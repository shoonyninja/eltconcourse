			<p>This guide is about finding things out for yourself.<br />
			It is part of the Teacher development section of the site but is 
			linked from numerous other areas and guides because, sooner or 
			later, most teachers start to become curious about what works best 
			for them and their students and what their learners feel about the 
			service they are receiving.<br />
			One can, naturally, read books about methodology and teaching 
			techniques, procedures and approaches or take a teacher training 
			course at an appropriate level and many of these resources will 
			focus on what someone else thinks constitutes best and most 
			efficient practice.<br />
			There is no harm in relying on the wisdom of others in this respect 
			and most of us will do so at many points in a teaching career.<br />
			However, by their nature, these resources will not apply 
			specifically to you, your learners or your and their aims so they will, at 
			best, be generic responses to questions such as:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I motivate 
			my learners?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What types of tasks appeal most and work best in the 
			classroom?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I ensure that my learners are getting what they need 
			as well as what they want?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I best prepare my learners to use the English they need 
			in their lives?</em></span><br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are my learners 
			unhappy?</em></span><br />
			and so on.</p>

			<p>This seems such an obvious question that it's hardly worth taking 
			the time to spell things out but it is surprising how often 
			otherwise good research projects end up being worthless because too 
			little thought is given at the outset to what the project is for 
			and, indeed, what type of project it is.<br />
			There are choices to be made and they fall into two main categories, 
			like this, with the right-hand column containing examples of the kinds 
			of questions to ask:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="questions" height="346" src="../training/imagesgraphics/classroom_research_qs.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>To explain a little:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Experiments</strong></dt>
				<dd>are designed to find out <em>What happens if ...</em> .&nbsp; 
				In other words, they are designed to examine causes and effects 
				and make some kind of measurement of outcomes.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Surveys</strong></dt>
				<dd>come in two sorts (hence the change of colour for the last 
				box in the diagram):<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>Descriptive surveys include the first four examples and 
					they are concerned with <em>what</em> not <em>why</em> or
					<em>how</em>.</li>
					<li>Analytic surveys relate to the last example and, while 
					they are also 
					concerned with <em>what</em>, they are simultaneously 
					focused on
					<em>why</em> and <em>how</em>.</li>

			<p>Whether you are setting out to conduct an experiment or a survey 
			of some kind, you need to follow a simple procedure.&nbsp; There is 
			nothing immensely time consuming or complicated about this but it is 
			as well to set it out clearly.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			<p><img alt="1" height="44" src="../gfx/step1.png" width="70" /><strong>Ask 
			the question</strong> (see above for some examples)<br />
			You need to make sure that the question is answerable in less than a 
			few decades so do not ask:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I teach 
			better?</em></span><br />
			but prefer something a little less ambitious such as:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I teach grammar 
			more interestingly?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do my learners feel about the correction techniques I 
			use?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which of two possible procedures will work best for this 
			target?</em></span><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p><img alt="2" height="44" src="../gfx/step2.png" width="70" /><strong>Hypothesise 
			an answer</strong> to the question<br />
			If you don't do this, then you will be stabbing in the dark.&nbsp; 
			For example, if you want to answer a question like:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will a 
			Test-Teach-Test approach appeal to this group of learners?</em></span><br />
			then your hypothesis will be either:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
			Test-Teach-Test approach will appeal to this group of learners</strong></span><br />
			or<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
			test-Teach-Test approach will not appeal to this group of learners.</strong></span><br />
			Then, when you gather results, you can see clearly which hypothesis 
			the results support.<br />
			Hypotheses must be <strong>testable</strong> statements.&nbsp; That 
			is to say, they must be <strong>disprovable</strong>.</p>
			<p><img alt="3" height="44" src="../gfx/step3.png" width="70" /><strong>The 
			experiment or the survey</strong><br />
			This is the heart of the project, of course, and needs to be very 
			carefully designed bearing Steps 1 and 2 in mind.&nbsp; More on this 
			below.</p>
			<p><img alt="4" height="44" src="../gfx/step4.png" width="70" /><strong>Observe 
			the outcomes</strong><br />
			For an experiment, this involves looking at the result.&nbsp; For a 
			survey, this involves assembling the data.<br />
			Many people find that assembling the data graphically is helpful 
			because it is often easier to see patterns in graphics (and making 
			the graphic often exposes them) than seeing patterns in columns of 
			figures.</p>
			<p><strong>
			<img alt="5" height="44" src="../gfx/step5.png" width="70" />Analysis 
			of outcomes</strong><br />
			If the experiment or survey has been well designed, this will be 
			easy.&nbsp; If it hasn't, it will be impossible because the data 
			will be dirty and the outcomes unclear.</p>
			<p><strong>
			<img alt="6" height="44" src="../gfx/step6.png" width="70" />Draw 
			conclusions</strong><br />
			Go back to step 2.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>Are the hypotheses supported or 
			refuted?</em></span><br />
			Take them one by one.</p>

			<p>You can see from the example questions above that experiments and

			<ol class="style_black">
				<li><em>Do I want to find out what happens if I change something in

				<li><em>Do I want to find out how well a new approach that I am

					<li>If you answered <em>yes</em> to question 2., you are

					<li>If you answered <em>yes </em>to question 3., you are

					<li>If you answered <em>yes</em> to questions 4., 5. and/or 
					6., then you are not interested in <em>why</em> or <em>how</em>: 
					you are interested in <em>what</em> so you are conducting a 
					descriptive survey.</li>
					<li>If you answered <em>yes</em> to question 7., you are

			<p>Let's say, for the sake of this example, that we are setting out 
			to discover why the vocabulary that we are teaching has not been 
			retained as well as it should be by the learners in a particular group.&nbsp; 
			We know this is the case because we run weekly progress tests which 
			include a test of the vocabulary to which the learners have been 
			exposed.<br />
			Results for the vocabulary part of the test have been consistently 
			disappointing.</p>
			<p>At the moment we do these things in terms of teaching vocabulary:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We encourage learners to keep a vocabulary notebook in which 
				they write a short sentence or clause to set the lexeme within some 
				co-text.</li>
				<li>We get the learners to translate the new words into their 
				L1.</li>
				<li>We always introduce new vocabulary in a written text so the 
				learners can see it in context.</li>
				<li>We run a topic-based syllabus so all the vocabulary for the 
				week is in the same general lexical field.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now we 
			want to try something new so we can introduce a new phase and, 
			for this experiment, we want to see if forcing the learners to use 
			all the new vocabulary from a day's lessons in a short piece of 
			written work will help to move the items from the short- to the 
			long-term memory.<br />
			We must be very careful to keep the four elements above constant 
			because we only want to see the results of a new procedure.<br />
			If we take out one of the things we already do or add in 
			something else, we will never 
			know whether removing that element or introducing a new one 
			has the effects (if any) that we observe.<br />
			So here are our six steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Ask</strong>:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is 
				vocabulary not being adequately learned?</em></span></li>
				<li><strong>Hypothesise</strong>:<br />
				<strong><span class="style_black">Vocabulary is not being 
				retained because we have failed to provide a task to incorporate 
				new lexis in a piece of written work</span></strong><span class="auto-style4">.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Experiment</strong>:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide such a task for each day's 
				lessons for a week.</li>
				<li><strong>Observe</strong>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we test the learners on this week's work, is there any 
				change in the results?</li>
				<li><strong>Analyse</strong>:<br />

				<p>We need to consider at least these factors:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Was the <strong>difficulty</strong> of the lexis introduced during the 
					experiment the same as in preceding weeks?<br />
					If it was easier or more difficult, then the results may 
					depend on the level of difficulty and have nothing to do 
					with the written task.</li>
					<li>Did we keep <strong>the four elements </strong>we started with, 
					add another or skip 
					one?<br />
					If we did, then we have two variables in play and we don't 
					know which was causal.&nbsp; If, for example, we departed 
					from our topic-based syllabus and introduced items from an 
					unconnected lexical field that might have made the items 
					more difficult to retain.&nbsp; Alternatively, it may have 
					made them easier because of the novelty aspect.</li>
					<li>Was the <strong>class</strong> the same?<br />
					If new learners have arrived and / or others left, then the 
					groups are not comparable.&nbsp; For the purposes of this 
					experiment, although we only have one group of learners, we 
					can visualise them as two groups: the group in the control 
					week (before the innovation) and the group in the 
					experimental week (after the innovation).</li>
					<li>Was <strong>the reading text</strong> in which we set the lexis of 
					comparable difficulty?<br />
					If it was more difficult, then new vocabulary in it will 
					have a more serious blocking effect.&nbsp; If it was easier, 
					the cognitive load on trying to understand the text as well 
					as noticing the new vocabulary is made somewhat smaller.</li>
					<li>Was the text equally <strong>interesting and engaging</strong> for the 
					learners?<br />
					The more motivating, relevant and engaging the text is, the more 
					likely learners are to focus on the vocabulary items in it 
					because they <em>want</em> to understand.&nbsp; On the other hand, if 
					a text is of little interest to the learners, they are 
					unlikely to engage with the content so assiduously.</li>
					<li>Were <strong>the vocabulary items</strong> equally useful (or perceived 
					as such by the learners) across the weeks?<br />
					One technical terms for this factor is the learners' 
					perception of the <strong>affordances</strong> that the 
					lexis presents.<br />
				Affordances are the uses to which we feel something can be put.&nbsp; 
				For example, you may see a door handle as a tool for opening a 
				door but you may also see it as a place to hang your jacket.&nbsp; 
				Both purposes are affordances offered by the door handle.<br />
					If the learners had perceived that the items encountered 
					during this experiment were more or less useful than usual, 
					that may have affected how motivated they were to acquire 
					them.</li>
					<li>Were the vocabulary items of the same <strong>word 
					classes</strong>?<br />
					Some people find learning nouns to which they can attach 
					mental pictures easier than learning items in other word 
					classes and some find verbs very challenging to learn 
					because there are grammatical elements, such as transitivity 
					and adverbial use, to bear in mind.<br />
					Collocation is also an issue.</li>
					<li>Was <strong>the test</strong> we administered of the same kind, conducted 
					at the same time of day in the same circumstances and at the 
					same level of difficulty?<br />
					Was it marked in the same way?<br />
					If it wasn't, then its reliability is compromised.&nbsp; In 
					that case, because it is the only measure of outcomes, the 
					whole experiment is compromised.</li>
					<li>Was the <strong>teaching and learning load</strong> comparable?<br />
					If the week in which we conducted the experiment was not 
					typical of all weeks on a course, it may be that learner 
					tiredness (or freshness) played a part and we may also find 
					that the teachers' commitment and energy levels may have had 
					some effect.&nbsp; Unless we have a way of measuring or at 
					least estimating these 
					factors, we just don't know.</li>
					<li>Was the <strong>novelty</strong> of being asked to write a piece of text 
					incorporating the items a factor?<br />
					If learners have never been asked to do this before, the 
					mere fact they are asked may result in heightened levels of 
					motivation and effort because they may feel that this has 
					quite suddenly become a critical factor in their learning 
					and assessment.<br />
					This effect may be exactly what we have aimed for and has 
					resulted in better retention but we know that novelty soon 
					wears off so we need to monitor whether the effect has been 
					sustained.</li>

			<p>The Latin above is often referred to as the <em><strong>post-hoc

			conclusion that the relationship is causal.<br />
			It has often been noted that it rains more frequently at the weekend 
			than during the working week.&nbsp; That does not mean that the 
			names we give to days of the week affect the weather directly.<br />
			We shall meet this fallacy again when we look at the attempt to 
			carry out analytical surveys.</p>
			<p>We may, through this little experiment, have discovered that 
			setting a piece of written work has been associated with better 
			retention of vocabulary items but we cannot be absolutely sure that 
			we have discovered causality because association is not evidence in 
			itself of causality.&nbsp; It may be the case, for example, that
			<strong><span class="style_underline">any</span></strong> new task 
			would have had the same effect and it was the novelty value that 
			caused the increase in commitment to learning.<br />
			There are ten factors above (and you may have thought of more) that 
			may have intervened to muddy the results of this experiment so we 
			should be careful not to jump to conclusions.<br />
			It has been pointed out (see https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/PiratesVsTemp%28en%29.svg

			the number of pirates preying on the world's merchant shipping and

			<p>We may, if we have been careful to exclude all the complicating

			useful about this group of learners.&nbsp; It may be tempting to 
			make a leap and suggest that instituting a task which forces 
			learners to embed newly encountered lexis in self-produced written texts 
			will generally result in better vocabulary retention for all 
			learners everywhere.<br />
			Such a leap would be unfounded and perilous because we cannot make a 
			generalisation of this sort without a great deal more evidence.<br />
			We can, and often do, make assumptions about small groups based on 
			what we know about many groups in general but to work the other way 
			and generalise about large numbers from small numbers is not a 
			defensible procedure.<br />
			Were it, for example, to be found that the same results were 
			obtained from five other groups in the same institution, we may be 
			justified in suggesting (not claiming) that the task has a 
			beneficial influence on vocabulary retention for the kinds of

			<p>As you can see, a scaled matrix item like this one needs to be 
			designed very carefully if it is going to be helpful and it needs to 
			be administered with a good deal of care.<br />
			We could, providing we have the data from the vocabulary tests we 
			administer weekly, then compare the responses to this survey with 
			the results from the tests and try to match what people do with how 
			well they retain the lexis.&nbsp; We still will not have proven any 
			kind of causality, of course, because it may be the case that people 
			are doing things which are not very effective but, because they have 
			good memories, still managing to retain the lexemes well.<br />
			More probably, we would use a survey like this to establish what 
			people currently do as the basis for introducing some 
			learner-training sessions to extend their repertoire in an effort to 
			help them learn.<br />
			There are ways to overcome the disadvantages.</p>

			<p>It often requires a good deal of insight into one's own mental 
			processes to answer questions about what helps you learn.&nbsp; Not 
			all learners have the skills to do that and, if some in the group 
			do and others don't, there is going to be a mismatch of data types: 
			the informed <em>vs</em>. the stab-in-the-dark answer.<br />
			This issue is to do with insight and it can be represented like 
			this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="johari" height="251" src="../training/imagesgraphics/johari310.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This sort of diagram was developed by Joseph Luft and Harrington 
			Ingham to investigate how people see themselves and how others see 
			them.&nbsp; The name of the technique is a Johari window (derived 
			from the authors' first names).<br />
			The contention is that we all have these four 'rooms' in our minds 
			which relate to how we want to be seen, how we really are, how 
			others see us (and we don't) and the subconscious ideas about 
			ourselves which we are not able to articulate.<br />
			The four central areas are described by the 'Things ...' sentences 
			around them.<br />
		For example, the <strong>Facade</strong> is the area of things that I know about myself 
		but keep hidden from others.&nbsp; The <strong>Blind Spot</strong> refers to things that 
		others see in me which I know nothing about.&nbsp; <strong>Insight</strong> is our 
		ability to draw on our unconscious understanding to realise something 
		about ourselves.<br />
		Originally, the technique was used for people to select 6 adjectives 
			(from a list of 50 or so) to 
		describe themselves and then their peers were asked to select 6 which 
		described the subject.&nbsp; Putting these adjectives into the grid, it 
		is claimed, helps people to see themselves as others see them and be 
		better able to use insight and introspection.&nbsp; We may choose 
			adjectives which we feel we want others to ascribe to us but the list may be very different from the list that others who know us 
			would ascribe to us.&nbsp; That's the difference between the Facade 
			and the Blind spot.<br />
		For our purposes here it stands as a reminder that however carefully a 
		questionnaire or interview process is designed, it ultimately depends on 
		people knowing about themselves and, as the window demonstrates, few of 
		us really do.<br />
			Asking a learner, therefore, to be insightful about something as 
			complex as how they learn may be doomed from the outset because few 
			of us can answer that question very accurately if at all.</p>
			<p>Circumventing the issue is not easy but we can make inroads by 
			discussing with our learners what they think before asking them to 
			complete a questionnaire in the effort to bring some at least of our 
			unconscious feelings into the conscious spheres.</p>

			Only item 3 will give you some usable data because it really is an

			<p>Overcoming this problem is straightforward and it involves using

			We should, of course, not take this too far and have an

			accurately something that they have probably not been actively 
			measuring.</p>
			<p>Gradable adjectives are another obvious stumbling block in this 
			kind of matrix grid questionnaire because everyone's definition of a
			<em>short</em> <em>text</em>, a <em>difficult grammar item</em>, a
			<em>useful word</em> or an <em>important lesson</em> will be 
			different.<br />
			Asking learners to grade questions which themselves contain gradable 
			concepts will not provide very useful (or usable) data so it is 
			better to avoid terms such as<em> difficult </em>altogether and to 
			define terms such as <em>short</em> carefully.<br />
			We can, of course always get the learners to grade the responses in 
			something like:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5" style="width: 651px">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style8" colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>

			<p>which is one way forward but even then people's definitions will vary

			difficult</em> for another who is at a lower level or wants to be challenged less.&nbsp; We 
			will not know from the results of this question which is which and we

			<p>An added complication for us is that we are dealing with people 
			whose first language is probably not the language in which we are 
			writing the survey items.<br />
			In some situations, this is avoidable because all the subjects of a 
			survey or experiment have the same first language and in that case, 
			naturally, we can write the items in the respondents' first language 
			and avoid any terrible misunderstanding.&nbsp; That's not 100% a 
			given because people are adept at misinterpreting questions and 
			statements regardless of the language in which they are written.<br />
			We can get around this but it is a time-consuming business and 
			involves the use of face-to-face interviews to explain the content 
			of the survey and elicit the result that is fair to the views of the 
			respondents.<br />
			Face-to-face interviews are open to bias and we should be careful to 
			avoid that by duplicating the written survey as much as possible so 
			we are not asking open-ended, uninterpretable questions but 
			eliciting the same evidence that a written survey is intended to 
			discover.<br />
			If our target respondent group is quite small, such an undertaking 
			is perfectly possible and bias can be further reduced (or, at least, 
			evened out) if only one person does the interviewing.<br />
			It is as well to break down the questions and the possible responses 
			like this:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How often do 
					you spend time reading through the notes you take in class?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you do this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than once a week? (pause for an 
			answer)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once or twice a week? (pause for an

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three to five times a week? (pause

			an answer)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than ten times a week? (pause 
			for an answer)</em></span><br />
			Even when we think we have the answer right, it's as well to double 
			check with something like:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you spend time 
			reading through the notes you take in class between 3 and 5 times a 
			week.&nbsp; Is that correct?</em></span></p>

			<p>On the face of things, this is quite a good set of items because 
			care has been taken to ensure that the options apply to the types of 
			statement so there are three sets of them.<br />
			However, when it comes to analysing the results how are we going to 
			score the responses?<br />
			If we give all the left-hand responses a score of 0 and all the 
			right-hand responses a score of 5 then the analysis will be made 
			more difficult because a high score for items 1 and 2 will mean that 
			the classwork and materials are too difficult but a high score for 
			items 3 to 6 will mean that the learners feel very positive about 
			the texts, topics, grouping and homework tasks.<br />
			To make matters worse, most teachers will be happy if learners score 
			the first two items around 2 and 3 because that means that most find 
			the difficulty level challenging but not overly so.&nbsp; Lots of 
			scores around zero or 5 will mean that the work and the materials 
			are at the wrong level.</p>
			<p>The moral of the story is to look at a survey questionnaire very

			of 4 and 5.<br />

			</table>
			<p>Up to now, we have been dealing with gathering quantitative data 
			in a survey and that is how things are normally arranged because we 
			can analyse the outcomes mathematically as we saw above by assigning 
			numbers to the various responses we invite people to give to 
			statements or questions.<br />
			Occasionally, however, we want to gather qualitative data from a 
			survey and for that we ask open questions rather than asking people 
			to scale their answers or provide <em>Yes-No-Maybe </em>responses.<br />
			The obvious problem with attempting to elicit qualitative data is 
			analysing the results.&nbsp; For example, let's say we have asked, 
			either <em>via</em> a questionnaire or in an open-class discussion, 
			something like:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>What should be the focus of 
				the next two weeks of the course?</em></span><br />
				or</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>How do you prefer to work in class?</em></span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>and we have noted the following responses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>What should be the focus of 
				the next two weeks of the course?</em></span><ol class="auto-style18">
					<li><em>More vocabulary</em></li>
					<li><em>More speaking and listening practice</em></li>
					<li><em>Revise the grammar</em></li>
					<li><em>Play more games</em></li>
					<li><em>Do a pr<span class="auto-style4">oject</span></em></li>
					<li><em>No more tests, please</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>How do you prefer to work in class?</em></span><ol class="auto-style18">
					<li><em>More slowly</em></li>
					<li><em>With a group of other students</em></li>
					<li><em>Alone</em></li>
					<li><em>By reading texts</em></li>
					<li><em>With the whole class</em></li>
					<li><em>In pairs</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is almost impossible to categorise the responses in any 
			sensible manner because they are so disparate.&nbsp; Some answers to 
			the first question refer to course content, some to procedures, some 
			to grammar and so on.&nbsp; The answers to the second question vary 
			in type, too, with some referring to grouping, some to speed and 
			some to materials.&nbsp; To make matters worse, we don't know what
			<em>prefer </em>really means because it could imply that the 
			respondent felt it was effective or felt it was enjoyable (or both).<br />
			Deriving sensible data from this sort of list of answers is, it 
			appears, a forlorn hope.<br />
			However, all is not lost because we do not have to stop there and we can use qualitative data to form 
			the basis of a quantitative analysis survey by taking all the 
			answers we have elicited and inserting them into a scalar survey, 
			like this:</p>

			<p>Unlike descriptive surveys, analytic surveys are intended to

			</table>
			<p>If we are looking for a causal relationship, we can only discover 
			it by observing changes.&nbsp; In this sense, analytic surveys are 
			akin to experiments because we want to find out people's current 
			views, then make changes and re-survey them to see what effect the 
			changes had.&nbsp; Because we are concerned here to measure 
			motivation and engagement alone, that has to be the focus or we will 
			get lost in the data.</p>
			<p>There are two ways to set a base line in principle:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We can select two identical groups of learners who have had 
				teaching which is different in terms of the variable (the lesson 
				procedures) which we are interested in investigating.<br />
				One group will be the control group and one the experimental 
				group.&nbsp; The control group will (or should) tell us what 
				would have happened if no changes at all had been made.</li>
				<li>We can use the same group and conduct a longitudinal survey 
				by gathering base-line data from them, then varying the teaching 
				procedures and re-surveying them to discover what changes, if 
				any, are evident.<br />
				In this way the group becomes its own control group (before and 
				after the experiment in lesson procedures).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are problems with both ways.</p>

				<li>It is almost impossible except in the largest institutions 
				to identify two groups of learners who are even superficially 
				similar let alone identical.&nbsp; This means that the data we 
				gather from each group may be influenced by a range of 
				variable factors outside our control.&nbsp; Worse, we may not 
				even know what the differences are.<br />
				We can, in large institutions, carry out a preliminary survey to 
				identify all the possible variables and then select two groups 
				who are most similar in nature.&nbsp; They will be 
				similar groups but it is vain to hope that they are identical.<br />
				There are also ethical issues because, if our hypothesis is that 
				variations in lesson procedures will enhance motivation and 
				engagement, we are denying one group the advantages of this 
				proposal in order to use them as a guinea-pig group.<br />
				Differences will include at least:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>Level</li>
					<li>Ages</li>
					<li>Interests</li>
					<li>Preferred learning styles</li>
					<li>Previous learning experiences</li>
					<li>Sexes</li>
					<li>Teacher approaches</li>
					<li>Needs for English</li>
					<li>Aptitude</li>
					<li>Motivation: level and type</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>When we conduct a longitudinal survey, factors may intervene 
				between survey one and survey two which will muddy the waters.&nbsp; 
				The longer the time gap is, the more severe the disturbance to 
				the data may be.<br />
				A focus on motivation is particularly difficulty in this respect 
				because we know (from other people's surveys, incidentally) that 
				motivation levels can vary for reasons external to any changes 
				we may make.&nbsp; We can hope that the factors across the group 
				may cancel each other out but that is a hope, not a certainty.<br />
				The learners' overall measurable level of motivation may vary at least because:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>There are changes to a learner's professional life.&nbsp; 
					For example, there may be an enhanced or lowered need for 
					English-language skills which will affect motivation.</li>
					<li>There are changes to a learner's personal life which 
					present other priorities or relieve any pressure and that 
					may, respectively, result in lower or higher commitment.</li>
					<li>Events may come closer or recede which will affect the 
					urgency with which the learners feel they need to acquire 
					English.</li>
					<li>Learners may decide to take a different approach to 
					learning because they realise that what they currently do is 
					not being effective or could be more effective.</li>
					<li>The group's members may change and more (or less) 
					motivated learners may leave the group altogether.&nbsp; The 
					longer there is between survey one and survey two, the more 
					likely this is to happen and the loss of data may be serious 
					if not terminal.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Whichever approach we take, we have to try to minimise the 
			effects of these issues but we need to maintain the awareness that 
			we cannot hope to remove them altogether.</p>
			<p>There are also advantages with both procedures:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Choosing identical (or nearly so) groups means that we can 
				tightly control what happens because we can conduct the survey 
				quite quickly and elicit responses from both groups 
				simultaneously.&nbsp; This cuts down on the opportunity for 
				extraneous events to affect our results.<br />
				We have an identifiable control group which means that we can be 
				reasonably certain that any changes between it and the 
				experimental group are caused by the factor which we are 
				altering (lesson procedures in this case).</li>
				<li>Using the same group for both surveys should mean that it is 
				acting as its own control group because, if the members of the 
				group are not changed or affected by other factors, we have 
				arrived at the all-things-being-equal state that we seek in all 
				data.<br />
				It is also, in most situations, the only practical procedure.</li>

			</table>
			<p>In theory, the analysis of results from a process like this is 
			comparatively simple because we are not looking for absolute 
			numbers, just trying to identify differences and be able to say 
			whether they represent improvement or not.<br />
			All we need to do, therefore, is tot up the scores from all the 
			surveys and see how they differ (if they do).<br />
			This is not the place for a course in statistical analysis so we 
			have to rely on some less than perfect mathematical reasoning.&nbsp; 
			If, for example, we find that Survey 2 showed and increase overall 
			of 10% over Survey 1, how significant is that?<br />
			The answer depends on how many people were involved and on the 
			difference in real numbers.</p>
			<p>If we had twenty learners in a group and 8 questions, the maximum 
			we could have recorded is 48 X 20 = 960 and the minimum is 8 X 20 = 
			160.&nbsp; The difference is 800.<br />
			If the total for Survey 1 was 400 and that for Survey 2 was 440, we 
			have a 10% increase but, with 20 learners a total score of 40 can be 
			obtained if 2 learners record 6 instead of 1 for all 8 items.&nbsp; 
			The rest of the learners may have returned exactly the same score on 
			all the items in both surveys and, therefore, only 2 out of 20 
			learners (10% of the group) have been positively affected by the changes we made.&nbsp; 
			The two learners in question have been significantly affected but 
			the other 18 are not affected at all.<br />
			By the same token, the figure of 10% could be reached if all 20 
			learners recorded just an extra 2 points each spread over the 8 
			items in the survey.&nbsp; That would mean that some improvement is 
			recognisable but it is slight and probably not significant because, 
			on average, it represents only 0.25 extra points per item.<br />
			We have, therefore, to break down the results to reveal what has 
			changed not just by how much it has changed.<br />
			For example, if that analysis reveals:<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr>

			then we are safe in suggesting that the changes have brought about a 
			greater liking for the lesson approaches but that the effort 
			learners are putting in is only slightly greater and probably 
			insignificant (it could be achieved if two learners selected 6 
			instead of 1 on that question or five of the twenty selected 4 
			instead of 2).<br />
			We should be careful not to exaggerate the effects and with small 
			groups in particular not to underestimate the disproportionate 
			effect a few learners can have on the overall results.<br />
			In our example case, a quarter of the learners moving just 2 points 
			up or down the scale can make a difference of 20% in the score for a 
			single item.</p>

			<p>The first thing to be clear about is that we can only draw

			We have no evidence at all that the results would be the same for 
			different groups in different settings.</p>
			<p>However, if we have been careful to control the variables 
			sufficiently, we can draw some reasonable conclusions not only about
			<strong>what</strong> people felt but also about <strong>why</strong> 
			their opinions differed (because we only changed one variable in the 
			survey: the nature of lesson procedures).<br />
			That's quite a good outcome and should encourage us to develop the 
			process for other groups to see if we can improve their engagement 
			and motivation, too.</p>

		<h2>A case study</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Finally, we'll take a real case study and see how a teacher can 
			research her own classroom and discover not only what is going wrong 
			but why.<br />
			The starting point for this little piece of research is:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>When I conduct a 
			Presentation-Practice-Production lesson, I frequently do not have 
			time to do the third stage thoroughly and neither the learners nor I 
			can judge how successfully the targets have been learned.<br />
			When I use a Test-Teach-Test procedure, I frequently have to cut the 
			final stage short and rarely have time to do any kind of recap and 
			summary in which the learners can judge their progress.<br />
			In both cases, I know I have a timing problem but I am not sure what 
			causes it.</strong></p>
			<p>This is clearly an important issue because the failure to 
			include a stage in which the teacher and her learners can assess 
			progress means that learning has not been shown so it is possible 
			that the course is moving on and leaving gaps in the learners' 
			knowledge which will later negatively affect the teaching-learning 
			process.<br />
			It also has the effect of potentially reducing the learners' 
			commitment and motivation because they are rarely able to perceive 
			progress.</p>
			<p>To investigate this area, the teacher has decided to follow a 
			six-step process and combine both a mini-survey and an experiment.&nbsp; 
			The survey will be different and quite subjective for her but the experiment will target what 
			she hypothesises may be the root of the problem.</p>
			<p>Here's how the process panned out:</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="questions" height="133" src="../training/images/questions_graphic200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Step #1: the questions</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The teacher starts from this simple question:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>What is causing the timing issue?</strong></p>
			<p>The question is deceptively simple, as we shall shortly see.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="hypotheses" height="133" src="../training/images/desktop_graphic200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Step #2: the hypotheses</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This teacher had three:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The problem stems from trying to target too much so the 
				presentation and practice stages (or the initial testing and 
				teaching stages) are taking up too much time and unbalancing my 
				lessons.</li>
				<li>The problem stems from the fact that I am talking too much 
				and giving unnecessarily long explanations as well as having to 
				repair activities as I go along because I have not been clear 
				the first time.&nbsp; This has the effect of slowing the pace of 
				the lesson and wasting time.</li>
				<li>The problem stems from a combination of factors 1. and 2.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="experiment" height="133" src="../training/images/experiment_graphic200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Step #3: the experiment and the survey</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Here's the thinking:</p>
			<p>I know that I have three hypotheses but if I try to tackle all 
			three at once by changing what I do in two ways, I will never know 
			which change affected the results.&nbsp; In other words, I will be 
			no better off because I still won't know the source of the problem.&nbsp; 
			That is a multi-variation issue.<br />
			So, I will take hypotheses 1. and 2. in turn to see what effect this 
			has on my lessons.<br />
			I am anticipating three possible outcomes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Planning for less will mean I can cut down on the 
				Presentation and Practice stages (or the initial Testing and 
				Teaching stages) and that will allow more time for checking 
				learning.<br />
				Alternatively, this will have no discernible effect at all.</li>
				<li>Planning and monitoring my own explanations, talking time 
				and instructions to make them more precise and economical will 
				save time in the lessons and allow more time for later stages.<br />
				Alternatively, this will have no discernible effect at all.</li>
				<li>Both actions 1. and 2. will have a positive effect (this is 
				multi-causality) and need to be taken forward in tandem.<br />
				Alternatively, neither action will have a discernible effect.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is how I am going to run the research:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A will look carefully at what I have planned for two lessons 
				and re-plan the lessons to cover 50% more time.&nbsp; That means 
				that the targets will be stretched over three lessons instead of 
				two.<br />
				When I do this, I will also re-plan the presentation and 
				practice stages (or the initial Testing and Teaching phases) to 
				take account of the reduced targets and shorten the stages where 
				possible.</li>
				<li>Next, I will look thorough the procedure of my lesson and 
				write out only what I have to say and have to explain to keep 
				the lesson on track.&nbsp; I will do this for three lessons that 
				I have already planned and delivered in the past so I know 
				nothing else will be changed.<br />
				I will write my explanations and instructions down and memorise 
				them.&nbsp; During the lesson, I will focus on what I am saying 
				and monitor my own talk cutting it down as far as possible 
				without losing effectiveness.</li>
				<li>Finally, I will run a series of three lesson in which I both 
				cut down on the targets <strong>and</strong> economise on my 
				talking time.</li>

			<p>After each stage, I intend to do the following to see what the

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Although there's more to be done, I concluded the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The greatest effect on increasing the amount of time for 
				final stages of the lesson was clearly the action of reducing 
				the targets to give more balance between stages.<br />
				My own view was that learning appeared successful whenever I 
				devoted more time to the final stage.</li>
				<li>Teacher talk changes had a much smaller effect.&nbsp; The 
				time allocated for the final stage of the lessons barely 
				increased at all.&nbsp; I conclude that my timing problems do 
				not stem primarily from the way I explain and give instructions.</li>
				<li>When I reduced the targets of the lessons, learners overall 
				seemed content that the challenge level was about right and it 
				is significant that their response to Statement 2 (having time 
				to use the language personally) scored the highest.&nbsp; That's 
				an encouraging sign.</li>
				<li>Varying my teacher talk, on the other hand, had only a small 
				effect as far as we can judge (because we do not have figures 
				from previous lessons).&nbsp; Furthermore, a figure of less than 
				3 for the average of all responses to the whether the learners 
				understood the explanations clearly signals a problem.&nbsp; It 
				may be the case that I cut the explanations too severely so I 
				will return to my old ways and then ask the learners to fill in 
				another form to see if I can get the average response up for 
				this crucial item.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Going forward, I will maintain the practice of making sure that I 
			limit the aims of the lessons I deliver so that the explanation and 
			practice phases do not take up a disproportionate amount of time.</p>
