					<p>You may think that praise is a form of feedback, and 
					you'd be right but it's a peculiar form of feedback because 
					it often goes nowhere.&nbsp; Consider these four classroom 
					interactions:</p>
					<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1" class="auto-style6">
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style9" style="width: 246px"><em>T: 
							What did you do last night?<br />

							<td class="auto-style8" style="width: 246px"><em>T:

							excellent.</em></td>
						</tr>

							went?<br />
							S: Oh, I went.<br />
							T: Fine.&nbsp; What did you think?</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style8" style="width: 246px"><em>T:

						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>On the left we have praise <span class="style_underline">
					and</span> feedback.&nbsp; On the right, it's just praise 
					with almost no feedback.&nbsp; If you were the student, 
					which would you respond to more positively?<br />
					Right.&nbsp; Above and beyond praise (which is always nice) 
					we need to feel that the teacher is listening to what we 
					say, as well as how we say it.</p>
					<p>Overusing praise cheapens the coinage.&nbsp; If 
					everything is "Great", what do you say when it really is 
					exceptional?</p>
					<p>Underusing praise demotivates and confuses.&nbsp; If 
					every answer is greeted with "OK" how do I know if it's 
					right or wrong, good, passable or excellent?</p>
					<p>There is some anecdotal and research evidence to suggest 
					that learners appreciate feedback more than they appreciate 
					praise.&nbsp; A lot of the research that has been done is 
					based on 'ordinary' schools, often elementary ones, rather 
					than in language-teaching environments but it's interesting 
					nonetheless.&nbsp; Here's a quick summary of some tidbits of 
					research:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Teachers' and students' perceptions of the purpose 
						of praise differ.&nbsp;(Morine-Dershimer, 
						1982)</li>
						<li>"<span class="style_black">Praise is positive reinforcement that contains 
						positive affect and is a more intense response to 
						student behavior than general feedback</span>" (Thomas (1991) 
						and Blote (1995) in Reigel, 2008)</li>
						<li>"<span class="style_black">even in a classroom, where a teacher praises once 
						every five minutes, the rate of praise for the average 
						student would be ... once every two hours</span>" (Brophy 
						(1981:10) also in Reigel, 2008)</li>
						<li>"<span class="style_black">students may value explicit feedback relating 
						directly to a given response (Ellis, 2008) and it is 
						possible that this ‘general’ praise lacks the 
						specificity that is valued by students.</span>" (Levy, 2014)</li>
						<li>"<span class="style_black">Scrivener has recently 
						questioned what he describes as empty praise’ or 
						‘overpraising’ and has suggested that continual praise, 
						as opposed to feedback, actually hinders the learning 
						process (Scrivener, 2012)</span>" (Levy, op cit.).</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>A classroom research suggestion</h3>
					<p>Given that there really isn't very much ELT-specific 
					research concerning the effects of praise, why not do some 
					of your own?&nbsp; ELT Concourse might be interested in 
					publishing your results here.</p>
					<p>This is a six-phase suggestion based on the work of Levy (op 
					cit.).</p>
					<h4>Phase 1: Reflection and estimation</h4>
					<p>Make a list of the praise words you use most often in 
					class and guess how often you use them.&nbsp; Here are some 
					suggestions:</p>
					<p ><em><span class="style_black">good, very good, 
					yep/yes/yeah, well done, perfect, exactly, fine, great, 
					excellent</span></em> etc.<br />
					Add your own favourites to the list and omit the ones you 
					never use.</p>
					<h4>Phase 2: The reality</h4>
					<p>Now record one or two lessons and, when you listen to / 
					watch it, record how often you actually used the praise 
					words.&nbsp; Set the results out in a table and compare how 
					often you really used them with how often you thought you 
					used them.</p>
					<p>Then listen to the lesson again and record when you used 
					the words and what was happening at the time.&nbsp; This may 
					take a bit of time but you will end up with a graph 
					something like this:</p>
					<p>
					<img alt="prasie word chart" height="233" src="../developmentimages/praisechart.png" width="350" /></p>
					<p>From that, you can easily see which words you are 
					overusing and which you hardly ever use.</p>
					<h4>Phase 3: Praise, feedback or both?</h4>
					<p>Now listen again to see how often you combined praise 
					with solid feedback and record the results.&nbsp; You'll end 
					up with a list of words with the percentage of the time they 
					were used with feedback so you can see whether you are just 
					praising or praising and giving feedback on form
					<span class="style_underline">and</span> content.</p>
					<h4>Phase 4: Learner response</h4>
					<p>This is a bit more subjective, but none the worse for 
					that.<br />
					Now try to see if you can recall the learners' reactions to 
					your praise and/or feedback.<br />
					Did the praise just wash over them or were they more engaged 
					by it?<br />
					Did they take the feedback on board and amend their language 
					independently?</p>
					<h4>Phase 5: Evaluating outcomes</h4>
					<p>Here's where you sit and think.&nbsp; What conclusions do 
					you draw?&nbsp; Can you answer these questions?</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Do you overuse extreme praise words such as <em>
						Wonderful</em>?</li>
						<li>Do you underuse praise?</li>
						<li class="auto-style10">Do you give feedback without 
						praise too much?</li>
						<li class="auto-style10">Do you give praise without 
						feedback too much?</li>
						<li>Could you combine praise with feedback more often?</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Phase 6: Amending your behaviour</h4>
					<p>From the results of all the above, you should be able to 
					set out an action plan for how to change your classroom 
					routines and be more sure that you are giving feedback 
					appropriately, not using praise so much that you cheapen the 
					coinage and your learners begin to ignore it and not using 
					it too little so that the learners don't believe you are 
					valuing their efforts.</p>
					<p>When you have done that, try recording another lesson or 
					two and running the same analysis.</p>
					<p>Here's how the whole thing might look:</p>

		<h2>Gauging progress</h2>
		<p>There's a separate guide in this section of the site to
		<a href="../gaugingprogress.html">gauging and measuring progress in your 
		development</a>.&nbsp; Go there for more ideas.<br />
		In terms of responding to learners' contributions, you may not 
		always be the best judge so, if you can, get someone to observe how you react 
		to contributions and ideas and discuss whether your reaction was the right one.<br />
		If it wasn't, try to think together about what would have been the right 
		response.</p>
