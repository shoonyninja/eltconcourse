		<h1>Strand 3: <span class="auto-style3">Teaching tenses and focusing on

			<p>
			<img alt="clock" height="207" src="../../training/images/clock_waiting310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
				<p>Yes, conceptually, tenses are sometimes 
				the most difficult area of the grammar of any foreign language.&nbsp; 
				How we conceptualise and divide time varies from language to 
				language and, if some authorities are to be believed, how our 
				first language organises time fundamentally affects how we can 
				think about it.<br />
				That's the bad news.</p>
				<p>The good news is that <strong>all</strong> 
				human language have ways to talk about the past, the present and 
				the future.&nbsp; How they do it will differ, but they all do it 
				somehow.</p>
				<p>There are guides to all tenses linked from
				<a href="../../training/initial/initial_plus_index.html" class="highlightlink">the initial 
				plus training index</a>.&nbsp; What's there will not be repeated 
				here but the following assumes <strong>you</strong> are familiar with the forms, functions 
				and concepts of the tenses in English.&nbsp; Examples will be 
				used on that basis.</p>
			<p>If what has been said about all human languages is true, there should be no problem with tying a tense to a 
		time.&nbsp; So what <strong>are</strong> the problems?</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				<td class="auto-style16">
		<h2>Problem 1: 
		form and function</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Tense forms may look as if they refer to a particular time but the 
		function of the tense may actually refer to a different time.&nbsp; Here 
		are six common ones:</p>
		<table class="auto-style12">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style20"><em>I am playing football tomorrow</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style21">:</td>
				<td class="auto-style20">The use of the present progressive to refer to 
				a present plan for a future event</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td style="height: 21px" class="auto-style20"><em>If you asked me I would marry you</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style21" style="height: 21px">:</td>
				<td style="height: 21px" class="auto-style20">The past simple to refer to a possible (if unlikely) future</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style20"><em>I was wondering if I could talk to you</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style21">:</td>
				<td class="auto-style20">The past progressive used to maintain politeness</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style20"><em>Shall we order?</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style21">:</td>
				<td class="auto-style20">Future simple used to make a current suggestion about now</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style20"><em>The train arrives in five minutes</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style21">:</td>
				<td class="auto-style20">Present simple to talk about the future</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style20"><em>I'm about to lose my temper</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style21">:</td>
				<td class="auto-style20">Present simple to talk about the future</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br />
		Many languages use a tense form which is ostensibly about one sort of 
		time to talk 
		about another.&nbsp; English is not exceptional in this sense but the 
		way we label the tenses is potentially confusing.&nbsp; It is not 
		unreasonable to assume that something called <em>the present simple</em> 
		is used to talk about the present.<h3>
			Two possible solutions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><strong><em>Concept checking</em></strong><br />
			We need to be continuously alert to the potential for our learners 
			to have the concept wrong in their heads.&nbsp; This is often a 
			covert error because many mechanical tense exercises can be 
			completed without any idea of the function of the language.<br />
			For example, in this dialogue:<br />
			<em>Anne: Shall we ask John?<br />
			Barry: There's no point.&nbsp; He's leaving for the States.</em><br />
			it would be easy for a learner to assume that Anne is talking about 
			the future when she is actually making a suggestion about what to do 
			now and that Barry is talking about now when he's actually talking 
			about the future.&nbsp; The only way to be sure that there's no 
			covert receptive error is to check with the learner asking questions 
			such as:<br />
			<em>Is John on his way to the States now?<br />
			Is Anne making a suggestion or asking about the future?<br />
			etc.<br />
			</em>(Good concept checking should be done with 
			individuals, not the whole class.&nbsp; If you ask general 
			concept-check questions, you get people just going along with the 
			majority when, in fact they may not have got the concept right at 
			all.)</li>
			<li><em><strong>Context setting</strong></em><br />
			If you set a mechanical exercise such as this:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><span class="smallfont">Put the verb in 
			the right form with <em>going to + infinitive </em>or the present 
			continuous:<br />
			Look at the weather it (rain) ___________ .</span><br />
			</span>Then a student could be forgiven for choosing <em>it's 
			raining</em> because the sentence could easily be about now.&nbsp; 
			In this case, the learner hasn't got the distinction between the two 
			forms wrong, he or she has got the whole concept that we are talking 
			about the future wrong because there's no context for the language.<br />
			Getting around this is easy but requires planning and thought.&nbsp; 
			In this case, a simple visual of dark black clouds but
			<span class="style_underline">no rain</span> would suffice.</li>
		</ol>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				<img alt="worry" height="166" src="../../training/images/man_worry250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style16">
		<h2>
		Problem 2: Aspect</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
		If you don't speak many languages, you may be forgiven for assuming that 
		aspects are roughly equivalent across languages.&nbsp; You'd be wrong.&nbsp; 
		There's <a href="../../training/inservice/verbs/aspect.html">more 
		on aspect on this site</a> but learners are often misleadingly told 
		something like this:</p>
		<p>
		<a name="1"></a>Apart from the simple forms of tenses, English has two 
		main aspects which are detectable by looking at the verb forms:</p>
		<table class="auto-style19">
			<tr>
				<td><em>Progressive aspect</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style13">:</td>
				<td>To show that an action or event is ongoing.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><em>Perfect aspect</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style13">:</td>
				<td>To show that and action of event is incomplete</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>
		There's much more to it than this.&nbsp; If that's all we are alert to, 
		our students may be forgiven for getting the concepts wrong.&nbsp; Refer 
		to the guide for all the other possible aspects but note now what you 
		think may be the problems here.<br />
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'list1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have a note</a>.</p>
		<ol class="style_brown" id="list1" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
			<li>English actually exhibits <strong>both</strong> continuous and 
			progressive aspects.<br />
			Some languages make a formal (i.e., visible in the form) distinction between the two aspects 
			so learners with those language backgrounds may have trouble 
			unravelling what English is doing.:<ol class="auto-style15">
				<li>The progressive aspect refers to ongoing events and actions.&nbsp; 
				We often use the <em>-ing</em> form to do that, e.g., <em>He's 
				playing well</em>, but we can also use the simple verb form to 
				do the same thing, e.g., <em>He plays the ball powerfully to the 
				boundary</em> or <em>He works in the city</em>.</li>
				<li>The continuous aspect refers to ongoing states.&nbsp; We can 
				use the <em>-ing</em> form to do this, e.g.,<em> I've been feeling 
				unwell for some time</em>.&nbsp; We can also use the simple form of 
				the verb to suggest the same sort of thing, e.g., <em>He appears 
				unwell</em> or <em>It functions well</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>English uses the perfect form of the verb in a number of 
			distinct ways.&nbsp; The most important consideration in this area 
			is to remember that the present perfect is a
			<span class="style_underline">present</span> tense.&nbsp; It refers 
			to the present <strong>in relation to</strong> the past:<ol class="auto-style15">
				<li>to show that an event or state is unfinished in, for 
				example, <em>I've lived here for years</em> which really is what 
				most languages would understand by a perfect aspect.</li>
				<li>to show that a finished event was recent, e.g., <em>I've 
				finished!</em> which is actually a perfective but with a perfect form 
				to show the present relevance of a completed act or state, e.g.,
				<em>The rain has stopped.&nbsp; </em>That's also a perfective 
				masquerading in perfect clothes.</li>
				<li>to represent a simple perfective, finished event as in, 
				e.g., <em>He's arrived</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>All this makes life tough for learners.&nbsp; Even learners whose 
		first language(s) distinguish between progressive, continuous and 
		perfect aspects will get confused because what looks like a progressive 
		in English might be simple or continuous and what looks like the perfect 
		aspect might be finite and completed.</p>
		<h3>Solutions</h3>
		<p>There's no easy solution here because the choice of aspect usually 
		depends on how the speaker perceives an event.&nbsp; That is to say, 
		it's <span class="style_underline">internal</span>, not an external idea 
		that can be captured by providing a context via an image or whatever.</p>
		<p>Using concept-checking questions and setting a clear context for the 
		language will help, of course, but with aspect, and much else in the 
		language, we have to try to get inside someone else's head.&nbsp; How 
		might we do that?</p>
		<h4>Intentionality</h4>
		<p>We need, when presenting tenses, to consider the intentions of the 
		speaker and we can do that explicitly.</p>
		<p>Example 1:</p>
		<p><span class="style_black">John is interested in starting a 
		conversation with Paul about computers because he wants some advice.&nbsp; 
		What is he most likely to start with?</span></p>
		<ol class="auto-style15">
			<li><em>You've just got yourself a new notebook, haven't you?</em></li>
			<li><em>You bought a new notebook, didn't you?</em></li>
			<li><em>You were buying a new notebook, weren't you?</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Setting this sort of context, where the intentions of the speaker are 
		clear, exposes the thought processes of the speakers.&nbsp; It's a short 
		step from there to implanting the intention in the learners and getting 
		them to produce the appropriate form.</p>
		<p>Example 2:</p>
		<p><span class="style_black">You want to stop someone interrupting John 
		because you know he nearly always works on Saturday mornings.&nbsp; 
		Which of these would you say?</span></p>
		<ol class="auto-style15">
			<li><em>Don't call now, he's working.</em></li>
			<li><em>Don't call now, he'll be working.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>In this case we have told the learner two things: what he/she knows 
		and what he/she intends.&nbsp; Both of those are important to 
		understanding aspect.</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				<td>
				<img alt="visualise" height="166" src="../../training/images/woman_visualise250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style16">
		<h2>Visualisation</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Despite what is said about learning styles we all like concepts we 
		can visualise.&nbsp; The more memorable and interesting the image, the 
		more we like it.&nbsp; Time lines don't have to be dull.&nbsp; Here's an 
		example illustrating two concepts attached to the past progressive in 
		English.</p>
		<p>Sense 1:<br />
		An ‘interrupted’ action which stops: <em><strong>Mary was cycling to 
		work when a bus hit her.</strong></em></p>
		<p>
		<img alt="cycling 1" height="298" src="../development_images/cycling1.png" width="720" /></p>
		<p>Sense 2:</p>
		<p>An ‘interrupted’ action which continues after the interruption: <em>
		<strong>Jane saw her boyfriend with another woman while she was cycling 
		to college.&nbsp; She's 'talking to' him about that now.</strong></em></p>
		<p>
		<img alt="cycling 2" height="324" src="../development_images/cycling2.png" width="720" /></p>
		<p>Here's one for the present perfect to illustrate:</p>
		<p><em><strong>We've all been working really hard in the garden this 
		year and John is very pleased with the result.</strong></em></p>
		<p>
		<img alt="gardening" height="361" src="../development_images/gardening.png" width="730" /></p>
		<p>To show the speaker's intention, thought bubbles are helpful.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="medicine" height="500" src="../development_images/medicine.png" width="600" /></p>
		<p>These sorts of images are easy to make and almost infinitely 
		re-usable.<br />
