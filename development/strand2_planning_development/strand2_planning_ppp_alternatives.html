			<p>There are good reasons why PPP is so popular:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It's easy to implement</li>
				<li>It seems to work</li>
				<li>It's reliable and familiar</li>
				<li>Most course-book and resource writers assume it is how you will approach their material</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is also, however, a bit predictable and dull and not always suited to all lesson aims.</p>

		<p>Lots.&nbsp; Which you choose will depend on what you are trying to 
		achieve.</p>
		<p>The first thing to assemble is a list of what you think must be 
		present in any lesson, especially one in which you hope the learners 
		will acquire new language or skills.&nbsp; That is most of them.&nbsp; 
		Think for a moment and make a list of what stages you think should 
		always be present in your lessons.&nbsp; Don't worry about the ordering 
		of them at this time.<br />
		Write down a few ideas and  
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'structure1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">then click here</a>.</p>
		<div id="structure1" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
		
			<dl class="style_brown">
				<dt><strong><em>Introduction and focus</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>Learners need to know where they are going (and it helps if 
				you give the impression that you know the answer to that) and 
				what they are going to learn.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>Presentation of the focus</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>At some point in the lesson you are going to have to present 
				the language or the skill you are targeting.&nbsp; This means 
				personally (a teacher-led phase) or via the materials you use.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>Controlled practice</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>In this phase, the learners will get some practice at 
				actually using the language or skill but it will be fairly 
				closely controlled so they gain confidence and can focus on the 
				targets.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>Freer practice</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>At this stage the learners will use the targets in a way 
				which is meaningful and personal to them.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>Checking learning</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>At some stage(s) in the lesson there should be an 
				opportunity for both you and the learners to see what they have 
				learnt.&nbsp; This could happen briefly and frequently or be a 
				clear and identifiable stage in itself.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>You may have thought of other things you would like to include 
			and that's fine as long as most of the things in that list are also 
			there.</p>
			</div>
		<h3>Ordering the stages</h3>
		<p>It seems pretty clear that an introduction will come at the beginning 
		and a review and learning check will come at the end.&nbsp; The other 
		phases are, however, moveable.</p>
		<p>Here's the typical structure of what you do now, a PPP lesson:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="ppp" height="396" src="../../training/imagesgraphics/ppp.png" width="620" /></p>
		<p><a name="2"></a>But it doesn't have to be that way.&nbsp; How can you 
		move the middle stages around to make life more interesting for you and 
		your learners?&nbsp; One way is to test first, then present and then 
		test again as a way to check learning.&nbsp; This is called Test &gt; Teach 
		&gt; Test.&nbsp; 
		<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'testteachtest',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Think for a moment how that would look and 
		then click here</a>.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="ttt" height="409" src="../../training/imagesgraphics/ttt.png" width="620" /></p>
		<p>This kind of lesson has three distinct advantages.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>It raises the learners' awareness of their need for the target 
			language or skill so they are motivated to acquire it.</li>
			<li>It is focused on what the learners demonstrably need, not on 
			what you think they need.</li>
			<li>It is centred on the students because they get to try to do a 
			task, then get the language or skill they need to do it better and 
			then get to deploy the language or skill at the end and see their 
			progress.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>PPP and TTT are the two most frequently used structures for lessons.&nbsp; 
		If you haven't used TTT, why not plan to do so this week?&nbsp; You'll 
		need to rearrange your procedures and probably insert more tasks in the 
		lesson but it is not difficult to do.&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Other lesson structures</h3>
		<p>There are other choices.&nbsp; One example is Dogme, (the background to 
		which is covered in
		<a href="../../training/inservice/methodology/alternative_methodologies.html#dogme">a short 
		guide on this site</a>).&nbsp; A Dogme lesson might have a structure 
		like this:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="dogme" height="399" src="../../training/imagesgraphics/dogme.png" width="620" /></p>
		<p>Another example is Task-Based Learning for which there is also 		<a href="../../training/inservice/methodology/tbl.html">a guide on this site</a>.</p>
		<p>There is something of a small controversy here because authorities 
		differ on the ordering of a lesson procedure.&nbsp; There are 
		essentially two choices:</p>
		<table cellspacing="0" style="width: 810px">
			<tr>
				<td><em><strong>Procedure 1</strong></em></td>
				<td><em><strong>Procedure 2</strong></em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="procedure 1" height="329" src="../../training/imagesgraphics/tblproc1.png" width="400" /></td>
				<td>
				<img alt="tbl procedure 2" height="329" src="../../training/imagesgraphics/tbl2proc.png" width="400" /></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>For more ideas and suggestions, try
		<a href="../../training/inservice/methodology/alternative_methodologies.html">the guide to 
		alternative methodologies on this site</a>.</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="repertoire" height="166" src="../../training/images/music_score250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style14">
		<h2>Developing your repertoire</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>There's no suggestion here that what you have been doing (following a 
		PPP approach) is in any way wrong or misguided but it is slightly safe 
		and predictable.&nbsp; Learners (and teachers) respond well to 
		innovation and novelty so it is worth injecting something new from time 
		to time.&nbsp; Here are some suggestions.</p>
		<p>To experiment with a TTT approach:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Take a plan for a lesson you have done as PPP.</li>
			<li>Re-arrange the phases of the lesson by inserting the controlled 
			practice section at the beginning, followed by the presentation 
			section and some more controlled practice (which you will probably 
			have to design).</li>
			<li>Have a freer practice phase at the end followed by an explicit 
			conversation with the learners about what they can do now that they 
			couldn't do in the first part of the lesson.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>To experiment with other approaches, you'll probably have to plan 
		from scratch.&nbsp; For Dogme, for example, you will find lots of ideas 
		in Thornbury and Meddings (2009).&nbsp; Dogme lessons are often based 
		around materials brought in by the learners themselves so you could, for 
		example, ask them to bring in a picture which means something special to 
		them, a quotation from someone which has a particular attraction or 
		whatever.<br />
		You can't plan much more for the lesson but you can think of small tasks 
		to do with the materials.&nbsp; In the lesson, you will have to be on 
		your toes and react to needs as they arise, inserting short teaching and 
		practising phases.</p>

			</table>
		<p>There's a separate guide in this section of the site to
		<a href="../gauging_progress.html">gauging and measuring progress in your 
		development</a>.&nbsp; Go there for more ideas.<br />
		In terms of judging how introducing innovation in lesson structure is 
		working, you and your learners are the best judges.<br />
		You need to develop some ways of asking your students how they feel 
		about different approaches and you'll need to keep a diary or notes on 
		plans where you can record your own and their reactions as well as some 
		judgement of how well learning happened.<br />
		It's a long-term project and you can't change your teaching approach 
		overnight.<br />
		Nor should you try.&nbsp; As was said at the beginning, there is nothing 
		inherently wrong with what you do now but a little variety and newness 
		can be a spur to learning and renew your own motivation and commitment.</p>
