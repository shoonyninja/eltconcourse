				<p>If you are an obsessive clock-watcher in 
				your lessons and/or find yourself pausing often to check your 
				plan then you are probably the victim of the dread overplanning 
				syndrome.</p>
				<p>On the positive side, it also means that 
				you are an organised and conscientious teacher who wants to make 
				sure that no learner's time is wasted and that all the learners 
				get the most out of each lesson.&nbsp; That's a good thing and 
				there is no intention here to suggest that careful planning is 
				not helpful and desirable.<br />
				However, there are 
				many occasions in language teaching when going with the flow is 
				a principled decision and it has many advantages.&nbsp; It does 
				not necessarily mean you are not being conscientious.</p>
			<p>In fact, there is an 
				approach to teaching, called Dogme, which encourages teachers to 
				be much more relaxed about planning, use materials sparingly if at all and 
				avoid the use of technology where possible.&nbsp; The central 
				idea is to use the language that emerges from, or that is clearly 
				needed by, the learners as the core of any teaching.<br />
				You still have to have some idea where you are 
				going, but only the general outlines of a lesson can be planned because 
			learning is seen to happen in conversation and the focus is on what 
			emerges naturally from the learners rather than imposed upon them.<br />
				If you think you might be suffering from overplanning syndrome, 
				you could read up on Dogme and try the approach.&nbsp;
				For more on Dogme, and some references to research, go
				<a href="../../training/inservice/methodology/alternative_methodologies.html#dogme">

		<p>You knew that but here is one reason why.<br />
		In most jobs, workers don't actually have to do much planning of 
		their own work &ndash; it comes to them.<br />
		If you are a doctor, a pilot, a train driver or a shop worker, all you 
		need to do is go to work at the right time and the patients, the 
		passengers and the customers come to you.&nbsp; You don't even have to 
		bring your own surgery, aeroplane, train or shop with you.</p>
		<p>Teaching isn't like that because, although you don't usually need to 
		bring the classroom and the equipment with you, you do have to bring the 
		ideas, the materials and a plan of what you intend to do.&nbsp; If you 
		do nothing, the students may come to you but nothing will happen.<br />
		Teachers have to make up their jobs as they go along.&nbsp; That's one of 
		the things that makes it special (and tiring and stressful at times).</p>

				Emerging needs</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>One of the ways we make up our own jobs is in planning.&nbsp; Another 
		concerns our reactions to the needs of the learners as we go along.&nbsp; 
		Not reacting to their needs means you end up teaching the plan, not the 
		learners.</p>
		<p>Think for a moment about what sorts of needs might emerge from a 
		group of learners as a lesson goes along.&nbsp; If it helps, think 
		through a lesson you have recently taught and see if you can identify 
		any emerging needs in that lesson.<br />

		<div id="emergingneed" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
		
		<dl class="style_brown">
			<dt><strong>The need for extension</strong></dt>
			<dd>This happens frequently with lexis.<br />
			For example, you knew in the plan that the learners would need the 
			adjective <em>enthusiastic</em> 
			to complete a task on personality traits and understand a key part 
			of text.&nbsp; What you didn't plan for is the fact that 11 out of 
			12 learners don't know how the word collocates and none of them can 
			pronounce it acceptably.&nbsp; They are producing things like <em>an 
			enthusiastic job, an enthusiastic position</em> and so on<em>.&nbsp;
			</em>You could, of course, just explain or translate rapidly and 
			move on.&nbsp; On the other hand, if they need the word and need to 
			produce the word, you have to depart from your plan to take account 
			of its importance, teaching its pronunciation, likely collocations, 
			related words and so on.&nbsp; This might take 5 minutes out of your 
			carefully planned timing so something may have to be shortened or 
			omitted elsewhere.&nbsp; That's the judgement call.</dd>
			<dt><strong>The need for more practice</strong></dt>
			<dd>Half-way through a lesson you have cleverly planned a stage in 
			which the learners complete a form-based exercise intended to show 
			you and them that they have grasped the use of a range of 
			prepositions.&nbsp; What you didn't plan for is that many of the 
			learners are very tired and have not properly understood the 
			difference between <em>in</em> and <em>at</em>.&nbsp; There's little 
			point in going on to the next stage of the lesson if they can't 
			distinguish the uses of the words so you have to extemporise: 
			re-present the issues with different examples, concept check again 
			and then invent something like a quick gap-fill task or elicit some 
			uses to make sure they have got it.&nbsp; This all takes time.</dd>
			<dt><strong>The need for background and clarification</strong></dt>
			<dd>You have used a reading text as the basis of a lesson on 
			skimming and scanning skills.&nbsp; You weren't very concerned with 
			the topic (American food); it was the subskills that formed your 
			focus.&nbsp; Surprisingly, however, you find that the learners are 
			actually displaying a previously hidden interest in knowing more 
			about American food and how it varies from state to state and region 
			to region of the USA.&nbsp;&nbsp;You could, of course, ignore this 
			hunger for knowledge and get on with the plan or you can take 10 
			minutes to explore things further and provide both information and 
			language.&nbsp; Another judgement call you have to make.</dd>
			<dt><strong>The need to have another go</strong></dt>
			<dd>It is sometimes the case that we need to do things more than 
			once (or more often than we planned).&nbsp; For example, a reading 
			or listening text may prove to be more difficult for our learners 
			than we thought or a speaking task may be poorly and hesitatingly 
			achieved and needs to be repeated.&nbsp; If there is an issue like 
			this with a task, it is perilous to ignore it.</dd>

		<p>Naturally, however you deal with needs as they emerge in your 
		teaching, the effect will be a departure from your plan.&nbsp; The

		<dl class="style_brown">
			<dt><strong>Event 1</strong></dt>
			<dd>This is the introduction to the lesson so giving the class a 
			blow-by-blow account of your holiday is unlikely to involve the 
			learners in the topic and will disrupt the timing for the rest of 
			the lesson.&nbsp; A combination of b) and c) is probably the wisest 
			response but you do need to respond.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Event 2</strong></dt>
			<dd>It's actually quite complicated because buses can be two deck 
			and coaches can't and buses are timetabled but coaches are hired for 
			special occasions.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we usually use the word 
			coach for a single-deck, long-distance bus!&nbsp; Eliciting the 
			difference will take too long so the preferred response is to give 
			the student half the truth (single vs. double deck or hired vs. 
			timetabled) and make a mental note to sort the issue out later.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Event 3</strong></dt>
			<dd>Response a) will take forever and is of questionable value 
			(unless you are teaching English for maritime purposes).&nbsp; 
			Again, a combination of b) and c) is probably wise.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Event 4</strong></dt>
			<dd>If you can do a), don't.&nbsp; It's an excessive response.&nbsp; 
			b) is much better (and if you have a map in the classroom, you can 
			point to the country).&nbsp; You do, however, need to get 
			pronunciation right so pausing to drill is a good response.</dd>
		</dl>
		</div>
		<p><a name="3"></a>These are, of course, rather trivial events.&nbsp; 
		Less trivial is the occasional need to depart completely from your plan

		<a href="#3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'non-trivial',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Think of some reasons and then click here</a>.</p>
		<div id="non-trivial" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
		
		<dl class="style_brown">
			<dt><strong>Misjudgement</strong></dt>
			<dd>If you have badly misjudged the difficulty of the materials or 
			the abilities of the students then one of two reactions is needed.<br />
			If the material is too difficult or the learners less able than you 
			thought, you will have to slow down and teach the language the 
			learners need to understand it.&nbsp; In extreme cases, it may be 
			necessary abandon it. Anything is better than steamrollering ahead 
			and frustrating, depressing and demotivating the learners.<br />
			If the material is easier or the learners more able than you 
			thought, it is time either to raise the challenge of the task 
			(asking them to read and summarise, getting them analyse the grammar 
			and lexis etc.) or move on more quickly than you had planned, 
			abandoning, if necessary, the text explanation phase.&nbsp; It is 
			frustrating for learners to be asked to demonstrate they understand 
			something below their abilities.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Responses</strong></dt>
			<dd>There are times when a learner's response to something comes as 
			a surprise and is compelling enough to warrant some divergence from 
			the plan.&nbsp; For example, in practising short responses to present-perfect 
			questions, the following exchange was observed:<br />
			<span class="style_black">
			<em>T: Have you ever been to Brazil, Michael?<br />
			M: Yes, I have.<br />
			T: Good. Dana, have you ever eaten a full English breakfast?<br />
			D: No, I haven't.<br />
			T: Good. Michiko, have you ever been in an earthquake?<br />
			M: Yes, I have, it was in ...<br />
			T: Good. Frederic, Have you ever ...</em></span><br />
			etc.<br />
			Please don't do that.&nbsp; It was important to Michiko if not to you.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Involvement</strong></dt>
			<dd>Some classroom activities can surprise in terms of how involved 
			learners get.&nbsp; If you expected something to involve people and it 
			doesn't, cut it short.&nbsp; If something is unexpectedly involving for 
			your learners, extend it and catch the buzz.</dd>

		<h4>Planning</h4>
		<p>When you next plan a lesson, re-read the plan and look at each stage 
		in turn.<br />
		About each stage, ask yourself:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>What could be the learners' response to this stage?<ol class="auto-style7">
				<li>What will I do if the response is negative?</li>
				<li>What will I do if the response is very positive?</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>What language and/or skills do the learners need to complete 
			this task well?<ol class="auto-style7">
				<li>What will I do if they don't have the knowledge or the 
				skill?</li>
				<li>What will I do if they finish it very quickly?</li>
				<li>What will I do if they are struggling?</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In each stage of the plan insert a 'flexi-stage', i.e., one that you 
		can implement or not as the needs arise, which responds to the possible 
		answers to those questions.&nbsp; That way, you'll have planned to go 
		off plan and still be in your comfort zone.</p>
		<h4>Monitoring, reviewing and being observed</h4>
		<p>Monitoring your own behaviour in class is a start.&nbsp; Try 
		to notice when people are struggling or wanting more and be brave enough 
		to depart from the plan and attend to it.&nbsp; If you have time try:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Record a lesson on video or audio.</li>
			<li>Play it back in privacy and look particularly for events or 
			questions which show an emerging need.<br />
			Ask three questions:<ol class="auto-style7">
				<li>did I notice?</li>
				<li>did I react?</li>
				<li>was my reaction wise and proportional?</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can do the same thing if you are lucky enough to be able to get 
		an observer to follow your instructions.&nbsp; Set them the same 
		questions and then discuss your responses and the events and talk about 
		how to make them better.</p>

		In terms of making adjustments to the plan as you go along, you may not 
		be the best judge so, if you can, get someone to observe how you react 
		to emerging needs and discuss whether your reaction was the right one.<br />
		If it wasn't, try to think together about what would have been the right
