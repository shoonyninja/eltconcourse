	planning?</span></h1>

				<p>You have arrived here because you 
				partially or fully agreed with:</p>
				<p class="indentpara"><em><strong>I don’t plan much – I just go 
				with the flow</strong></em></p>
				<p>There are many occasions in language 
				teaching when going with the flow is a principled decision and 
				it has many advantages so there is no intention here to be 
				obsessive about the need to plan.&nbsp; In fact, there is an 
				approach to teaching, called Dogme, which encourages teachers to 
				be much more relaxed about planning, use materials sparingly if at all and 
				avoid the use of technology where possible.&nbsp; The central 
				idea is to use the language that emerges from, or that is clearly 
				needed by, the learners as the core of any teaching.</p>
			<p>Some have assumed that this also 
				means teachers can't or shouldn't plan but that is arguably not 
				true.&nbsp; You still have to have some idea where you are 
				going.&nbsp; It <strong>is</strong> the case that only the general outlines of a lesson can be planned because 
			learning is seen to happen in conversation and the focus is on what 
			emerges naturally from the learners rather than imposed upon them.<br />
				For more on Dogme, and some references to research, go
				<a href="../../training/inservice/methodology/alternative_methodologies.html#dogme" target="_blank">to the brief guide</a> on this site.</p>

		<p>There are some good reasons why planning lessons (not all of them, 
		not all the time) is A Good Thing.<br />
		Come up with three good reasons to have plans for a lessons and then 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'plan1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">click for a list of 4</a>.</p>
		<div id="plan1" style="visibility: hidden"><ol class="auto-style8">
			<li>They encourage clear thinking concerning aims and procedures.&nbsp; These should match.<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>What do you expect the learners to be able to do at end of 
				lesson that they couldn’t do before?</li>
				<li>What do you intend to do to make that possible?</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>They assist in a rational approach to the design and structuring 
			of a lesson.&nbsp; It is remarkably easy to see on paper that 
			something does or doesn't make sense in the order you have planned 
			it.</li>
			<li>They provide a working document during the lesson so you don't 
			forget key stages.</li>
			<li>They provide a record for the future so you can amend and repeat 
			the lesson.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>The gist here is that planning leads to coherence and learners like 
		that.&nbsp; It gives them confidence that their needs are being met and 
		they are in the hands of a professional who knows where things are 
		going.</p></div>
