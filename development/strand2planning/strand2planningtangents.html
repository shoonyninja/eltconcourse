			<li>It can frustrate the learners because the tangent you are 
			following is often not something they are particularly interested 
			in following.</li>
			<li>It means that the timing of the lesson is disrupted and crucial

			everyone and doesn't lead to good learning.</li>
			<li>It makes you seem scatty and disorganised and lowers your

		<p>The point here is not to suggest that it is never a good idea to go 
		off on a tangent because sometimes doing so really is responding to the 
		emerging needs of learners.&nbsp; However, if it something that you 
		admit happens 'too often' then it seems that you are not responding to 
		the learners' needs but to your own.</p></div>

		<p>No, it's not easy to decide without knowing the context.<br />
		Events 1, 2 and 3 could be examples of chasing red herrings, if, e.g., 
		the story about your last holiday contained none of the target language, 
		the learner's tale was long and very laborious or the fashion house 
		question was a concern of only one learner.&nbsp; However, if the story 
		about your last holiday was mostly about transport and carefully worded, 
		it might be a good contextualiser.&nbsp; If the learner's disaster story 
		concerned transport (if only in part) it might do the same and also be 
		interesting and motivating.&nbsp; If fashion and fashion houses are of 
		interest to most of the students, that, too, might be motivating.<br />
		On the other hand, the <em>do</em> in Love Me Do is an emphasiser, not a 
		substituting verb so it's irrelevant and a red herring.&nbsp; Equally, 
		asking the expert for help with your problems is unlikely to improve any 
		but her language and is an abuse of other people's time so that's a red 
		herring, too.<br />
		If the phrase 'abuse of other people's time' seems strong to you, that's 
		intended.&nbsp; Wasting learners' time is not excusable.</p>

		<p>If the tangent you are about to follow is something that has just 
		occurred to you it is likely to be a red herring and should not be 
		followed.&nbsp; It's that simple.<br />
		If, on the other hand, the tangent is stimulated by a question from a 
		learner or something that is happening in class with a task or activity, 
		then not to respond and go off plan would be unwise.&nbsp; You need to 
		pause and ask some questions before you follow a diversion:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Is this a concern of only one learner or will it be of interest 
			and benefit to most?&nbsp; If it's the latter, follow it.</li>
			<li>Is this going to take a lot of time or is it quick to answer 
			even if it's not central to the lesson aims?&nbsp; If it's quick and 
			won't delay you, respond.&nbsp; That values the learner's 
			contribution and motivates.</li>
			<li>Is the class struggling with a task and needing more help.&nbsp; 
			Yes?&nbsp; Depart from the plan.&nbsp; This results from a fault in 
			planning probably and some kind of misjudgement.</li>
			<li>Is this something which has just occurred to me that might 
			mislead or be plain wrong?&nbsp; If that's the case, you need to 
			clear it up now.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Summary:<br />
		If the tangent you are following is nothing to do with the aims of the 
		lesson and will not contribute to the topic, leave it alone.<br />
		If the tangent is suggested by the learners or their behaviour, take it 
		much more seriously and use your judgement.</p>

		<h4>Planning</h4>
		<p>When you next plan a lesson, re-read the plan and look at each stage 
		in turn.<br />
		About each stage, ask yourself:</p>
		<p>What could be the learners' response to this stage?</p>
		<ol class="auto-style7">
			<li>What tangent will I be tempted to follow?</li>
			<li>Where will it lead me?</li>
			<li>Will it contribute to my aims?</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Monitoring, reviewing and being observed</h4>
		<p>Monitoring your own behaviour in class is a start.&nbsp; Try 
		to notice when you are being tempted to go off plan and resist the 
		temptation unless there's a really good reason.&nbsp; If you have time try:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Record a lesson on video or audio.</li>
			<li>Play it back in privacy and look particularly for events when 
			you departed from the plan.<br />
			Ask four questions:<ol class="auto-style7">
				<li>did I need to do that?</li>
				<li>did I get back on track quickly?</li>
				<li>how did the learners benefit?</li>
				<li>did the diversion mean that crucial parts of the lesson 
				didn't happen?</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can do the same thing if you are lucky enough to be able to get 
		an observer to follow your instructions.&nbsp; Set them the same 
		questions and then discuss your responses and the events and talk about 
		how to make them better.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Gauging progress</h2>
		<p>There's a separate guide in this section of the site to
		<a href="../gaugingprogress.html">gauging and measuring progress in your 
		development</a>.&nbsp; Go there for more ideas.<br />
		In terms of making 
		sensible adjustments to the plan as you go along, rather than chasing 
		red herrings, you may not 
		be the best judge so, if you can, get someone to observe how you react 
		to questions and ideas and discuss whether your reaction was the right one.<br />
		If it wasn't, try to think together about what would have been the right 
		response.</p>
