		<p>There are lots of ways to gather data on your teaching or kick-start 
		a development programme.&nbsp; Keeping 
		a teaching diary and getting someone to come and observe you are two.&nbsp; 
		Can you think of some more?<br />

			</ol>
				</div><p>We can take them one at a time and see what's meant.&nbsp; 
		Some are obvious, some aren't.</p>
		<ol>
				<li><strong>Record your lesson(s)</strong><br />
				Most people now assume that this means on video but it isn't 
				necessary to do that or be sophisticated.&nbsp; Video is helpful 
				in many ways because it allows you to see what's happening.&nbsp; 
				However, unless it's quite elaborate, you won't be able to see 
				the whole room or the individuals in it and sound quality is, 
				likewise, often an issue.<br />
				Audio recording is much simpler and less intrusive (it can even 
				be done covertly) and there are few teaching settings in which 
				an audio recorder of some sort is not available.&nbsp; You were 
				present in the lesson, after all, and can visualise what was 
				happening quite clearly when you play back the recording to 
				yourself.&nbsp; Others will have more difficulty.</li>
				<li><strong>Get an observer to comment on your teaching</strong><br />
				This is often a very powerful source of data but it is sometimes 
				hard to set up in schools where everyone is busy and you need to 
				make sure you have clear tasks for observers to do or they will 
				just get an overall, and rather subjective, impression with not 
				enough detail or focus for your purposes.</li>
				<li><strong>Get students to comment on your teaching</strong><br />
				There are really only two ways to do this: face to face or via a 
				questionnaire of some sort.<br />
				Face to face is often better because you can refine the 
				questioning as you go along and respond to what people say by 
				asking them to clarify or expand.&nbsp; You don't need to do 
				this with the whole of large classes.&nbsp; You can select a few 
				people as a representative focus group or ask for volunteers.&nbsp; 
				You still need a clear, focused set of questions to ask, 
				however.</li>
				<li><strong>Keep a diary of your teaching experiences</strong><br />
				This requires a bit of discipline and structure but it can be 
				finely focused because you can choose what to record and how 
				often to record it.</li>
				<li><strong>Try out something new in the classroom</strong><br />
				Again, this doesn't need to be elaborate.&nbsp; It can be as 
				simple as trying out a new drilling technique or using 
				Dictogloss or whatever.</li>
				<li><strong>Discuss with colleagues</strong><br />
				If you can, get others involved in a development programme.&nbsp; 
				That way, you can meet, say, once a week and bounce ideas around 
				and share triumphs and disasters together.</li>
				<li><strong>Attend lectures / seminars about teaching / read books and 
				journal articles</strong><br />
				This may not be an option where you live and work but, if it 
				isn't, why not try setting up a self-help group to make 
				mini-presentations or read and article and come to a meeting to 
				discuss it?</li>
				<li><strong>Be a student yourself</strong><br />
				It's a humbling and often informative experience to become a 
				language student yourself.&nbsp; It can also focus you on real 
				difficulties.&nbsp; Try learning a new language from scratch.</li>
				<li><strong>Observe others teaching</strong><br />
				Again, in busy schools and institutions, this is often hard to 
				arrange (as is finding volunteers) but if you have a self-help 
				group set up, you can observe each other so everyone gets a 
				chance to 'get their own back'.</li>
				<li><strong>Keep records such as notes made on lesson plans after 
				teaching</strong><br />
				This is less elaborate than keeping a diary and simply requires 
				you to take a few minutes at the end of each lesson (or during 
				it, if you have a bit of space) to make a few notes on what went 
				right, what didn't and what changes you should make.&nbsp; You 
				don't have to do it for every lesson, of course.</li>
			</ol>
				<p>Ideas 5, 7 and 8 above are just ways to get you started but 
				the rest are proper data-gathering procedures.&nbsp; We'll focus 
				on those here.<br />

				your own mind what it's good for and whether there are 
				advantages and drawbacks and then click on the

				<h2>Examples</h2>
		<p>Some examples of data-gathering documents follow.<br />
		Additionally, there is some advice about how to write questionnaires and 
		the sorts of item-types which are appropriate in the in-service training
		<a href="../training/inservice/teaching/needs_analyses.html">guide to conducting 
		a needs analysis</a>.&nbsp; That section is not written with personal 
		professional development in mind but the considerations are the same and 
		you can adapt the procedures to get the data you want.</p>
		<h3>Observer tasks</h3>
		<p>These work well whether used by an observer or by yourself when 
		reviewing a recording of some teaching.</p>
		<p>You can, of course, write a questionnaire for an observer but 
		simple tasks like this often produce cleaner results.</p>
		<h4>Charts</h4>
		<p>This can be an effective way to focus your observer (or you, if you 
		are reviewing a recorded lesson) on what you want 
		to discover.&nbsp; Start with a blank chart and three coloured 
		pens to play with while the lesson progresses.&nbsp; You can also use a set of blank circles and make pie charts if that's 
		easier.&nbsp; Clearly, you can vary the parameters to suit what you want 
		to be the focus.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="chart" height="215" src="../training/imagesgraphics/observation_bar_chart.png" width="465" /></p>
		<h4>Simple tasks</h4>
		<p>
		<img alt="task" height="303" src="../training/imagesgraphics/observation_areas_task.png" width="465" /><br />
		etc. for the following stages.</p>
		<h4>Interaction charts</h4>
		<p>Again, these can be filled in by an observer or by you when you 
		review a recorded lesson.&nbsp; You need to limit them to short phases 
		or they become unmanageable.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="interactions" height="273" src="../training/imagesgraphics/observation_interaction_chart_full.png" width="465" /></p>
		<h4>Questionnaires for learners</h4>
		<p>Again, simple, attractive questionnaires which are for simple 
		responses are often better than requiring written answers from learners 
		because the data are easy to interpret.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="feedback" height="320" src="../training/imagesgraphics/learner_feedback_chart.png" width="465" /></p>
		<p>This is another way of getting feedback from learners, lesson stage 
		by lesson stage.&nbsp; Warning: learners are poor at remembering what they did!&nbsp; 
		Get them to put a cross or a bar on the line.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="what we did" height="310" src="../training/imagesgraphics/learner_feedback_chart2.png" width="465" /></p>
		<h4>Apportioning time</h4>
		
		<table cellpadding="8" class="auto-style11">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13">Make a pie chart of a lesson you taught 
				and recorded in some way.&nbsp; Something like this:</td>
				<td class="auto-style12">Then make another setting out the 
				proportions of time you should have used.</td>
