		<p>You arrived here because you agreed or fully agreed with this 
		statement:</p>
		<p><strong class="auto-style5"><em>Iâ€™m not always sure whether I should correct an error, 
		make a note for later or ignore it</em></strong></p>
		<p>As was noted on the previous page, this is a judgement call and 
		nobody gets it right all the time.&nbsp; However, there are some ways to 
		make our judgements more reliable and more consistent.&nbsp; You need to 
		develop a conscious system for pausing when you hear error and 
		considering the best way to deal with it.&nbsp; It's complex and depends 
		on a number of variables.</p>

				<td class="auto-style4">
		<h2>Understanding error</h2>

		</table>
		<p>First you need to revise or learn about some of the key concepts concerning errors 
		learners make.&nbsp; Go 
		to either
		<a href="../../training/inservice/background/error.html" target="_blank">
		the in-service guide to the technicalities of error analysis</a> or
		<a href="../../training/initial/teaching/error_essentials.html" target="_blank">
		an easier guide to error</a>.&nbsp; (Both those links will open in a new 
		tab so just close the page to come back to this point.)</p>
		<p>As you know, we can view error as something to be avoided at all 
		costs and make sure our learners make as few of them as possible or 
		treat error as part of the learning process.<br />
		If you hold the first view, then you will have to correct all errors in 
		the language as they occur.&nbsp; You have no choice because the theory 
		is that errors will become habitual and permanent parts of the learner's 
		language if they are not eradicated or avoided.&nbsp; Even better, of 
		course, you will design lessons and tasks so that errors do not occur at 
		all.<br />
		However, if you have started 
		this development strand, it's more likely that you hold the second view 
		and want to investigate what to correct and how to correct it.&nbsp; 
		That's the assumption here.</p>

				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The first step in developing your skills in handling error is to make 
		the process of deciding whether to correct as automatic as you can.&nbsp; 
		At first, this may slow down your responses to students but, as 
		experience grows, the time-lag shortens.&nbsp; What questions do you ask 
		of yourself to decide whether to correct?<br />
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'errorfeedback1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have reflected briefly</a>.</p>
		<div id="errorfeedback1" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">
		
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>How systematic is the error?</strong></dt>
			<dd>If it's pre-systematic (i.e., the learner has never encountered 
			the language before), then it's probably not worth taking too much 
			time correcting.&nbsp; If you simply need to supply a single word, 
			then it's OK to correct.<br />
			If it's systematic, then you probably need to do something because 
			the learner needs your help in acquiring the language at this point.<br />
			If it's post-systematic, then it's probably just a slip you can 
			safely ignore.&nbsp; Alternatively, just a gesture or grimace is 
			usually enough to alert the learner and encourage self-correction.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Is the error in language or skill-use which is the target of my 
			lesson?</strong></dt>
			<dd>If the error has nothing to do with the targets of the lesson, 
			you would be well advised to ignore it to maintain your focus.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Will correcting the error interrupt too much?</strong></dt>
			<dd>If you are at a stage in a lesson when your focus is on fluency, 
			not accuracy, then a sensible way forward is just to note the 
			error and wait for a more opportune time to draw the learners' 
			attention to where they went wrong.</dd>
			<dt><strong>How serious is the error in terms of communication?</strong></dt>
			<dd>If the error is so serious that the learner cannot be 
			understood, it's probably wise to step in and sort the problem out.</dd>
		</dl>
			
			<p>The situation is sometimes a bit muddy because an error may be 
			pre-systematic (so you don't want to correct) but also interfering 
			with communication (so you do).&nbsp; An error may be in the target 
			language but also come at a time when you don't want to interrupt 
			the flow of a fluency-focused stage.&nbsp; That's a judgement call.</p>
			</div><p>Clearly, you will need to take a bit of time to process these 
			questions before you decide whether to correct or not so here are two 
			suggested self-training programmes:</p>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="1" height="68" src="../../gfx/1blue.png" width="100" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style4">
				<h4>Programme 1:</h4>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Decide before the lesson what you will correct.&nbsp; For 
			example (select only one for each lesson you target):</p>
		<ul class="redbullet">
			<li>In this structure lesson I will only focus on the targets of my 
			lesson and will ignore all other error, or</li>
			<li>I will ignore any error in the lesson which is not systematic, 
			or</li>
			<li>I will not interrupt anyone in this skills lesson but will make 
			a note of errors and set aside two phases in my lesson, one in the 
			middle and one near the end, when I will focus on students' errors 
			and get them to try to correct them before I teach.</li>
		</ul>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="2" height="69" src="../../gfx/2blue.png" width="100" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style4">
				<h4>Programme 2</h4>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Negotiate what to correct with your learners and let them know what 
		you will correct.<br />
		You could, for example, establish a routine of having a 20-minute 
		opinion-sharing exercise at the end of each day on a different topic 
		but, on certain days, you will focus exclusively on pronunciation while 
		on others, lexical choice will be your focus and at other times only 
		grammatical and structural errors will be corrected.<br />
		You can do the same kind of thing with lots of different 
		types of activities.<br />
		(Some learners, it is true, think they want the teacher to correct all 
		and every error they make.&nbsp; Trying that for one lesson usually 
		persuades them that it is not actually what they want at all.)</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				<td>
				<img alt="correcting" height="166" src="../../training/images/goodbad250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style4">
		<h2><a name="2"></a>How to correct</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>A lot of learners expect their teacher to do the correction work and, 
		yes, that is sometimes the appropriate way.&nbsp; It is, however, not 
		the only way.&nbsp; What questions should we be asking here?<br />
		<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'errorfeedback2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Reflect for a moment about how you correct and then click here for some 
		ideas</a>.</p>
		<div id="errorfeedback2" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
		
		<dl class="style_brown">
			<dt><strong>Question 1: do <em>I</em> need to correct this?</strong></dt>
			<dd>Very often, learners can correct their own production so a 
			quizzical look or stopping learners and getting them to 
			retrace their steps and reconsider may be more effective than your correcting the 
			error.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Question 2: can anyone else correct the error?</strong></dt>
			<dd>If the learners can't correct their own errors, perhaps someone 
			else in the class can. &nbsp;If you think this is the case, give them the 
			chance to do so.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Question 3: how will I correct?</strong></dt>
			<dd>A last resort is normally to give 
			the correct answer yourself.&nbsp; Often, learners can be led to discover 
			the right answer with questions and suggestions such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's 
			something wrong with the order of the words<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What preposition do 
			we need here?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What tense should this be?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we talking about 
			tomorrow or today?</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a long 'a' sound or a short one?</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			If all else fails, however, there are, obviously, times when  
			providing the right answer is the best approach <strong>providing</strong> you make 
			sure that the learner can produce the correct language independently 
			after you have done so.</dd>
		</dl>
</div><p>You can follow a similar procedure to train yourself to apply these criteria 
automatically by focusing on one at a time.<br />
Decide at the start of your day's teaching, for example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Today I will <span class="style_underline">always</span> try to elicit the 
correction from the learners before I provide the answer<br />
			or</li>
			<li>Today, my first response to an error will
			<span class="style_underline">always</span> be a quizzical look, 
			followed by "Try again, please."</li>
		</ul>

		<p>There's <a href="../gauging_progress.html">a guide to gauging progress</a> for any development process in 
		this section for some general ideas about how to gather data on your 
		classroom behaviour.<br />
		In the case of handling error, however, your own and your learners' 
		opinions are very important.&nbsp; Specifically, you could ask yourself 
		whether you feel more confident handling error after trying out some of 
		these suggestions.&nbsp; And you could explain to the learners what you 
		are trying to achieve and get their feedback on whether they feel your 
		error handling seems more helpful and more relevant.<br />
		Ways of getting feedback from learners are covered in the guide to 
		gauging progress.</p>
