			<dt><strong>Authenticity</strong></dt>
			<dd>If it is our avowed aim to improve our learners' communicative 
			competence in the real world, then it seems logical, as often as we 
			can, to make interactions inside the classroom simulate those they 
			might encounter outside the classroom.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Motivation</strong></dt>
			<dd>Most of us actually like someone to ask us about our feelings 
			and experiences because it makes us feel valued and interesting.&nbsp; 
			That's a strong motivating factor.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Skills authenticity</strong></dt>
			<dd>We react to texts of different sorts in different ways and read 
			them using different strategies.&nbsp; If a text is only used as a 
			vehicle for language work, we won't be giving our students the 
			chance to react to texts personally and authentically.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Learning</strong></dt>
			<dd>Language is more memorable if we have had some kind of personal 
			connection to it and engaged parts of our personalities rather than only 
			our analytic skills.</dd>

		<p> We saw above that the other problem with the teaching exchanges was 
		that it is always the teacher who does the initiation and the student is 
		consigned to the role of responder.&nbsp; (For more 
		on Initiation, Response, Feedback routines, see
		<a href="../../training/initial/skills/speaking_overview.html" target="_blank">the guide to speaking</a>.)<br />
		Why should this be a problem?&nbsp; 
		<a href="#3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'qanda3',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have had some 
		thoughts</a>.</p>

		<p><span class="style_brown">Some comments:</span></p>
			<dl class="style_brown">
				<dt><strong>Authenticity</strong></dt>
				<dd>In the real world, we share our initiations and responses 
				more fairly and usually, as you may have seen if you followed 
				the guide to speaking, we respond and initiate in the same turn.&nbsp; 
				That's not happening in the interactions above so the learner is 
				getting one-sided practice.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Commitment and autonomy</strong></dt>
				<dd>If the learners are not given the opportunity to initiate as 
				well as respond, they are forced into a receptive and passive 
				role which doesn't allow for full commitment to what's going on 
				in the room.&nbsp; It also leaves the learner unable to function 
				independently.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Communicative skill</strong></dt>
				<dd>If learners get too little training in how to (and in the 
				need to) initiate to keep interactions flowing, then we'll end 
				up with the usual sorts of conversations such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Where have you been this evening?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				B: I went to the cinema.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A: What did you see?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				B: A film.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A: Oh.</em> [end of conversation]<br />
				instead of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Where have you been this evening.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				B: I went to the cinema.&nbsp; What have you been doing?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A: That's nice.&nbsp; Oh, I've just been out for a walk with 
				Rover.&nbsp; Was it a good film?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				B: Not really.&nbsp; Did you go to the park?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				which may not be particularly gripping but is a bit more like 
				real people-talk.</dd>
