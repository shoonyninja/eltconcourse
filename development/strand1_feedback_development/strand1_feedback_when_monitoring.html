		</table>
		<p>Lev Vygotsky (1962) posited something known now as the Zone of Proximal Development 
		or the ZPD.<br />
		Briefly explained, it is the learning zone in which the 
		learner can achieve the task with a little help or scaffolding by 
		someone who knows more (you).&nbsp; It lies between tasks which the 
		learner can already do without help (so won't learn much) and tasks 
		which the learner cannot even attempt (so won't learn much).&nbsp; If 
		the task is too easy, the learner will get bored.&nbsp; If it's too hard 
		the learner will become anxious.</p>
		<p>You can visualise it like this:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="zpd" height="233" src="../../training/imagesgraphics/zpd_green_zone310.png" width="310" /></p>
		<p>Part of the business of monitoring is to check that the task is in 
		the green zone.&nbsp; The other part is to supply just the level of help 
		and information that the learners need to complete the task but no more 
		or less.<br />
		If you find yourself having to do the task for them or that your help is 
		never needed, the task is outside the green zone and less useful (or 
		even useless).<br />
		That's the theory.</p>

		</table>
		<p>The first step in developing your monitoring skills is to decide what 
		you should be doing.&nbsp; Clearly, at the outset of any task, you 
		should do a bit of check monitoring but what next?</p>
		<h4>Decide what kind of task it is:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Are you interested in the product?<br />
			Do the learners need to 
			get the task right before you can go on?<br />
			Yes to both questions:<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Is the task in the learners' ZPD?<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>Yes: monitor carefully, sit <strong>with</strong> your 
					students and scaffold their efforts by helping and leading.&nbsp; 
					At the end, feedback from and to you should be thorough and 
					searching.</li>
					<li>No?&nbsp; Then ask: Can you move the task to the ZPD by 
					asking for more or helping more?<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>If you can, amend the task and start monitoring 
						closely again</li>
						<li>If you can't, change your plan now, cut the task 
						short and get on.&nbsp; Your planning was flawed.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Is this task simply one to raise awareness or get the learners 
			thinking about the topic?<br />
			Does it actually matter to the rest 
			of the lesson what they come up with?<br />
			Yes to the first question, no to the second question:<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>This is a process task:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>You can wander around, pausing briefly to overhear what 
					people are saying but you don't need to sit with the groups</li>
					<li>You need to take some notes so you can focus on what
					<strong>some</strong> people came up with.&nbsp; There's no 
					need to get feedback from everyone.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Here's a kind of flow chart of this to keep on your desk in the 
		lesson.</p>
		<p>

				<td class="auto-style7">
			<h2>Improving your monitoring</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<h4>Step 1: Plan what you will be doing</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Look at all the tasks in your lesson and apply the questions.&nbsp; 
			The sort of task will determine the monitoring you do (and, 
			incidentally, how you will handle feedback).</li>
			<li>Make sure that any product task really is in the learners ZPD.</li>

		<p>There is a guide on this site to
		<a href="../../training/inservice/teaching/scaffolding_zpd.html">
		scaffolding, the ZPD and Vygotsky</a>.</p>
		<h4>Step 2: React accordingly in the lesson</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Always check monitor.</li>
			<li>Do not interfere with process tasks but know what's going on.</li>
			<li>Always sit with learners and stay longer when they are involved 
			with product tasks.&nbsp; Don't flit around.</li>

		<p>There's <a href="../gauging_progress.html">a guide to gauging progress</a> for any development process in 
		this section for some general ideas about how to gather data on your 
		classroom behaviour.<br />
		In the case of monitoring, however, you need to keep some kind of diary 
		or at least notes on the plan concerning how you monitored, what the 
		consequences were and how the lesson flow was affected (usually 
		positively, if you get it right).<br />
		It's helpful, too, if you think about how you handled feedback.&nbsp; 
		Was it matched to the task type?</p>
		<p>You could explain to the learners what you 
		are trying to achieve and get their feedback on whether they feel your 
		monitoring seems more helpful and more relevant but be aware that some 
		learners expect you always to be there to help, no matter how easy the 
		task.&nbsp; They need to take more responsibility.<br />
		Ways of getting feedback are suggested in the guide to gauging progress.</p>
