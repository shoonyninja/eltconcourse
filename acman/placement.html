			<h1>Placement</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="placement" height="207" src="../training/images/five_placement310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>In many schools, placement in class is done according to age, 
			although there may be a system of streaming within year groups.&nbsp; 
			In language-teaching institutions, however, placing students in a 
			class at the right level, following an appropriate syllabus and with 
			a suitable social profile is a rather more challenging undertaking.</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>Good tests manage to balance reliability, validity and 
			practicality but, as you will know if you have followed 
			<a href="../training/inservice/background/testing.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
			testing</a> on this site or have taken a good training course, the grail 
			of making a test which maximises the three variables is probably 
			unobtainable.<br />
			Placement testing needs to compromise to get the best results for 
			its purpose: putting learners in groups where they are challenged, 
			not overwhelmed and feel comfortable.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="valid" height="133" src="../training/images/stamp_valid200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style31">
				<h3>Validity</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Content validity</strong><br />
				Validity refers, among other things, to whether a test actually 
				tests what we think, or claim, it tests.<br />
				To maximise its validity, a placement test needs to match the 
				kinds of teaching that our institution delivers.&nbsp; For 
				example, in a school dedicated to preparing people for 
				examinations, the placement test has to measure how well the 
				learner is already able to achieve the kinds of tasks we are 
				training them to do in classes.<br />
				In a school focused on other areas, for example, preparing 
				people for study in an English-speaking institution or for the 
				workplace, the test will need to reflect those aims.<br />
				Despite the claims of those who develop placement tests for 
				commercial purposes, there is no one-size-fits-all test that 
				will be appropriate in all situations.<br />
				Nevertheless, there are commercially available tests which may 
				fit well with your institution's aims and approaches and which 
				are affordable and can be easily administered.&nbsp; Some will 
				even come with an on-line marking system to give you instant 
				results.&nbsp; If an off-the-peg test is what you need, then a 
				little research will enable you to track down professionally 
				designed and attractive tests.<br />
				If that is not appropriate, you, the Academic Manager, will have 
				to select, design or develop testing materials which are valid 
				for the aims of your teaching programme.</li>
				<li><strong>Face validity</strong><br />
				This is an important criterion to consider because learners need 
				to trust the outcomes of the test and to do that it has to look 
				like a fair test and be long enough and searching enough for the 
				learner to feel that the results will be a proper measure.<br />
				You may believe, and you may be right, that you can place a 
				learner accurately in a class by chatting to them for five 
				minutes or assessing their writing of a 100-word application.<br />
				Most learners will not see that as a valid test and will not 
				trust its outcomes.<br />
				If, later, they feel that they have been misplaced, the feeling 
				will be intensified by the thought that they were not properly 
				assessed in the first place.</li>
			</ol>

				<h3>Reliability</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Just as important is the knowledge that the test will produce 
			comparable results whoever takes the test, whoever marks it and 
			where it is taken.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>The environment</strong><br />
				Few schools have the luxury of setting aside a space where only 
				placement testing occurs so the physical conditions are 
				standard and unchanging.<br />
				Nevertheless, you need to give some thought to whether a test 
				completed by someone sitting in a noisy corridor with the test 
				balanced on one knee and another person taking the test in a 
				quiet office at a desk with a proper chair will be comparable in 
				terms of reflecting the test-takers' ability.<br />
				Care needs to be taken to neutralise variability in the 
				environment.</li>
				<li><strong>The marker<br />
				</strong>The more objectively marked the test is, the less 
				subject the results will be to marker variability.&nbsp; Many 
				placement tests include assessment of learners' oral 
				ability and this is often accomplished through an interview.<br />
				Even if the same person conducts the tests, variability can 
				creep in if the procedure isn't carefully scripted and 
				consistent each time it is carried out.</li>
				<li><strong>The test takers</strong><br />
				Some people prefer to work slowly and methodically through a 
				test without making guesses.&nbsp; Others are more willing to 
				take risks and have a stab at the right answer even if they 
				don't know.<br />
				In the first case, someone who completes, say, only half a 
				multiple-choice test but scores 40% overall may be at a higher 
				level than someone who has completed the whole test and gets the 
				same score because the second person might get 25% of the 
				answers right by guessing from the four possibilities in each 
				question.</li>
			</ol>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="practical" height="133" src="../training/images/nut_bolt200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style31">
				<h3>Practicality</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>This is the final important area.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In large organisations where many prospective new students 
				have to be tested and placed quickly (for example, at the 
				beginning of terms or in summer-school environments), 
				practicality is possible the most important criterion.&nbsp; 
				There is little point in administering a test if it takes so 
				long to mark, rank the results and interpret them that a day has 
				slipped by before you are ready start teaching.</li>
				<li>At other times, you may have the luxury of only having one 
				or two tests to mark and assess with the students' classes not 
				starting imminently so time pressures are eased.</li>
				<li>However, if a test is to perform both functions, as a mass 
				testing system and for the odd individual, it is the former 
				function which will take precedence.&nbsp; For the sake of 
				reliability, of course, you should not have two tests serving 
				these two functions because outcomes will very probably not be 
				comparable.</li>
				<li>Whether a test is a computer-based or a pen-and-paper 
				exercise is also a question of practicality.&nbsp; 
				Computer-based tests are eminently practical if you want very 
				quick results.&nbsp; Pen-and-paper tests require some manual 
				marking, usually, and that is time consuming.&nbsp; There is 
				also the possibility of errors creeping into the marking 
				process.<br />
				If you need to test 50 learners at the same time, a 
				computer-based test will require 50 terminals.&nbsp; If you 
				don't have that kind of facility, then a pen-and-paper test is 
				your only viable option.</li>
				<li>Getting learners to complete on-line tests before they 
				arrive at your institution's door is a popular and eminently 
				practical option in some settings but reliability is severely 
				compromised because you have no control at all over the 
				conditions.</li>
				<li>A final constraint on practicality is oral testing because, 
				by its nature, it is at best a one-to-two setting and no one 
				person can possibly carry out a test for 100 learners in a day.&nbsp; 
				Having multiple assessors impacts negatively on reliability unless test 
				design, training and supervision are very efficient indeed.&nbsp; 
				That is not insuperable.</li>

			<p>It is noted above that what you test will reflect the aims of 
			your teaching programme.&nbsp; If you are only teaching people to 
			take part in business meetings, then the ability to do so is what 
			you will test.<br />
			If, however, your concern is more with General English or the core 
			grammatical, functional and lexical aspects of the language, then a 
			much more general test is called for.<br />
			The first trap to avoid is only testing grammar.<br />
			In many settings around the world, multiple-choice grammar tests are 
			commonplace in classrooms and outside them.&nbsp; Learners from 
			backgrounds like these may perform well in such tests but have a 
			poor vocabulary and little idea of communicative functions.&nbsp; 
			They may also be good at <strong>recognising</strong> grammar, but 
			less able to <strong>use</strong> it.<br />
			Lexis and appropriacy are also easy to test via a multiple-choice 
			task format and should be mixed in to make the test as valid as 
			possible.&nbsp; Depending on your situation, you may also want to 
			test listening comprehension, spelling and a range of other skills.</p>

			<p>The answer key is at the end of the paper 
			versions.&nbsp; If you use them, please make sure that you credit 
			this site.&nbsp; If you are using the test, consider whether it 
			might be appropriate to donate the price of a cup of coffee to the 
			charity of your choice each tenth time you use the test.<br />
			Thank you.</p>
			<p>The test comes in two parts and there's a reason for that.&nbsp; 
			It was noted above that test-takers vary in their approaches so the 
			first half of the test is easier than the second part.&nbsp; Someone 
			who takes a long time to do the test but gets 80% of the first 50 
			questions right may well be at a higher level than someone who 
			rushes through and completes the test by guessing at the answers.&nbsp; 
			In a multiple-choice test like this, random answering will gain 25% 
			of the marks on offer.<br />
			For levels between A1 and B1, the first 50 questions will be a 
			reliable guide.&nbsp; Above that level, you'll need to take the 
			score from Part 2 into account.<br />
			Here's a scoring guide based on the Common European Framework levels 
			which start at A1 (the lowest level) and go up through A2, B1, B2, 
			C1 and C2 (the highest level).</p>

				<h3>Testing oral skills</h3>

			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In addition to a pen-and-paper test of lexis, grammar and so on, 
			you probably want to gauge learners' oral / aural skills.&nbsp; A simple way to 
			do this is by talking to them, of course, but you need to be a bit 
			more careful than just having a chat.</p>
			<p>The approach taken here is to have a scripted conversation which 
			is standard for all interviews.&nbsp; This way, even if you have 
			multiple interviewers, there is some chance of being able to 
			standardise the marking and placement procedure.<br />
			It works like this for interviews in pairs but if you are 
			interviewing one to one, you'll need to make small adjustments.<br />
			The age of the interviewee will also need to be taken into account 
			when selecting which questions to ask.</p>
			<p>Interviews should not simply be question-and-answer sessions but 
			should allow the students to demonstrate their oral communicative 
			ability so don’t be afraid to ask more open-ended, follow-up 
			questions, and with students of B1 / B2 ability and above, ask them 
			to question their partner.<br />
			Remember: <strong>you are not judging formal grammatical accuracy 
			but the ability to understand and be understood.</strong><br />
			<br />
			Level descriptors for listening and speaking ability are taken from 
			the Common European Framework. They are:</p>

			<p>The whole purpose of placement testing is, naturally, to give you 
			the data from which you can build groups of learners or place

			In an ideal world, groups would have a comfortable mix of sexes,

			In most settings, you should expect the results of testing lots of

			Typically, it will look something like this:<br />

			Which means with large numbers of learners that you will be able to 
			build classes with parallel levels in the centre of the range and 
			then you can, and should, take the mix of other, non-language 
			factors into account.</p>
