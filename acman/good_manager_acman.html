		<h1>What makes a good Academic Manager?</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="good" src="../training/images/fairy_tale310.jpg" /></p>
			<p>If you aspire to being an Academic Manager or have recently been 
			promoted to the position, this has to be your first question.<br />
			Unfortunately, there's no right answer.<br />
			In some settings such as small departments and schools, the ability 
			to work with people and support their efforts will be an essential 
			part of being a good manager.&nbsp; In other, larger, institutions, 
			organisational skills and the ability to handle budgets and liaise 
			with a wide range of partner institutions will be at more of a 
			premium.<br />
			What the job involves and, therefore, the answer to our question 
			will vary with the setting.</p>
			<p>Unless you have been suddenly parachuted into a management role 
			with no previous ELT experience, you will have worked with a range 
			of Academic Managers before becoming one yourself.&nbsp; It is a 
			useful exercise to write down what skills and abilities the best of 
			these people have demonstrated to you.&nbsp; You may like to try 
			answering these questions:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>what are the three most important characteristics of a good 
				Academic Manager?</li>
				<li>what do I most admire about a good Academic Manager I have 
				worked with?</li>
				<li>what will I bring to the job?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As a beginning, here are a few answers.&nbsp; Good Academic 
			Managers:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>know their role</li>
				<li>plan effectively but don't constantly interfere</li>
				<li>communicate</li>
				<li>are available</li>
				<li>are reactive and proactive</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We can take these one at a time to see how you measure up.</p>

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Know your role</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>If your first reaction to that heading is, "<em>Well, I know my 
			role.&nbsp; I'm the Academic Manager.</em>" then you are confusing 
			the map with the territory.&nbsp; Your job title describes your job, not 
			your role <strong>in</strong> the job.&nbsp; Simply saying that your 
			role is your job title is akin to saying that John Wayne is an actor 
			in this film.&nbsp; Yes, Yes.&nbsp; But what's his <strong>role</strong>?<br />
			Academic managers are called on to take on many roles and you should 
			know what they are so you can select behaviours appropriate to them:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Colleague</dt>
				<dd>This is the role you take on when you are talking to 
				teachers about teaching and learning or about students and their 
				issues.&nbsp; It is something you do frequently and the role 
				carries no especial power or authority.&nbsp; Teachers are more 
				expert concerning their own classes and learners than you are so 
				seek to understand before you seek to be understood.<br />
				This means listening with respect and thoughtfulness and 
				suggesting rather than demanding.</dd>
				<dt>Boss</dt>
				<dd>This is the role in which you do demand some respect from 
				others and are in authority over them.&nbsp; If you have 
				recently been promoted from the teaching team, it's often the 
				most difficult role to play convincingly.&nbsp; However, you 
				won't get respect if you command and don't explain.&nbsp; You 
				may have many good reasons for wanting something done in a 
				particular way.&nbsp; If you have, explain the reasoning clearly 
				and honestly.&nbsp; If you can't do that, perhaps you are wrong 
				in wanting something done this way at all.</dd>
				<dt>Representative</dt>
				<dd>In almost all institutions, there is a tension between 
				controlling costs and ensuring quality.&nbsp; Raising standards 
				nearly always costs money or time (much the same thing in some 
				philosophies).<br />
				You are the Academic not Financial Manager so never be afraid to 
				argue your corner.&nbsp; You need, of course, to be aware of the 
				cost and material pressures that other managers have to respond 
				to but your concerns are academic.&nbsp; You need to be armed 
				with reasons why you want to increase training, raise teaching 
				salaries or cut teaching hours because other managers do not 
				have your expertise and insider information.<br />
				Explain, don't reject or complain.&nbsp; You may not get your 
				way but life is like that.&nbsp; You will never get your way if 
				you don't try.</dd>
				<dt>Assessor</dt>
				<dd>In this role you are probably doing one of two things: 
				observing teachers or employing teachers.<br />
				Observation, to which there is a separate guide in this section, 
				requires you to be respectful, knowledgeable, authoritative and 
				constructive.<br />
				Employing teachers requires you to be searching, demanding, 
				informative and judgmental.&nbsp; There is a separate guide to 
				interviewing in this section, too.</dd>
				<dt>Carer</dt>
				<dd>Without slipping into the nanny role, you need to be aware 
				that pastoral care and what are called hygiene factors are also 
				within your remit.&nbsp; Teaching is a stressful occupation, 
				done properly, and teachers need moral support as well as 
				material and training support.&nbsp; Listening is the first step 
				but the second step is acting.&nbsp; If someone is stressed and 
				unhappy, is there anything you can do to make life easier?<br />
				The environment in which teachers work is critical to them but 
				often overlooked by management that is not primarily concerned 
				with academic matters.&nbsp; You are, so you can make sure that 
				you do everything in your power to make teachers' lives more 
				comfortable, better organised and productive.&nbsp; This can 
				involve everything from ensuring the staff room is not a slum 
				(by cleaning it up now and then) to major equipment or new 
				materials investment or something as simple as a well-stocked 
				stationery cupboard.&nbsp; Go to the teachers' room now, look 
				around and find three things you can improve for no or minimal 
				cost.</dd>
				<dt>Disciplinarian</dt>
				<dd>If your institution deals with younger learners, this may be 
				an issue (and even in adult-only environments, it's not 
				unknown).&nbsp; Usually, you don't get involved until the 
				teachers have run out of options but you may if you feel they 
				are being too lax.<br />
				In this role, you are not the student's friend, you are the 
				manager.&nbsp; Your job is to support the teachers, not the 
				students and especially not if a student is degrading other 
				students' learning experience.<br />
				You need to be fair, firm and stern.&nbsp; Don't make empty 
				threats and don't shout.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; Here's a possible 
				response procedure for behavioural discipline:<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
					<li class="smallgreybulletlist">Personally go and take the 
					student(s) out of class and bring them to your office.&nbsp; 
					Do not try this in corridors or public places.&nbsp; You 
					want this to be official.</li>
					<li class="smallgreybulletlist">Invite a witness if possible 
					and sit them at the back of the room, out of the students' 
					eye line.&nbsp; They should remain silent throughout.</li>
					<li class="smallgreybulletlist">Get the student(s) to 
					explain why you want to talk to them (they'll know).</li>
					<li class="smallgreybulletlist">Explain what effect their 
					behaviour is having on the teachers and other students.</li>
					<li class="smallgreybulletlist">Get them to say that back to 
					you.&nbsp; You are concept checking.</li>
					<li class="smallgreybulletlist">Get the student(s) to say 
					explicitly how they will amend their behaviour.</li>
					<li class="smallgreybulletlist">Explain what the sanctions 
					are going to be if they don't.&nbsp; Do not make any empty 
					threats.</li>
					<li class="smallgreybulletlist">Agree a contract with the 
					student(s) and make it clear that the matter is now closed.</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt>Planner and checker</dt>
				<dd>This is where your organisational skills come in.<br />
				If you plan a course and the teachers' roles on that course, sit 
				back and imagine how you would feel if you were given that 
				timetable.<br />
				Look through any plan and decide at each stage what could go 
				wrong.&nbsp; Fix it now, not when it happens.&nbsp; This is 
				especially important if you are planning testing and examination 
				procedures.<br />
				If you have made changes to things like room allocations, the 
				timetable and so on, remember to manage by wandering around and 
				checking that the changes you planned have actually happened.<br />
				When you present a plan, have it on paper.&nbsp; Nobody will 
				remember anything ten minutes after a meeting, however pretty 
				and impressive your PowerPoint presentation was.</dd>
				<dt>Chair</dt>
				<dd>It is often your role to chair teachers' meetings, training 
				sessions and workshops.<br />
				If you have a meeting, have an agenda.<br />
				Have frequent meetings.<br />
				Start and finish meetings on time.&nbsp; If people come late and 
				miss something important, they will be discouraged from doing so 
				again.<br />
				Keep a record and make it public.<br />
				Take the chair role seriously because it requires some important 
				behaviours.&nbsp; Think about the following and have:<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>Ways of including quieter participants and demanding 
				participation: e.g., <em>Fred.&nbsp; 
				Do you have any thoughts on this?</em></li>
				<li>Ways of silencing the over-enthusiastic responder: e.g., <em>
				Thanks, Jane.&nbsp; Let's get some other questions now, huh?</em></li>
				<li>Ways of signalling transitions: e.g., <em>Right.&nbsp; 
				Before we go on to the reasons for all this, does anyone have anything 
				else to add?</em></li>
				<li>Ways of keeping the contributions on track: e.g., <em>We are 
				getting off the topic.&nbsp; Let's go back a bit.</em></li>
				<li>Ways of moving things on and requiring a current speaker 
				to give up the turn: e.g., <em>Right, let's move on.</em></li>
				<li>Ways of closing a topic: e.g., <em>Does anyone have anything 
				to add before we move on?</em></li>
			</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt>Thinker</dt>
				<dd>This is the role you have when there's nothing else to do.&nbsp; 
				Wander around your institution and make notes of anything that 
				could be better organised, better presented or more helpful.<br />
				Think through the teaching day and see where things could flow 
				more easily.<br />
				Listen hard and develop other people's complaints or thoughts.<br />
				Have one major improvement planned for each month in the year.</dd>
				<dt>Developer</dt>
				<dd>Get a piece of paper and write down the strengths and 
				weaknesses of all the teachers on your team.&nbsp; Look for 
				commonalities and plan a development programme which involves 
				the stronger helping the weaker (it needn't and shouldn't all come from you).<br />
				Remember that materials need developing as well as people.&nbsp; 
				Look at what you have and make a wish list.&nbsp; Be prepared to 
				explain why you want the money.</dd>
				<dt>Representative</dt>
				<dd>Depending on your institution, one of your roles may well be 
				to represent the institution at conferences, meetings with 
				sponsors, meeting with parents and so on.&nbsp; The trick here 
				is to be as thoroughly prepared as possible and exude an air of 
				professional competence.&nbsp; You may be the only point of 
				contact between important people and your institution.&nbsp; As 
				far as they are concerned, you <strong>are</strong> the 
				institution so be aware of the messages you send by how you 
				behave and how you look.&nbsp; How you dress matters, by the 
				way.</dd>

			<p>Yours is a planning and management role, not an implementation 
			role.&nbsp; Implementation is for others.<br />
			If you constantly interfere (rather than checking how things are 
			going) a number of unpleasant consequences will follow:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You will send a message that you don't trust your staff to 
				implement plans and changes effectively without constant 
				surveillance.</li>
				<li>You will make the process of implementing plans more 
				difficult because people will be constantly looking over their 
				shoulders to see what you are doing.</li>
				<li>You will unsettle anyone of a slightly nervous or 
				unconfident disposition.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Instead:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Make careful plans and don't try to implement them until 
				they have been discussed and assessed.</li>
				<li>Carry people with you.&nbsp; Explain and justify plans.</li>

					<h2>Communicate</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Obviously, you need to communicate.&nbsp; How you communicate 
			matters.&nbsp; There are some pitfalls:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Communication by memo:<br />
				By all means use written communication, especially for 
				complicated ideas but as support for talking to people, not a 
				replacement.&nbsp; Talk first, write afterwards.<br />
				Sticking notes in people's pigeon holes and hoping they will 
				read them is a recipe for <strong>non</strong>-communication not 
				a <strong>form</strong> of communication.&nbsp; It makes you 
				seem distant and overly authoritarian.</li>
				<li>Asking too much, too often:<br />
				You are the manager so you should 
				only be communicating ideas to people that are properly worked 
				out, at least in outline.&nbsp; Asking questions such as<ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li><em>Do you think the timetable's OK?</em></li>
					<li><em>Is there anything we need to do?</em></li>
					<li>
					<em>What do you think we should do?<br />
					</em>Will often produce the response:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How should I know?&nbsp; You are the Academic Manager so you 
			decide and then I'll comment on your decision if you ask me.<br />
					</em>Communication is not a substitute for managing things, 
					it is part of managing things.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Being divisive:<br />
				All of us have best friends, even managers.&nbsp; Be very 
				careful, however, that what you communicate is communicated to 
				everyone it affects.<br />
				One of the commonest causes of complaint from teachers is that 
				changes are made which affect them without their having had the 
				chance to be part of the decision-making process.&nbsp; You may 
				have agreed with a student, her group representative, her 
				sponsors or parents or whatever that she should change classes 
				but do not do anything until you have spoken to the expert: her 
				teacher.&nbsp; Nobody likes surprises and paranoia is part of 
				most teachers' make-ups.&nbsp; If you do things that affect 
				others without seeking their views (even if you ignore them or 
				overrule them), you will set up questions in them concerning 
				their competence or popularity that you don't need.<br />
				You may also have decided that the materials need reorganising 
				and you have a very good way to do it.&nbsp; OK, now make a 
				really clear plan of what you intend, call a meeting and see 
				what people think.&nbsp; Do not move everything around.<br />
				Communication means involving not just telling.</li>
			</ol>

					<h2>Be available</h2>
					<p>This is how your workspace should look &ndash; empty</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>If you are a new Academic Manager, you will be delighted to have 
			your own workspace.&nbsp; You may even have an office with a door.<br />
			You should not be in your office or workspace if there is any chance 
			that one of your teaching team might need to talk to you.&nbsp; Not 
			everyone feels happy knocking on doors.&nbsp; Of course, you need 
			somewhere private to talk to people but bring them to the space, do 
			not expect them to appear.<br />
			Here are just a few reasons why you should be with people rather 
			than waiting for them to come to you:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>If you are in the teachers' room, the caf&eacute; or the canteen 
				when your team are there too, people will talk to you.&nbsp; 
				Someone may have something to say that seems too trivial to go 
				knocking on office doors but may not be trivial at all.&nbsp; 
				How important it is, is often a question you are in a better 
				position to answer.</li>
				<li>If you are with people, you can watch them.&nbsp; If you are 
				not, you may miss early signs of stress and distress.&nbsp; You 
				may miss out, too, on how relationships between team members are 
				working and whether your decision to ask John and Peter to share 
				a timetable was actually a very wise one.</li>
				<li>People may not ask you things or bring you their troubles 
				but the simple fact that you are available to talk, and <strong>obviously</strong> 
				so, is often enough for them to get on and solve their own 
				issues.</li>
				<li>You are making it clear that the teaching team comes first.&nbsp; 
				Your desk may be piled high with things that have to be done 
				yesterday but you can ignore it for 30 minutes or so with the 
				earth ceasing to turn on its axis.</li>
				<li>You can find out how things are going, especially if you know 
				there is an issue somewhere.&nbsp; Asking people to come to your 
				office to discuss something makes it a federal case.&nbsp; Just 
				chatting over coffee can be much more effective and a lot less 
				threatening.&nbsp; There may be a problem that needs to be 
				discussed in depth and in private but assuming that all issues 
				are of this magnitude is poor management.</li>

				</table>
			<p>A good way to solve a problem is to step in quickly with wise and 
			decisive action.&nbsp; A better and far less stressful way for all 
			concerned is not to have a problem.<br />
			It is easy enough to know when you need to react, although reacting 
			wisely is another matter.&nbsp; It is less easy to prevent problems 
			arising.&nbsp; Here are some ideas:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>On Friday afternoon (or whenever the working week is almost 
				finished where you are), sit somewhere comfortable where you 
				won't be disturbed.<br />
				Now visualise how next week is going to pan out.&nbsp; Do you 
				have new arrivals, tests, an examination to organise, a teacher 
				on holiday etc.?<br />
				Write down all the things that could go wrong and, instead of 
				thinking about what you will do if they do, make a plan now for 
				how to stop them arising.<br />
				For example, you have a public examination next Wednesday and 
				people could a) make too much noise in the corridor or b) forget 
				to bring their ID papers.&nbsp; You may also have a visit from 
				the accrediting body or need to find an invigilator if yours 
				goes sick.<br />
				Right now, make and implement a plan to keep noise down.&nbsp; 
				Arrange for someone to be outside the room to remind people to 
				be quiet, put up loud notices, make sure every candidate gets a 
				note reminding them about ID papers and the awful consequences 
				of forgetting them, phone your second-choice invigilator and 
				make sure they will be available at short notice.<br />
				Relax and think of the next thing that could go wrong.<br />
				When you are done, you should have more than a list of possible 
				problems; you should have a ticked list of all the problems you 
				have pre-empted.</li>
				<li>If you took the advice above about being with your teachers 
				whenever you can and not sequestering yourself in an office 
				somewhere, you will already be alert to the need to watch people 
				and observe their behaviours.&nbsp; Inexperienced teachers (and 
				not only them) can become stressed quite quickly so you need to 
				be alert to the signs of potential breakdown.&nbsp; It is better 
				to act now, by, say, reducing their hours or providing 
				more support than to wait for the telephone call telling you 
				they aren't coming any longer.<br />
				Here are four signs to look out for.&nbsp; Any of these requires 
				action from you now or you will have a problem sooner or later 
				that you could have prevented by timely intervention:<ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li>staying in the teachers' room and preparing during 
					breaks and for a long time after lessons</li>
					<li>being withdrawn and non-contributory at meetings</li>
					<li>looking harassed</li>
					<li>standing and clock watching rather than relaxing and 
					waiting for time to go to class</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Investigate mysteries.<br />
				For example:<ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li>A normally bubbly and enthusiastic teacher has become 
					silent and withdrawn.<br />
					You need to find out what the issue is and the best way to 
					do that is to find somewhere non-official but private to 
					have a chat.&nbsp; Explain your concerns and <strong>listen</strong>.&nbsp; 
					Try to be more than sympathetic.&nbsp; It may be that simple 
					action from you can alleviate whatever is troubling the 
					teacher.&nbsp; Just showing that you are aware and care may 
					be enough.</li>
					<li>None or only a few of your teachers has put up a weekly 
					work plan in the teachers' room.<br />
					This could well be your fault for failing either to make it 
					clear that it is required of them or what its purposes are 
					(so people haven't taken it seriously).&nbsp; It isn't a problem 
					yet but it is something of a mystery.<br />
					At your next meeting rectify the omission.&nbsp; Don't insist 
					that things are put right instantly and don't blame anyone.&nbsp; 
					You are asking for cooperation, not laying down the law.&nbsp; 
					Whatever you, do, don't issue a memo.&nbsp; Make a note of what 
					was said in the normal way.</li>
					<li>A teacher has told you, because you invited her to, that 
					one of her students is sullen, disconnected and disruptive.<br />
					Before you play disciplinarian, you need to get some data to 
					work with.<br />
					Has he always been like this or it is a sudden change in 
					character?<br />
					Have you recently changed the make-up of the group?<br />
					Does anyone else know the student well enough to give you 
					some background?<br />
					Once you have a few bits of data, try to encounter the 
					student before or after lessons and explain what's been said 
					to you.<br />
					Find out what his problem is before you act.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Think proactively.<br />
				Don't wait for complaints and moans.&nbsp; Do something now.&nbsp; 
				This is part of your thinking role.&nbsp; Here's what to think 
				about:<ul>
					<li class="greybulletlist">After classes have finished for the day, or before they 
				begin, take the time to wander the empty corridors and 
				classrooms.&nbsp; You are looking for anything that is looking 
				tired or old: notices, furniture, walls, equipment.&nbsp; 
				Anything at all.&nbsp; Make a list of improvements.&nbsp; It 
				doesn't matter, at this stage, how much improvement will cost.</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Now do the same in the teachers' room.&nbsp; What's missing?&nbsp; 
				What could be better?&nbsp; What do we need more of?&nbsp; Would 
				a new teacher be able to find everything?&nbsp; Ignore costs &ndash; 
					you are writing a wish list.</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Now go back to your office / 
					workspace and make a list of all the things that are in your 
					control.&nbsp; This will include timetables, systems for 
					placement, tests, the syllabus, course plans, record keeping 
					systems and much more.<br />Against every item on the list put a score against it out of 
					10 showing how perfect you think it is.<br />Now think of how to make everything that scores below 9 
					better.&nbsp; Ignore costs &ndash; this is wish list.</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Now take your three lists and 
					divide them into those improvement that cost nothing, those 
					that cost a little and those that will be expensive.</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Implement changes that cost 
					nothing and make things better but make sure you involve 
					people whose lives may be adversely affected.&nbsp; Make one 
					change a week until the list is exhausted.&nbsp; Then make a 
					new list.</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Now prioritise the items for 
					which an improvement has a cost implication.&nbsp; Look at 
					the top two items on each list and come up with a good 
					argument why the institution should invest here.</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist"><span class="greybulletlist">Ask for a meeting with 
					whomever holds the purse strings and makes financial 
					decisions.<br />Start with the most expensive ideas and work your way down.&nbsp; 
					You won't get everything you want (probably) but it's a long 
					list and you are patient.<br />If management agree to one cheap idea a week and one 
					expensive idea every six months, you are well on the way to 
					making things better and being a very good Academic Manager.</span></li>
