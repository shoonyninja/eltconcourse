			<p>Here's what an anonymous institution says about this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">In [institution name] observations by your 
			line manager are supportive and constructive and are not part of an 
			assessment process.<br />
			The results of any observations will, however, be kept on file.</p>
			<p>Nobody will be fooled by that for a second.<br />
			All observations in institutions undertaken by people in senior 
			positions will contain an element of assessment.&nbsp; It cannot be 
			otherwise in the real world.<br />
			The trick, if there is one, is to separate support from assessment 
			while maintaining honesty and transparency.</p>

			<p>It may be the case that you are an experienced and qualified 
			teacher trainer used to working on in-service (not initial) training 
			courses.&nbsp; In that case, you probably don't need this guide but 
			you may find it interesting to compare prejudices.<br />
			Most Academic Managers around the world do not fall into 
			this category so need to tread carefully.<br />
			Assessing teaching is a complex and difficult area and not centrally the topic 
			of this guide (although it will be considered).<br />
			Advising and supporting teachers is far less so.<br />
			If you are not and never have been a teacher trainer by trade, you 
			may like to take the course on this site intended to convert master 
			teachers into good teacher trainers.<br />

					<h2>Tailor-make observations</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>People are different, have different levels of experience and 
			expertise and different expectations.&nbsp; We need to tailor the 
			types of observations we conduct to take account of these 
			differences.<br />
			Crudely, we can 
			reduce the types of teachers that most schools employ to three 
			sorts.&nbsp; Obviously, this is pigeon-holing people and there is a 
			cline from one end of the spectrum to the other.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="inexperienced" height="90" src="../training/imagesgraphics/inexperienced.png" width="200" /><br />These are usually teachers who have recently completed an 
				initial training course such as the Cambridge CELTA or the 
				Trinity Certificate in TESOL.&nbsp; They come to you armed with 
				their new certificates and probably quite a lot of enthusiasm 
				and not a little nervousness.&nbsp; Observation for these people is guidance 
				but there will be a large element of assessment.&nbsp; This sort 
				of teacher expects that because they are new to you and the 
				institution.</p>
			<ol class="greybulletlist">
				<li>you need to be something of a generalist because neither 
					you nor they know now what they are best at and where they 
					need advice.</li>
				<li>you need to look at their classroom tactics and gently 
					suggest alternatives to any they are using which you think 
					could either be done better another way or are inappropriate 
					to your setting.</li>
				<li>you need particularly to look for things like 
					thoroughness in practice and presentation because typically 
					teachers like this burn through materials too quickly and 
					don't properly exploit what they have.</li>
				<li>you need to limit your ambitions.&nbsp; Most teachers at 
					is level can take on board and act on a maximum of three 
					ideas and bits of advice per observation.&nbsp; Do not give 
					them long lists because that will de-focus, confuse and 
					depress them.</li>
				<li>you need, in feedback, to be absolutely clear and not 
					hedge with too many comments on what <em>could</em> have 
					been done.&nbsp; If you mean <span class="style_black"><em>A 
					better way to do this is ...</em></span> or,
					<span class="style_black"><em>This is what you should have 
					done</em></span>, then say so.</li>
				<li>teachers like this, if you are employing the right ones, 
					welcome positive, constructive feedback and are confused by 
					the presentation of alternatives.</li>
				<li>you need to consider carefully what they are capable of 
					doing.&nbsp; You may be able to carry out complex and 
					sophisticated classroom procedures using multiple media 
					inputs but, before you suggest they do so, ask yourself 
					whether they have the experience and aplomb to carry it off 
					successfully.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			<img alt="moderate" height="90" src="../training/imagesgraphics/moderately_experienced.png" width="200" /><br />These are usually teachers with a few years' experience who are 
				still learning but can do most things in the classroom 
				efficiently and automatically.&nbsp; They don't need, for 
				example, to think about how to elicit, how to drill and how to 
				set up activities.&nbsp; There will be little by way of 
				assessment of these teachers because, presumably, they have 
				worked with you for some time and have not been found wanting.&nbsp; 
				They need focus and some advice concerning what they need to 
				learn before they go on to further training at diploma level or 
				above.</p>
			<ol class="greybulletlist">
				<li>before any observation, discuss with them where they 
					feel their weaknesses are in the classroom and then set up 
					an observation that focuses on what they need to improve.&nbsp; 
					Most teachers in this category can identify a range of 
					issues.&nbsp; If they can't, nudge them.</li>
				<li>don't be tempted, in feedback, to take on the assessment 
					role.&nbsp; Focus on the data you have gathered and discuss 
					them together, seeking a way forward to improvement.</li>
				<li>set up another observation focused on the same area to 
					note any changes in behaviour.&nbsp; This way, your 
					observations become part of a development programme.</li>
				<li>see below for some focusing ideas.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			<img alt="experienced" height="90" src="../training/imagesgraphics/experienced.png" width="200" /><br />These teachers have probably been working with you for some time 
				and have worked in a range of other settings.&nbsp; They may be 
				diploma-level qualified and are serene and comfortable in what 
				they do.&nbsp; Because of this, they may resent any hint of 
				assessment or advice giving by you.&nbsp; People vary and some 
				will be very open to both, of course.&nbsp; In that case, you 
				can proceed as for the previous group and focus your observation 
				on something the teacher wants to find out and needs an 
				observer, who is not otherwise employed in the classroom, to be 
				a data gatherer.&nbsp; If not:</p>
			<ol class="greybulletlist">
				<li>look for excellence.&nbsp; Many teachers in this 
					category have become specialists at some forms of classroom 
					behaviour.&nbsp; It may be anything from crisp instruction 
					giving to the use of poetry.&nbsp; Whatever it is, try to 
					identify it and use this expertise in the rest of your 
					in-house development programme.</li>
				<li>be alert for negative habits that the teacher may be 
					unaware of.&nbsp; After a few years of doing something that 
					seems to 'work' (however that nebulous concept is defined), 
					some classroom habits can become ingrained.&nbsp; Look for 
					these and mention them, interspersed with positive comments 
					in your feedback.&nbsp; Secretly, the teacher may well be 
					grateful that you have pointed out that they consistently 
					overpraise, talk facing the board or use <em>OK, um</em> as 
					a filler.</li>
				<li>feedback will be much more even in this case.&nbsp; The 
					teacher will know where the high and low points of the 
					lesson were so you are in listening mode.&nbsp; You want the 
					teacher to reflect.</li>
				<li>find your point(s) of excellence and ask whether the 
					teacher may be prepared to lead a short workshop for the 
					whole teaching team on the subject.&nbsp; Even if the idea 
					is rejected, the teacher will be covertly pleased that you 
					asked.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Depending on the make-up of your team, you may need to refine 
			this rather crude categorisation.&nbsp; That's part of the job.<br />
			You may also need to match the observation type you employ to the 
			characteristics of the teacher and your, or your institution's, 
			purposes for the observation programme.&nbsp; Read on.</p>

			<p>You may like to select one or a combination of more than one type

			</table>
			<p>There is no profession-wide definition of best 
			practice.&nbsp; There is, in fact, no academic consensus concerning 
			how people learn languages and how best they should be taught them.</p>
			<p>Novice (and not so novice) teachers continually seek out 
			novel and interesting ways to do things the wrong way simply because 
			there are more ways of doing something wrong than doing it right.&nbsp; 
			However, there is more than one way to be effective, even if what is 
			done runs counter to our own prejudices or preferred understanding 
			of good practice.<br />
			Teacher observers need, accordingly, to 
			leave any preconceptions at the classroom door and try to judge 
			whether what is happening is achieving its ends.&nbsp; For those inclined 
			to see things that way, this is what is meant by “first cast out the 
			beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast 
			out the mote out of thy brother's eye” (Matthew 7, 5, King James 
			Version).</p>
			<p>There should, therefore, be no presumption of a monopoly of 
			knowledge concerning how things should rather than can be done.&nbsp; 
			There is not a scrap of evidence to support quite a lot of received 
			wisdom in the field and we should acknowledge that.&nbsp; This 
			includes, for example, the efficacy of drilling, delayed correction, 
			inductive learning and much else.</p>
			<p>It is true that novice teachers need clear guidance rather than 
			being told somewhat vaguely what they could (=should?) have done but 
			that should not be at the expense of making assertions concerning 
			the efficacy of one approach over another.&nbsp; Setting out advice 
			and feedback in the form of imperatives – do this, do not do that – 
			reinforces the air of omniscience.&nbsp; There are times when it is 
			fully appropriate to tell novice teachers not to do something (e.g., 
			give instructions vaguely and after the task has been distributed) 
			but there are other times when advice needs to be far less 
			dogmatically expressed.</p>

		<p>
		There are lots of ways to use charts when observing teaching.&nbsp; 
		Charts allow a quick way to record data, can be very informative and can 
		later be used to compare the different ways different teachers deal with things like 
		apportioning time, gaining and maintaining attention and groupings.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		If you want to measure the amount of teacher <em>vs</em>. learner talk and map it 
		against your estimation of energy levels in the classroom, you could use 
		something like this:<br />
		Start with a blank chart and three coloured 
		pens to play with while the lesson progresses.&nbsp; You can also use a set of blank circles and make pie charts if that's 
		easier.&nbsp; Clearly, you can vary the parameters to suit what the 
		teacher wants 
		to be the focus.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="chart" height="215" src="../training/imagesgraphics/observation_bar_chart.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>Then, 
			in feedback, you and the teacher can compare what they perceived to 
			be happening with what you recorded and spot the differences.</p>
		<p>A reasonably simple alternative type of chart is something like this 
		which is intended to focus on error correction and instruction checking 
		but could be used for all sorts of other purposes such as concept 
		checking, nomination of learners and so on.&nbsp; You place a bar on the line where you believe it should go and then, later, 
		discuss the findings with your teacher.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="task" src="../training/imagesgraphics/observation_areas_task.png" height="303" width="465" /></p>
		<p>
		For time apportioning, an effective chart type is the pie chart which 
		may look something like this:</p>
		<img alt="pie" height="197" src="../training/imagesgraphics/observation_time_pie_chart.png" width="465" /><br />
		Again, a comparison with the teacher's planned timing can be informative especially if you find wide 
		variations.<br />
		<br />
		Interaction&nbsp;patterns are also candidates for graphical 
		representation.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		<img alt="interaction" height="270" src="../training/imagesgraphics/observation_interaction_chart_cutdown.jpg" width="465" />
		<p>This sort of chart quickly shows how equitably attention is shared 
		and who are the most forthcoming learners etc.&nbsp; It will soon become 
		messy if you try it for the whole lesson so is best reserved for plenary 
		sections of the lesson or for short snatches only.</p>

		<p>Charts and so on are mostly for information.&nbsp; Their use is a

		Some institutions have a policy of so-called drop-in observations.&nbsp; 
		The view taken here is that these are useful as a way of observing the 
		class, useless as a way of observing the teacher.<br />
		Unannounced, drop-in observations</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>are generally resented by the more experienced, because they 
				feel it is unfair not to have been allowed to prepare something 
				exciting</li>
				<li>are a source of feelings of panic and inadequacy for the less 
				experienced, because they are seen as spot checks on their 
				competence</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			They should only be used to get a general feel for a group's 
			strengths and weaknesses for the purposes of class placement.&nbsp; 
			As assessment or teacher evaluation tools, they are worse than 
			useless.</p>
			<p>
			Even in properly set up observations, you (and peer observers) need 
			to adhere to an agreed, institution-wide policy.<br />
			Here is a suggestion:</p>
			<p>
		Please remember that you are a guest in someone else's classroom.&nbsp; This means 
			being as unobtrusive as possible:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>do not distract the learners</li>
				<li>if possible sit behind the learners, out of eye contact</li>
				<li>arrive when you say you will and don't overstay your welcome</li>

			<p>This will be both oral and written, naturally.<br />
			We considered the three main categories of teacher above and how the

			background and the type of observation that was done.&nbsp; In general terms, the more experienced the teacher 
			is, the less formal and agenda-driven the meeting will be.&nbsp; This 
			also makes a meeting with an experienced and well-known member of 
			the team much less predictable so what follows applies mostly to 
			giving feedback to new and/or inexperienced teachers.</p>

				<li>Formality<br />
				This is a semi-formal occasion so make sure you sit facing the

				<li>Agenda<br />
				We all have our own way of doing this but here’s a suggested way 
				to proceed:<ol class="auto-style21">
					<li>Thank the teacher for coming and, if they are giving up 
					part of their time (i.e., they are on a break or it’s after 
					teaching hours), make very sure the teacher knows you know 
					this and appreciate it.</li>
					<li>Ask for the teacher’s view of the good and less good 
					areas of the lesson.&nbsp; Nudge them into identifying the 
					stages, if they can’t think of much and then lead them 
					through the sections of the lesson.&nbsp; Let them do the 
					talking.&nbsp; It’s not your turn yet.&nbsp; Probe a little 
					here to encourage self-appraisal (it’s a key teaching skill) 
					with questions like<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you say that?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much did it 
					matter?<br />
					</em>and so on.</li>
					<li>Now it’s your turn.<ol class="greybulletlist">
						<li>Start with the positives (there are always some) but 
						avoid the use of ‘nice’, ‘lovely’ etc. because these are 
						meaningless terms.&nbsp; Prefer words like ‘helpful’, 
						‘engaging’, ‘motivating’ etc. because those are what you 
						probably mean</li>
						<li>Now focus on your three main points – the ones you 
						want them to work on – explaining why they are important 
						and what they should (not <em>could</em>) have done.&nbsp; Make 
						this very constructive and allow them any number of <em>
						Yes, but … </em>interruptions.</li>
						<li>Sum up the three issues and make sure the teacher 
						can do the same – you are concept checking, in fact.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Broaden things out.&nbsp; Ask about the teacher’s other 
					class(es), the students giving them trouble or being 
					otherwise interesting etc.&nbsp; Get them to say if anything 
					is concerning them.&nbsp; Are you getting enough support?&nbsp; 
					Are you generally happy with the materials / classrooms?&nbsp; 
					Is there anything you need? etc.&nbsp; Make it clear their 
					views are valued but don’t make promises you can’t keep and 
					stick to academic matters.</li>

			<p>This should be properly presented, word processed and free from 
			typos and other errors.&nbsp; It is probably a document the 
			teacher will retain for a considerable time.&nbsp; They may even 
			show it to future employers.<br />
			We all write differently so these are just general points to 
			consider.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Avoid note form and obscurity.&nbsp; Don’t over hedge with<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think you could have ….<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed to me that …<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				but state things clearly, objectively and unambiguously.</li>
				<li>Avoid questions which can have no answer in a written text such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you considered …?</em></li>
				<li>State that the teacher is free to ask you any questions if 
				anything you have written is unclear.</li>
				<li>Put it in an envelope with the teacher’s name on it and make 
				sure they get it directly from you.</li>
				<li>Keep a copy for your records and, if required, for the 
				institution's records.&nbsp; The document given to the teacher, 
				the one you keep and the one that goes to the institution's 
				records should be identical.</li>
				<li>Make sure the teacher knows what happens to any records and 
				who gets to see what.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here are some examples of what to write and what not to write:<br />

			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style19" style="width: 90%">
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style20" style="width: 33%">Merely critical and unhelpful</td>
					<td class="auto-style20">Constructive and usable&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td valign="top" class="auto-style20" style="width: 33%">You need to keep a lid on the amount of 
						first language use that is going on&nbsp;</td>
					<td valign="top" class="auto-style20">There’s too much use of first language, isn’t there?&nbsp; 
						This is making your job more difficult so try, for 
						example:
						<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
							<li>Separating the three boys in the corner</li>
							<li>Taking the main culprits to one side at the 
							beginning of a break and explaining how they are 
							degrading other people’s experiences</li>
							<li>Taking a 5-minute break in the middle of a 
							lesson to allow first language use before snapping 
							back to an English-only environment</li>
					</ul>
						If these things don’t work, give the problem to me – 
						that’s what I get paid for.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style20" style="width: 33%" valign="top">
					Consider how you set up pair and group work more carefully 
					because some people didn’t know what they should be doing.</td>
					<td class="auto-style20">The first pair-work activity didn't 
					work too well, did it?<br />
					When you set up a pair- or group-work activity do four 
					things:<br />
					<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
						<li>Make sure you have everyone’s attention before you 
						start</li>
						<li>Be clear about who works with whom and get them to 
						move there before you go on</li>
						<li>Give the instruction clearly and demonstrate the 
						task if necessary</li>
						<li>Check that your instruction has been understood by 
						asking questions like …</li>
					</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style20" style="width: 33%" valign="top">
					Make your feedback suit the task – the first activity needed 
					more feedback in detail.</td>
					<td class="auto-style20">Think about the type of task you 
					are using: <em>Is the product or the process important?</em><br />
					If the product is important (like your task ZZ), do thorough 
					feedback so you know if it’s safe to move on<br />
					If the process is more important (like your task XX), then 
					monitor it so you can pick up on a few interesting ideas, 
					thank people so that it’s valued and move on.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style20" style="width: 33%" valign="top">At 
					the end of the first pair-work task, you could have taken a 
					little more feedback.</td>
					<td class="auto-style20">At the end of the first pair-work 
					task, you needed to take more feedback because:<ol class="auto-style22">
						<li>It was an important check on learning so both you 
						and the class could judge the outcomes</li>
						<li>The exercise needed to be valued and it needed to be 
						made clear what it’s purpose was</li>
