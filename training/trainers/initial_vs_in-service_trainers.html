		<h1>Initial <em>vs.</em> in-service teacher training</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="two" height="207" src="../images/animals_two_horses_different310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>There are similarities between all sorts of teacher training at 
			all levels, of course, because, after all, all forms of training 
			have the same end: to contribute to the trainees' professional 
			competence.<br />
			It is, however, a mistake to assume that in-service training is some 
			kind of super initial training or that it can be conducted in the 
			same way.&nbsp; The reverse is also true: initial training is not a 
			matter of making a selection from an in-service training course and 
			discarding the difficult parts.<br />
			In-service training is not initial training's big brother and 
			initial training is not in-service training's cut down and simplified 
			smaller sibling.</p>
			<p>In what follows, the reference will be to initial <em>vs</em>. in-service 
			training without necessarily focusing on particular qualifications.&nbsp; 
			The assumption is, however, that the reader will recognise the 
			Cambridge CELTA and Trinity's CertTESOL as the best known and most 
			widely recognised examples of the former and Cambridge Delta and 
			Trinity's Dip. TESOL of the latter.&nbsp; TKT lies 
			somewhere in between.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Initial training is premised on the fact that the majority of 
			participants have never taught or, if they have taught, have not 
			taught a language.<br />
			Trainers need to remember what it was like not to know anything 
			about the profession and that sometimes requires a bit of effort.</p>
			<p>Most initial training on short courses involves three types of 
			activities:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Demonstration</dt>
				<dd>In this, the tutor simply demonstrates the classroom 
				approach which is the focus of the session.<br />
				For example:<ul class="brownroundbullet" >
					<li>if the focus is on teaching vocabulary via a reading 
					text, the tutor can employ a section of an article or book 
					about reading and set the task of identifying some key terms 
					in the text and matching them to definitions provided on a 
					separate worksheet.</li>
					<li>if the focus is on teaching a tense structure, the tutor 
					can demonstrate by introducing the use of the tense via a 
					set of pictures and/or a timeline to explain its key 
					function.</li>
					<li>if the focus is on using Dictogloss, the simplest way is 
					clearly to do one with the trainees and then discuss with them 
					how it worked and what skills they needed to deploy to 
					complete the text.</li>
					<li>the use of teaching an unknown 
					language to the trainees near the beginning of a course to 
					demonstrate techniques such as modelling, drilling, 
					correction and so on as well as alerting them to how it 
					feels to be taught a language from scratch.&nbsp; This is an activity done on most 
					initial training courses.</li>
				</ul>
				The next step is for the trainees to deploy similar techniques 
				in a controlled setting (peer teaching or small-group 
				demonstration) before taking the plunge and using the procedure 
				with a class of learners in teaching practice session.</dd>
				<dt>Experiential learning</dt>
				<dd>This is an extension of demonstration and involves the 
				trainees in firstly experiencing a technique pretending to be 
				learners of the language and then doing it for themselves with 
				their peers.&nbsp; The theory is that the act of using 
				a technique one has seen demonstrated makes the activity more 
				memorable and engaging.</dd>
				<dt>Loop input</dt>
				<dd>This is a term first introduced by Woodward in 1986.&nbsp; 
				In her words:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loop input is a 
				specific type of experiential teacher training process that 
				involves an alignment of the process and content of learning.</em>
				</span><span class="smallfont">(Woodward, 2003:301)</span><br />
				The assumption, not without its critics, is that matching the 
				content to the process results in better learning.&nbsp; Here's 
				an example from Woodward's article:<p class="indentpara">A 
				course module on, say, the Presentation, Practice, Production, 
				or 'Three Ps' method of introducing new language to foreign 
				language students could, if run along loop input lines, have 
				three main phases. The first is where the methods and materials 
				associated with the Three Ps are elicited or taught to 
				participants via texts or talks. The second is where the 
				participants have a chance to try out the methods and materials 
				in very controlled settings, such as micro- and peer-teaching 
				practice. The third would be where they are encouraged to 
				transfer them to situations which would be of use to them in 
				their own classrooms. Towards the end of the module, if 
				participants had not noticed already, the congruity between the 
				content and the process of the module would need to be pointed 
				out by discussion.<br />
				<span class="auto-style6">(op. cit.:304)</span></p>
				The part at the end about discussion is an important one.&nbsp; 
				Woodward calls this decompression time and avers that it allows 
				for a detailed and very useful consideration of what has been 
				encountered.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>There are, naturally, many other ways in which a topic can be 
			taught on an initial training course but the key aspect of such 
			courses is that the tutor is, throughout, demonstrating what the 
			participants need to learn to do.<br />
			It is assumed, therefore, that simply lecturing people about a topic 
			presents a false model of what teaching should be in the classroom.&nbsp; 
			Efforts are accordingly made to make the process match the content.</p>
			<p>This is a process of training akin to watch-and-see.&nbsp; It is 
			also known as sitting by Nellie, a way in which industrial workers 
			were trained by being paired with an experienced and skilful 
			operative.&nbsp; It was also called exposure training incidentally 
			which neatly summarises the three facets of this sort of training 
			explained here.</p>
			<p>Here's a diagram to show what this kind of training usually 
			involves:</p>
			<p>
					<img alt="initial" height="183" src="../imagesgraphics/initial_training.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>To explain:</p>
			<ul class="brownsqbullet">
				<li>Study with the master practitioner (you, in this case) and 
				demonstration and instruction involve:<ul class="brownroundbullet">
					<li>being shown how something is done</li>
					<li>being told why it's useful and effective</li>
					<li>being told how to do it and vary it sensibly</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Practice with feedback comes in two forms:<ul class="brownroundbullet">
					<li>micro-teaching and peer-teaching with feedback from 
					peers and the tutor</li>
					<li>teaching practice with real learners and feedback from 
					tutors primarily and peers secondarily</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Professional competence emerges as a result of the repeated 
				application of the previous stages.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The issue is that this competence is based almost entirely on 
			practical application with one set of volunteer learners.&nbsp; The 
			result is often competence of a rather brittle kind: it works when 
			the teacher is faced with a familiar set of circumstances, 
			learner characteristics and aims but it may break down if the setting and 
			types of learners are very different from what has previously been 
			encountered.<br />
			That's why in-service training is important.</p>

			</table>
			<p>In-service training is different in three ways (at least):</p>
			<ul class="brownsqbullet">
				<li>Quantitatively<br />
				There is a great deal more to learn than some basic theory and 
				practical classroom techniques.</li>
				<li>Qualitatively<br />
				This is a reflective and developmental level of training usually 
				leading to a wholly portable level of qualification which will 
				prove its worth in a range of teaching environments.<br />
				The aim of in-service training is not limited competence, it is 
				generalised competence which can be demonstrated anywhere with 
				any kind of learner.</li>
				<li>Procedurally<br />
				We are beyond the stage of sitting by Nellie.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In-service training is premised on the fact that the participants have 
			already attained a reasonable level of competence in the classroom 
			and can demonstrate the ability to apply all the techniques they 
			were originally taught on an initial course, and more.<br />
			They have decided, too, that this is their chosen profession, not a 
			passing fancy, and they are committed to a process of personal and 
			professional development.<br />
			Trainers need to remember that such people are not going to be very 
			impressed by being asked to copy the trainers' behaviours and apply 
			what they are learning to teaching their peers under supervision.&nbsp; 
			These people want to take what they learn and use it to enhance 
			their own effectiveness in helping learners to learn.</p>
			<p>The form that training takes is not a matter of seeing, doing and 
			then applying but of the application of experience and theory, reflection 
			and constant improvement.&nbsp; The picture is:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="in-service" height="213" src="../imagesgraphics/in-service_training.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>To explain:</p>
			<ul class="brownsqbullet">
				<li>Received knowledge refers to:<ul class="brownroundbullet">
					<li>lectures and workshops on the course</li>
					<li>reading and research</li>
					<li>observations of other teachers</li>
					<li>input from colleagues, conferences, workshops, training 
					courses and the like</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Previous experiential knowledge refers to:<ul class="brownroundbullet">
					<li>substantial (often set at a minimum of around 1200 hours of teaching) 
					experience</li>
					<li>personal reflections on what was and was not effective</li>
					<li>the responses and success of their learners</li>
					<li>the content of an initial training course seen in the 
					light of later experience</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Both kinds of knowledge feed into the central process of 
				researching, preparing teaching and reflecting on teaching 
				evaluated by oneself or a tutor / mentor.</li>
				<li>Professional competence emerges as a result of the repeated 
				application of the central section of the whole process.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The sort of professional competence as a language teacher which 
			emerges from a process such as this is very different from that 
			which emerges from initial training.&nbsp; It is independent of 
			setting, learners' aims, learners' characteristics and the demands 
			of a syllabus.&nbsp; It is, in other words, a truly portable, 
			generic qualification (or should be).</p>

			<p>The focus so far has been on what distinguishes initial from 
			in-service training and that's logical because a failure to 
			understand the differences and act on them is often the cause of 
			much disappointing training.<br />
			There are, naturally, similarities, too.&nbsp; Both types of 
			training:</p>
			<ul class="brownsqbullet">
				<li>require a constant focus on the classroom.&nbsp; At initial 
				level, this goes almost without saying but in-service training 
				is not just a theoretical exercise (which is why many Masters' 
				degree courses do not count as teaching qualifications).&nbsp; 
				In-service training, too, requires high levels of classroom 
				expertise.&nbsp; The difference being that at in-service level, 
				people also need to know why they are doing something.</li>
				<li>need to be conducted by people who have an appropriate level of 
				mastery of both the theoretical and practical sides of their 
				profession.&nbsp; At initial level, this need be no more than 
				the holding of an in-service qualification but at in-service 
				level, a good deal more is required, of course.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, treating diploma-level training as super-certificate 
			training or certificate training as dumbed-down diploma training 
			leads to a good deal of error and confusion.&nbsp; It may mean that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>an initial training course will be too theoretical and leave 
				the participants unable to apply what they now know in the 
				classroom.<br />
				(The obverse of this coin is that an initial course which only 
				focuses on practical technique will equip the participants with 
				what they require for the immediate demands placed on them but 
				not give them the information or skills they need to develop 
				later.)</li>
				<li>an in-service course fails to demand a level of theoretical 
				understanding concomitant with the needs of participants and 
				leaves them without a firm enough basis on which to amend, 
				develop and adapt what they do.<br />
				(The obverse of this coin is that an overly heavy focus on 
				theory (of methodology, learning, language etc.) at the expense 
				of practical ability will leave trainees able to talk and write 
				about teaching more effectively and impressively than they can 
				do it.)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The problem is sometimes particularly acute when people move from 
			tutoring on initial training schemes to tutoring on in-service 
			schemes without taking the differences and the differing demands 
			into adequate account.</p>

			<p>It is something of an oddity, given the comments made here on the 
			differences which should be apparent between initial and in-service 
			training, that one form of in-service training is almost always 
			accomplished by a process of sitting by Nellie: training new 
			trainers.</p>
			<p>It is pointed out in a somewhat polemical and deliberately 
			controversial article on this site that:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Because there is no single, recognised route 
			to becoming an ELT teacher trainer, 
			[trainer training] procedures will vary but what they almost 
			always have in common is some kind of shadowing element. This 
			involves the trainer in training observing more experienced trainers 
			and being observed in turn by these more experienced colleagues who 
			attempt to shape both the content and manner of delivery of 
			training. There is, in other words, a deliberate attempt to transmit 
			content and practice ...<br />
			<span class="auto-style7">
			<a href="../../articles/articles1/ELT_Concourse_Evolution_and_decay_in_ELT_methodology_and_training.pdf" target="_blank">
			Click here to read the whole article.</a></span></p>
			<p>The context here is that as approaches to training and the 
			content of courses is passed down through generations of trainers in 
			the same or closely connected institutions and inevitably meme 
			inheritance becomes apparent.&nbsp; Errors are duplicated (with new 
			ones added as things go along), emphases are repeated and particular 
			concepts are repeatedly forefronted until eventually the institution's 
			courses become unique and no longer tied explicitly to the syllabus 
			they are attempting to follow.</p>
			<p>Some see that as a positive, of course:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Cambridge allows the individual trainers to 
			tailor the courses to suit the trainees and to be compatible with 
			the trainer’s own attitudes and beliefs about language teaching.<br />
			<span class="auto-style6">Chong, 2016</span></p>
			<p>If you substitute <span class="style_black"><em>prejudices</em></span> 
			for <span class="style_black"><em>attitudes and beliefs</em></span>, 
			you'll see the obvious danger.</p>
			<p>With effort, this kind of slow decay of the purity of training 
			can be avoided but that is best done by occasionally at least 
			interrupting the trickle-down training process by importing fresh 
			talent and new people who have been trained elsewhere.</p>
