			<h1>Introduction to skills: initial training sessions</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="introduction" height="207" src="../../images/handshake310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Most participants on an initial training course are slightly 
			surprised that teaching a language is not just about systems and 
			grammar so this set of ideas and worksheets focuses on introducing 
			people to the main ideas that lie behind the teaching of skills.</p>
			<p>It is worth saying at the outset that, although the teaching of 
			skills is enshrined in teacher training syllabuses at all levels, 
			there are those who would suggest that the deliberate and systematic 
			teaching of skills is not a good use of classroom time.&nbsp; The 
			argument, briefly, is that adult learners, and many younger ones, 
			already know how to read, write, listen and speak and what they need 
			is to transfer skills they have already mastered to learning and 
			de-coding a foreign language.<br />
			After all, English speakers are not unique in listening for gist, 
			skim reading, intensive reading, understanding their audience, using 
			appropriate styles, planning and drafting writing and so on.&nbsp; 
			Everyone does that, at varying levels of skill, in all languages.</p>
			<p>The following is somewhere to start.<br />
			Even on short courses, there will have to be some consideration of 
			the subskills involved in the four main areas.&nbsp; Longer courses may have a 
			bit more time to devote to the area and there are guides in the 
			initial plus and in-service sections of the site to help a little.&nbsp; The links come at the end.</p>

			</table>
			<p>This section does not consider each skill in turn.&nbsp; It is an attempt to 
			survey the general nature of skills and how people may be trained 
			(if trained they need to be) in comprehension and production of 
			texts of any sort.</p>

			<p>The aim of all of this is to give trainees the essential data

			to appreciate what happens when people are asked to access or 
			produce written and spoken texts).</p>

			<p>The purpose here is to get participants think a bit about the 
			four main skills and see what their main characteristics are in 
			comparison with each other.</p>
			<p>The first task is simple: to identify what skills are being used 
			in a range of situations.&nbsp; In order for people to be able to 
			talk sensibly about the task, it is a good idea to do a short 
			introductory mini-lecture explaining:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="skills" height="183" src="../../imagesgraphics/skills310.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Then you can go on to the worksheet.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Task 1:<br />
				This task concerns both productive and receptive skills.<br />
				The answers are not as straightforward as one might imagine 
			because part of the purpose of the exercise is to get people to 
			realise that we almost never use skills in isolation.<br />
			Here are some ideas:</dt>
				<dd>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>I am explaining something in the newspaper to a friend</em></span><br />
				Reading, speaking but also listening to my friend's responses to 
				see if she is attending or even interested.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>I am writing an email applying for a job</em></span><br />
				Writing but also re-reading what I have written to check &ndash; this 
				is an important text.&nbsp; I may also be making frequent 
				reference to the advertisement for the job.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>I am telephoning to arrange an appointment at a hospital</em></span><br />
				Speaking and listening but it would be odd if writing down times 
				and dates (key data) is not involved.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>I am waiting for a train announcement</em></span><br />
				Listening only but listening for particular information.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Someone is explaining to me how to use a chainsaw safely</em></span><br />
				I am listening carefully – chainsaws are dangerous – and I may 
				be taking notes (writing) and asking questions (speaking).</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>I am watching a film on television (with no subtitles)</em></span><br />
				Listening but with visual clues.&nbsp; I may be talking to 
				someone else about what I'm seeing.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>I am buying a packet of biscuits in a small shop</em></span><br />
				This is a transaction so I am speaking and listening equally 
				carefully.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>I am doing this task with a colleague</em></span><br />
				Reading the task (intensively), speaking&nbsp; and listening and 
				writing the answers.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>I am researching skills materials in the teachers’ room</em></span><br />
				If I am alone, reading (skimming and sometimes reading 
				intensively) but if a colleague is present, I may be speaking 
				and listening, too, as well as reading aloud.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>I am trying to understand the 
				written instructions for a machine</em></span><br />Reading (intensively) and maybe 
				taking a few key notes (writing) or at least highlighting bits 
				of the text.<p>Take advantage if people have selected only one or two skills for 
			each section to explain how complex most of these situations are.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt>Task 2:</dt>
				<dd>This concerns receptive skills and is an attempt to alert 
				people to how the purpose of a text may influence which 
				sub-skills we apply to decoding it.&nbsp; Text purposes are 
				twofold:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The text-producer's purpose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The text accessor's purpose<br />
				and those may not coincide.<br />
				It really doesn't matter whether people agree or not but the 
				task serves as an introduction to ideas such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skimming (9 and 10)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scanning (8 and 10)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reading or listening intensively (3, 6, 7, you hope)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gist listening (4 and 5 but the latter requires more care)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extensive reading (2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monitor listening (1)<br />
				so you will need to be prepared with more examples to explain 
				the concepts.<br />
				It is a good time to note that sub-skills are also often 
				combined, for example, scanning may become intensive reading 
				when we find something of interest, casual monitor listening may 
				become intensive listening when the relevance is clear and so 
				on.</dd>
				<dt>Task 3:</dt>
				<dd>This task is a revision test on receptive skills only so you 
				need to be sure you have introduced all the terms before it is 
				tackled.<br />
				The answers are obvious.</dd>

			<p>For simplicity's sake, this guide is not separated into sections 
			concerned with receptive <em>vs</em>. productive skills and sub-skills 
			<em>vs</em>. 
			processing procedures.&nbsp; It is also quite unpredictable how your 
			course will divide up the area so you may wish to introduce 
			different worksheets at different stages and in a different order.&nbsp; 
			That's fine and should make little difference.<br />
			This part concerns receptive skills only.</p>
			<p>Before you start, here's a reminder of some important subskills 
			and text types.&nbsp; There is, as you know, no one-to-one 
			relationship between purposes for reading, text types and subskills 
			so the big picture is somewhat more complex.&nbsp; However, on an 
			initial course, complexity is worth avoiding.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Task 1</dt>
				<dd>This is a simple awareness-raising exercise.<br />
				The answer, should you need it, involves trying to understand 
				the words that are being said (a bottom-up procedure) and 
				knowing in advance what the topic is so you are listening out 
				for the content from the first word (a top-down procedure).</dd>
				<dt>Task 2</dt>
				<dd>This concerns knowledge of generic conventions (although the 
				terminology can be avoided if you like).<br />
				We know the answers to the questions because of layout and 
				conventions in the English-speaking world.&nbsp; This is not a 
				universal, of course, and different cultures handle these things 
				differently.<br />
				You may like to dwell a little on what exactly it is about the 
				layouts that provides the clues.&nbsp; Here's the right answer:<br />
				<ul id="texttypes" class="brownsqbullet" >
					<li>The first text is a newspaper 
				article:<ul class="brownroundbullet">
						<li>It has a banner headline to catch 
					the eye</li>
					<li>There is a large graphic to intrigue 
					the reader</li>
					<li>The text is divided into columns</li>
					<li>Paragraphs are short and spread out 
					to make reading easy</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The second text is a technical 
				article of some kind:<ul class="brownroundbullet">
					<li>The title comes in two parts</li>
					<li>The authors' names are at the top</li>
					<li>There is a subtitle which is 
					probably 'Abstract' or 'Summary'</li>
					<li>There's a graphic</li>
					<li>The text is dense and continuous</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The third text is a recipe:<ul class="brownroundbullet">
					<li>There's a picture of the finished 
					meal</li>
					<li>There's a list of ingredients</li>
					<li>The procedure is numbered in stages</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Important information</strong><ul class="brownroundbullet">
					<li>Text 1: the first paragraph will set 
					the scene: when, where, who?&nbsp; The final paragraph will 
					sum up the situation.&nbsp; Everything in between can be 
					ignored.</li>
					<li>Text 2: the abstract at the 
					beginning will tell you if you need to read it.&nbsp; At the 
					end there will probably be a summary of the main points and 
					that will often include suggestions for further research and 
					work.&nbsp; 
					Detail will be in the text.</li>
					<li>Text 3: the list of ingredients will 
					tell you if you have what's needed.&nbsp; All the text is 
					important because it is a set of instructions.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>By this time, the meanings of top-down and bottom-up processing 
			should have been made clear.&nbsp; How you define the terms is your 
			problem.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Task 3</dt>
				<dd>This is an identification exercise but it is worth noting 
				now that we do not use the two types of processing separately.<br />
				Some of the examples need the use of both types of processing 
				together.</dd>

			<p>The first task is to identify the essential differences between

			Exactly how people choose to phrase things is not important
