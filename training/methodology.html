			<p>A dictionary definition of methodology is
			<span class="style_black"><em>a system of methods used in a particular 
			area of study or activity</em></span></p>
			<p>This is a very brief guide.&nbsp; For more in this area, see the 
			list of related guides, linked at the end.</p>
			<p>There are two common ways to define methodology in English 
			Language Teaching and, graphically, this is how they look:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="methodology" height="371" src="imagesgraphics/methodologies.jpg" width="400" /></p>
			<p>The left-hand set was developed by Anthony in 1963.&nbsp; The 
			right-hand set was developed from Anthony's definition later and 
			appears in Richards and Rogers, 2001.&nbsp; Briefly:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Approach</strong></dt>
				<dd>For Anthony, an approach was simply a 
				set of principles or ideas about the nature of language learning.<br />
				For Richards and Rogers it was similar but explicitly divided 
				into theories of what language is and theories of how learning a 
				foreign language happens.<br />
				The second of these definitions has the advantage of being quite 
				explicit.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Method or Design</strong></dt>
				<dd>In this section are lesson designs such as 
				Present-Practice-Produce or Test-Teach-Test.&nbsp; Those are not 
				methods, they are ways of structuring lessons within methods.<br />
				For Anthony, method described the plan for the presentation 
				of language which is consistent with the approach.<br />
				Richards and Rogers' concept of design is somewhat broader and 
				covered the practical implications in the classroom: syllabus 
				design, activities and the roles of teachers and students.<br />
				These are not all that different but again, the latter one is 
				more explicit.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Technique or Procedure</strong></dt>
				<dd>Technique, for Anthony, was just any teaching trick or way 
				of doing something in the classroom such as eliciting, 
				approaching a reading text, encouraging authentic speaking, 
				drills and so on.<br />
				For Richards and Rogers, too, the term procedure refers to what 
				we see happening in the classroom when a particular approach and 
				design are implemented.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>It actually doesn't matter all that much which breakdown you 
			accept.&nbsp; Both are fairly arbitrary and subjective ways of 
			breaking down a complex area.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="practice" height="166" src="images/work250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style31">
				<h2>Methodology in practice</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>It is worth pointing out that not all methodologies will fit 
			neatly into the categories above.<br />
			For example, Communicative Language Teaching, the current dominant 
			methodology, has a good theory of language but little to say 
			concerning a theory of learning.&nbsp; Some earlier methodologies 
			such as Situational Language Teaching were similarly deficient but 
			some, audio-lingualism, for example, had very clear theories both of 
			what language actually is and how people learn languages.</p>
			<p>The extent to which, if at all, the various models and concepts 
			of language and learning actually reflect reality is, of course, 
			quite another matter.</p>
			<p>It is, however, often quite possible to work backwards from what 
			is observed in the classroom (techniques and procedures) and deduce 
			the approach a teacher favours or to work from the materials an 
			institution uses (the method or design) to see what principles (the 
			approach) the institution is favouring.&nbsp; The Delta examination, 
			e.g., explicitly asks you to do that.</p>
