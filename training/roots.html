			<p>English is an Indo-European language.&nbsp; This family of 
			languages probably originated in the area of Asia just to the north 
			and west of the Caspian Sea, between it and the Black Sea (although 
			this is a debatable issue), in what is now south Kazakhstan.&nbsp; 
			There are around 400 languages in the group, spoken in total by over 
			3 billion people.&nbsp; The 
			source of all these languages is known as Proto-Indo-European or PIE.<br />
			Here's the map of the presumed expansion of PIE from its homeland:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="PIE expansion" height="244" src="imagesgraphics/PIEexpansion.png" width="400" /><br />
			<span class="auto-style2">Source: Wikipedia</span></p>
			<p>Indo-European languages include many now spoken in the south and 
			east of that area, which include Farsi, Sanskrit (now extinct but 
			influential), 
			Hindi, Punjabi and many others, 
			but we are concerned here with the development of English so we'll focus on the western 
			groups of languages.<br />
			Here's the family tree, much simplified and with fewer examples of 
			the languages than you will find in more academic texts.&nbsp; 
			Extinct languages are not included here.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="pie" height="470" src="imagesgraphics/pie.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>We are talking here about very ancient relationships and languages grow, evolve and change.&nbsp; The origins of 
			PIE are obscure but linguistic and genetic studies are beginning to 
			converge on a date around 6000 years BCE (Before Common Era).&nbsp; 
			A lot can happen in 8000 years.</p>
			<p>As you see, there are 5 main branches of western PIE and English belongs 
			to one of them, the West Germanic group which includes Dutch, 
			Flemish and Afrikaans as well as Frisian (its closest relative).</p>
			<p>Some analyses will 
			differ in minor respects, for example, separating Greek and Albanian 
			or sub-dividing Slavic languages differently as well as including 
			Modern German as a West Germanic language, descending from the now 
			extinct Old High German.&nbsp; By that analysis, English and the 
			other West Germanic languages descend from Low German.&nbsp; Frisian 
			itself, a language spoken today by around 500,000 people, has two 
			branches: West Frisian, spoken in The Netherlands and East Frisian, 
			spoken in parts of Germany and Denmark.&nbsp; Old Frisian and Old 
			English were so closely related that their speakers were almost 
			certainly mutually comprehensible.&nbsp; That is no longer the case 
			for the modern forms of these languages.&nbsp; 
			None of this detail matters for what follows.<br />
			Another, more 
			complex and inclusive, diagram is in the guide to types of languages, 
			linked below in the list of related guides.</p>
			<p>English grammar, syntax and the lexicon bear witness to its close 
			affinity with other Germanic languages as can easily be seen from 
			the very large numbers of closely similar structures and words in the 
			languages.</p>

			<p>The country that is now England was the northernmost province of 
			the Roman Empire until around 410 CE (Common Era).&nbsp; Shortly 
			afterwards, migrations from the continent, not always peacefully 
			intended or received, began:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Angles</strong></dt>
				<dd>(from whose name the word for the language is derived) from 
				Central Denmark who settled in Northern and Eastern England</dd>
				<dt><strong>Saxons</strong></dt>
				<dd>from Northern Germany who settled in Southern England</dd>
				<dt><strong>Jutes</strong></dt>
				<dd>from Northern Denmark who settled in South-East England</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>These migrants brought with them a set of closely related and 
			highly inflected languages which formed the basis of Old English.&nbsp; 
			The first writing in a language identifiable as English dates from 
			the seventh century.</p>
			<p>By the ninth century, if not before, the original Britons, a 
			Celtic-speaking people had been pushed northwards and westwards 
			and confined to what is now Scotland, Wales and the island of Ireland.</p>
			<p>The languages spoken at that time, under the umbrella term of 
			English were related but not always mutually comprehensible.&nbsp; 
			Northumbrian (spoken in the North West of England and southern 
			Scotland and related to the language spoken in East Anglia), Mercian (widely spoken from the Welsh border eastwards to 
			the western fringe of East Anglia), West Saxon (the language of Wessex in the South and South West of England) and Kentish (spoken 
			in the South East of England) are all 
			distinguishable.<br />
			It is only by the tenth century with the writings of a 
			scholar-priest, Ælfric, that an identifiable early standard English 
			emerges.&nbsp; Even so, the majority of people travelled little and 
			continued to speak local dialects of English.</p>

			<p>The history of English, conventionally divided into three periods 
			(Old, Middle and Early Modern), is one of the gradual loss of 
			inflexion, 
			gender and case and a slow 
			transition to an uninflected and simplified structure.<br />
			In other words, the language has moved from being <strong>synthetic</strong> 
			(i.e., having lots of endings and other affixes to signal case, 
			number, person, gender and so on like Modern German, Russian, Greek, 
			French and Italian) to being <strong>analytic</strong> (i.e., having 
			few such characteristics and preferring one morpheme to represent 
			one idea).&nbsp; Here is an example to make things clear(er):</p>
			<p>In Modern German, the past form of <em>go</em> has the root <em>ging</em> 
			(from the infinitive<em> gehen</em>).&nbsp; The way to say<em> you 
			went</em> is <em>du gingst</em>.&nbsp; The -<em>st</em> ending on the verb 
			shows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It is singular</li>
				<li>It is familiar rather than polite</li>
				<li>It is in the second person</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The -<em>st</em> ending on a verb form will be familiar to anyone 
			who has read the King James Bible or Shakespeare's plays because 
			both use the ending to denote the second person singular familiar 
			form of the verb.&nbsp; Thou hast, of course read Shakespeare, hast 
			thou not?</p>
			<p>Similar things to German happen in other synthetic languages, like this, 
			e.g., for the past tense:</p>

			<p>In Modern English, by contrast to the other six language examples 
			and Old English, the past form of <em>go</em> is
			<em>went</em> and it is unchanged for all numbers and persons: <em>I 
			went, you went, she went, he went, it went, we went, they went</em>.&nbsp; 
			Here, the only change signalled by the form of the verb is tense.&nbsp; 
			Modern English is at the analytic end of the spectrum, therefore, 
			but many other Indo-European languages along with Old English are 
			clearly at the synthetic end.<br />
			(If you are wondering why the past tense of <em>go</em> is so 
			irregular, the answer is that the present form of the verb is 
			derived from the Old English <em>gan</em> (which shares the root of 
			the German <em>gehen</em>, the Dutch <em>gaan</em>, the Swedish <em>
			gå</em> and so on).<br />
			The past tense comes to us by a different root and is derived from 
			the Old English verb <em>wend</em> (as in <em>wend one's way</em>).&nbsp; 
			The past of <em>wend</em> was <em>went</em> and that became the 
			standard past-tense form of <em>go</em> with a new weak, or regular, 
			past tense for <em>wend</em> of <em>wended</em>.)</p>
			<p>Modern English is not fully analytic because it still retains some 
			inflexions such as the third-person <em>-s</em> ending for present-simple verb 
			forms (<em>she smoke</em><strong>s</strong>) and the plural
			<em>-s</em> as well as some changes in pronouns (<em>I, me, my, 
			mine, he, him, his</em> etc.).&nbsp; It is, however, much more analytic than most other Indo-European 
			languages.<br />
			Some languages, such as Mandarin, are even more analytic and usually 
			referred to as isolating languages.</p>
			<p>Similar considerations apply to determiners, nouns and adjectives because in 
			Old English there were a number of endings on articles, nouns and their 
			associated adjectives to signal number and case (often object or 
			subject case but there are other possibilities).<br />
			In Old English, for example, the mistress of a household was 
			expressed as <em>hlǣfdīġe</em> but if the word is used as the object 
			of the verb rather than the subject, it changes its ending to <em>
			hlǣfdīġan</em> to reflect the changed grammatical status.&nbsp; Like 
			Modern German, Old English had four cases for nouns: nominative (the 
			subject), accusative (the object), genitive (the possessive) and 
			dative (denoting movement to and from, usually).</p>
			<p>In the end, what this change from an inflected to a more or less 
			analytic language has done is to fix the word order in English as 
			Subject–Verb–Object without which, we cannot understand the 
			difference between:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog chased the cat</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;The cat chased the dog</em><br />
			The difference would have been clear to an Old English speaker, whatever the 
			ordering of the words, because in the first case, the word for <em>
			dog</em> would have been <em>docga</em> and in the second case (as 
			the object) it would have been <em>docgan</em>.</p>

			<p>Old English can be dated to around the 5th to the 11th centuries 
			and is almost impossible to understand for modern English speakers 
			without a good deal of study.&nbsp; It was a synthetic, highly inflected 
			language (or, as we saw above, a collection of related languages) in many ways similar to 
			Modern German with case endings, 
			complex verb declensions, gender differences, article changes and so on.&nbsp; The great adventure story of 
			Beowulf (picture) was written in Old English sometime between the 
			8th and 11th centuries.<br />
			The language was written in both runes and the Latin alphabet but 
			some of the letters were different.&nbsp; In particular, Old English

			<p>The Anglo-Saxons did not have it all their own way, of course.&nbsp; 
			From the end of the eighth century and continuing for 200 years, 
			raiders, then settlers from Scandinavia occupied virtually the whole 
			of the east and north of England with the Saxon kingdoms confined to 
			the south and west.&nbsp; Northumberland in the north, which 
			stretched into what is today Scotland, remained English.<br />
			The area under Norse control, known as The Danelaw comprised 
			virtually the whole of England from the Scottish border to London to 
			the east of a line drawn diagonally from Liverpool to London.<br />
			Very roughly the picture looked like this with the blue areas to the 
			west and north remaining Celtic speaking:<br />
			<img alt="danelaw" height="300" src="imagesgraphics/danelaw2.png" width="250" /><br />
			Norse languages, too, influenced the development of English within 
			and beyond the confines of The Danelaw with 
			hundreds of common words dating from the ninth to the eleventh 
			centuries being introduced into English.&nbsp; They include, for example, a<em>nger, bend, cake, 
			dirt, egg, fog, glove, haggle, ill, knife, loft, mistake, outlaw, 
			plough, raft, skill, Thursday, ugly</em> and <em>window</em>.<br />
			It is also the case that the same peoples and their languages 
			influenced Norman French (of which more later).</p>
			<p>Place names derived from Norse languages are common in the north 
			of England where names ending in <em>-by, -thorpe </em>and <em>-thwaite</em> 
			occur very regularly.</p>
			<p>It has also been suggested that the fact that English evolved 
			from a heavily inflected synthetic language to a much more 
			analytical one is attributable, in part at least, to the influence 
			of Old Norse.&nbsp; In particular, apart from the kinds of borrowing 
			listed above, structural words, such as pronouns, prepositions, 
			conjunctions and modal auxiliary verbs show a good deal of 
			Scandinavian influence.&nbsp; This has led some to assert that the 
			structure of Old English became simplified because of the need to 
			find a language mutually comprehensible to both the English and the 
			Norse invaders, later settlers and traders.&nbsp; On the other hand, because both Old Norse and 
			Old English shared a common Germanic ancestry, many of these 
			structural words were already very similar, often identical.<br />
			Additionally, and slightly more persuasively, Old Norse and Old 
			English shared many items in their lexicons which differed only in 
			the complex inflexions found in Old English.&nbsp; The pressure 
			within The Danelaw, at least, to simplify for the sake of easy 
			communication must have been quite strong.</p>

			<p>Even today, Celtic influences on English have been underestimated 
			or dismissed as sporadic and peripheral and there is no doubt that 
			compared, say, to the influences of Norman French, considered next, 
			the contribution of Celtic languages to Modern English is small, 
			although it is not at all negligible.</p>
			<p>Celtic languages were once dominant across most of Europe and the 
			evidence of Celtic influences is most apparent in place names.&nbsp; 
			Most of France's main cities have names which derive from Celtic 
			languages (Gaulish in most cases) and the same is true for a large 
			number of place names in Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, Spain and 
			so on across all major and many minor European states.<br />
			Many place names in The British Isles can be traced to Celtic words 
			for <em>hills, rivers, woods</em> and so on, among them <em>Avon, 
			Axminster, Brentford, Devon, Dover, Leatherhead </em>and literally 
			hundreds more.</p>
			<p>When we get away from toponymy, the evidence is somewhat less 
			obvious (a phenomenon which may, at least in part, be due to the 
			disparagement with which many early scholars treated the notion of 
			Celtic influences on Modern English).&nbsp; In fact, there were two 
			phases of influence:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>When invaders from Europe arrived in the 5th century and for 
				some time later, many Celts were forced to emigrate to the 
				western and northern fringes of Britain where the influence of 
				Celtic languages is still strong (Welsh, Scots Gaelic and, to 
				some extent, Cornish and Manx, for example).&nbsp; The large 
				numbers of place names which survive from those times is still 
				evident but many words dating from this period have clear Celtic 
				origins (from Irish, Welsh or Scots, mostly).&nbsp; Among them 
				are probably:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">

				</table>
				</li>
				<li>During the 16th to 19th centuries when many Celtic speakers 
				moved into cities in England, especially but not exclusively, to 
				London.&nbsp; Some of the words cited above may have first 
				appeared at this time (written records are unreliable guides) 
				but it has been argued that some peculiarities of English 
				grammar certainly date from this time and that it is no 
				coincidence that these peculiarities also appear in Celtic 
				languages.<br />
				Most other European languages make do with a single verb form to 
				denote the simple and progressive aspects in English.&nbsp; For 
				example, <em>I go</em> and <em>I am going</em> both translate 
				into French as <em>je vais</em>, into German as <em>ich gehe</em>, 
				in Spanish as <em>voy</em>, in Estonian, <em>ma lähen</em>, in 
				Danish,<em> jeg går</em>, in Romanian <em>mă duc</em>, in 
				Italian <em>vado</em>, in Czech, <em>jdu</em> and so on across 
				almost all European languages.&nbsp; Some Slavic languages do 
				distinguish between the two aspects but they are unlikely to be 
				the source of much influence on the development of English.&nbsp; 
				Even Basque, a non-Indo-European language makes no distinction 
				(the two phrases both translate as <em>banoa</em>).<br />
				However, Celtic languages all make a distinction between three 
				aspects of the verb which may be translated as <em>I go, I am 
				going </em>and <em>I habitually go</em>.&nbsp; In Irish, for 
				example, <em>I go</em> translates as <em>téim</em> but <em>I am 
				going</em> as <em>tá mé ag dul</em>.&nbsp; In Scots Gaelic we 
				find:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I go &rarr; téighim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going →t&aacute; ag dul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I (regularly) go → bím ag dul</em><br />
				<span class="auto-style2">(Source Todd &amp; Hancock 1986:105)</span><br />
				According to many authorities, the progressive aspect was not 
				commonly found in English until the early 17th century, and it 
				follows, for some, that the innovation is influenced by Celtic 
				languages.&nbsp; Celtic languages may, in fact, be the sole 
				source of this innovation but they are almost certainly a 
				reinforcing factor at the very least.</li>

			<p>A date every British school child is familiar with (if they are 
			familiar with any at all) is 1066, the year of the Norman Conquest 
			of England.<br />
			Unusually for that period of history, the Battle of Hastings was 
			decisive: the English King Harold was killed and the Saxon 
			aristocracy almost wiped out.<br />
			What followed was 300 years in which no ruler of England spoke 
			English as a first language (or at all).&nbsp; Although the Norman 
			conquerors never represented more than around 3% of the population, 
			they spoke French and that language, along with Latin, became the 
			language of administration, religion, the court and the land-holding 
			classes.&nbsp; It was the language of power.&nbsp; Naturally enough, 
			anybody with ambitions to rise in the social hierarchy also needed 
			to master French and so began a slow trickle-down of French into the 
			native aristocracy.&nbsp; Many of these people, the civil servants 
			of the day, were bilingual in English and French.<br />
			Especially in areas (i.e., registers) in which the aristocracy were 
			mostly concerned, French was hugely influential in terms of the 
			vocabulary of English.&nbsp; Predominately, the words introduced 
			from French (around 10,000 of them) occur in the following areas 
			(although almost no area was untouched):</p>
			<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
				<li>Warfare: e.g., <em>peace, battle, arms, enemy, attack</em> 
				etc.</li>
				<li>The church: <em>service, miracle, saint, sacrifice, clergy
				</em>etc.</li>
				<li>Hunting: <em>forest, quarry, falcon, retrieve</em> etc.</li>
				<li>Architecture and houses: <em>carpet, wardrobe, chair, table, 
				joist, arch</em> etc.</li>
				<li>Food: <em>mutton, pork, gammon, onion, peach, cream</em> 
				etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In many cases, the original English words were also retained so, 
			although we now commonly use the French-derived word <em>archer</em>, 
			the English <em>bowman</em> is still extant.&nbsp; By the same 
			token, the names for the animals, which the peasantry raised, were 
			retained and so we have the distinction in English between, for 
			example, <em>beef</em> (the French word) and <em>cow</em> (the 
			English word for the animal from which it comes).<br />
			For the majority of the population, who continued to speak English, 
			exchanging an English lord for a French one probably had little 
			impact.</p>
			<p>Not all the language was affected and the great mass of the 
			population continued to speak English so the essentials of the 
			language remained unchanged or evolved very slowly.&nbsp; Words for 
			kinship terms (<em>father, mother, son, daughter</em> etc.), agricultural items 
			(<em>land, barn, field, hay</em> etc.), numerals and so on are still 
			recognisably Anglo-Saxon in origin and most have cognate words in other 
			Germanic languages which are instantly recognisable.&nbsp; Basic 
			verb forms and very common nouns, too, remained virtually 
			unaffected.&nbsp; For example:</p>

			<p>As we saw above, Modern English inflects for tense (regularly 
			with a <em>-d</em> or -<em>ed</em> suffix and shows the third person 
			singular in the present (only) with -<em>s</em> or -<em>es</em>.<br />
			Although the language was beginning to lose some of the synthetic 
			elements of earlier forms, it is still the case that verb endings 
			varied to show number more clearly than they do in Modern English.&nbsp; 
			So, for example, the plural form of the verb <em>make</em> was <em>
			maken</em> and the singular form of the verb <em>do</em>, now <em>does</em>, was <em>doth</em>.&nbsp; 
			Nouns, however, had almost completely lost the endings for case that 
			Old English inherited from the Anglo-Saxon languages.</p>
			<p>It should also be remembered that this period was one of very 
			limited literacy; most of what was written at the time was intended 
			to be read aloud to those who could not read.&nbsp; Latin was still 
			the language in which laws and charters were written but they were 
			often translated to be read aloud to those whom they would most 
			closely concern.</p>
			<p>An important event which occurred during this period, in 1476, 
			was the introduction of the printing press to England by William 
			Caxton who opened his first workshop in Westminster.&nbsp; Others 
			followed and it is from this period that we can trace the slow and

			<p>Early Modern English is the language of Shakespeare and covers

			It was during this period that many of the modern uses of modal 
			auxiliary verbs and such constructions as the passive became fixed.&nbsp; It

			simplified and the distinctions between plural and singular pronouns 
			(<em>thou</em> vs. <em>you</em>) began to be lost (although that

			<p>You can probably see why many people profoundly dislike the 
			modern versions.</p>
			<p>In addition, many writers in English (not least Shakespeare) deliberately introduced foreign words because they felt the need or 
			in an effort to appear erudite and learned.&nbsp; Some have stuck 
			but many have not.<br />
			This phenomenon is closely associated with the Renaissance period in 
			Europe during which science, commerce and the arts expanded 
			dramatically.&nbsp; Estimates of the number of new words entering 
			English during the Renaissance vary but a figure of at least 10,000 
			new words is generally agreed with some claiming three times as many.&nbsp; Shakespeare and his 
			contemporaries were daring and innovative in this regard, 
			introducing words such as <em>agile, allurement, antipathy, 
			catastrophe, critical, demonstrate, dire, discountenance, emphasis, 
			emulate, expostulation, extract, hereditary, horrid, impertinent, 
			meditate, modest</em> and thousands more.<br />
			Many of the words introduced from Latin had very short life spans in 
			English and vanished almost as soon as they appeared.&nbsp; Examples 
			of words which have disappeared include <em>deblaterate</em> (<em>babble</em>),
			<em>latrate</em> (<em>bark</em>), <em>devulgate</em> (<em>set forth</em>),
			<em>adminiculation</em> (<em>aid</em>) and <em>consumulate</em> (<em>bury</em>).</p>
			<p>Grammar, too changed quite dramatically during the transition 
			from Early Modern to Modern English.&nbsp; Some examples here are 
			enough:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>nouns</strong></dt>
				<dd>Old English inflexions for case had already been lost by 
				this period but inflexion for number is another matter.&nbsp; 
				During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there is a slow 
				transition from Old English plural forms, often involving 
				changes to central vowels or the addition of the -<em>en</em> 
				suffix to the noun, in favour of the now almost ubiquitous -<em>s</em> 
				or -<em>es</em> endings.&nbsp; There are still some surviving 
				examples as in, e.g., <em>mice, feet,</em> 
				<em>brethren, children, oxen </em> 
				and so on but we have now lost plurals such as <em>eyen</em> (<em>eyes</em>) 
				and <em>shooen</em> (<em>shoes</em>) which were both used by 
				Shakespeare and other writers.</dd>
				<dt><strong>adjectives</strong></dt>
				<dd>This period sees the regularisation of the comparative and 
				superlative forms of adjectives so we no longer use, for 
				example, <em>the most unkindest</em>, <em>valiantest</em> and so 
				on and now reserve the periphrastic forms for longer adjectives 
				and the inflexions for shorter ones.&nbsp; It was only later 
				that scholars decreed the combination of the -<em>est</em> 
				ending and the word <em>more</em> to be substandard.</dd>
				<dt><strong>pronouns</strong></dt>
				<dd>The period sees the demise of the distinction in Old English 
				between <em>ye</em> and <em>thou</em> (the former plural, the 
				latter singular) and the introduction and persistence of 
				the pronoun <em>you</em> for all forms of address, losing the 
				distinction still apparent in many European languages between a 
				polite and familiar form (<em>du</em> vs. <em>Sie</em>, <em>tu</em> 
				vs. <em>vous</em> etc.).<br />
				This period also sees the formulation of the gender neutral <em>its</em> 
				possessive determiner whereas previous usage reserved <em>he</em> and 
				<em>she</em> 
				for nouns as in, for example, <em>the sun starts to spread his 
				warmth</em> or <em>the moon shines her beams</em>.&nbsp; The use 
				of <em>it's</em> instead of <em>its</em>, now considered a mark 
				of illiteracy, was common until the beginning of the nineteenth 
				century, incidentally.</dd>
				<dt><strong>verbs</strong></dt>
				<dd>
			<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
				<li>Before this period and during it, the use of the operator
				<em>do</em> to form simple-tense questions was rare so we have a 
				slow change from forms such as <em>Take you the time?</em> to 
				the more modern <em>Do you take the time?</em>&nbsp; Similarly, 
				the previous use of the negative as in, e.g., <em>I know not
				</em>changed to the modern use of <em>I don't know</em>.&nbsp; 
				The older forms persist in Modern English with modal and other 
				auxiliary verbs (<em>Must you?&nbsp; I must not </em>etc.).</li>
				<li>The third-person singular ending in Modern English is -<em>s</em> 
				or -<em>es</em> but this form was only common in northern 
				English dialects with the more familiar -<em>eth</em> ending 
				being dominant in the south.&nbsp; Within the transition from 
				Early Modern to Modern English the -<em>s</em> endings came to 
				predominate.&nbsp; Shakespeare, writing in the middle of this 
				period, used both endings interchangeably.</li>
				<li>Old English distinguished, as does Modern German, between strong 
				and weak verbs and the irregular verbs on classroom charts list 
				the surviving older forms.&nbsp; During this period, however, 
				many verbs which were strong became weakened so the past tense 
				of <em>help</em> changed from <em>holp</em> to what we now 
				consider the regular form <em>helped</em>, for example.&nbsp; 
				The reverse is also the case with some verbs using weak forms 
				during this period of transition (<em>blowed, growed, shined</em> 
				etc.) interchangeably with the strong forms (<em>blew, grew, 
				shone </em>etc.) on which modern usage eventually settled.</li>
				<li>A fourth notable change is the introduction of the modern 
				progressive forms of verbs.&nbsp; Before this period, the simple 
				form was frequently used for ongoing or progressive actions and 
				events so, in Shakespeare one finds <em>What do you read?</em> 
				rather than <em>What are you reading?</em>&nbsp; By the end of 
				this period the progressive forms were well established 
				including the use of progressive non-finite participles in, 
				e.g., <em>Having done the work, he left</em>.<br />
				There is some evidence based on comparative language studies 
				that this innovation came about through the influence of Celtic 
				language structures (see above).</li>
			</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>prepositions</strong></dt>
				<dd>The use of prepositions changed quite dramatically during 
				this period with, for example, <em>wonder of</em> changing to
				<em>wonder at</em>, <em>done of you</em> changing to <em>done by 
				you</em> and <em>provide of</em> changing to <em>provide with</em>.&nbsp; 
				There are hundreds of other examples and many older uses such as
				<em>bored of </em>survive in dialect or casual speech.</dd>

			</table>
			
			<p>It has been said that Modern English arrives with the invention 
			of the novel as literature.&nbsp; An early exponent of the novel was 
			Daniel Defoe (?1660 - 1731), whose father, incidentally but 
			revealingly, had Frenchified his name from the original Foe to the 
			more sophisticated Defoe.&nbsp; His most famous work, Robinson 
			Crusoe, was published in 1719 and is a readable today as it was 
			then.<br />
			An attempt to appeal to national prejudices by asserting the purity 
			of English, as common then as now, were cuttingly satirised by Defoe 
			in his only famous poem, <em>The True-born Englishman</em>, 
			published in 1701.&nbsp; (The following year, Defoe was imprisoned 
			for six months for writing a satirical prose pamphlet about 
			dissenters.)<br />
			It goes like this and is a decent summary of the roots of the 
			language Defoe spoke:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The Romans first with Julius Caesar came,<br />
			Including all the Nations of that Name,<br />
			Gauls, Greeks, and Lombards; and by computation,<br />
			Auxiliaries or Slaves of ev'ry Nation.<br />
			With Hengist, Saxons; Danes with Sueno came,<br />
			In search of plunder, not in search of Fame.<br />
			Scots, Picts, and Irish from th' Hibernian Shore:<br />
			And conqu'ring William brought the Normans o'er.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these their Barb'rous Offspring left behind,<br />
			The Dregs of Armies, they of all mankind:<br />
			Blended with Britons who before were here,<br />
			Of whom the Welsh ha' blest the Character.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this Amphibious Ill-born Mob began<br />
			The vain ill-natur'd thing, an Englishman.<br />
			The Customs, Surnames, Languages, and Manners<br />
			Of all those Nations are their own Explainers:<br />
			Whose Relics are so lasting and so strong,<br />
			They hs' left a Shibboleth upon our Tongue;<br />
			By which with easy search you may distinguish<br />
			Your Roman-Saxon-Danish-Norman English.</p>
			<p>As one can see from the poem, spelling, abbreviations and 
			capitalisation are somewhat erratic even at this time.<br />
			From the 18th century onwards, the language becomes recognisably 
			modern and it was during this period that the first attempts at 
			standardisation were made with a good deal of argument about what 
			should be 'correct' and what should be considered 'wrong'.&nbsp; 
			Baugh and Cable (2002:241) describe the attempts to codify the 
			language as the desire:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>(1) to reduce the language to rule and 
			set up a standard of correct usage; (2) to refine it—that is, to 
			remove supposed defects and introduce certain improvements; and (3) 
			to fix it permanently in the desired form.</em></span></p>
			<p>The spirit of the times flowed with such endeavours with the rise 
			of what was called 'polite literature'.&nbsp; The word <em>polite</em> 
			here has nothing to do with <em>politics</em>; it is derived from 
			the Latin verb meaning <em>polish</em> or <em>smooth down</em>.&nbsp; Although earnest efforts to establish a kind of Academy to regulate 
			and define the uses of English failed (albeit narrowly) many 
			self-styled authorities arose to condemn, for example, the use of
			<em>had rather</em> (seen as a corruption of <em>would rather</em>).&nbsp; 
			Other forms which became fixed at this time are (<em>op cit.</em>: 
			263):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the preference for <em>different from</em> (rather than <em>
				different than</em> or <em>to</em>, the former standard AmE 
				usage and the latter still common on both sides of the Atlantic)</li>
				<li>the proscription of <em>*between you and I </em>(as an 
				illiterate use of a nominative pronoun after a preposition)</li>
				<li>the differentiation of <em>between</em> and <em>among </em>
				(the former to refer only to two entities and the latter to more 
				than two)</li>
				<li>the use of the comparative rather than the superlative where 
				only two things are involved (<em>the larger</em>, not <em>
				largest</em>, of two)</li>
				<li>the feeling that ungradable adjectives such as <em>perfect, 
				chief, round</em>, should not be compared (<em>more perfect</em> etc.)</li>
				<li>the proscription of the use of <em>you was</em> as a 
				singular (although Webster approved it) and the adoption of <em>
				were</em> as the only correct form, singular or plural</li>
				<li>that the case of the pronoun after <em>than </em>is 
				determined by the construction supplied or understood (<em>he is 
				older than she</em>; <em>he likes you better than me</em>)</li>
				<li>the condemnation of the double negative</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There were also those who asserted that any attempt to set down 
			hard rules for English use was doomed to failure.&nbsp; Joseph 
			Priestly (1733-1804) noted (<em>op cit.</em>: 267):</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>In </em>modern<em> and </em>living<em> 
			languages, it is absurd to pretend to set up the compositions of any 
			person or persons whatsoever as the standard of writing, or their 
			conversation as the invariable rule of speaking.&nbsp; With respect to 
			custom, laws, and every thing that is changeable, the body of a 
			people, who, in this respect, cannot but be free, will certainly 
			assert their liberty, in making what innovations they judge to be 
			expedient and useful.&nbsp; The general prevailing custom, whatever it 
			happen to be, can be the only standard for the time that it 
			prevails.</em></span></p>
			<p>However, it is certainly true that the rules above and many more 
			persist to this day and are reasserted in grammars and handbooks of 
			use (and written into computer grammar-checking programs).&nbsp; 
			That they are simply the reflection of the views of a few 
			influential people and not based on what people actually said and 
			wrote is often not mentioned.</p>

			<p>As Defoe pointed out, throughout its history, even from the earliest times of Old 
			English, the language has been subject to influences from, 
			especially, Latin (through the influence of Christianity and the 
			role of Latin as the scientific, diplomatic and religious <em>lingua franca</em>), Norman 
			French (through the imposition of a French-speaking aristocracy 
			after the conquest in 1066), Greek (through the influence of science 
			and religion) and much later other languages indigenous to the 
			British colonies.&nbsp; At various times in history, other languages 
			contributed, notably Dutch for maritime matters, German for 
			military ones and Italian for musical terms.</p>
			<p>The outcome is a language essentially Germanic in structure but with 
			a huge range of lexical influences.&nbsp; Roughly, for the lexicon, the picture is:</p>

			<p>We saw above that there has been a general tendency in English 
			towards the simplification of many grammatical categories which were 
			once important, especially the loss of inflexions on adjectives, 
			verbs, and case endings on a range of items.<br />
			A phenomenon not confined to any particular period in the 
			development of English is one which has been documented in a huge 
			range of languages.&nbsp; It is usually referred to as 
			grammaticalisation but it may be called grammartisation or 
			grammatication, too.<br />
			Briefly, it describes a process in which a lexical word (which 
			carries meaning and may stand alone) is converted into a function 
			word which operates at the level of grammar.</p>
			<p>Lexical words are generally understood to be nouns, adjectives, 
			adverbs and verbs so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; table<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go</em><br />
			etc. can all stand alone and still carry significance for speakers 
			of the language.<br />
			Function words, on the other hand are generally understood to be 
			determiners, pronouns, prepositions and conjunctions so, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; although</em><br />
			etc. are all meaningless without co-text to appreciate what they are 
			doing in terms of grammar.</p>
			<p>There is a trend, in English and many other languages for the 
			meaning of some lexical words to be bleached out so that the 
			original meaning is lost and only the grammatical function remains.&nbsp; 
			Some examples will suffice to see the process in action:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em><strong>indeed</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>In Modern English, the word has 
					two functions:<br />
				as an adverb intensifier 
					used to emphasise a statement such as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was indeed difficult to understand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was indeed a man of some intelligence<br />
				</em>as a conjunct adverbial to 
					introduce and additional and unexpected issue such as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ideas interested the management.&nbsp; 
					Indeed, they were implemented quite quickly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She expected it to be hard work and indeed it took a lot 
					longer than two hours<br />
				</em>In earlier times, however, the word was 
				lexical rather than grammatical and appeared as a prepositional 
				phrase, <em>in dede</em>, which meant <em>in fact</em> or <em>in 
				action</em> (cognate with the Modern English <em>deed</em> from 
				the Old English <em>dæd</em>, an action or event).&nbsp; Over 
				time, the meaning has been bleached from the word and all that 
				remains is a function word.&nbsp; The change took place during 
				the 16th century.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>will</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>derives from the Old English verb <em>wyllan</em>, meaning
				<em>wish, want</em> or <em>desire</em> and can still be used 
				that way in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He willed his entire fortune to his 
				cousin</em><br />
				In Modern English, however, the verb has be delexicalised (or 
				grammaticalised) and now functions as a future tense marker as 
				in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be 35 years old tomorrow</em><br />
				or as an expression of willingness (not a future marker) as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll cook supper if you like</em><br />
				The verb <em>would</em> in Modern English, derived from the 
				past tense of <em>wyllan, wolde</em>, has undergone a 
				similar process being confined now to a modal auxiliary verb 
				which, standing alone, has no obvious meaning.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>let</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>Until comparatively recently, this verb simply meant <em>
				allow</em> and is still used that way in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me go</em><br />
				meaning<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to go</em><br />
				However, modern usage has delexicalised the verb and it is now 
				used as a marginal modal verb in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's go out</em><br />
				meaning<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why don't we go out?<br />
				</em>The change in use can be discerned in the difference 
				between:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us go<br />
				</em>meaning<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow us to go<br />
				</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's go<br />
				</em>meaning<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest we go<br />
				</em>The conjunction <em>let alone, </em>meaning <em>not to 
				mention </em>is not attested until the early 19th century and is 
				another example of the grammaticalisation of the verb.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>that</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>Is generally seen as the singular form of the determiner <em>
				these</em> and is used that way to distinguish between, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like that hat and those gloves</em><br />
				However, the word has been grammaticalised in Modern English and 
				now functions as a relative pronoun in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The books that I gave her</em><br />
				where it is unmarked for plural or singular.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>going</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>is, in many cases, a verb form from the verb <em>go</em> and 
				it carries its usual meaning in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is going to the shops</em><br />
				which can mean<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is currently on her way to the shops</em><br />
				In Modern English, on the other hand, the verb has been 
				grammaticalised and now functions as an auxiliary verb denoting 
				currently planned actions as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to talk to the boss tomorrow</em><br />
				and, in fact, the verb can also refer to a present intention for 
				the future in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's going to the shops</em> (later)<br />
				because of the avoidance of the clumsy <em>going to go</em> 
				formulation.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>have</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>is still used in its original meaning of possess as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has a nice house in London</em><br />
				but the verb has also been grammaticalised:<br />
				to form a perfect tense as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been to New York</em><br />
				to express obligation as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have (got) to go now</em><br />
				The verb <em>have to </em>to mean <em>must</em> is only attested from 
				the late 16th century and the use with the meaningless <em>got</em> 
				is not current until three centuries later.</dd>

			</table>
			
			<ol>
				<li>One interesting outcome of the influences of other languages 
				is the existence in English, almost uniquely, of three-level 
				synonym structures.&nbsp; So we have, for example<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rise – 
				mount – ascend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ask – question – interrogate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goodness – virtue 
				– probity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire – flame – conflagration<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fetch – retrieve – recover<br />
				</em>and many more where 
				the first word is English, the second from French and the third 
				from Latin.<br />
				These are not exact synonyms because they differ in style, in 
				nuance and, sometimes, in their associated grammar (<em>fetch</em> 
				and <em>retrieve</em> are, for example always transitive but <em>
				recover</em> can be intransitive or transitive).</li>
				<li>Another outcome is the distinction between multi-word verbs 
				and their Latin or French equivalents in English so we get, for 
				example<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put off </em>vs. <em>postpone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look into</em> vs. <em>investigate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call off</em> vs. <em>cancel<br />
				</em>and literally hundreds of others.<br />
				Again, these are not perfect synonyms because the associated 
				grammar and style is variable.</li>
				<li>A third issue is the sheer richness of the lexicon in 
				English which often exhibits subtle but distinct differences between, e.g.,<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; folk</em> (Old English <em>folc</em>) and <em>people </em> 
				(Old French <em>peupel</em>)<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pig</em> 
				(origin obscure) 
				and <em>swine </em> (Old English <em>swin</em>)<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grow </em> (Old English <em>growan</em>) and <em>expand</em> 
				(Old French <em>espandre</em>)<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freedom
				</em>(Old English <em>freodom</em>) and<em> liberty
				</em>(Old French <em> liberte</em>)<em><br />
				</em>and 
				thousands of other near or partial synonyms distinguished by 
				style, register, connotation, dialect and collocational characteristics.<br />
				A subset of these near synonyms is exemplified by verbs which 
				exist in intransitive and transitive pairs such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>rise</em> (from Old English) vs. <em>raise</em> (from Old 
				Norse)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>lie</em> vs. <em>lay</em> (both from Old English)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sit</em> vs. <em>seat</em> (the latter verb appears much 
				later but both are derived from Old English)</li>
				<li>Two related phenomena are homonymy (the fact that some words 
				look and sound the same but are not related in sense or 
				origin) and polysemy (words which are used in distinct but 
				related senses and are related in origin).<br />
				Homonymy occurs frequently when two words which now look the 
				same are derived from different sources.<br />
				For example, <em>left</em> (the opposite of <em>right</em>) 
				derives from the Old English <em>lyft</em> which meant <em>weak</em> 
				(as in the weaker hand) but the past tense of <em>leave</em>,
				<em>left</em>, derives from the Old English verb <em>læfan</em> 
				which originally meant <em>allow to remain</em> and only assumed 
				its sense of <em>depart</em> in the thirteenth century.&nbsp; 
				The words look the same but are unconnected in derivation and 
				meaning.<br />
				Polysemous words are related but, over time, some of their 
				senses have diverged.&nbsp; For example, as we have seen <em>
				leave</em> to mean <em>depart</em> and <em>leave</em> to mean
				<em>allow to remain</em> are both used as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She left without paying</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I left the book on the table</em><br />
				The first use is intransitive only and the second always 
				transitive.<br />
				The word <em>set</em> is notorious in having a large range of 
				meanings:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I set a test<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glue set<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I set the alarm clock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She set the dog on him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They set the vase on the mantelpiece</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				In fact, all these uses of the verb set are derivable from the 
				Old English <em>settan</em> (a transitive verb meaning <em>to 
				put in some place</em> or <em>fix</em>).&nbsp; The fact that 
				some of the meanings have diverged to the point at which there 
				is little obvious connection inclines some to classify the uses 
				as examples of homonymy rather than polysemy.&nbsp; Opinions 
				vary.</li>
				<li>A fifth outcome is that learners from certain language 
				backgrounds will be able to access and retain some areas of the 
				English lexicon better than others.&nbsp; Those from Italic 
				language backgrounds will be able to understand and recall words 
				derived from Latin and French and those from Germanic language 
				backgrounds will find the same with the approximately a quarter 
				of the words in English traceable to Anglo-Saxon.<br />
				Some of the older connections may not at first seem obvious.&nbsp; 
				For example, the Modern German verb <em>reisen</em> (<em>travel</em>) 
				shares a root with the English word <em>rise</em> and originally 
				meant <em>to get up to start a journey</em>.&nbsp; Words also 
				change their meanings in other subtler ways.&nbsp; For example, 
				the English word <em>stove</em> originally meant a warm room for relaxing 
				in and that sense is retained in other Germanic languages (with 
				spelling variations) but only reduced its sense to mean <em>a 
				heating or cooking device</em> in the mid-seventeenth century in 
				English.<br />
				By the same token, some words derived from Latin, Norman or 
				later French have had time to vary their meanings or to acquire 
				new ones which did not occur in the original.&nbsp; So, for 
				example, the Modern English <em>realise</em> and the Modern 
				French <em>réaliser</em> both clearly derive from the same 
				source but the sense of <em>gain a sudden understanding</em> in, 
				for example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I slowly realised the truth</em><br />
				which the English verb carries is absent in French.&nbsp; French 
				uses <em>prendre conscience</em> to express this meaning, not 
				the verb <em>réaliser.</em><br />
				In French the 
				verb only shares the English sense of <em>make real</em> as in, 
				for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They realised their dream</em><br />
				The meanings are connected because the verb originally was used 
				in the sense of <em>make real in the mind</em> in the 
				mid-eighteenth century in English and only slowly changed its 
				sense to <em>gain an understanding</em>.<br />
				The existence of so-called false friends between English and 
				other European languages can usually be explained by these 
				gradual shifts in meaning over the years since the words entered 
				the language.<br />
				The longer the separation, the more the meaning is likely to 
				have diverged so, for example, words from Greek may appear 
				related (and they often are) to Modern English words but the 
				senses have diverged until they seem no longer connected in 
				meaning.&nbsp; For example, the Greek word for <em>civil</em> 
				(in the sense of to do with citizens) is <em>πολιτικός</em> (<em>poleetikos</em>) 
				which is the source of the English <em>political</em> (to do 
				with government).<br />
				See
				the guide to cognates and 
				false friends on this site, linked below in the list of related 
				guides.</li>
				<li>Finally, learners from Germanic language backgrounds will 
				find many of the grammatical and structural phenomena in English 
				relatively easy to understand and form because parallel 
				structures exist in their languages.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Issues 5. and 6., above, will only, of course, apply to learners 
			whose languages are western Indo-European.&nbsp; Others will have no 
			such easy access to the grammar or the lexicon of Modern English.&nbsp; 
			There are obvious consequences arising from that, too.</p>
