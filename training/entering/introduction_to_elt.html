			<p>Teaching any language is fundamentally different from teaching 
			knowledge-based subjects.&nbsp; Here's how:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Information-based teaching</strong><br />
				<img alt="books" height="133" src="../images/books_bundle200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>The purpose of education in most settings is to broaden the 
				knowledge and skills base of the students.&nbsp; That remains 
				true at all levels of study from primary schools to 
				post-graduate courses at universities.&nbsp; How the teaching 
				happens is very variable and may be impressively imaginative and 
				enthralling or downright dull and boring.<br />
				Whichever it is, teachers start from the premise that they know 
				something their students do not and they use their common 
				language to enhance and expand the experiences of the learners.<br />
			What is meant here is that most teaching requires the teacher to use 
			the language he or she has in common with the learners to help them 
			acquire new information and skills.&nbsp; For example, in teaching a 
			general school subject such as mathematics, history, sports or literature, 
			teachers and learners share a common language but have experiences 
			which differ.&nbsp; The object of teaching is to use the language to 
			bring the experiences of the teacher and the learners closer 
			together.<br />
				This may be done by telling people facts and asking them to 
				remember them, by leading them to discover them for themselves 
				or by showing them how things work.<br />
				Learners in this setting are assumed to have the communication 
				skills they need to learn about, talk about, read about and 
				write about the world.&nbsp; What they do not have is the 
				knowledge to do so and that has, somehow, to be transmitted.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Language teaching</strong><br />
				<img alt="teach" height="133" src="../images/teaching_seminar200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Language teaching is the mirror image of most teaching.<br />
				It assumes from the outset that 
			teachers and learners share common experiences of the world but 
			differ in the medium through which they talk, listen, read and write 
			about them.&nbsp; The object of language teaching is to bring the language 
			the learners use into a closer alignment with the language which the 
			teacher is there to help them acquire.<br />
				Learners in this setting are assumed to have a sound knowledge 
				of the world and its systems so do not need to be taught facts.&nbsp; 
				What they do not have is the ability to talk about, hear about, 
				read about and write about the world in English (or whichever other 
				language is the target) and that is skill that has to be developed and 
				practised, not transmitted.<br />
				We cannot teach people a language in the way that we can teach 
				chemistry or history but we can engender the environment in 
				which language is learned and acquired.</dd>

					<h2>Subject matter</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Deciding what to teach in information-based education is a 
			comparatively simple matter.<br />
			Although the details of constructing a rational syllabus may be 
			fiendishly complicated, the process is one of deciding which bits of 
			information should come first and then building on them as you go up 
			the ladder from complete ignorance of the topic to full mastery.&nbsp; 
			Few ever reach the top of the ladder, naturally, and in some 
			subjects, no-one ever does.</p>
			<p>It used to be the assumption that language teaching can be designed in 
			roughly the same way by taking the simplest grammar and vocabulary 
			first and building on it until full mastery of the language is 
			attained.<br />
			That meant, for example, starting with easy grammar such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is John<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a desk<br />
			</em>going on to more complex structures such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I had known you were coming, I'd've baked 
			a cake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John told Mary she should have consulted Fred and then 
			decided what they will have been able to accomplish by the end of 
			the year<br />
			</em>and building up to the ability to speak at length and write the 
			occasional novel or encyclopaedia in English.<br />
			It is now pretty much accepted in the profession that focusing on 
			the forms of the language is not enough.&nbsp; There are, basically, 
			two approaches but they often work in harmony and happen in the same 
			lessons, like this.&nbsp; (When you have looked at the diagram and 
			made some sense of it, click on it for an explanation.)</p>

					comparison, attractiveness etc. (the notions).&nbsp; Then we 
					can see how the language encodes these ideas using its

			<p>There's a bit more to it than that, of course (well, quite a lot 
			more, actually), or nobody would need a training course but,

					<h2>The learners</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			
			<p>Because of the slightly strange nature of language teaching 
			compared to information-based teaching, it is not the decisions 
			about subject matter 
			which come before consideration of the learners but the learners who often determine 
			the subject matter.<br />
			When, for example, we set out to write a syllabus and design a 
			course in nuclear physics, we are mostly concerned with the nature 
			of the topic and select what is to be taught first and at what level 
			of detail.<br />
			When we come to writing a language syllabus and designing a course, 
			we are, naturally, concerned with what to teach but we base that on 
			questions (and answers) about the learners:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What level are they?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do they need to be able to do in the language?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are they going to use the language?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who are they going to communicate with?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will they need to speak, read, write and listen equally and 
			equally well?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they learning the language to function in the workplace?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they learning the language to study in it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they learning the language to talk to native speakers or 
			other learners?</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Apart from children learning a language at school, who may have no 
			idea why they are learning it and may, in fact, not want to learn it 
			at all, most learners have a reasonably good idea about why they are 
			learning, what they will need to be able to do in the language and 
			how well they will need to be able to do it.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>Someone who needs the language to answer the telephone in 
				English and write short emails to customers will need good 
				listening and speaking skills and some less good writing skills.&nbsp; 
				The ability to read a novel or short story for pleasure in 
				English is something they certainly don't need.<br />
				They do not need, either, to write academic essays in English or 
				long texts.</li>
				<li>Someone who needs the language to travel and communicate in 
				English probably needs only good speaking and listening skills, 
				some ability to read simple texts and very little (if any) skill 
				in writing.</li>
				<li>Someone who needs the language to access study materials 
				(but not to live or work in an English-speaking environment) 
				probably only needs good reading skills and a wide vocabulary.</li>
				<li>Someone recently arrived to live in an English-speaking society 
				will need all the skills but urgently they will need good 
				comprehension skills and the ability to get things done in 
				spoken English.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In summary, taking into account the needs of the learners leads 
			us to focus on:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>The functions people need to be able to use and understand.</li>
				<li>The skills (reading, writing, speaking and listening) that 
				they need to use.</li>
				<li>The level of formal accuracy (grammar, spelling, 
				pronunciation etc.) that they need to attain.</li>
				<li>The types of settings in which they need to learn and 
				practise the language.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The roles people associate with teachers they have encountered 
			are usually:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style42">
				<li>An informer / knower: transmitting information in some way, 
				by dictation, elicitation and leading, questioning, 
				demonstrating and so on.</li>
				<li>An instructor: telling people what to do, setting tasks and 
				tests, directing people to resources, giving homework and so on.</li>
				<li>An assessor: marking homework, evaluating the quality of 
				people's work and contributions etc.</li>
				<li>A planner: designing courses and the lessons within them.</li>
				<li>A counsellor: advising on learning, careers, further study 
				and so on.</li>
				<li>A disciplinarian: telling people off, making rules, policing 
				the environment and so on.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Language teachers, too, need to take on these roles from time to 
			time but also to adopt a range of other roles which include:&nbsp;</p>
			<ol class="auto-style42">
				<li value="7">Contributor: taking part in discussions and conversations, 
				being part of a brainstorming group, taking part in a role play 
				and so on.</li>
				<li>Diagnostician: spotting errors, analysing gaps in knowledge 
				etc.</li>
				<li>Facilitator: helping and making things a little easier by 
				supplying language or models of language.</li>
				<li>Language resource: a walking, talking grammar book and dictionary for your 
				learners.</li>
				<li>Monitor: checking that people are on track in tasks and 
				being aware of how well they are doing.</li>
				<li>Narrator: telling stories and anecdotes, personal or 
				otherwise.</li>
				<li>Relationship builder: maintaining a good rapport between all 
				the members of the class.&nbsp; Learning a language can be a 
				threatening and stressful experience.</li>
				<li>Methodologist: judging approaches and materials in the light 
				of the learners' needs and the settings in which they will use 
				the language.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now you know why you need a training course.&nbsp; To be able to 
			do all of this, you need to know your subject and know your 
			methodology.<br />
			There is more to the former than the ability to speak the language 
			and much more to the latter than being helpful and friendly.</p>
