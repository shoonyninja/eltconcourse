			<h1>Clausal subordination</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="subordination" height="207" src="../../images/shouting310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Before tackling this guide, you would be wise to consult
			<a href="subordination_and_coordination.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
			subordination and coordination </a>(new tab) where the differences and 
			similarities between the phenomena of coordination and subordination are analysed.<br />
			This guide deals with a number of issues covered in more detail 
			elsewhere such as conditionality and concession.&nbsp; You can track 
			other guides to the area via
			<a href="../indexes_is/syntax_index_is.html" target="_blank">the section 
			on syntax: clauses and phrases</a> (new tab).</p>
			<p>You will know if you have followed
			the guide to 
			subordination and coordination that compound-complex sentences 
			with mixtures of various types of coordination and subordination are not uncommon in English.<br />
			In what follows, for the sake of clarity, we will deal with single 
			instances of subordination at a time and will not consider 
			coordination at all.</p>

		Here's a list of the contents of this guide.<br />

			<p>We can classify subordinators in two ways:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style15">
				<li>By their structural characteristics – how they are formed 
				and the nature of the surrounding syntax</li>
				<li>By what they do &ndash; their functions in terms of making 
				meaning</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>We'll do both.</p>

			<p>We can divide the structural characteristics into three classes:</p>

				</strong>
				<img alt="simple" height="133" src="../../images/clear_blue200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This is by far the largest class and contains the 
				subordinators that we would consider the essential subordinators 
				in English.&nbsp; They are all single words and many will be 
				familiar to most learners above A1 level.<br />

				*The phrase <em>so that</em> is listed here as a subordinator 
				which is the role it performs when we are linking action with
				<strong>purpose</strong> as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I covered it well so that it wouldn't get 
				wet</em><br />
				However, the phrase also functions as a coordinator in, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fog was very dense so that I couldn't 
				see my way</em><br />
				in which it means <em>so</em> and is only a coordinator 
				expressing <strong>consequence</strong>.<br />
				We can demonstrate this by trying to reverse the clauses so 
				while:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that it wouldn't get wet, I covered it 
				well</em><br />
				is acceptable as a sentence containing subordination,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *So that I couldn't see my way the fog 
				was very dense</em><br />
				is not because coordinators must retain their position between 
				clauses.<br />
				The other sign that the conjunction <em>so that</em> is a 
				coordinator when it signals a result or consequence is that it 
				cannot be paired with other conjunctions so, while we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fog was very dense and so I couldn't

			<p>All subordinators share certain attributes which distinguish them 
			from coordinators and make them teachable together (but not all of 
			them at once, please).</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Clause mobility</strong></dt>
				<dd>It is possible to have, for example,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came because I was interested</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I was interested, I came</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless you work a bit more, you'll fail the examination</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll fail the examination unless you work a bit more</em><br />
				and even<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will, if we work really hard, be 
				time to finish this</em><br />
				Although the emphasis is different, all three orderings are 
				grammatically acceptable.<br />
				You cannot do this with coordinating conjunctions, of course, or 
				you get nonsense like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *But you weren't at home I telephoned<br />
				</em>Subordinators travel with their clause; coordinators are 
				independent of either clause and come between them.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Allowing the addition of other conjunctions</strong></dt>
				<dd>Subordinators can themselves be preceded by coordinators in, 
				for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't come because it was raining and because he was too 
				tired<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				You can leave early provided that you have finished but only if 
				the boss says it's OK</em><br />
				Again, coordinators do not allow that so we cannot have, for 
				example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*She called you and but you were in a meeting.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Non-ellipsis of the subject</strong></dt>
				<dd>Usually, coordinators allow the ellipsis of the subject 
				providing it is common to both clauses but 
				subordinators do not so we can have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John came home and cooked<br />
				</em>which is a coordinated set of two clauses with ellipsis of the 
				second subject.<br />
				Subordination, however, requires the repetition of 
				the subject in both clauses so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came in order that I could see you</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't drink if I am driving</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I came in order that could see you</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I won't drink if am driving</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Assumed reference</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				In a 
				sentence with two coordinated clauses such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was exhausted but John worked on till 
				six</em><br />
				it is averred by some that <em>he</em> and <em>John</em> must 
				refer to different people.&nbsp; In other words, <em>he</em> 
				cannot be a cataphoric reference to <em>John</em> in a 
				coordinated sentence.&nbsp; This is somewhat questionable but at 
				best the sentence is ambiguous insofar as <em>he</em> 
				and <em>John</em> could refer to the same person or to different 
				people depending on context and co-text.<br />
				With subordination, on the other hand, cataphoric reference is 
				<strong>always</strong> assumed so in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he was exhausted, John worked on 
				till six</em><br />
				it is inevitable that <em>he</em> and <em>John</em> will be 
				assumed to be the same person unless intonation, stress and 
				context demand that the sentence be understood differently.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Inability to join two equal subordinate clauses</strong></dt>
				<dd>In this part, <span class="auto-style25"><strong>coordinators 
				in green</strong></span>, <span class="style_red"><strong>
				subordinators in red</strong></span>.</dd>
				<dd>Coordinators can join two subordinate clauses together as 
				in, e.g.:<br />
				<em><span class="style_red"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because</strong></span> I wanted to see you I came to the party 
				<span class="auto-style26"><strong>and</strong></span> stayed 
				for hours</em><br />
				in which the coordinator 
				<span class="auto-style25"><strong><em>and</em></strong></span> joins two equal-value clauses,
				but we cannot have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She came <span class="style_red"><strong>when</strong></span> you asked 
				<span class="style_red"><strong>in order that</strong></span> you saw her</em><br />
				because only coordinators can link two subordinate clauses 
				together.<br />
				Subordinators can, of course, link a further subordinate clause 
				making a complex tree of subordinations so we can have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came to the party <span class="style_red"><strong>because</strong></span> she wanted to talk to him 
				<span class="auto-style25"><strong>and</strong></span>
				<span class="style_red"><strong>because</strong></span> she enjoys parties 
				<span class="style_red"><strong>if</strong></span> they are not too large and noisy</em><br />
				Here, we have a main clause:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came to the party<br />
				</em>a 
				subordinate clause:<em><span class="style_red"><strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because</strong></span> she wanted to talk to him<br />
				</em>linked to another equal-value subordinate clause<em><span class="auto-style25"><strong>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and</strong></span>
				<span class="style_red"><strong>because</strong></span> she enjoys parties<br />
				</em>with its own subordinate 
				conditional clause:<em><span class="style_red"><strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if</strong></span> they are not too large and noisy</em>.<br />

				seems complicated to access, try a diagram:<br />

				<img alt="complex subordination" height="305" src="../../imagesgraphics/complex_subordination.png" width="465" /><br />

				limits the number of clauses to a maximum (rarely) of eight.</dd>

				are functionally synonymous.<br />
				However, the usual ordering of the clauses is slightly 
				different.<ol class="auto-style15">
					<li><em>as</em>, <em>since, seeing that<br />
					</em>all refer to the circumstance which caused the event 
					(or non-event) so a more natural ordering would be:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it was raining we stayed at home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it was raining we stayed at home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that it was raining we stayed at home</em></li>
					<li><em>because</em><br />
					on the other hand,
					emphasises the reason rather than the cause so the ordering 
					naturally remains as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stayed at home because it was 
					raining</em><br />
					not as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it was raining we stayed at 
					home</em><br />
					which is possible but less natural.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>for</em><br />
				<strong>in this sense</strong>, is a coordinator and can only be 
				used <em>between</em> the two 
					clauses.&nbsp; We can allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stayed at home for it was raining</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *For it was raining we stayed at home</em><br />
				and the use in coordination is formal and quite unusual.</li>
				<li><em>as</em> and <em>since</em><br />
				can both function as temporal subordinators and <em>since</em> 
				can also be a temporal preposition:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived just as I left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has lived here since he finished university<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has lived here since his graduation</em></li>
				<li><em>so that</em><br />
				functions as both a subordinator and a coordinator but with a 
				different meaning:<ol class="auto-style15">
					<li>as a coordinator, not a subordinator, it is akin 
					to <em>so</em> and refers to a <strong>result</strong>.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The garden was covered in snow so that he could see the 
					footprints clearly<br /></em>and In this sentence, <em>so that</em> can be replaced with 
					a true coordinator such as <em>and.<br />
					</em>Because it is a coordinator, it cannot shift position so we don't allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *So that he could see the footprints clearly the garden 
					was covered in snow</em></li>
					<li>When it is used as a subordinator its function is to 
					refer to <strong>purpose</strong> rather than result to mean something like
					<em>in order that</em>, and it is subordinating in function 
					so we can shift the clauses around as 
					in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He fixed it firmly in place so that it wouldn't move<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					So that it wouldn't move he fixed it firmly in place<br />
					</em>It is possible that some ambiguity may arise.&nbsp; For 
					example, does:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone stole my car so that I couldn't get to work<br />
					</em>mean that someone stole the car i<span class="style_underline">n 
					order to</span> prevent me getting to work or is
					<span class="style_underline">the result</span> of the theft 
					the fact that I couldn't get to work?</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>because</em><br />
				can also be a source of ambiguity when it is used with a 
				negative main clause as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't come because John would be 
				there</em><br />
				which could mean either:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason she didn't come was that John 
				would be there</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason she didn't come was not that 
				John would be there (but arose from some other motivation)<br />
				</em>Intonation and sentence stress (on the subordinator) will 
				disambiguate this is speech but only rephrasing can do so in the 
				written form.</li>
				<li> <em>lest</em> and<em> for fear 
					that<br />
				</em>are both formal and quite rare:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They covered the work with canvas lest it rain(ed)<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					She took a sweater for fear that the weather would turn cold<br />
				</em>and are often used with a subjunctive form.</li>
				<li>Causal / Resultative clauses are normally finite (see 
				below).</li>

			<p>There are rather too many subordinating temporal conjunctions in 
			English and they cause a certain amount of difficulty for learners 
			(and teachers) so they merit consideration here in a separate 
			section.</p>
			<p>Above, the following 18 items are listed as temporal 
			subordinating conjunctions:<br /><em><span class="style_black">after, as, as soon as, before, 
			hardly … when, immediately, no sooner … than, now (that), once, 
			scarcely … when, since, till, until, when, whenever, whereupon, 
			while, whilst</span><br />
			</em>and many of them are synonymous in some respects but not in 
			others.&nbsp; Few languages have such a rich source of these sorts 
			of subordinators so choosing the correct one to use and getting the 
			syntax right is challenging.<br />
			Here are some notes to help:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>as, as soon as, when, while</em> and <em>whenever</em> 
				are not synonyms<br />
				The conjunction <em>when</em> is quite versatile but the others are more restricted in their uses.<br />
				We can allow, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left when he arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was working in the garden when he was washing the car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was living in London when he died<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I want to talk to him he's always too busy</em><br />
				but if we try to replace the conjunction with the other common 
				subordinators, this happens:<ol class="auto-style15">
					<li><em>as</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left as he arrived</em><br />
					carries a different sense.&nbsp; The use with <em>when</em> 
					implies shortly after he arrived but the use of <em>as</em> 
					implies at <strong>exactly</strong> the same time.&nbsp; In 
					the sentence with <em>when</em> we might assume that his 
					arrival was a reason for her leaving but we can make no such 
					assumption when the subordination is achieved with <em>as.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was working in the garden as he was washing the car</em><br />
					is somewhat unusual but possible and carries more or less 
					the same meaning although because the conjunction is also 
					used causally might be interpreted as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because he was washong the car, mshe was working in the garden.</em><br />
					Additionally,<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was living in London as he died</em><br />
					is simply not possible because the sense of <em>as</em> is
					<em>at that precise time</em> and that is not carried by the 
					progressive tense form in the sentence and.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *As I want to talk to him he's always 
					too busy</em><br />
					is also malformed because the sense of <em>as</em> is 
					confined to a single rather then repeated event or state.</li>
					<li><em>as soon as</em><br />
					is an emphatic form of <em>as</em> and carries a little more 
					strength.&nbsp; It cannot, however, be used as a substitute 
					except in the first sense so we allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left as soon as he arrived</em><br />
					to carry the sense of immediacy.&nbsp; However:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She was working in the garden as soon 
					as he was washing the car</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was living in London as soon as he 
					died</em><br />
					are both disallowed for the same reasons that the single 
					form <em>as</em> is not allowed.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?As soon as I want to talk to him he's 
					always too busy</em><br />
					is only marginally acceptable and implies <em>at the moment 
					when I decide</em> which is unusual.</li>
					<li><em>while<br />
					</em>can only be used to link progressive or background 
					(continuous) states so if we produce:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She left while he arrived</em><br />
					the sentence is malformed.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was working in the garden while 
					he was washing the car</em><br />
					is perfectly acceptable because both events are progressive 
					and that is the usual use of this conjunction.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was living in London while he 
					died</em><br />
					is another malformed sentence because the verb <em>die</em> 
					is punctual in this sense and is not perceived as referring 
					to a long-duration event (although it can).<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *While I want to talk to him he's 
					always too busy</em><br />
					is also malformed because although <em>while</em> can be 
					used to refer to a background continual state, it cannot 
					refer to the iterative (repeated) sense of <em>whenever</em> which is carried by
					<em>when</em> in this example.</li>
					<li><em>whenever</em><br />
					refers to iterative events and cannot be used to refer to 
					one-off or progressive events so:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left whenever he arrived</em><br />
					can only refer to a habitual response to a repeated event.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was working in the garden 
					whenever he was washing the car</em><br />
					results in a similar and quite unusual sense of a repeated, 
					long-duration event rather than a singled pair of 
					progressive actions.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was living in London whenever he 
					died</em><br />
					is clearly nonsensical because dying cannot be repeated<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever I want to talk to him he's 
					always too busy</em><br />
					is the usual sense of the subordinator and refers to a 
					repeated pair of events.<br />
					Finally, <em>whilst</em> is a synonym of <em>while</em> and 
					commonly misused when the simpler form <em>while</em> is 
					stylistically preferable.&nbsp; (The word is, in fact, an 
					old genitive form of <em>while</em> and functionally 
					redundant in English.)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>while</em> and <em>whilst</em><br />
				also function as contrastive conjunctions and can imply 
				concession as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While / Whilst he isn't rich, he has 
				enough to live comfortably</em></li>
				<li><em>hardly .... when, no sooner ... than, scarcely ... when</em><br />
				are synonymous in most cases but they share a characteristic of 
				other negative adverbials in insisting on an alteration to word 
				ordering making a question form with <em>do, did, does</em> or 
				by inversion of auxiliary verb and main verb as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sooner had he arrived than she left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardly had he arrived when she left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarcely did he arrive when she left</em><br />
				and all suggest an almost simultaneous pair of events.<br />
				The last example here is slightly unusual because these 
				subordinators usually occur with past perfect tense forms.&nbsp; 
				The structure is:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp; No sooner / 
				Hardly / Scarcely </span></em><span class="style_black">+ past 
				perfect + past simple</span><br />
				None of these can be used with long-duration or progressive 
				events because by their nature they refer to two virtually 
				simultaneous events.&nbsp; So:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>No sooner was she working in the garden when he was 
				washing the car</em><br />
				etc. are not allowed and we cannot allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Hardly was he living in London when he 
				died<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Scarcely do I want to talk to him than he's always busy</em></li>
				<li><em>before, after</em><br />
				are straightforward and translate precisely into many languages, 
				causing few conceptual and no structural issues.</li>
				<li><em>immediately, now that</em> and <em>once</em> are not 
				exactly synonymous<br />
				The first implies <em>at almost the same exact time</em> (rather 
				like <em>as</em>) but <em>once</em> implies <em>shortly 
				afterwards and because</em> so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left immediately he arrived</em><br />
				implies a very short time thereafter but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left once he arrived</em><br />
				implies a longer time gap and possibly a causal connection.&nbsp; 
				For that reason, the past perfect form is often preferred, as 
				in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left once he had arrived<br />
				</em>The conjunction <em>now (that)</em> is frequently used to 
				in present perfect constructions to embed the past event in the 
				present and signal the causal nature of the two states as in, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now (that) Mary has arrived, we can 
				start.</em></li>
				<li><em>since</em><br />
				occurs both as a preposition as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has lived here since the war</em><br />
				and as a subordinating conjunction as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has lived here since the war finished</em><br />
				The conjunction may also occur in a non-finite clause structure 
				as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since finishing university he has been 
				unemployed</em><br />
				and that is an unusual role for a subordinating conjunction.<br />
				Few languages have a parallel structure like this.</li>
				<li><em>till</em> and <em>until</em><br />
				are synonymous although the first is far less formal (and 
				sometimes further reduced to <em>til</em>).&nbsp; Both mean <em>
				up to the time when</em>.</li>
				<li><em>whereupon</em><br />
				is quite an unusual conjunction which always occurs linked to 
				the second, subordinated clause because, semantically, it 
				strongly implies a causal connection as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrived, whereupon she left</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Not listed above are some common noun phrases which perform a 
			subordinating grammatical function including, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (At) The moment he arrived she left</em><br />
			(compare <em>as, as soon as</em>)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time I want to talk to him he's always 
			busy</em><br />
			(compare <em>whenever</em>)</p>
			<p>Temporal subordinators vary in whether they allow non-finite or 
			reduced clause constructions and that is set out below in the 
			restrictions section.</p>

					<td class="auto-style2"><h3><a name="ordering"></a>Clause ordering: theme and rheme</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Because subordinators are linked to the clause (unlike 
			coordinators which usually come between the clauses), the ordering 
			of the clauses can be reversed and still produce a sensible 
			sentence.&nbsp; We can have therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>
			Whereas most of the children arrived late</em></strong></span><em>, 
			Mary was on time<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>
			Mary was on time</em></strong></span><em> whereas most of the 
			children arrived late<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>
			Wherever I went</em></strong></span><em>, I encountered nothing but 
			friendliness<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>I 
			encountered nothing but friendliness</em></strong></span><em> 
			wherever I went<br />
			</em>and so on.</p>
			<p>However, in English, word ordering determines what the reader / 
			hearer will understand as the theme of the sentence.&nbsp; Above, 
			the themes are highlighted <span class="style_black"><strong><em>in 
			black</em></strong></span>.&nbsp; What follows the theme is called 
			the rheme and that, incidentally, frequently forms the theme of the 
			next sentence, maintaining coherence and cohesion in a text.</p>
			<p>When subordinate and main clauses are reversed, so are the 
			associated themes and rhemes.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>Because she 
			wanted to meet his mother</strong></span>, she travelled up to 
			London<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>She 
			travelled up to London</strong></span> because she wanted to meet 
			his mother<br />
			</em>are not simply alternative ways of saying the same thing as the 
			themes (in <span class="style_black"><strong><em>black</em></strong></span>) 
			show.<br />
			Theme and rheme are identified by word order and word order is not 
			selected at random.<br />
			Speakers and writers will select the word order to match what they 
			perceive as the theme of the sentence.<br />
			Naturally, the first sentence would be followed by something about 
			London such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While she was there, she took the opportunity 
			to visit the British Museum<br />
			</em>and the second sentence would be more naturally followed by 
			something about the mother such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was delighted to see her<br />
			</em>If we follow the first sentence with something more appropriate 
			to the second we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because she wanted to meet his mother she 
			travelled up to London.&nbsp; She was delighted to see her<br />
			</em>in which we are left in a state of ambiguity regarding who was 
			delighted to see whom.<br />
			If we follow the second sentence with the theme appropriate to the 
			first, we get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She travelled up to London because she wanted to meet his 
			mother.&nbsp; While she was there, she took the opportunity to visit 
			the British Museum<br />
			</em>which is only marginally coherent.</p>
			<p>The other indicator of what is perceived as the most important 
			information is to note that pitch will rise and fall most obviously 
			on <em>London</em> and <em>mother</em> respectively, signalling that 
			this is the new information.</p>
			<p><strong>Reversing the clauses has a real and important 
			communicative effect.</strong></p>

			<p>There are four major ways in which English can signal a 
			subordination of one clause to another without using a conjunction 
			(although conjunctions are by far the most frequent).</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em><strong>wh</strong></em><strong>-words</strong></dt>
				<dd>Frequently, <em>wh-word</em>s occur in pronoun and adverb relative clauses.&nbsp; They function to split the main clause, 
				inserting the relative clause into the sentence like this:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shop, where you bought the 
				coat, has closed.</em></span><br />
				There is, however, a crucial difference because adverb relative 
				clauses perform a <strong>coordinating</strong>, not 
				subordinating function and can be removed to leave two 
				well-formed independent clauses so we can rephrase:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the moment when he realised the 
				truth</em><br />
				as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the moment.&nbsp; He realised 
				the truth.</em><br />
				which, although the sense is lost to some degree, results in two 
				potentially independent clauses.<br />
				When, on the other hand, the relative pronoun is removed from a sentence 
				the structure's subordinating function becomes apparent because 
				removing it from, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was the man who lent us the money</em><br />
				leaves nonsense.<br />
				The subordination occurs with both defining and non-defining 
				relative pronoun clauses:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people who came to the party 
				were genuinely friendly.</em></span><br />
				The relative pronoun <em>that</em> is used in a similar way:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog that bit him belongs to 
				the neighbours.</em></span><br />
				When omitting the relative pronoun is allowed (i.e., when it stands as 
				the object in a defining clause, subordination still occurs<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man we asked was very helpful.</em></span><br />
				There is a guide to relative pronoun clauses 
				on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
				</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>that </em>clauses</strong></dt>
				<dd>The word <em>that</em> is not in itself in any lists of 
				subordinating conjunctions.&nbsp; It is, however, an <strong>
				indicator </strong>of subordination and occurs, for example, in 
				sentences such as:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he was 
				drunk was obvious to everyone</em></span><br />
				where it functions as the subject of a copular verb<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect that 
				she will be late</em></span><br />
				where it functions as the object of the verb<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The result is 
				that we can't afford it</em></span><br />
				where it functions as the complement of a copular verb.<br />
				That clauses do a lot of other things in the language, too.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>what</em></strong> clauses</dt>
				<dd>The word<em> what</em> can also act as an <strong>indicator</strong> 
				of subordination.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">She told me what she wanted</span></em><br />
				where it is the object of the verb<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What he did 
				made the situation more difficult</em></span><br />
				where it is the subject of the verb<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outcome is 
				what we expected all along</em></span><br />
				where it functions as the complement of the copular verb.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Inversions</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is a fairly rare occurrence in English in conditional 
				sentences but in formal writing may be encountered.&nbsp; The 
				usual items are <em>had, were</em> and the putative <em>should</em>:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had I known you were coming, I 
				would have got in some beer.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Were you to try a bit harder, I feel sure you'd understand.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Should you find yourself in any trouble, call me at once.</em></span></dd>

			<p><strong>Non-finite forms</strong> are those in which the verb is 
			not conjugated to show person, tense or number.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He came because I asked</em><br />
			contains two finite clauses, the second subordinated and both of 
			which contain a conjugated verb showing tense (in English; in other 
			languages the verb form might also show person and number).<br />
			However, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having been asked, he came</em><br />
			contains two clauses, again, but the first is non-finite because it 
			does not show tense in the verb form in the conventional way.</p>
			<p>This is a large category.&nbsp; If you have followed the 
				guide to clause structure, you'll know that independent clauses 
				cannot be non-finite but that a non-finite clause is almost 
				always a marker of subordination.&nbsp; If the terms confuse 
				you, there is a guide to finite and non-finite clauses on this 
				site linked in the list of related guides at the end.&nbsp; Here are two examples:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came (in 
				order) to help</em></span> 
				(non-finite <em>to-</em>infinitive clause)<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opening the door, he saw the fire 
				had burnt out</em></span> (non-finite <em>-ing</em> clause)<br />These sorts of subordination may be replaced by the use of a 
				subordinator.<br /><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came so that I can help<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				When he opened the door, he saw the fire had burnt out</em></span></p>
			<p>Non-finite adverbial clauses generally function as</p>
			<ol class="auto-style15">
				<li>adjuncts 
			(being integral to the sentence), for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John, <span class="style_black">having no 
				work on</span>, was happy to come and help</em></li>
				<li>disjuncts (showing the speaker / writer's attitude to what 
				is being said), for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Personally 
				speaking</span>, I have no objections</em></li>
				<li>conjuncts (linking two clauses or sentences), for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to be difficult to do within 
				the budget.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">That having been said</span>, we 
				may be able to manage</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are five ways in which non-finite adverbial clauses can be 
			used to subordinate.&nbsp; As is the case for subordinating 
			conjunctions, they answer questions such as <em>when?, where?, with 
			what?, how?, what if?</em> and so on.&nbsp; When these clauses are 
			used without a conjunction, they may be referred to as absolute 
			clauses.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>The bare infinitive</strong><br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than <span class="style_black">do
				</span>it himself, he called in a 
				builder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sooner than <span class="style_black">have</span> a problem later, she made sure it was well 
				done<br />
				</em>These clause types are actually quite rare and usually 
				signal exclusiveness.<br />
				All such non-finite constructions can be  rephrased using finite 
				forms with subordinators:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because he didn't want to do it himself, 
				he called in a builder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She made sure it was well done so that she didn't have a 
				problem later</em></li>
				<li><strong>The <em>to-infinitive<br />
				</em></strong>For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">To see</span> better, he stood on tiptoe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon <span class="style_black">to be given </span>a pay rise, she splashed out on a new car</em><br />
				In some cases, the infinitive form is actually an abbreviated form of <em>in order to</em> 
				and answers the question <em>why?<br />
				</em>The connection is usually causal.<br />All such non-finite constructions can be  rephrased using 
				finite forms with subordinators:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that he could see better, he stood on tiptoe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because she was soon to be given a pay rise, she splashed out 
				on a new car.</em></li>
				<li><strong>The -</strong><em><strong>ing</strong></em><strong> 
				participle</strong><br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Having</span> no work, he slowly spent his 
				savings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Watching</span> TV, being bored and not having anything better to 
				do, I saw something about it on the news</em><br />
				In almost all cases, the form implies a causal or temporal 
				connection.<br />
				All such non-finite constructions can be  rephrased using finite 
				forms with subordinators:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spent his savings because he had no 
				work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was watching TV because I was bored and didn't have 
				anything better to do, I saw something interesting about it on 
				the news<br />
				</em>Misuse of the -<em>ing</em> participle in non-finite 
				clauses often results in what is called a dangling or unattached 
				participle.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting on the bus, John's wallet fell 
				from his pocket<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asking my students, they tell me they find non-finite clauses 
				difficult to use</em><br />
				are semantically and grammatically flawed because it was not the 
				<em>wallet</em> that got on the bus or the <em>students</em> who did the asking.&nbsp; 
				To avoid this kind of error, the participle and the main clause 
				verb need to have the same subject.&nbsp; The use of a finite 
				clause solves the issue:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While he was getting on the bus ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I have asked my students ...<br />
				</em>The rule of attachment to the same subject is often relaxed 
				so we allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Being</span> Friday, the staff left 
				early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Being</span> optimistic, Mary will 
				be able to do the job<br />
				</em>(which could be ambiguous depending on whether the speaker 
				or <em>Mary</em> is the optimist).</li>
				<li><strong>The -</strong><em><strong>ed</strong></em><strong> 
				participle</strong><br />
				(This is a slight misnomer in that irregular verb forms do not 
				take -<em>ed</em> endings so the form is often called the -<em>en</em> 
				participle.)<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tired and <span class="style_black">worn</span> out, he went to bed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Opened</span>, the box revealed its secrets</em><br />
				Again, in almost all cases, the form implies a causal or 
				temporal connection.<br />
				All such non-finite constructions can be  rephrased using finite 
				forms with subordinators:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he felt tired and was worn out, he 
				went to bed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as it was opened, the box revealed its secrets</em></li>
				<li><strong>Verbless clauses</strong><br />
				(This appears to be a contradiction if one assumes that all 
				clauses contain verbs but can be analysed as ones in which the 
				verb is omitted and understood.)<br />
				For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">In sunshine or in rain</span>, the garden was tended beautifully</em><br />
				(= <em>Whether there was sunshine or rain ...</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Acceptable or not</span>, the work must be paid 
				for</em><br />
				(= <em>If it is acceptable or not ...</em>)<br />
				Some verbless clauses, known as supplementing clauses, refer to 
				the whole of the preceding clause and omit all of it, including 
				the verb.&nbsp; They are usually afterthoughts or additions to a 
				statement and are avoided in formal writing.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had finished the report &ndash; 
				<span class="style_black">scarcely</span></em><br />
				(= <em>I finished the report but only scarcely finished it</em>)<br />
				Some verbless clauses, known as appended clauses, apply to part 
				of the preceding clause only and are slightly more formal, being 
				used in written and spoken forms.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The child was tired, <span class="style_black">perhaps overtired</span></em><br />
				(= <em>The child was tired.&nbsp; The child was perhaps overtired</em>)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Non-finite clauses can also be used in the conventional way with 
			subordinating conjunctions.&nbsp; Here are some examples of all 
			eight types of subordination in the table above:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Conditional</strong></dt>
				<dd>
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">When known</span>, the cost should be published</em><br />
			(= <em>If it is known, the cost should be published</em>)<br />
			There is some ambiguity with a temporal connection here because it 
			could mean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>As soon as the cost is known it should be published.</em></dd>
				<dt>
			<strong>Concessive</strong></dt>
				<dd>
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Although proven</span>, the accusation was ignored 
			by the court</em><br />
			(= <em>Although it was proven, the accusation was ignored by the 
			court</em>)</dd>
				<dt>
			<strong>Causal / Resultative</strong></dt>
				<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_black">Because of being tired</span>, he left early</em><br />
			(= <em>Because he was tired, he left early</em>)</dd>
				<dt>
			<strong>Temporal</strong></dt>
				<dd>
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="style_black"><em>When digging</em></span><em> in the garden, he found the coin</em><br />
			(= When he was digging in the garden he found the coin)</dd>
				<dt>
			<strong>Exclusive</strong></dt>
				<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_black">When not including John</span>, we'll be eight for dinner</em><br />
			(= <em>If we don't include John, we'll be eight for dinner</em>)</dd>
				<dt>
			<strong>Spatial</strong></dt>
				<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_black">Wherever placed</span>, it's going to be unsuitable</em><br />
			(= <em>Wherever it is placed, it's going to be unsuitable</em>)</dd>
				<dt>
			<strong>Comparative / Contrastive</strong></dt>
				<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_black">As if stung</span>, he jumped suddenly</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (=<em>As if he had been stung, he jumped suddenly</em>)</dd>
				<dt>
			<strong>Proportional</strong></dt>
				<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_black">The more extreme</span>, the more likely he was to hold the view</em><br />
			(= <em>The more extreme a view was, the more likely he was to hold 
			it</em>)</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The sorts of non-finite clauses used to express temporal or 
			causal relationships can give rise to some ambiguity of meaning.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being in New York, she went to see him</em><br />
			could mean:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; While she was in New York, she went to see him</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because she was in New York, she went to see 
			him.</em></p>

			<p>Subordination allows for pronoun referencing to be either 
			cataphoric (referring forward) or anaphoric (referring back) and 
			that distinguishes it from coordination which only allows anaphoric 
			referencing.&nbsp; We can allow, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary was tired and she stopped arguing</em><br />
			because the reference for the pronoun <em>she</em> has been stated, 
			but we cannot allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was tired and Mary stopped arguing</em><br />
			unless <em>she</em> and <em>Mary</em> refer to different people.<br />
			However, with subordination we can allow both sorts of referencing 
			so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because she was tired, Mary stopped arguing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because Mary was tired, she stopped arguing</em><br />
			are both acceptable.<br />
			Equally, we can allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John argued although he was tired</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he was tired, John argued.<br />
			</em>In other words, in sentences with subordinated clauses, the 
			assumption will always be that the pronoun reference and the noun 
			refer to the same entity whichever way the referencing goes.</p>

			<p>Features of connected speech affect how subordinated clauses
