		</table>
			<p>Note that this classification is one used in so-called 
			traditional grammar.&nbsp; From other points of view, e.g., 
			functional grammar, all sentences which consist of more than one 
			clause may be defined as complex sentences (Lock, 1996:247).&nbsp; We retain the 
			distinction here but it is not a necessary one for what follows.</p>
			<p>The following examples show that compound and complex sentences 
			are not, of course, confined to two or three clauses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>I went to the cinema and met John but he was bored by the 
				film so he left early.</em></li>
				<li><em>I went to the cinema because I was bored and had nothing 
				better to do as I'd finished my essay and already sent it in.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In sentence 1. we have a compound of<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; went to the cinema<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; met John</em><br />
			This is followed by a further independent clause<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he was bored<br />
			</em>and a subordinate clause<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so he left early</em>.</p>
			<p>In sentence 2., we have the independent clause<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the 
			cinema<br />
			</em>followed by a subordinate clause<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because I was 
			bored<br />
			</em>and that has a further subordinate clause<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as I'd 
			finished my essay<br />
			</em>which is linked to another independent clause<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and already sent it in<br />
			</em>The final clause is incomplete because the subject and 
			auxiliary verb (<em>I had</em>) have been ellipted.&nbsp; We may do 
			this only if they apply to both clauses and only with coordinating 
			conjunctions.</p>
			<p>Here's 
			another way to understand it.</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>
				<p class="auto-style31">independent clauses are in&nbsp;<span class="auto-style27"> blue 
				boxes&nbsp;</span></p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p class="auto-style31">dependent clauses are in&nbsp;<span class="auto-style28"> green 
				boxes&nbsp;</span></p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p class="auto-style31">coordinating conjunctions are in&nbsp;<span class="auto-style29">
				 red diamonds&nbsp;</span></p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p class="auto-style31">subordinating conjunctions are in&nbsp;<span class="auto-style30">
				 orange diamonds&nbsp;</span></p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style50">
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style54" valign="top">
					Sentence 1</td>
					<td class="auto-style53" valign="top">
					Sentence 2</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style52" valign="top">
					<img alt="1" height="67" src="../../imagesgraphics/complex1.png" width="465" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style51" valign="top">
					<img alt="2" height="100" src="../../imagesgraphics/complex2.png" width="465" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>An alternative representation of these sentences in which only 
			coordinators are seen as independent elements is:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style50">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style52" valign="top">
					<img alt="complex" height="373" src="../../imagesgraphics/complex_2.png" width="465" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style51" valign="top">
					<img alt="complex" height="304" src="../../imagesgraphics/complex_1.png" width="465" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>And it is clear that the first sentence contains three 
			coordinated main clauses and one subordinate clause but the second 
			sentence contains one main clause which has two coordinated 
			subordinate clauses, one of which also has two coordinated 
			subordinate clauses.<br />
			This is by no means unusual and takes a little bit of unpacking to 
			understand the sense and what see depends on what.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="claws" height="166" src="../../images/birds_claws250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style34"><h2>Types of clause</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We have distinguished two clause types in the above:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Independent clauses</strong><br />
				<img alt="dog" height="133" src="../../images/animals_dog_independent200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>These are not dependent structurally on other clauses and 
				can stand alone, potentially, at least.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the 
				cinema<br />
				</em>is perfectly comprehensible and the reason need not 
				be given.<br />
				This sentence contains two independent clauses, 
				highlighted in green:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style28">&nbsp;I took the bus to the station </span> 
				&nbsp;and <span class="auto-style28">&nbsp;I just managed to catch the train </span></em><br />
				In a compound sentence such as this, the coordinating 
				conjunction is not tied to one or other of the clauses so if we 
				reverse the clauses it remains between them.&nbsp; There is 
				however, often a semantic rather than syntactical reason for the 
				ordering of the clauses.<br />
				We can reverse the clauses in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I washed the car and cleaned the house</em><br />
				and make the sentence as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cleaned the house and washed the car</em><br />
				without making any real difference to the sense but we cannot do 
				that with, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was tired and went home</em><br />
				without affecting the meaning because:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went home and was tired</em><br />
				has a different sense.<br />
				The reason is that the conjunction here signals some kind of 
				causal relationship between the events.<br />
				When two independent clauses are joined in this way, the subject 
				is often omitted from the second clause so we allow, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<em><span class="auto-style28">&nbsp;I took the bus to the station </span>&nbsp;and <span class="auto-style28">&nbsp;just managed to catch the train </span></em><br />
				With coordinated clauses, we can also often ellipt other 
				elements so we can also have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<em><span class="auto-style28">&nbsp;I can's see it </span>&nbsp;or
				<span class="auto-style28">&nbsp;hear it </span></em><br />
				in which the auxiliary verb and the subject are ellipted from 
				the second clause.<br />
				For more on what can and cannot be ellipted, see the guide to 
				conjunction, linked below.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Dependent clauses<br />
				<img alt="hands" height="133" src="../../images/hand_holding_child200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>These are also called subordinate 
				clauses for the reason that they are structurally or 
				semantically dependent on 
				other clauses and cannot usually stand alone.&nbsp; Here's an 
				example with the dependent or subordinate clause highlighted in 
				blue:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style27"><em>&nbsp;When I came home </em></span><em> &nbsp;I saw that 
				the window was broken.</em><br />
				In spoken language, of course, a dependent clause can stand 
				alone when the independent clause is understood.&nbsp; For 
				example,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are you so late?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Because the bus broke down.<br />
				</em>In complex sentences the conjunction is tied to the 
				subordinated clause and moves with it when the ordering is 
				reversed.&nbsp; We can reverse the ordering in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came to the pub 
				<span class="auto-style27">because she wanted to meet Mary</span><br />
				</em>to have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="auto-style27">Because she wanted to meet Mary</span>, she came to the pub<br />
				</em>but the word
				<em>because </em>travels with the clause it introduces.<br />
				Similarly with our first example we can reverse the clauses and 
				have<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I saw that the window was broken</em><span class="auto-style27"><em>&nbsp;when I came home</em></span><em>.</em><br />
				and the subordinating conjunction, <em>when</em>, moves with the 
				subordinate clause.<br />
				When we join an independent clause to a dependent clause it is 
				not usually possible to omit the subject so we do not allow, e.g.:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<em>*</em><span class="auto-style27"><em> When I came home </em>
				</span><em>&nbsp;saw that 
				the window was broken.<br />
				</em>Quite frequently, however, for semantic and logical reasons 
				rather than grammatical ones, it is not possible to reverse the 
				clause ordering so, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was late,
				<span class="auto-style27">so I missed my connection</span></em><br />
				cannot sensibly be rendered as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<span class="auto-style27">So I missed 
				my connection</span>, the train was late</em></dd>

			<p>If you are unsure about the difference between the various types 
			of conjunction in English, follow the
			guide to conjunction on 
			this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>
			<p>In traditional grammars conjunction is the name given to clausal 
			connections.&nbsp; Here, we'll look at things from a slightly 
			different, functional, angle and distinguish between <strong>linking</strong> and 
			<strong>binding</strong>.</p>
			
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style34">
			<h3>Linking</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>When two clauses are <strong>equal</strong>, they can be linked.&nbsp; Here are some 
			examples with the link highlighted in red.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Stop nagging </em><span class="auto-style29"><em>;</em></span><em>&nbsp;I'll do it tomorrow.</em></li>
				<li><em>You can stay here with me </em>
				<span class="auto-style29"><em>&nbsp;or </em></span><em>&nbsp;you can go 
				with your father.</em></li>
				<li><em>He gave it to me because I wanted it </em>
				<span class="auto-style29"><em>&nbsp;and
				</em></span><em>&nbsp;he had no use for 
				it.</em></li>
				<li><em>While I was walking the dog </em><span class="auto-style29"><em> 
				&nbsp;and </em></span><em>&nbsp;thinking about the day ahead, I ran into an 
				old friend.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The rule is simple:<br />
			For linking to occur, <strong>both</strong> 
			clauses must be either independent or dependent.</p>
			<p>In examples 1 
			and 2 the clauses are both independent.<br />
			In 3 and 4, they are 
			both dependent.&nbsp; The main clauses in those sentences are <em>He 
			gave it to me</em> and <em>I ran into an old friend</em> 
			respectively.</p>
			<p>We can use punctuation, e.g., a semi-colon or dash, to link or we can employ a conjunction.&nbsp; 
			There are examples of both above.</p>
			<h4>Sequencing linked clauses</h4>
			<p>Sometimes, the clauses can be reversed without changing the 
			meaning.&nbsp; In sentence 3, for example, there is little 
			difference if we say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave it to me because I wanted it </em><span class="auto-style29"><em>&nbsp;and
			</em></span><em>&nbsp;he had no use for 
				it<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave it to me because he had no use for 
				it&nbsp;<span class="auto-style29"> and </span>&nbsp;I wanted it</em>.<br />
			You can see that <em><span class="auto-style29">&nbsp;and </span></em>&nbsp;clearly belongs to neither clause because it <strong>remains between 
			them when they are reversed</strong>.&nbsp; That is a defining 
			characteristic of a coordinating conjunction, but not the only one.</p>
			<p>At other times ordering is important either because:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style32">
				<li>There is a logical chronological relationship which is 
				disturbed by moving clauses around.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went home and had a long, hot bath.<br />
				</em>is not at all the same 
				as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a long hot bath and went home.</em></li>
				<li>There is an implied causal relationship.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was angry and walked out in a huff.<br />
				</em>is not the same 
				as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked out in a huff and was angry.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Subject omission in linked clauses</h4>
			<p>In linked clauses, we have a frequent example of the omission of 
			the subject.&nbsp; If the subject of the verbs in both clauses is 
			unchanged, it can be omitted.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went out and I caught the bus<br />
			</em>means the same as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			went out and caught the bus</em>.<br />
			This cannot happen if we change the subject of the clauses so, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went out and she stayed at home</em><br />
			we cannot omit the second subject without changing the meaning 
			radically.</p>
			<h4>Auxiliary omission in linked clauses</h4>
			<p>By the same token, we can ellipt the auxiliary verb (whether it is 
			modal or primary) providing it applies to both verbs.&nbsp; In these 
			examples, the subject is also omitted because it applies to both 
			verb phrases.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I must do my homework and clean the flat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had washed the car and put it in the garage</em></p>

			<h3>Binding</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>When clauses are <strong>unequal</strong>, they are connected by 
			binding.</p>
			<p>The simplest example is when we have an independent and dependent 
			clause such as:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>The room was a mess <span class="auto-style33">&nbsp;because&nbsp;</span> 
				I'd been too busy to clear up.</em></li>
				<li><em><span class="auto-style33">&nbsp;When&nbsp;</span> I'd finished, it 
				looked a lot better.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In which the main clauses are <em>The room was a mess</em> and
			<em>it looked a lot better</em> respectively.</p>
			<h4>Sequencing in bound clauses</h4>
			<p>Reversing the clauses is possible:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3"><em><span class="auto-style33">&nbsp;Because&nbsp;</span> I'd 
				been too busy to clear up, the room was a mess.</em></li>
				<li><em>It looked a lot better <span class="auto-style33">&nbsp;when&nbsp;</span> 
				I'd finished.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>However, when clauses are linked in this way the 
			conjunction <strong>moves with the clause</strong>.&nbsp; That is to 
			say it is part of it.&nbsp; That is a defining characteristic of 
			subordinating conjunctions.</p>
			<p>Sequencing can be even more flexible with the dependent clause 
			embedded in the independent clause:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5"><span class="auto-style33"><em>&nbsp;Although&nbsp;</em> </span>
				<em>&nbsp;not 
				a good one, the idea was accepted by the board.</em></li>
				<li><em>The idea,&nbsp;</em><span class="auto-style33"><em> although 
				</em> </span><em>&nbsp;not a 
				good one, was accepted by the board.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>We can also have sentences in which a dependent clause has its 
			own dependent clause.&nbsp; This frequently occurs when causal 
			relationships or relative clauses are used.&nbsp; For example,</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="7"><em>The room was a mess&nbsp;</em><span class="auto-style33"><em> 
				because </em></span><em>&nbsp;I'd been too busy to clear up&nbsp;</em><span class="auto-style33"><em> 
				while </em></span><em>&nbsp;I'd been working.</em></li>
				<li><em>I went to the cinema in the next town&nbsp;</em><span class="auto-style33"><em> 
				because </em></span><em>&nbsp;it was the only one&nbsp;</em><span class="auto-style33"><em> 
				which </em></span><em>&nbsp;was showing the film&nbsp;</em><span class="auto-style33"><em> 
				that </em></span><em>&nbsp;I wanted to see.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Binding without conjunctions</h4>
			<p>If you have followed the guide to conjunction, you'll be familiar 
			with the range of subordinating (and other) conjunctions used to 
			bind independent and dependent (or subordinate) clauses.&nbsp; 
			However, there are other ways to bind clauses together.&nbsp; For 
			example</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="9"><em>Had you asked, I would have helped.</em></li>
				<li><em>By taking a taxi, I managed not to be late.</em></li>
				<li><em>Arriving at the meeting, I saw that lots of people were 
				going to be late.</em></li>
				<li><em>The meeting which I attended was not very useful.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In 9, it is word order alone which connects the ideas and the 
			contingent conjunction (<em>if, supposing</em> etc.) has been 
			ellipted.<br />In 10, the use of the preposition <em>by</em> and a non-finite participle,
			<em>taking</em>, 
			connects the ideas.<br />
			In 11, the non-finite participle alone is enough.<br />
			In 12, we have a relative pronoun to connect the clauses.</p>
			<h4>Subject omission in bound clauses</h4>
			<p>In linked clauses, we can omit the subject of the second clause 
			if it is the same for both verbs as we saw above.<br />
			This is not 
			usually the case with bound clauses even when the subject 
			remains unaltered.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I had worked hard so that I could leave early</em><br />
			but we do not allow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*I had worked hard so that could leave early<br />
			</em>and we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She did the work because she needed the money</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She did the work because needed the money.<br />
			</em>With some subordinating conjunctions, however, subject omission 
			is allowable so we may have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although exhausted, she worked on<br />
			</em>Nevertheless, including the subject and the verb in both 
			clauses is never wrong and often the only correct alternative.</p>

			<p>There are separate guides to catenative (i.e., joined together in 
			a series) verbs and modification on this site, linked in the list of 
			related guides at the end so only brief mention will be made here.&nbsp; 
			Here's an example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara" style="width: 676px">HYDROUSA intends to set 
			up, demonstrate and optimize innovative on-site nature-based 
			solutions to recover fresh water, nutrients and energy from 
			wastewater, rainwater, groundwater, atmospheric water vapor and

			<span class="auto-style42">http://www.ekathimerini.com/230601/article/ekathimerini/business/circular-water-economy-introduced-on-greek-islands</span></p>
			<p>There's no doubt that this is a complex sentence but complexity 
			is being achieved in four separate ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Pre-and post-modification of noun phrases</strong><ol class="greenbullet">
					<li><em>on-site nature-based + <span class="style_black">
					<strong>solutions</strong></span></em></li>

				<li><strong>Verb listing</strong><ol>
					<li class="greenbullet"><em>set up, demonstrate and optimize</em></li>

				<li><strong>Compounding</strong><ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>adjectives: <em>on-site, nature-based</em></li>
					<li>nouns: <em>wastewater, rainwater, groundwater, seawater</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Catenation</strong><ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>the first verb <em>intend</em> is catenated with the 
					three which follow <em>to set up, demonstrate and optimize</em></li>
					<li>those three verbs are all catenated with the infinitive <em>to

					complex subordinator <em>in order to</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>

			<p>When four different ways of making complexity are used together 
			in this way it becomes quite hard for learners of the language to 
			extract the core meaning.</p>

			<h3>Given and new information</h3>
			
			
			<p>There is a tendency in English to end-focus new information,

				<li><em>When I had finished my essay, I went to meet my friends.</em></li>

			<span class="style_brown">In 1, a sentence of two equal independent

			<span class="style_brown">In 2, a dependent clause is followed by an 
			independent clause.&nbsp; The writing of the essay is assumed to be known to the 
				hearer / reader, and the new information, taking the recount 
				forward, follows this.<br />
			In 3, the key information is the timing of meeting friends.&nbsp; 
			The fact that it did not occur until the essay was finished is the 
			important new information.<br />If learners are unaware of this 
			phenomenon, they will often produce language which is unnatural or 
			difficult to follow.<br />
			Raising awareness of end-focus is

			<h3><a name="2a"></a>Conjunct vs. conjunction</h3>
			<p>What's gone wrong here?&nbsp;
			<a href="#2a" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'complexpara2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click when you have an answer</a>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>*I went to the cinema therefore I missed your call.</em></li>
				<li><em>*I was in London because of this I was able to see the 
				exhibition.</em></li>
				<li><em>*He came to the meeting additionally so did Mary.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p id="complexpara2" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
			<span class="style_brown">Many languages do not handle the 
			distinction between conjuncts, which lie outside the clause 
			structure, and subordinating conjunctions, which lie within the clause, in the 
			same way as English.<br />
			In 1, <em>therefore </em>is a conjunct and the sentence should be 
			rephrased either as two sentences:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the cinema.&nbsp; 
			Therefore, I missed your call<br />
			</em>or by using a real subordinating conjunction:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			went to the cinema so I missed your call</em>.<br />
			<br />
			Similarly, in sentences 2 and 3, the learner has tried to use 
			conjuncts, <em>because of this</em> and <em>additionally</em>, as if 
			they were conjunctions.&nbsp; The result is syntactically flawed.&nbsp; 
			Again, the sentences need to be rephrased and this can be done by making two separate sentences, linked by the 
			conjuncts:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in London.&nbsp; Because of this, I was 
			able to see the exhibition</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came to the meeting.&nbsp; Additionally, 
			so did Mary</em><br />
			Alternatively, the links need to be made with conjunctions:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in London so I was able to see the 
			exhibition<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to see the exhibition because I was in London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came to the meeting and so did Mary</em><br />
			Conjuncts often seem a good deal more formal, especially in spoken 
			texts.<br />
			For more about conjuncts, refer to 
			the guide 
			to adverbials or that to conjuncts only on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.</span></p>
			<h3><a name="3"></a>Repeated conjunctions</h3>
			<p>Some languages (e.g., most Chinese languages) mark the relationships between clauses twice and 
			speakers of those language may produce sentences such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I was in London so I could meet her.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Although it was hot but he wore a coat.</em></p>
			<h3>Finite and non-finite verb forms</h3>
			<p>What has gone wrong here?&nbsp;
			<a href="#3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'complexpara3',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have an answer</a>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>In order that getting to school on time he got up early.</em></li>
				<li><em>He worked hard so that making a lot of money.</em></li>
				<li><em>In spite of he worked so hard, he made very little 
				money.</em></li>
				<li><em>Without I had a satnav I would have been lost.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<div id="complexpara3" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
			<p >
			<span class="style_brown">There are three problem issues.&nbsp;
			Languages vary in this and it is unsurprising that the forms cause 
			serious difficulty:</span></p>
				<ol class="style_brown">
					<li><span class="style_brown">The conjunctions <em>as, 
			wherever, because, in order that, so that </em>and <em>as long as</em> 
			must be used with finite verb clauses.&nbsp; Sentence 1 is as 
			example of using <em>in order that</em> with a non-finite verb form and it's 
			wrong.&nbsp; It is correct to use <em>in order to</em> with a non-finite verb 
					form but that must be an infinitive.<br />We can have, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came because I enjoy parties</em><span class="style_underline"><strong><br />
					but not</strong></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I 
			came because enjoying parties</em>.</span></li>
					<li><span class="style_brown">Other conjunctions, such as 
					<em>while, since, until, although</em> 
			etc. can be used with finite <strong>and</strong> non-finite verb 
			phrases.&nbsp; We can have, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she arrived late, she was soon at work</em><span class="style_underline"><strong><br />
					and</strong></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although arriving late, she was soon at work</em>.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw him while I was getting off the bus</em><span class="style_underline"><strong><br />
					and</strong></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw 
			him while getting off the bus</em>.<br />
					The guide to subordination, linked below, has more on this 
					with greater exemplification.</span></li>
					<li><span class="style_brown">Prepositions, such as<em> 
					in, by, without, despite, in spite of, as a result of, 
					so as</em> 
					etc., can <strong>only</strong> be used with 
			non-finite verbs.<br />
					We can have, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By opening the window he managed to escape</em><strong><span class="style_underline"><br />
					but not</span></strong><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *By 
					he opened the window he managed to escape</em>.<br />
					and<br /><em>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					As a result of drinking too much, he forgot to ask her name</em><span class="style_underline"><strong><br />
					but not</strong></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *As a result of he drank too much he forgot to ask her name</em>.<br />
					The complex subordinators <em>in order to </em>and<em> so as
					to
					</em>can only be followed by an infinitive.&nbsp; Both 
					function as subordinating conjunctions in this respect, akin 
					to<em> because.&nbsp; </em>The difference is that 
					conjunctions proper (<em>because, so</em> etc.) must be 
					followed by a finite clause.&nbsp; So we can have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried (in order) to catch the 
					train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried so as to catch the train</em><br />
					but we do not allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I hurried because to catch the train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I hurried so to catch the train</em><br />
					The other prepositions, <em>in, by, without, despite, in 
					spite of </em>and<em> as a result of</em> also subordinate 
					in the same way as conjunctions but are followed by a noun 
					phrase or a non-finite -<em>ing</em> form of the verb.</span></li>
				</ol>
				<p><span class="style_brown">Non-finite verbs can appear without subjects so learners may not 
			know when they are needed and produce, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting 
				for my money, the man spoke to me</em>.<br />in which it is not clear who 
				exactly was waiting for my money.<br />
				The issues here is that we have what is called a dangling 
				participle and we are unsure of the intended subject of the 
				verb.<br />
				A more obvious example is:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While getting on the bus my wallet fell 
				out of my pocket</em><br />
				which makes it appear that <em>my wallet</em> rather than <em>I</em> 
				was getting on the bus.<br />
				There is an answer to a user's question about dangling 
				participles which you can access via the link to Language 
				questions on the left.</span></p>
