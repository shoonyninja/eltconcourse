			<p>There are separate guides to coordination and

			the attempt here is to separate the ideas before getting in to an 
			analysis of each.<br />
			The three guides in this area also deal with a number of issues covered in more detail 
			elsewhere such as conditionality and concession.&nbsp; You can track 
			other guides to the area via
			the index to the section 
			on syntax: phrases, clauses and sentences also linked in the list of 
			related guides at the end.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>This is the traditional analysis and one which you will find in 
			many teachers' grammars and those written for learners.&nbsp; It is 
			only accurate as far as it goes.</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>Coordination involves the joining together of two 
				potentially independent clauses.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>I was unhappy and I left<br />
				I was unhappy but I stayed<br />
				She was unhappy so she left<br />
				She can stay or she can leave<br />
				</em></span>Two notes:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>In all these cases, the coordinating conjunction 
					(hereinafter simply <strong>coordinator</strong>) can be 
					replaced by <em>and</em> or removed altogether and leave two 
					independent clauses (although some sense is lost, the new 
					simple sentences remain comprehensible and grammatically 
					acceptable).<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was unhappy.&nbsp; I left.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I was unhappy.&nbsp; I stayed.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					She was unhappy.&nbsp; She left.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					She can stay.&nbsp; She can leave.</em></span></li>
					<li>It is not possible to move the coordinating conjunction 
					and an attempt to do so results in ungrammaticality:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *And I was unhappy I left<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*But I stayed I was unhappy<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*So she left she was unhappy<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*Or she can stay she can leave</em></span><br />
					The coordinator must come between the two clauses which are 
					being joined together to make a compound sentence.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Subordination, on the other hand, is an asymmetrical 
				relationship between two clauses with one, as the name suggests, 
				being subordinate to and relying on an independent clause for 
				its meaning.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I left because I was unhappy<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I stayed although I was unhappy<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She left since she was unhappy<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She can either stay or she can leave</span><br />
				</em>Two notes:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>Only one of the clauses can stand alone (i.e., function 
					independently) and make a grammatically acceptable sentence.<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>I left.&nbsp; *Because I was 
					unhappy.<br />
					I stayed.&nbsp; *Although I was unhappy.<br />
					She left.&nbsp; *Since she was unhappy.<br />
					*She can either stay.&nbsp; She can leave.</em></span></li>
					<li>The subordinating conjunction (hereinafter simply 
					<strong>subordinator</strong>) can be moved because it is an adjunct and 
					forms part of the subordinate clause.<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>Because I was unhappy, I left<br />
					Although I was unhappy, I left<br />
					Since she was unhappy, she left<br />
					Either she can stay or she can leave</em></span></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The difference between subordination and coordination can be very 
			simply illustrated like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="co- and sib-ordination" height="134" src="../../imagesgraphics/coordinationandsubordination.png" width="250" /></p>
			<p>If you have followed the guide to clause structure, linked at the 
			end, you will know 
			that an alternative analysis is to consider the independent clause 
			as the matrix in which a subordinate clause or clauses can be 
			embedded.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="complicated" height="133" src="../../images/cogs_machinery200.gif" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2"><h3>It can get complicated</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>The structure of complex sentence (i.e., one involving 
			subordination rather than coordination) can be very complicated so 
			we may have, for example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style3"><em>She came home because the dogs needed 
			feeding but discovered that there was no food for them so she had to 
			go out to the supermarket and get some before she could relax in 
			order to finish the book she was reading so that she could take part 
			sensibly in the reading circle at the weekend.</em></p>
			<p>In that (made up) sentence there are instances of both 
			<span class="style_black">coordination</span> and 
			<span class="auto-style4">subordination</span>.</p>
			<p>An independent clause may itself be coordinated:<br />
			<em>
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came home and she cooked a huge meal </span>
			<span class="auto-style4">because she was so hungry</span></em><br />
			(Two coordinated independent clauses with the second having a 
			subordinate clause)<br />
			and subordinate clauses may be coordinated, too:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came home and she cooked a huge 
			meal</em> </span>
			<span class="auto-style4">because she was so hungry</span><span class="style_black"> 
			and she hadn't eaten lunch</span><br />
			(Two coordinated independent clauses with the second having a 
			subordinate clause which is also coordinated)<br />
			and subordinate clauses can have their own subordinate clauses:<br />
			<em>
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came home and she cooked a huge meal </span>
			<span class="auto-style4">because she was so hungry since she hadn't 
			eaten lunch</span></em><br />
			(Two coordinated independent clauses with the second having a 
			subordinate clause which itself has a subordinate clause)</p>
			<p>and so on, <em>ad infinitum</em>.&nbsp; There is, in theory at 
			least, not limit to the number of clauses which a sentence may 
			contain.&nbsp; In practice the limit is provided by the brain's 
			ability to process information and that is usually around 8 clauses.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="complicated" height="166" src="../../images/marbles_range250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2"><h2>The range of conjunctions</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>The difference between coordinator and subordinators is actually 
			a rather more complicated matter than the analysis so far has 
			revealed.</p>
			<p>There is, in fact a cline between those that we can consider true 
			coordinators and those which can only ever be used as subordinators.&nbsp; 
			There are a number of criteria for identifying the nature of 
			coordinators which are discussed in the guide to coordination.</p>
			<p>In some analyses, there are the following coordinating 
			conjunctions:<br />
			<em>
			and, or, but, so, for</em> (in its meaning of <em>because</em>), <em>yet, nor
			</em>and <em>so that.</em><br />
			All other conjunctions are subordinators, correlative or otherwise.<br />
			The guide to coordination makes it clear, however, that only <em>and</em>,
			<em>or</em> and <em>but</em> (probably) meet the criteria for true 
			coordinators and the rest are in some way defective.</p>
			<p>The true picture is more like:</p>
