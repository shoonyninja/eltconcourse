			<h1>Pre-modification of noun phrases</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="modify" height="207" src="../../images/modification_welding310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>There is a 
			<a href="modification.html" target="_blank">guide to modification</a> in general on this site which 
			you may also like to consult.&nbsp; Here we are concerned only with 
			pre-modification of noun phrases.</p>
			<p>Pre-modification of noun phrases is a way of adding more 
			information.&nbsp; There are a number of ways we can do this in 
			English.</p>
			<hr />

					<h2>Pre-modifying adjectives</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Most students of English will be happy with this, the easiest 
			form: pre-modification with adjectives.&nbsp; There are, however, 
			some issues.&nbsp; As our examples, we'll use:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>the delicious meal</em></li>
				<li><em>the vicious dog</em></li>
				<li><em>the ugly building</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is straightforward enough to see that all these are 
			attributive adjective use and could be rearranged to use the 
			adjective predicatively (i.e., as a post-modifier) so we can get:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>the meal was delicious</em></li>
				<li><em>the dog is vicious</em></li>
				<li><em>the building looks ugly</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p><a name="1"></a>If you have followed
			<a href="../lexicogrammar/adjectives.html">the guide to adjectives</a>, 
			you'll know that most (but not all) adjectives can be used in both 
			ways.&nbsp; Now try to use the following predicative adjectives to 
			<strong>pre</strong>-modify the noun and you'll discover the problem.&nbsp;
			<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'list1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you see it</a>.</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>the meal was not delicious</em></li>
				<li><em>the dog is so vicious</em></li>
				<li><em>the building looks ugly</em></li>
			</ul>
			<ul id="list1" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li class="redbulletlist">When we use a negator, 
				pre-modification is at best clumsy, at worst downright wrong.&nbsp; 
				Few would accept <em>*The not delicious meal</em> and it is not 
				easy to rephrase the sentence with a different adjective.&nbsp;
				<em>The foul-tasting meal</em> does not convey the same sense at 
				all.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">The adverb <em>so </em>cannot be 
				transferred to the attributive position.<em>&nbsp; </em>Again, 
				the sentence has to be re-phrased as something like <em>The very 
				vicious dog</em> because the adverb <em>very</em> <strong>can</strong> 
				be used to modify the pre-modifying adjective.&nbsp; Lots of 
				adverbs can be used this way: <em>extremely, undoubtedly, 
				obviously </em>etc.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">When a copular verb other than <em>be</em> 
				is used to link subject to complement, attributive use won't 
				work unless one rephrases the sentence as, e.g., <em>the 
				ugly-looking building, the odd-seeming man, the foul-tasting 
				food, the peaceful-sounding music</em> etc.&nbsp; We have to 
				include the sense of the copular verb in the pre-modification.</li>
			</ul>

			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style2">

					<h2>Pre-modifying nouns</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>You will know if you have followed the guide to adjectives that 
			we need to distinguish between an adjective proper (sometimes called 
			an epithet) and a noun being used adjectivally (often called a 
			classifier).&nbsp; A simple test is to ask whether the word can be 
			modified with <em>very</em> or made comparative with <em>more</em> 
			or -<em>er.</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybulletlist">We can have <em>a fast car, a faster 
				car </em>and<em> a very fast car </em>so <em>fast</em> is a 
				pre-modifying epithet or adjective proper.</li>
				<li class="greybulletlist">We can have <em>a sports car</em> but 
				not <em>*a sportser car </em>or<em> *a very sports car</em> so 
				the word <em>sports </em>is a noun pre-modifier or classifier, not an 
				adjective.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The relationship between the two nouns is often very close and 
			they may better be considered simply compound nouns but that is not 
			always the case.&nbsp; We need to consider the stress patterns:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li class="greybulletlist">Compound nouns are generally stressed 
				on the first item because they are conventionally considered 
				single concepts so we get, e.g., <em><strong>gla</strong>ss 
				house, <strong>i</strong>nk jet, <strong>spo</strong>rts car,
				<strong>door</strong> key</em> etc.&nbsp; All of those could, 
				incidentally be joined with a hyphen or written as one word.</li>
				<li class="greybulletlist">When the first noun is acting as a 
				classifier, however, in less common combinations, the stress 
				remains on the noun being modified so we have, e.g., <em>a 
				software de<strong>vel</strong>oper, a mountain <strong>ref</strong>uge, 
				a garden <strong>seat</strong></em> etc.<br />
				(As a noun-noun combination becomes increasingly common, the 
				stress will slowly slide to the first item.&nbsp; For example, 
				what began as <em>a hard <strong>dri</strong>ve </em>has become<em> 
				a<strong> hard</strong> drive</em> and <em>a wind <strong>tur</strong>bine</em><strong><em>
				</em></strong>is slowly becoming <em>a <strong>wind</strong> turbine</em> 
				etc.)</li>

					<h2>The genitive <em>'s</em> pre-modifier</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The genitive <em>'s</em> is straightforward usually and causes 
			few problems so <em>Peter's car, the man's cottage, the sea's power</em> 
			etc. are readily understood.<br />
			There are times when the situation is not so clear.&nbsp; Consider 
			these four phrases and their meanings.<br />
			<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'list2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have done that</a>.</p>
			<ol >
				<li><em>this is a young man's job</em></li>
				<li><em>there's a gardener's hut over there</em></li>
				<li><em>this is the young man's job</em></li>
				<li><em>she rides an old man's bicycle</em></li>
			</ol>
			<ol id="list2" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li >In this case, the speaker is probably referring to the fact 
				that the work is hard and not easily done except by young, fit 
				people.&nbsp; However, it <strong>could </strong>mean that the 
				job is that of a particular young man.</li>
				<li >This is truly ambiguous.&nbsp; It probably means that the 
				hut is typical of gardeners' huts everywhere and not that it 
				belongs to a particular gardener (or any gardener at all).&nbsp; 
				On the other hand, it could mean that the hut belongs to, or is 
				generally used by, one particular gardener from a group of 
				gardeners.&nbsp; The genitive <em>'s</em> form is commonly used 
				to refer to professions as in, <em>a barber's shop, a 
				greengrocer's business, a doctor's surgery, an agricultural 
				worker's cottage, an artisan's dwelling</em> etc. and it is also 
				often ambiguous whether the reference is to a particular 
				artisan, agricultural worker or to the class of objects 
				associated with them.</li>
				<li >Compare to sentence 1.&nbsp; Here the meaning is almost 
				certainly that a particular young man is the holder of this job.</li>
				<li >This is also almost unambiguous because of the sex of the 
				people.&nbsp; It almost certainly refers to the type of bicycle, 
				not its owner.&nbsp; There is an outside chance, however, that 
				she has begged, borrowed or stolen an old man's bicycle.</li>

					<h2>Participle pre-modifiers</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are two sorts of these.</p>
			<h3><em>-ing</em> participles</h3>
			<p>For the graphic above we could have, e.g., <em>the howling wind
			</em>which implies that it's acting as a simple adjective.&nbsp; 
			There are two problems with that analysis.</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>If we try to use the 'adjective' predicatively, we get 
				something like <em>the wind is howling</em> and that's a 
				progressive tense aspect, not an adjectival use.</li>
				<li>We can't have <em>*the very howling wind</em> or<em> the 
				more howling wind</em> so the word is not functioning at all as 
				an adjective in the proper sense.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now consider:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>She has a number of irritating habits</em></li>
				<li><em>She has a number of very irritating habits</em></li>
				<li><em>That's a shocking idea</em></li>
				<li><em>That's the most shocking idea I've heard today</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>All of these are quite acceptable so here the words <em>shocking</em> 
			and <em>irritating</em> are functioning as normal adjectives, not as 
			participles <em>per se</em>.&nbsp; They are, of course, strongly 
			associated with their verb forms so are participial adjectives.</p>
			<h4>the concept of permanence</h4>
			<p>
			<img alt="cavalier" height="242" src="../../images/cavalier.jpg" width="200" /></p>
			<p><a name="3"></a>Compare these:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li ><em>the grinning skull</em></li>
				<li ><em>The Laughing Cavalier</em></li>
				<li ><em>the grinning man</em></li>
				<li ><em>the laughing group of students</em></li>
				<li ><em>the reassuring person</em></li>
				<li ><em>the reassuring conversation</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Why are some more acceptable than others?&nbsp;
			<a href="#3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'permanence',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have an idea</a>.</p>
			<p id="permanence" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
			The reason that the first two and the last phrases seem more natural 
			is that they are <strong>permanent</strong> states.&nbsp; The skull, 
			the Cavalier (in the famous painting by Frans Hals) and the 
			conversation are fixed in place or time and have the attributes of
			<em>grinning, laughing </em>and<em> reassuring </em>permanently 
			associated with them.&nbsp; (And you are right; the cavalier in 
			question is not actually laughing.)<br />
			The others are less natural because a <em>man</em>, a <em>group of 
			students</em> and a <em>person</em> cannot, usually, 
			be described as <em>grinning, laughing </em>or <em>reassuring<strong> </strong> 
			</em> <strong>permanently</strong>.</p>
			<h3><em>-ed </em>participles</h3>
			<p>(The term <em>-ed</em> participles applies to forms such as 
			<em>completed</em> as well as to irregular but parallel forms such as <em>
			spoken</em>.)</p>
			<h4>the concept of permanence applies here, too.</h4>
			<p>We can have, e.g.,<br />
			<em>his forced laugh, her broken shoes, an accomplished performance, 
			their excited shouting, my astonished reaction</em> etc.<br />
			These attributes are permanently assigned to the nouns either 
			because they are fixed in time or fixed in space.&nbsp; In all the 
			examples, the attribute applies to a single incidence and is fixed 
			in time:<br />
			<em>The laugh was forced; the shoes were broken; the performance was 
			accomplished; the shouting was exited</em> and <em>my reaction was 
			astonished</em>.<br />
			But we cannot have, e.g.,<br />
			<em>*an arrived man, *a begun job, *a started war</em> etc. because the 
			attributes cannot be permanently ascribed to the noun.<br />
			As 
			another example, note that <em>a worn dress </em>refers to its 
			permanent condition not the fact that someone is temporarily wearing 
			it.</p>
			<h4>active and passive</h4>
			<p><em>-ed</em> particles are used both actively (as in, e.g., <em>I 
			have spoken to him</em>) and passively (as in e.g., <em>The job has 
			been finished</em>).</p>
			<p>This is a key distinction because using an active particle as a 
			pre-modifier is quite rare and subject to some constraints.<br />
			If we want to use an active <em>-ed</em> particle attributively for 
			a temporary state it must be pre-modified so, e.g.:<br />
			We can allow:<br />
			<em>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			a recently started war<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			a newly begun job<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			a freshly arrived man<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			But we cannot allow, e.g.:<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*a started war<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*a begun job<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*an arrived man</em> etc.</p>
			<p>Passively, the <em>-ed</em> particle is much more frequently used 
			and not subject to so many constraints so we can have any of the 
			following whether the attribute is permanent or temporarily applied:<br />
			<em>a broken vase, an insulted participant, a forgotten treasure, an 
			angered tiger, a disappointed lover, a chewed bone</em> etc.</p>
			<p>(The passive is frequently used to refer to a
			<strong>permanent</strong> state and that is why the following are 
			not usually acceptable:<br />
			<em>*a constructed dam, *a mentioned person, *a named baby</em>)</p>

			</table>
			<p>Mostly, teaching implications stem from the need for the teacher 
			to be aware of the complications of noun pre-modifiers and to make 
			sure that presentation, practice and correction is consistent and 
			principled.<br />
			Your final task is to review the analysis above and pick out the 
			three most important ideas that you need to be aware of in the 
			classroom and when you are reviewing, planning or correcting.<br />

				<li><strong>The distinction between epithets and classifiers.
				</strong>&nbsp;So you can spot when a learner confuses the ideas 
				and produces, e.g., <em>the very retired teacher, the gardening 
				hard work, the more Ancient Greek </em>etc.<br />
				Classifiers almost always come immediately before the noun they 
				modify and cannot be themselves modified by adverbs.&nbsp; The 
				adjective which comes before the classifier modifies the noun, 
				not the classifier itself: <em>a green mountain bike</em> is not 
				for use on green mountains.</li>
				<li><strong>The concept of (im)permanence.</strong>&nbsp; This is 
				vital because it applies across the range of pre-modification 
				both by <em>-ing</em> participles and <em>-ed</em> participles.&nbsp; 
				You can teach the difference between <em>a bored person</em> and
				<em>a boring person</em> from the point of view of the speaker 
				and the person but, unless the concept of temporary vs. 
				permanent attribution is made clear, your job is only half 
				accomplished.&nbsp; The concept needs explicit analysis in the 
				classroom.</li>
				<li><strong>The distinction between pre-modifying noun 
				classifiers and compound nouns.</strong>&nbsp; Unless this is 
				made clear, attempts to teach learners how to stress noun 
				phrases is very difficult.&nbsp; You will be reduced to telling 
				learners that it's all just 'irregular' and they have to learn 
				each combination's stress pattern separately.&nbsp; We can be 
				more helpful than that.</li>
