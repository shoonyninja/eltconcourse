			<img alt="modify" height="207" src="../../images/modification_nails310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide pulls together parts from various other guides to give

			various word classes and phrase types.<br />
			This guide is linked from both the in-service and the initial plus 
			sections of the site and there's a reason for that:<br />
			For people on or who have recently completed initial training 
			courses, this may be all you want to know for now.<br />
			For more experienced teachers considering going on to or currently 
			taking further training, this provides a road map of the area from 
			which you can select where to go to learn more.<br />

				<p>Modification involves changes and refinements to items in the 
				language.&nbsp; For example, this is a more or less unmodified sentence:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man bought the house</em><br />
				There's nothing grammatically or communicatively wrong with this 
				sentence, of course, because it is well formed and tells the 
				reader / hearer what happened and who did what to what.&nbsp; 
				However, it lacks detail and is much less effective than, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young man with the flashy car immediately bought 
				the woman's 
				old house on the corner of our street.</em><br />
				The second sentence contains a good deal of modification to 
				change and refine the data.&nbsp; We now know:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style8">
				<li>what sort of man (<em>young</em>)</li>
				<li>something about the man (<em>with the flashy car</em>)</li>
				<li>how he bought (<em>immediately</em>)</li>
				<li>whose house (<em>the woman's</em>)</li>
				<li>what sort of house (<em>old</em>)</li>
				<li>where the house is (<em>on the corner</em>)</li>
				<li>of what (<em>our street</em>)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and by a process of quite simple modification, we have added 
			seven new pieces of information to the basic sentence.<br />
			How we do that and a good deal more is the subject of this guide.</p>
			<p>We said above that the initial sentence was <em>more or less</em> 
			unmodified and that is true because, in fact, there are three 
			modifications even in that very basic sentence:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>the noun <em>man</em> is modified by the determiner <em>the</em> 
				which tells us that it is a particular man</li>
				<li>the verb <em>buy</em> is inflected (irregularly) to tell us 
				that the even occurred at a specific time in the past</li>
				<li>the noun <em>house</em> is modified by the same determiner,
				<em>the</em>, to tell us that we are referring to a specific 
				house</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This guide will deal with the sorts of modifications set out in 
			a. to g. above rather than concern itself with determiners and verb 
			inflexions.</p>

				</table>
				<p>There is a distinction between the terms <strong>qualifier</strong> 
				and <strong>modifier</strong> which we should pause to get 
				clear:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A modifier is any item which adds information to the head of 
				a phrase so, for example:<ol class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em><strong>ancient</strong> Greek</em><br />
					contains a pre-modifying adjective</li>
					<li><em><strong>many</strong> people</em><br />
					contains a pre-modifying quantifier</li>
					<li><em>the woman <strong>in the hat</strong></em><br />
					contains a post-modifying prepositional phrase</li>
					<li><em>the <strong>really cheap</strong> option</em><br />
					contains both a pre-modifying adverb and a pre-modifying 
					adjective</li>
					<li><em>the people <strong>involved</strong></em><br />
					contains a post-modifying adjective</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>A qualifier is an item which adds information to the head of 
				a noun phrase only so, for example:<ol class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em><strong>her</strong> money</em><br />
					contains a pre-modifying qualifier possessive determiner</li>
					<li><em><strong>the</strong> people<strong> from that 
					department<br />
					</strong></em>contains a pre-modifying definite article 
					determiner and a post-modifying prepositional phrase.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To complicate matters slightly, however, functional grammarians 
			(following Halliday) reserve the term modifier for pre-modifying 
			elements and use the term qualifier only for post-modifying 
			elements.<br />

			<p>The simplest way to modify a noun is to use an adjective, of 
			course, and we can usually do that two ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Attributively<br />
				Usually that means placing the adjective before the noun with no 
				intervening verb so we have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ridiculous idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current president</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Sometimes, with certain adjectives, an attributive use may 
				follow the noun with no intervening verb so we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The newspaper proper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer concerned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The president elect</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Predicatively<br />
				This means that the noun is the subject of the sentence and the 
				adjective follows in the predicate, after a verb, as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The house seemed cosy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people became frightened<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door is blue</em><br />
				etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Nouns can also be modified by placing items before them which are 
			not adjectives <em>per se </em>but which function in similar ways.&nbsp; 
			In older analyses, these were often explicitly called adjectives as 
			in, for example, <em>possessive adjectives</em> and so on.&nbsp; 
			More modern analyses call these <em>determiners</em> of one kind or 
			another because they determine how the hearer / reader perceives the 
			noun phrase.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>articles</dt>
				<dd><em>a house vs. the house</em></dd>
				<dt>demonstratives</dt>
				<dd><em>this / that / these those house(s)</em></dd>
				<dt>quantifiers</dt>
				<dd><em>some / a few / many / most houses</em></dd>
				<dt>partitives</dt>
				<dd><em>a row / an avenue / a cluster </em>etc<em>. of houses</em></dd>
				<dt>interrogatives</dt>
				<dd><em>which houses / whose houses</em> etc.</dd>
				<dt>possessives</dt>
				<dd><em>our houses / their houses / my house</em> etc.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The other way to modify nouns is more complex and 
			involves post-modifying the noun.&nbsp; Four important ways to do 
			this are:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>prepositional phrases</dt>
				<dd><em>the house on the corner<br />
				the man with the red jacket<br />
				the woman in the office<br />
				the house near the station<br />
				a city in the north</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt>relative pronoun clauses</dt>
				<dd><em>the house which we lived in<br />
				the man whose car was damaged<br />
				the woman who bought the tickets<br />
				the house that stands near the station</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt>relative adverb clauses</dt>
				<dd><em>the place where we ate<br />
				the day when we met<br />
				the reason why she spoke up<br />
				that was how we arrived at the figure</em></dd>
				<dt>non-finite clauses (-<em>ing</em> clauses or infinitive 
				clauses)</dt>
				<dd><em>the pub standing near the river<br />
				the best place to see the action</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Rarely, a noun phrase may be modified by an adverb as in, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was quite a party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was rather a mess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is such a fool</em></p>

				</table>
			<p>The most obvious way to modify a verb is to use an adverb as in 
			the example above, where there are two: <em>carefully</em> and <em>
			down</em>.&nbsp; Both words alter how we see, i.e., modify, the verb
			<em>go</em>.<br />
			There is a distinction between an adverb and an adverbial, however, 
			which is explained in more detail elsewhere.&nbsp; Briefly, any word 
			or phrase that alters how we see a verb is an adverbial and that 
			includes the word class of adverbs.&nbsp; Although all adverbs are 
			adverbials, not all adverbials are adverbs.<br />
			Here, we will consider the two major types only.&nbsp; There is much 
			more detail in the guides linked at the end.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Adverbs as adverbials:<ol class="auto-style8">
					<li>Adverbs of manner, answering the question 'How?'<br />
					so we get, e.g.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is cycling quickly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is thinking hard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children are waiting patiently</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>Adverbs of place, answering the question 'Where?'<br />
					so we get, e.g.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are waiting outside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked everywhere</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>Adverbs of time, answering the question 'When?' or 'How 
					often?'<br />
					so we get, e.g.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; They are enjoying it now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is going home tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss sometimes arrives late</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>Adverbs of degree, answering the question 'How much?'<br />
					so we get, e.g.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She enjoyed it enormously<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hated it intensely</em><br />
					etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you can see from these examples, not all adverbs end in -<em>ly</em> 
			(although hundreds do) and it's also worth noting that not all words 
			which end in -<em>ly</em> are adverbs so, for example, <em>friendly</em> 
			looks like an adverb but is actually an adjective.&nbsp; There is a 
			list of over 100 of these in the guide to adjectives, linked below.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Other items as adverbials:<ol class="auto-style8">
					<li>Manner:<ol class="greenbullet">
						<li>Clauses, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smiling happily, he collected the money</em></li>
						<li>Prepositional phrases, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They spoke in Italian<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a grin, he told her the story</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Place:<ol class="greenbullet">
						<li>Clauses, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ate well while I was in Italy</em></li>

					</li>
					<li>Time:<ol class="greenbullet">
						<li>Clauses, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived before everyone else</em></li>

				</table>
			<p>Adverbs themselves may, of course, be modified in a number of 
			ways, one of which is exemplified above and called an intensifier 
			because it alters the strength of the adverb <em>skilfully</em>.&nbsp; 
			When an adverb modifies another, it <strong>must</strong> function 
			as an intensifier.&nbsp; There are two essential forms of 
			intensifying adverbs:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Amplifiers, which make the adverb stronger.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was very carefully done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived extremely late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They argued totally stupidly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She climbed very quickly</em></li>
				<li>Emphasisers which often express the speaker / writer's view.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was simply deliciously cooked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove plainly insanely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke even more loudly</em></li>
				<li>Downtoners, which diminish the strength of the adverb.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was quite well done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She rather stupidly got on the wrong train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke fairly excitedly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The worked relatively slowly</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The term intensifier is not, incidentally, synonymous with 
			amplifier because it can also refer to a downtoner.</p>
			<p>Adverbs in a phrasal verb are rarely modified at all because the 
			convention is to modify the whole of the verb phrase so we prefer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He quickly grew up</em><br />
			rather than:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He grew quickly up<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He immediately looked up the word<br />
			</em>rather than:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He looked immediately up the word<br />
			</em>although, rarely, we may allow something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke right out</em></p>

					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>The normal way to modify an adjective is with an adverb and, 
			again, the usual categorisation is of various forms of intensifiers 
			which affect the strength of the adjective one way or another.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Amplifiers which increase the power of the adjective:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; That was incredibly stupid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was very happy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her dog was very friendly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was dreadfully dilapidated</em></li>
				<li>Downtoners which reduce the power of the adjective:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was rather silly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was slightly confident<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The animal was reasonably tame</em></li>
				<li>Viewpoint adverbs, expressing the scope of the adjective, 
				are a rarer class:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is technically possible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was morally unfit to govern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were financially independent</em></li>
				<li>Attitudinal adverbs express the speaker / writer's view.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is obviously right<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is definitely wrong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is patently untrue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is clearly inaccurate</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>A small class of adverb modifiers for adjectives needs special 
			attention:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em>enough</em></dt>
				<dd>always follows the adjective it modifies so we can have, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The food was hot enough</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The food was enough hot</em></dd>
				<dt><em>too</em></dt>
				<dd>is always an intensifier and often followed by a clause 
				implying a consequence:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The food was too hot to eat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had too little money for the fare</em></dd>
				<dt><em>so</em></dt>
				<dd>is also an intensifier which is almost always followed by a
				<em>that</em>- consequence clause (which may be implied rather 
				than stated):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was so good that I had three helpings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather was so beautiful that we stayed another week</em></dd>
				<dt>a small class of constrained adverb modifies</dt>
				<dd>these modifiers are confined to certain adjectives and can 
				be learned and taught as fixed expressions or chunks of 
				language.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog was fast / sound asleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ship was hard aground<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is stone deaf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The food was stone cold</em></dd>

				</table>
			<p>Some intensifying adverbs can modify prepositional phrases.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She is <span class="style_black">dead</span> against the idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are <span class="style_black">nearly</span> over the worst<br />
