			<h1>Colligation: classification by syntactic properties</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="sets" height="207" src="../../images/classify_birds310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<h2>A definition</h2>
			<p>This is a term often contrasted with <strong>collocation</strong> 
			(to which there is <a href="collocation.html" target="_blank">a 
			separate guide on this site</a>).<br />
			The clue is in the name:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em><strong>collocation</strong></em> derives from the Latin
				<em>collocare</em> meaning <em><strong>place</strong> together.&nbsp;
				</em>It refers to items in the language which are conventionally 
				found together, placed that way, in other words.</li>
				<li><strong><em>colligation</em></strong> derives from the Latin
				<em>colligare</em> meaning <em><strong>tie</strong> together.</em>&nbsp; 
				It refers to items which form a set with syntactically 
				identical properties.&nbsp; Such items are said to colligate.&nbsp; 
				A careful definition is:</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>A term ... for the process or result of 
			grouping a set of words on the basis of their similarity in entering 
			into syntagmatic grammatical relations.<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style9">(Crystal, 2008:86)</span></p>
			<p>Because the term refers both to <em><span class="style_black">the 
			process <strong>or</strong> result of grouping a set of words</span>
			</em>we can refer to items colligating and to the resulting group 
			sharing the same colligation.&nbsp; A colligation, therefore, refers to sets of 
			items which are primed to co-occur with certain grammatical 
			structures.&nbsp; We can say that, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The verbs </em>speak<em> and </em>tell<em> 
			colligate differently</em><br />
			or we can prefer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The verbs </em>speak<em> and </em>tell<em> 
			belong to different colligations</em>.</p>

			<h3>Syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations</h3>
			<p>Take the sentence:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>He bought a hat.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>In this sentence,<em> hat</em> can be replaced by almost any noun but it <strong>must</strong> 
		be a noun or a noun phrase.&nbsp; Likewise,
		<em>bought</em> can be replaced by many verbs but they <strong>must</strong> 
		be verbs or a verb phrase.&nbsp; So we can get, e.g.:</p>
		<ol start="2">
			<li><em>He sold a hat.</em></li>
			<li><em>He bought a car.</em></li>
			<li><em>He stole a gadget.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Syntagmatic relationship</strong></dt>
			<dd>This describes the relationship between, e.g., <em>He, bought</em> 
			and <em>a hat </em>in <strong>Sentence 1</strong>, <em>He, sold</em> and
			<em>a hat</em> in <strong>Sentence 2</strong>, <em>He, bought</em> 
			and <em>a car</em> in <strong>sentence3 </strong> and <em>He</em> and <em>stole</em> 
			and <em>a gadget</em> in <strong>Sentence 4</strong>.<br />
			These relationships work horizontally between words.&nbsp; Subjects 
			use Verbs, Verbs sometimes take Objects, Adjectives modify Nouns, 
			Adverbs modify Verbs and so on.&nbsp; The relationship is to do with
			<strong>syntax</strong> (hence the name).</dd>
			<dt><strong>Paradigmatic relationships</strong></dt>
			<dd>These are exemplified by the changes we have made between the 
			sentences and describe the relationships between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bought, sold </em>and <em>stole</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; car, gadget </em>and <em>hat<br />
			</em>These relationships work vertically in the sense that Noun 
			phrases can be replaced by other Noun phrases, Verb phrases by other 
			Verb phrases, Adjectives by other Adjectives, Adverbs by other 
			Adverbs and so on.&nbsp; The relationship is to do with <strong>word 
			and phrase class</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
			<p>It all works like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="relationships" height="226" src="../../imagesgraphics/syntagmatic.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>The words <strong>in</strong> each box have paradigmatic relationships to each 
			other.&nbsp; The red <strong>arrows</strong> show the syntagmatic relationships.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Collocation</strong></dt>
				<dd>is one type of syntagmatic relationship describing the 
				phenomenon we observe of, e.g., the adjective&nbsp;<em>genuine
				</em>often being seen in conjunction with a noun like <em>
				article, painting, excuse, antique</em> etc. but not with <em>
				money, pen, computer, glass</em> etc.&nbsp; In the same vein, we
				<em><strong>close</strong> the door</em> but <em><strong>switch 
				off</strong> a light</em>.&nbsp; Some languages will use the 
				same verb for both.<br />
				Collocation is also a paradigmatic relationship insofar as it is 
				possible to have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a heavy cold<br />
				</em>and we can replace <em>heavy</em> with a range of other 
				adjectives which collocate with <em>a cold</em> to get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a terrible cold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a 
				bad cold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a nasty cold</em><br />and so on but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a large cold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a 
				weighty cold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *an evil cold</em><br />
				Paradigmatically, then, we can replace the adjective with a 
				range of others with similar collocational characteristics.<br />
				What we are referring to here is lexical collocation because we 
				are focused on the content words (adjectives and nouns in this 
				case but the focus could be on verb + noun and so on).<br />
				There is a form of collocation which is often referred to as 
				grammatical collocation because it concerns function words 
				rather than content words.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; admit to a mistake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abstain from voting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; care for the children</em><br />
				are all collocations of verb + preposition (and are analysed in 
				more depth in the guide to multi-word verbs of which they form a 
				subset).<br />
				Mistakenly, this sort of relationship is sometimes referred to 
				as colligation because it is grammatical rather than lexical 
				but, as can be seen from the examples, is probably better 
				considered just a simple form of grammatical collocation.&nbsp; 
				Colligation proper, as we shall see, is more complicated.<br />
				There is a guide to collocation linked in the list of related 
				guides at the end.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Colligation</strong></dt>
				<dd>describes a different but allied relationship.&nbsp; Just as 
				an adjective can be, as it were, primed to appear before a 
				particular set of nouns so can a word be primed to enter into 
				certain grammatical relationships.&nbsp; For example, the verbs
				<em>allow, permit, forbid, force, enable </em>are often seen in  
				constructions like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I allowed him to go<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Mary permitted him to come<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I forbade him to speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I forced him to go<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The operation enabled him to walk<br />
				</em>Where the form is: <span class="style_black">Subject (often 
				but not always human) + object (often human) + <em>to</em> + 
				infinitive</span>.<br />
				Moreover, the second verb in such structures is usually dynamic 
				rather than stative in use.&nbsp; Things like:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I allowed him 
				to understand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They permitted him to be<br />
				</em>are vanishingly 
				rare<em>
				</em>because <em>understand</em> and <em>be</em> are not being 
				used dynamically in this meaning.<br />Other verbs which may mean very similar things such as <em>
				authorise, let, approve, make, coerce, necessitate, tolerate, consent </em>will not 
				enter the same sorts of syntactical relationships so are not 
				colligates of <em>allow, permit, forbid</em> etc.&nbsp; We 
				cannot, therefore, say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I let him to come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I consented him to come</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I made him to come</em><br />
				and so on.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Both colligation and collocation are language-specific phenomena.&nbsp; 
			What collocates in one language may not in another and the same 
			applies to colligation.</p>
			<p>Collocational phenomena are sometimes described in terms of what 
			is 'done' and 'not done' in the language so we prefer, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a wide street<br />
			</em>to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a broad street<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a narrow street<br />
			</em>to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a thin street<br />
			</em>although we are quite happy with both<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a narrow line<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a thin line.</em></p>
			<p>By the same token, colligation can be described in terms of what 
			is done and not done in the language but the advantage of looking at 
			colligation over collocation is that colligation can be explained 
			and taught on the basis of patterning in the language which follows 
			rules.&nbsp; That's much harder to do with collocation because that 
			phenomenon seems, superficially at least, random.</p>
			
			<p class="auto-style4">Unlike collocation, in which it is possible 
			to identify a range of simple types, adjective + noun, verb + noun, 
			adverb + adjective etc., colligation is a somewhat more slippery 
			concept pedagogically.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Hoey suggests:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>Colligations are particularly important 
			to learners of the language because they explain why it is that a 
			learner may feel he or she knows a word and yet produce a sentence 
			that is grammatical but ‘not English’.<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style9">(Hoey 2003)</span></p>

			<p id="colligation1" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
			<span class="style_brown">The usual way is in sentences such as:</span><br />
			<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They authorised his 
			visit.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They authorised the money.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss approved my expenses claim.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss approved the expenditure.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tolerated his rudeness.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tolerated the interruption.</em><br />
			In other words:</span></p>
			<p style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" class="indentpara" id="structure">
			<span class="style_black"><strong>subject (almost 
			invariably human or animate at least) + possessive pronoun or 
			definite article + object (usually inanimate, often abstract)</strong></span></p>
			<p>The description of the type of subject or object (human vs. 
			inanimate) above is strictly speaking an aspect of collocation, not 
			colligation.&nbsp; The concepts overlap to some extent but the 
			nature of the subject or object of the verb is rarely mentioned in 
			the context of collocation where the focus is more firmly on meaning 
			and lexical relationships rather than structure.&nbsp; As we shall 
			see, the nature of the subject and the type of object in clauses is 
			often constrained by both meaning and structural characteristics.<br />
			This goes some way to explaining why a grammatically well-formed 
			utterance may not sound English.<br />
			For example, there is nothing grammatically wrong with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car tolerated his poor driving</em><br />
			<em>or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I approved the bicycle</em><br />
			but most people would reject the sentences because the verb <em>
			tolerate</em> colligates with animate (usually human) subjects only 
			and <em>approve</em> usually takes an abstract noun as it object.</p>
			<p>There are some other phenomena associated with grammatical function.&nbsp; 
				We saw above how the verbs <em>allow, permit, forbid</em> and
				<em>enable</em> colligate.&nbsp; These verbs frequently come in 
			clauses with this structure:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><strong>subject + verb + object (usually animate) 
			+ to + verb (dynamic not stative)</strong></span></p>
			<p>so we arrive at</p>

			</table>
			<p>and so on.&nbsp; Once the colligational structure of the verbs 
			has been mastered, it is possible to construct an almost infinite 
			number of correct clauses with the verbs.&nbsp; The nature of the 
			second verb also explains, incidentally, why:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She forbade him to be old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He permitted his mother to enjoy Mozart</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It enabled Mary to like ice cream</em><br />
			are not English (i.e., wrong) even though they are, superficially at 
			least, grammatically well formed.&nbsp; These verbs, and many like 
			them, simply do not form colligations with stative uses of other verbs.</p>
			<p>As we also saw, the verbs <em>authorise, approve</em> 
				and <em>tolerate </em>although they are connected semantically 
			with <em>allow, permit</em> etc. have different colligational 
			characteristics, not in terms of meaning but in terms of 
				the structures with which they occur.&nbsp; There is no obvious 
			semantic reason that we could not produce:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They enabled rudeness</em><br />
			but it is still 'not English'.<br />
			And, if we can say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He allowed me to come</em><br />

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He approved me to come</em><br />
			not permissible?<br />
			The answer is that it contravenes the colligational nature of the 
			verb and not that it is ungrammatical in terms of an overarching 
			structural rule.</p>

			<p>We'll start with a simple example of colligational effects on how things are expressed in English.&nbsp; This issue is to with transitivity and, as we shall see, so are many others.</p>

				</em>BUT</li>
				<li><em>I hid behind my father<br />*I concealed behind my

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are three more-or-less synonymous verbs relating to 
			ownership but they have slightly different colligational 
			characteristics.<br />
			In the active voice we can accept:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl owns a book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl has a book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl possesses a book<br />
			</em>and all three verbs are monotransitive so capable of forming a 
			passive construction.<br />
			However, when we try to make a passive, we run into:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book is owned by the girl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The book is had by the girl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The book is possessed by the girl</em><br />
			and only the verb <em>own</em> can be used in a passive 
			construction.</p>
			<p>The same phenomenon occurs with <em>endure, stand for </em>and
			<em>tolerate.</em>&nbsp; We allow:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She endured his continual chatter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stood for his continual chatter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She tolerated his continual chatter</em><br />
			but not:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *His continual chatter was endured by her</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *His continual chatter was stood for by her</em><br />
			but we can have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>His continual chatter was tolerated by her</em></p>
			<p>Finally, we have the issue of <em>make</em> and <em>let</em> 
			which differ in their grammatical, i.e., colligational 
			characteristics.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They made me go</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They let me go</em><br />
			and in both cases, we use a bare infinitive for the second verb.<br />
			However, in the passive:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They were made <span class="style_underline"><strong>to</strong></span> 
			go</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was let go</em><br />
			it is non-intuitive that <em>make</em> requires a different 
			grammatical construction (the <em>to-</em>infinitive) in 
			the passive from the one it uses in the active form but <em>let</em> 
			does not.</p>

			<p>Because colligation varies across languages and translation is

					<em>to</em>:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke to Mary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke to her<br />
					</em>This is akin to what is known as a dative shift with a 
					ditransitive verb (see under <em>tell</em>, below) because 
					we allow, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke French to Mary<br />
					</em>but not:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He spoke Mary French</em></li>

					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He talked to Mary<br />

					<li>we do <strong>not</strong> allow true transitive use:<br />

					<li>we allow a single direct animate object <strong>only if</strong>

			<p>In summary, to be strict in our use of the term colligation with 
			these verbs, we can say that at times they fall into the same 
			colligation sets because they are sometimes found with similar 
			syntactical properties.&nbsp; Usually, however, they do not 
			themselves form a colligational set.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The verb <em>say</em> is a colligate of the verbs <em>shout, 
				call, scream</em> etc. because it often enters syntactical 
				relationships in the same way:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said / shouted / called / screamed, 
				"Hello"</em><br />
				for example.</li>
				<li>The verb <em>speak</em> is a colligate of the verbs <em>
				converse, natter</em> and <em>chat</em> because it enters 
				syntactical relationships in the same way:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We spoke / conversed / nattered / chatted 
				about the game</em><br />
				for example.</li>
				<li>The verbs <em>talk</em> and <em>speak</em> are members of 
				the same colligational set in some meanings because they enter 
				syntactical relationships in the same way.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talked / spoke about the problem</em><br />
				for example.<br />
				But, in other meanings they fall into different colligational 
				sets as we see above.</li>
				<li>The verb <em>tell</em> is a colligate of the verb <em>relate</em> 
				in some cases, of <em>inform</em> and <em>notify</em> in others 
				and of <em>command</em> and <em>order</em> in others because it 
				enters syntactical relationships in the same way:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told / related / the story of her 
				accident<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told / informed / notified me that the train was 
				cancelled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told / commanded / ordered the children to be silent</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In terms of certain prepositional and clause structures, the 
			verbs also take on aspects of colligation sets insofar as, for 
			example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Both <em>say</em> and <em>tell</em> can be followed by 
				finite clauses so, transitivity apart, are colligates and we 
				allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that he was angry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told her he was angry</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He spoke that he was angry</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He talked that he was angry<br />
				</em>When used with a finite clause, tell must take an indirect 
				object, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told her that it was a good idea</em><br />
				but not:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;*He told that it was a good idea</em></li>
				<li>Both <em>talk</em> and <em>speak</em> can be used with a 
				prepositional phrase referring to language type and are 
				colligates in this respect.&nbsp; We allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He talked in French to her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke in French to her</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He said in French to her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He told in French to her</em></li>
				<li>The verb <em>tell</em> is an outlier, not a colligate of any 
				of the other verbs, because it is the only one which can take an 
				animate direct object so, while we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me</em><br />
				we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She said me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She talked me</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She spoke me</em></li>
				<li>The verb <em>tell</em> is also an outlier, not a colligate 
				of any of the other verbs, because it is the only one which 
				cannot be used with <em>to </em>plus an object so, while we 
				allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said it to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked to me</em><br />
				we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She told to me</em><br />
				In this case, the verbs <em>say, speak</em> and <em>talk</em> 
				form a colligation set.</li>
				<li>The verbs <em>speak </em>and<em> talk </em>are colligates in 
				terms of transitivity because they can both be intransitive so, 
				while we allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spoke<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They talked<br />
				</em>we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They said</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They told</em></li>
				<li>The verbs <em>speak, talk </em>and <em>tell</em> are 
				colligates in being used with a prepositional phrase with <em>
				about</em> so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They talked about the job<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spoke about the job</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They told me about the job</em><br />
				but not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*They said about the job</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In answer to a student's question, this summary is suggested.&nbsp; 
			Where verbs share the green cells, they are, in that sense, members 
			of the same colligations.&nbsp; You can see, however, that the

			<img alt="say etc" class="auto-style68" height="699" src="../../imagesgraphics/say_speak_talk_tell.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>
			Note: with a nominalised clause, <em>tell</em> must also have an 
			indirect object.&nbsp; We allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told us where to put the luggage<br />
			</em>but not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He told where to put the luggage<br />
			</em>The reverse is true of the verb <em>say</em> which cannot take 
			an indirect object so we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said where to put the luggage</em><br />
			but not:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He said me where to put the luggage</em></p>

			<p>If something is a verb, is it transitive, intransitive, 
					ditransitive and so on?<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>She gave / passed / handed / offered / lent / bequeathed 
				me the book</em><br />
				are all possible because the verbs can be ditransitive, working 
				like <em>give</em><br />
				BUT</li>
				<li><em>*She presented / delivered / donated / handed over / 
				contributed me the book</em><br />
				are all prohibited because the verbs are resolutely 
				monotransitive and any indirect object needs to be prepositional 
				as in, e.g.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She presented me with the book<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She contributed the book to the sale<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She handed over the book to the librarian</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Compare:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary wanted him to come to her party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary told him to come to her party</em><br />
				Superficially, these look like parallel forms but <em>tell</em> 
				is a ditransitive verb and <em>want</em> is monotransitive.&nbsp; 
				This means that we can have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; What Mary told him was to come to her party</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *What Mary wanted him was to come to her 
				party<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary told him something</em><br />
				but not:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *Mary wanted him something</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary told him that he should come to her 
				party</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Mary wanted him that he should come to 
				her party</em><br />
				To explain this issue we need to look at how the sentences can 
				be broken down.<br />
				Because <em>want</em> is rigidly monotransitive it can only have 
				one object so we can analyse the sentence as:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
					<tr class="style_black">
						<td class="auto-style64">Subject</td>
						<td class="auto-style65">Verb</td>
						<td class="auto-style66">Direct object</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style59"><em>Mary</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style57"><em>wanted</em></td>

						<td class="auto-style61"><em>Mary</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style62"><em>wanted</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style63"><em>a birthday present</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br />
				The verb <em>tell</em>, on the other hand, can be both mono and 
				di-transitive so we can analyse the sentences like this:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
					<tr class="style_black">
						<td class="auto-style64">Subject</td>
						<td class="auto-style65">Verb</td>
						<td class="auto-style65">Indirect object</td>
						<td class="auto-style66">Direct object</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style59"><em>Mary</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style57"><em>told</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style57"><em>&nbsp;</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style60"><em>a lie</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style59"><em>Mary</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style57"><em>told</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style57"><em>him</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style60"><em>a lie</em></td>

					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style61"><em>Mary</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style62"><em>told</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style62"><em>him</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style63"><em>that he should come to her 
						party</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				There is no particular mystery here because clauses such as <em>
				to come to her party</em>, <em>him to come to her party</em> or
				<em>that he should come to her party</em> can be nominalised in 
				the usual way and function as the object of a verb.&nbsp; (But, 
				as we saw above, no dative shift is possible with nominalised 
				clauses as the object.)<br />
				The issue is the type of transitivity.</li>
				<li>Most ditransitive verbs allow what is called the dative 
				shift or alternation so we can accept both formulations:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She handed me the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They cooked me lunch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary sold me the car</em><br />
				and, with the dative shift:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She handed the money to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They cooked lunch for me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary sold the car to me</em><br />
				but some verbs form a small group of colligates which can
				<strong>only</strong> use the dative shift with an indirect 
				object.&nbsp; So, for example, we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I explained the problem to the mechanic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She clarified the issue to us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They defended their position to the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He justified his actions to me</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I explained the mechanic the problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She clarified us the issue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They defended the meeting their position<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He justified me his actions</em></li>
			</ol>

			via the list of related guides at the end.</p>

			<h3><em>suggest, recommend, advise</em></h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Because of their colligational characteristics, these three verbs 
			cause a good deal of difficulty for learners of English.&nbsp; There 
			are, naturally, semantic differences to get out of the way to start 
			with:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>suggest</em> has two meanings:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>to communicate something without stating it openly (<em>intimate</em>):<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He suggested she was lying</em></li>
					<li>to propose for consideration:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He suggested going for a walk</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><em>recommend</em> has the second sense of <em>suggest</em> but is 
				always positive:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She recommended a good hotel</em></li>
				<li><em>advise</em> has two meanings:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>to give counsel or special expert help:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need an expert to advise us about 
					this</em></li>
					<li>to suggest a wise course of action:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I advise you to stay at The Grand</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As we shall see, the meanings sometimes determine the grammar the 
			words take.&nbsp; Colligation is complex.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<p>We allow:<br />

			<p>The reasons stem from colligational characteristics of the verbs 
			rather than any overarching grammatical or structural rules of the 
			language.&nbsp; It works like this:</p>
			<h4><em>suggest</em> and <em>recommend</em></h4>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Both these verbs mean <em>put forward for consideration </em>
				or <em>propose</em> but <em>recommend</em> is always used with a 
				positive suggestion.<br />
				These colligating verbs can only have one object and the object can be<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>a simple noun phrase:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor suggested some tablets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor recommended some tablets</em></li>
					<li>a verbal noun or a gerund:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor suggested taking some 
					tablets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor recommended taking some tablets</em></li>
					<li>a nominalised subject plus verb phrase:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor suggested that I (should) 
					take some tablets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor recommended that I (should) take some tablets</em></li>
					<li>BUT <strong>not</strong> a <em>to-</em>infinitive 
					clause:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The doctor suggested to take some 
					tablets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The doctor recommended to take some tablets</em></li>
					<li>and <strong>not</strong> with a prepositional phrase:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She suggested against the idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They recommended for the proposal</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>these verbs can also take a person as the noun phrase object 
				but <strong>the sense of </strong><em><strong>put forward</strong></em><strong> 
				is retained</strong><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor suggested me (for the job)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor recommended me (for the job)</em></li>
			</ul>
			<h4><em>advise</em></h4>
			<p>This verb has two connected meanings (it is polysemous) and its 
			colligational features vary with the meanings.</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Meaning #1 = <em>suggest</em> or <em>propose a course of 
				action</em><ul>
					<li class="greybullet"><em>advise</em> can take one 
					object in the same way as <em>suggest</em> and <em>recommend</em>.&nbsp; 
					This can be<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>a verbal noun (gerund)<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor advised taking some 
						tablets</em></li>
						<li>a nominalised verb phrase<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor advised that I 
						(should) take some tablets</em></li>
						<li>a simple <span class="style_underline"><strong>
						inanimate</strong></span> noun phrase when it is clear 
						that the object of the advice is known and a person:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor advised some tablets</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor advised more exercise.</em></li>
						<li>a direct object (always human) followed by a 
						prepositional phrase using <em>against</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor advised me against the tablets</em></li>
						<li>BUT <strong>not</strong> a <em>to-</em>infinitive<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The doctor advised to take some 
						tablets</em></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Meaning #2 = <em>give advice</em> or <em>counsel</em><ul class="greybullet">
					<li><em>advise</em> can operate with this meaning with two 
					objects the first indirect and the second direct but the 
					indirect object must be a person (as is usual).&nbsp; When there is an 
					indirect object like this, the direct object can be<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>a nominalised verb phrase<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor advised me that I 
						should take some tablets</em></li>
						<li>a <em>to-</em>infinitive clause:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor advised me to take 
						some tablets</em></li>
						<li>BUT <strong>not </strong>a verbal noun (gerund)<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The doctor advised me taking some tablets</em></li>
						<li>and <strong>not </strong>a noun phrase<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The doctor advised me some 
						tablets</em></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li><em>advise </em>can also operate with a single direct 
					object in this meaning:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor advised me well<br />
					</em>and in this case it does not carry the sense of <em>put 
					forward </em>but retains the meaning of c<em>ounsel </em>or<em> 
					guide</em>.</li>
					<li><em>advise</em> can also operate intransitively 
					providing there is a prepositional phrase adverbial:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor advised against an operation<br />
					</em>Again, the verb carries the sense of <em>counsel</em>, 
					not <em>put forward</em>.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			question so if you want it as a PDF document, it is available

			<p>Certain words

				<li><em>It produced the consequence that ...

				<em>It has the consequence that ...<br />

				more frequent so expressions such as<br />
				<em>The consequence was that ...<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>It is a consequence of ...</em><br />are very much more common.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Similar considerations apply to the words <em>preference</em> and

			<ol>
				<li><em>He expressed a preference for leaving early<br />
				He explained its use to me</em></li>

			</table>
			<p>In some senses, these three verbs are colligates and also 
			slightly rare ones because they all take a bare infinitive form.&nbsp; 
			Of the three, <em>have</em> is the most formal but they all carry 
			the same sense of authority granting or obliging as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She let me stay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They made her pay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had her write it again<br />
			</em>However, <em>make</em> is the odd one out because it can also 
			take an adjectival object complement and we encounter, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It made her furious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John made me happy<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			The verbs <em>let</em> and <em>have</em> cannot function in this way

				infinitive or an <em>-ing</em><em class="auto-style6"> </em>form 
				but if <em>stop </em>is treated the same way the <em>to</em> 
				is interpretable as <em>in order to.<br />
			</em>The verb <em>stop </em>can also be transitive as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped the car<br />
			</em>but<em> cease </em>cannot be used that way so:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I ceased the car<br />
			</em>is not available.<br />
			Both are, however, available with a verbal noun or gerund so:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I ceased talking</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped talking</em><br />
			are both allowed.</p>
			<p>The use of the verbs <em>stop, cease</em> and <em>finish</em> is also determined by 
			something called <strong>telicity</strong> which refers to whether an action is seen 
			as having an end point, and is telic, or not, so is atelic.&nbsp; 
			For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>I finished cooking at 5</em></li>
				<li><em>I ceased cooking at 5</em></li>
				<li><em>I stopped cooking at 5</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In sentence 1. the sense is that the cooking was complete so the 
			verb is telic.<br />
			In sentences 2. and 3., however, both verbs imply a temporary end 
			point and suggest that the cooking would be resumed.&nbsp; In other 
			words, the verb <em>finish</em> is telic and the verbs <em>stop</em> 
			and <em>cease</em> can be atelic.</p>
			<p>To complicate matters, the verb <em>complete</em> generally takes a noun 
			object rather than a non-finite verb so we allow, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I completed the cooking at 5<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I completed the meal at 5<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I completed preparing the meal at 5</em><br />
			but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; ?I completed cooking at 5</em><br />
			is questionable at best.<br />
			In all cases, the verb is, like <em>finish</em>, telic.</p>

			</table>
			<p>This is not the place to dwell on the differences between a 
			conjunct and a conjunction (for that, see the guide to adverbials linked in the list of related guides at the end).&nbsp; Briefly, however, there are words which join 
			ideas (coordinate and subordinate) in sentences and these are 
			conjunctions.&nbsp; Other words, which refer from sentence or clause two back 
			to sentence or clause one and contribute to a strong sense of cohesion are 
			conjuncts.<br />
			The grammar of the two word classes is significantly different even 
			though the meanings may be parallel.&nbsp; Two examples are enough 
			here but you can probably think of a range of other pairs which 
			function similarly:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em>however</em> and <em>but</em></dt>
				<dd>The first of these is a conjunct expressing a contrast or an 
				adversative meaning and the second of these is a conjunction 
				expressing a very similar idea so we can have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called for you at six.&nbsp; However, you had already left<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called for you at six but you had already left<br />
				</em>and most people would consider these to express the same 
				meaning.<br />
				If we try to swap the words around, we get non-English or a 
				run-on sentence because they colligate differently:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I called for you at six however you had already left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I called for you at six.&nbsp; But you had already left.</em></dd>
				<dt><em>though</em> and <em>although</em></dt>
				<dd>The words <em>though</em> and <em>although</em> are often presented to 
		learners as synonyms.&nbsp; Conceptually, they are but syntactically 
		they are not.&nbsp; The word <em>though</em> can be a conjunct or a 
		conjunction but <em>although</em> is <span class="style_underline">only</span> 
		a conjunction.&nbsp; We can accept, therefore:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was done on time.&nbsp; It was more expensive 
		than I expected, <span class="style_black">though</span>. </em>(conjunct)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was done on time <span class="style_black">though</span> it was more expensive than I 
		expected </em>(conjunction)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was done on time <span class="style_black">although</span> it was more expensive than

			<p>Because colligation is often a grammatical rather than semantic 
			issue, there are classes of function words which are worth 
			considering.<br />
			Apart from the obvious grammatical issues to do with plurality and 
			countability concerned with, especially, quantifying determiners in 
			English (and for a discussion of that you should refer to the guide 
			to determiners) there are also issues to do with a word's meaning 
			which affects whether and with which determiners it is likely to 
			co-occur.<br />
			Some examples:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>The word <em>case(s)</em> co-occurs very frequently with 
				those determiners which allow a plural, countable noun 
				complement so we get, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in some cases<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in many cases<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a few cases of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both cases<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither case<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in more cases</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>The words <em>sort(s), kind(s), species, variet(y)(ies)</em> 
				and <em>type(s)</em>, on the other hand, are often also 
				associated with demonstrative determiners so we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of that sort<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this type of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these sorts of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that species of</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that kind of</em><br />
				as well as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many species of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a few sorts of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both species</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Article determiners, by their nature refer to specificity so 
				we can find:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the exact cause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the precise reason<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the obvious choice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the particular person</em><br />
				which all semantically point to precise entities with the use of 
				the definite article.<br />
				The indefinite article is, by nature, non-specific so other 
				patterns will occur such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a certain time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a vague suggestion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an indefinite case<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an indefinable something</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an example</em><br />
				and so on.&nbsp; It is less likely, therefore, that we will use:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the certain time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the indefinable something<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the example<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a precise reason<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an exact cause</em><br />
				etc.</li>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is another class of function words which show distinct 
			patterns.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Precision<br />
				Both prepositions of time and place colligate extensively with 
				expressions of place and time of course, but the precision they 
				signal is variable so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the top of the pole<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at six o'clock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at that exact moment</em><br />
				and so on and all the phrases refer to a very specific and 
				identifiable place or time.<br />
				The preposition <em>in</em> behaves differently and signals more 
				approximation as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the morning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a few minutes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the town centre</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>With verbs<br />
				It is sometimes suggested that the preposition which is 
				dependent on certain verbs is randomly selected and 
				unpredictable but there are patterns for those who look.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talk about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; argue about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consult about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; complain about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; write about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speak about</em><br />
				and more all refer to some form of communication and predictably 
				take the same dependent preposition.<br />
				On the other hand:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bank on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depend on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dote on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hinge on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rely on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; count on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reckon on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; live on</em><br />
				all refer to dependency of some kind.<br />
				And<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; acquaint with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; familiarise with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coincide with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agree with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deal with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comply with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfere with</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meddle with</em><br />
				all signal some kind of close relationship between two things.<br />
				And<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hunt for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rummage for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; search for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grope for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fumble for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delve for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dig for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prospect for</em><br />
				all refer to trying to find something.</li>
				<li>With adjectives<br />
				A similar process is at work in this case so we get, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glad about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happy about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depressed about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sad about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mad about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chuffed about</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; annoyed about</em><br />
				etc. which all refer to an emotional response.&nbsp; Equally, we 
				get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good at<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bad at<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rubbish at<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skilled at<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clever at<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poor at<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brilliant at</em><br />
				and more which all refer to ability and are predictable from 
				that point of view.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Prepositions are not <strong>wholly</strong> predictable, of 
			course, and there are exceptions to the patterns above (<em>seek out</em> 
			and <em>experienced in</em> are two) but, when faced with a new 
			adjective or verb which requires some kind of prepositional 
			complement, basing the decision concerning which one to use on 
			observable patterns is a good way forward.&nbsp; It is certainly 
			better than guessing.</p>

					<h2>Colligation in the classroom</h2>

			</table>
			<h3>Here are five implications</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Co-text</strong><br />
				The existence of colligation simply adds even more weight to the 
				need to present lexis with its co-text so that the syntagmatic 
				relationships between the target language, its collocational 
				aspects and its colligational nature can be observed and 
				practised.</li>
				<li><strong>Noticing</strong><br />
				Just as it is possible, indeed helpful, to draw learners' 
				attention to collocational patterns in texts, so we can draw 
				their attention to colligational patterns.&nbsp; Something like 
				this:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I <span class="style_black">let</span> <span class="style_red">
				him go</span> to the club although his mother had
				<span class="style_black">forbidden</span>
				<span class="style_red">him to do</span> so because his father 
				always <span class="style_black">tolerated</span>
				<span class="style_red">his visits</span>.<br />
				or<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I <strong>gave</strong> <span class="style_red">John</span>
				<span class="auto-style7">the money</span> to <strong>pass on</strong>
				<span class="style_brown">to Mary</span> but he <strong>lent</strong>
				<span class="style_red">Peter</span> all of
				<span class="auto-style7">it</span>.&nbsp; Peter <strong>donated</strong>
				<span class="style_red">it</span> <span class="style_brown">to 
				the household expenses</span> and <span class="auto-style7">it</span> 
				was duly <strong>delivered</strong> <span class="style_brown">to 
				the grocer</span>.</li>
				<li><strong>Translation</strong><br />
				In many circumstances, translation between English and the 
				learners' first language(s) is a useful, awareness-raising 
				technique and a classroom shortcut.&nbsp; However, if it 
				is carried out without due understanding of colligational 
				differences between the languages, it can be error inducing.<br />
				For example<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I allowed him to go<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I let him go<br />
				</em>can both be translated in German the same way (<em>Ich ließ 
				ihn gehen</em>) but the grammar in English is more complex and 
				misunderstanding may result in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I let him to go<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*I allowed him go</em>.<br />
				On the other hand, French handles 
				the two verbs differently (<em>Je lui ai permis d'aller</em> and
				<em>Je l'ai laissé aller</em>, respectively) and without an 
				understanding of word grammar, this could give rise to<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I 
				allowed him for going<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I let him to go</em>.<br />
				These are just two examples and, as may be imagined, colligational 
				phenomena across languages are even less predictable and 
				parallel than are collocational phenomena.</li>
				<li><strong>Transitivity and the passive voice</strong><br />
				When a new verb arises in the classroom from a reading text, a 
				listening text or by demand from the learners, it is important 
				to be alert to its nature in terms of transitivity.&nbsp; We saw 
				above that we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hid it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I concealed it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She owned the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She possessed the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had a house</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I concealed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The house was possessed </em>(except in a rather spooky and 
				different sense)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The house was had by her</em><br />
				and these are all examples of how transitivity and / or passive 
				formations work in English that are not likely to be parallel in 
				other languages.<br />
				Other verbs, such as <em>resemble, match, suffer, take after, 
				look like </em>etc. are also restricted to active-voice use.</li>
				<li><strong>Dealing with error</strong><br />
				As Hoey points out, colligational error can result in 
				grammatically well-formed sentences which are, nevertheless, 
				'not English'.<br />
				When you are faced with such errors in your learners' 
				production, looking out for the correct colligation in English 
				is often fruitful.</li>
