			<h1>Disjuncts or sentence adverbials</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="disjunct" height="207" src="../../images/disconnected310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Disjuncts are a class of adverbials which, instead of applying 
			only to verb or verb phrase, modify an entire clause, sentence or utterance.&nbsp; 
			This is why they are sometimes called sentence 
			adverbials.<br />
			Here, we will stick with the word <em>disjunct</em> but the terms are 
			functionally synonymous.<br />
			In terms of the meanings they signal, semantically, in other words, 
			disjuncts show the speaker / writer's comment on the clause of 
			which they are a part.</p>
			<p>You may also discover, alas, that disjuncts are sometimes referred 
			to as something called 'opinion adverbs'.&nbsp; While some of them 
			do undoubtedly express the speakers opinion of a proposition, and 
			many are, indeed, adverbs, that 
			is only some of what disjuncts are and do and to call them by such a loose 
			and vague name is to invite misunderstanding and confusion.&nbsp; 
			They aren't all adverbs although they are 
			all adverbials.</p>
			<p>Disjuncts form a class of adverbials, the other three being 
			adjuncts, conjuncts and subjuncts.&nbsp; If you need to place 
			disjuncts in that context, you may find it helpful to look at the general guide to adjuncts, 
			conjuncts, subjuncts and disjuncts on this site, linked in the list of related 
			guides at the end.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Disjuncts are easier to identify than define precisely.&nbsp; 
			They perform two functions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Style disjuncts:<br />
				express the speaker / writer's view of what is 
				being expressed and how it should be understood.&nbsp; In other 
				words, comment is being made on how the speaker wishes the 
				proposition to be understood by the hearer.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Frankly</span>, 
				my dear, I don't give a damn</em><br />
				<span class="auto-style66">(Last words of Rhett Butler to 
				Scarlett O'Hara in <em>Gone with the Wind</em> [1939 movie])</span><br />
				<strong>Reference is not to the content of what it said but to the way 
				the speaker should be understood.<br />
				</strong>In the example above, Rhett Butler wants Scarlett 
				O'Hara to understand that he is being honest and frank.</li>
				<li>Attitude disjuncts:<br />
				express the speaker / writer's understanding of the 
				likelihood of a proposition being true or desirable or the context or topic area in which the proposition should be set.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>In 
				theory</em></span><em>, there is no difference between theory 
				and practice.&nbsp; </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>In 
				practice</em></span><em>, there is.</em><br />
				<span class="auto-style66">(Lawrence Peter "Yogi" Berra (1925 – 
				2015), American baseball player)</span><br />
				<strong>Reference is to the content of what is said, not to the 
				speaker.</strong>&nbsp; That is why these sorts of disjuncts are 
				often called <strong>content </strong>disjuncts.&nbsp; The terms attitude and 
				content are, in this case, synonymous.<br />
			Attitude disjuncts are also sometimes called angle disjuncts because they 
			refer to the speaker's angle or 'take' on what is said.<br />
			In the example above, Yogi Berra is signalling the fact that the 
			first clause is a theoretical rather than practical proposition and 
			in the second, he is reversing the comment.&nbsp; Hence the joke.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To summarise briefly:<br />
			Disjuncts which express the way the speaker wants to be understood 
			are <strong>style</strong> disjuncts.<br />
			Disjuncts which express the truth value of what is said or refer in 
			other ways to the content of what is said are <strong>attitude</strong> or 
			<strong>content</strong> disjuncts.</p>
			<p>We can subdivide disjuncts somewhat more precisely and that is 
			the focus of this guide.</p>
			<p>You may find all disjuncts classified somewhat indiscriminately 
			as <strong>stance adverbials</strong> and that's a legitimate 
			approach to take because they all, in some way or another, identify 
			the speaker / writer's stance or angle.</p>
			<p>Whatever we call disjuncts, they are items which are external to 
			the main clause.&nbsp; Unlike adjuncts, then, which are optional but integral to 
			the clause and serve usually to modify the verb phrase, disjuncts 
			are external, optional features which refer to the whole utterance.&nbsp; 
			Both adjuncts and disjuncts are omissible constituents of a clause 
			but their sense is, naturally, lost when they are ellipted.<br />
			In other words, disjuncts do not relate solely to the clause in 
			which they are embedded, but can refer to other utterances and the 
			whole context of 
			the discourse.</p>

			<p>This horrible expression refers to the fact that words and 
			phrases can slide between classes because they can perform 
			different functions depending on the intended meaning.<br />
			Many disjuncts are adverbs and adverbs may act in various ways, 
			generally modifying verbs, adjectives, other adverbs and 
			prepositional phrases.&nbsp; When they do not refer to the whole 
			clause in which they appear, they are not disjuncts.<br />
			Here are four examples of what happens with adverbs:</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Many adverbials can do this and it can be confusing.&nbsp; The trick, 
			as always, is to look at what the word is doing, not what it looks 
			like.<br />
			What this means is that we have an example of categorical 
			indeterminacy: we do not know, just by looking at it, whether the 
			item in question is an adverb of manner or a disjunct.<br />
			It is not only adverbs that do this.&nbsp; It is also possible to 
			have a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial in the normal 
			way, modifying only the verb, not the entire utterance, for example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style67">Prepositional-phrase</td>
					<td class="auto-style64" style="width: 175px"><strong>as an adverbial of manner (an

			<p>As we said, style disjuncts refer to how the speaker's wants to be understood.&nbsp; They do not comment 
			on the content of what is being said directly but rather signal how the speaker 
			wishes it to be understood.</p>
			<p>They come in a number of flavours but whatever structure is used, 
			they signal the same thing: the speaker's style.<br />

			<h3>The form of style disjuncts</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Although adverbs are the most common forms of style disjuncts, 
			there are other options which are more or less synonymous.&nbsp; 
			Here's a short list with examples:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Adverbs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;<span class="styleblackbold">Seriously</span>, I don't care<br />
				</em>Other common style disjunct adverbs include 
				<span class="styleblackbold"> <em>bluntly, 
				briefly, candidly, frankly, generally, genuinely, honestly, 
				largely, mostly, personally, seriously, truthfully</em></span> etc. and 
				form a useful teaching set.</li>
				<li>Non-finite <em>to-</em>infinitive clauses<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">To be honest</span>, 
				I don't care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">To speak openly</span>, I don't 
				care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">To tell you the truth</span>, it's 
				a bit of a mess</em></li>
				<li>Non-finite -<em>ing</em> clauses<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Speaking confidentially</span>, 
				I don't care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Being honest</span>, I don't care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Taking a stab</span>, it's about 
				300</em></li>
				<li>Non-finite -<em>ed / -en</em> clauses<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Put frankly</span>, 
				I don't care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Honestly said</span>, I don't care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Expressed clearly</span>, she is 
				not up to the job</em></li>
				<li>Prepositional phrases<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">In all honesty</span>, 
				I don't care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">In this instance</span>, I don't 
				agree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">From where I am standing</span>, 
				this seems sensible<br />
				</em>The last example here is of a nominalised clauses acting as 
				the complement of the preposition and that's quite a common 
				form in disjuncts.&nbsp; Other examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">From where I 
				sit</span>, the situation looks a bit grim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">According to what I've heard</span>, he's 
				retiring in the spring<br />
				</em>and so on.</li>
				<li>Finite <em>if</em>-clauses and other conditional / 
				contingent structures<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">If I may speak 
				confidentially</span>, I don't care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="styleblackbold"> If I am honest</span>, I don't care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Unless I am mistaken</span>, that's 
				his sister<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">If the rumours are to be believed</span>, 
				he's moving on</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Unfortunately, not all the forms can be used with all the 
			lexemes.&nbsp; The word <em>honest</em>, and derived words and 
			expressions, for example, can appear in all the 
			guises above:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; honestly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be honest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speaking honestly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spoken honestly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in all honesty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if I may speak honestly</em><br />
			but others do not have all the equivalent forms so, for example, the 
			adjective <em>personal</em> has an equivalent adverb but no noun to 
			form the complement of a prepositional phrase is available because
			<em>personality</em> is semantically disallowed as a disjunct.&nbsp; 
			Additionally,<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; To speak openly ...</em><br />
			is a possibility but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Openly, ...<br />
			</em>is not because the adverb is confined to an expression of 
			manner as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was openly rude<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *If I am open<br />
			</em>is also not possible because the word is confined mostly to its 
			adjectival use.</p>
			<p>There are two rules of thumb, however, worth teaching because 
			they can add to learners' ability to sound quite natural and fluent.&nbsp; 
			They are learnable as language chunks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>All adverbs may be rephrased with the participle <em>
				speaking</em> so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Bluntly</span>, 
				this is going to be expensive = <span class="styleblackbold">
				Speaking bluntly</span>, this is going to be expensive</em></li>
				<li>All infinitive clauses may be rephrased with finite clauses 
				so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">To be honest</span>, 
				I have no idea =<span class="styleblackbold"> If I may speak 
				honestly</span>, I have no idea</em></li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Attitude or content disjuncts</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Attitude disjuncts (also called content disjuncts) are almost always adverbs 
			and simpler, therefore, to analyse (and teach).&nbsp; They have 
			three 
			functions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To express the speaker's view of the truth of a proposition.&nbsp; 
				This is a form of epistemic modality (to which, of course, there 
				is a guide on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end).</li>
				<li>To express the speaker's view of the desirability or 
				necessity of an event or state.&nbsp; This is a form of deontic 
				modality, which refers to obligations and desirability.</li>
				<li>To express the speaker's reaction to an event or state.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Each of these categories forms a teaching unit (or series of 
			units) and can be tackled independently of the other categories.&nbsp; 
			That's a sensible approach because it goes from meaning and 
			intention to the selection of form rather than the other way round.</p>

			<p>A few counterfactual disjuncts in this group express the fact

			but it won't<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Technically</span>, he's still

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Ideally</span>,

			but in reality it isn't<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="styleblackbold">Nominally</span>, she is in

			but in reality that is not the case</p>
			
			<p><strong>A note on the position of these disjuncts and 
			punctuation:</strong><br />
			Most attitudinal or content disjuncts expressing certainty or doubt are put in 
			the initial position to add weight to the concepts they express but 
			three, <span class="styleblackbold"> <em>definitely, probably</em></span> and 
			<span class="styleblackbold"> <em>possibly</em></span> routinely 
			appear in a medial position, following any auxiliary verb and before 
			the main verb.&nbsp; They may optionally be set off with commas but 
			these are frequently omitted, especially informally.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has <span class="styleblackbold">definitely</span> 
			got the job<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has <span class="styleblackbold">probably</span> arrived by 
			now</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Initial position disjuncts are conventionally followed by commas but 
			can be placed in medial position where they are almost always separated 
			by commas from the rest of the clause so, for example, we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Unarguably</span>, 
			she is very clever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is, <span class="styleblackbold">unarguably</span>, very 
			clever</em></p>

			modality)</h4>

			<p>This is a small group and quite an uncommon one.&nbsp; Examples 
			include:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Surely</span>, you

			(= <em>she shouldn't have spent the money</em>)</p>
			<p>All the disjuncts in this group may be rephrased using a modal 
			auxiliary verb, often <em>should</em>, to express the same sense of 
			obligation as in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shouldn't believe that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ought to have returned the money<br />

			</table>
			<p>Not all analyses of disjuncts accept comment clauses as a 
			separate category.&nbsp; Be that as it may, they are a teachable 
			area in what is otherwise a rather complex and disjointed field.<br />
			Comment clauses contain finite verb clauses and serve to 
			express the speaker's view of what follows, usually.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">I have to say</span> that's not 
			a good idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">It seems to me that </span>it would

			that way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">I assume s</span>he won't come</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			They are slightly unusual when written because they are not 
			separated off conventionally with commas.&nbsp; They are also 
			slightly unusual anywhere except in informal writing and speech.&nbsp; 
			They can be used in formal writing where they serve to establish 
			some kind of rapport between writer and reader because they sound 
			almost personal (and they are).</p>
			<p>In some analyses, not followed here, comment clauses may also be 
			non-finite clauses such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking honestly, I don't have an answer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be fair, that's a good solution</em><br />
			but we are keeping these in the area of disjuncts proper in this 
			analysis.</p>

			</table>
			<p>The usual choice is for attitudinal disjuncts (and the one to 
			teach first) is to use adverbs, especially those ending in 
			-<em>ly</em>.&nbsp; See above for examples.&nbsp; However:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Prepositional phrases are frequently used 
			providing a noun form of the adverb is available to form the 
			complement:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">To my surprise</span>, he came on time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="styleblackbold">To my astonishment</span>, she turned it down<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="styleblackbold">With total predictability</span>, the work is unfinished</em><br />Prepositional phrases are, however, rarer and often more formal.<br />
				There are occasions when a noun form from the adverb is 
				unavailable so, for example, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Unfortunately</span>, she 
				didn't get the job</em><br />
				no noun (*<em>unfortune</em>) is available, so no 
				prepositional-phrase equivalent exists.</li>
				<li>The <em>to</em>-infinitive with the copular verb <em>be</em> 
				may also be used as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">To be sure</span>, I have tried 
				my best<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">To be accurate</span>, it was 
				exactly $20</em></li>
				<li>Adjectives phrases containing the intensifier <em>even more</em> 
				are less common but occur, for example, in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="styleblackbold">Even more surprising</span>, 
				she lost the game<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Even more important</span>, the 
				meeting came to a decision<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Even more noteworthy</span>, the 
				money was not spent</em></li>
				<li>Relative pronoun clauses with <em>which</em> referring anaphorically 
				appear more complex but perform the same disjunct function, 
				e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She is not going to promote him,
				<span class="styleblackbold">which is surprising, given what she 
				said last week</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children all managed to get to school on time,
				<span class="styleblackbold">which is remarkable in view of the 
				dreadful weather</span></em><br />
				But relative pronoun clauses cannot refer cataphorically so we 
				do not allow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>Which is surprising, they are giving him the job</em></li>
				<li><em>What</em> clauses function cataphorically and refer to the 
				following clause as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="styleblackbold">What is astonishing</span>, she 
				doesn't want the job<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">What is even more staggering</span>, 
				he doesn't want it either<br />
				What</em> clauses cannot, in turn, function anaphorically so we 
				do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She doesn't want the job, what is astonishing</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The fact that relative pronoun clauses can only function 
			anaphorically and <em>what</em> clauses only cataphorically is not a 
			feature common to many languages that use disjunct clauses and is a 
			source of some error and unnatural production.</p>

			<p>Disjuncts are frequently written rather than spoken but they are

			<p>All disjuncts can be modified and style disjuncts in particular

			<dl>
				<dt><em>very, quite, rather, enough</em></dt>
				<dd>These modifiers are routinely used with 
			disjuncts to amplify the strength of the 
			disjunct:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Very</span> 
				happily, the parcel arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Quite</span> honestly, I kept quiet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strangely <span class="styleblackbold">enough</span>, the letter 
				never arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Rather</span> interestingly, the 
				book was written in prison</em><br />
				The modifier <em>enough</em> displays its usual anomalous 
				word-order behaviour by following rather than preceding the item 
				it modifies.<br />
				(The usual constraints with the modifier <em>quite</em> apply.<br />
			In<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="styleblackbold">Quite</span> astonishingly</em> ...<br />
			it acts as an amplifier because the adverb is generally ungradable, but in<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Quite</span> fortunately</em> ...<br />
			it tones the adverb down because the adverb is gradable.)</dd>
				<dt><em>not</em></dt>
				<dd>is often used to modify disjunct adverbs prefixed with <em>
				un-, im</em>- or <em>in-</em> and with the disjunct <em>
				surprisingly</em> in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Not</span> surprisingly, he was 
				angry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Not</span> unexpectedly, she was 
				delighted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Not</span> unfairly, he asked for 
				more money<br />
				</em>Some people deprecate the use of the double negative in 
				expressions such as <em>not unjustly</em> and so on but they 
				perform as useful modifying function because they tone down the 
				meaning of the disjunct.&nbsp; There is a difference in strength 
				between, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not unhappily</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happily</em></dd>
				<dt><em>more, less, most, least</em></dt>
				<dd>The first two modifiers perform their usual function of 
				making comparatives.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprisingly, he turned down the pay 
				rise.&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">More</span> surprisingly, 
				he actually took less money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Predictably, she got quite angry.&nbsp;
				<span class="styleblackbold">Less</span> predictably, so did he.<br />
				</em>The<em> s</em>uperlatives, <em>most </em>and <em>least</em>, 
				can also be used but are rarer:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unhappily, they were stopped at the border.&nbsp;
				<span class="styleblackbold">Most</span> unhappily, they spent the 
				night in prison<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debatably, the meeting was a small success.&nbsp;
				<span class="styleblackbold">Least</span> debatably, it was never 
				intended to reach a conclusion</em></dd>
				<dt><em>much, greatly</em></dt>
				<dd>These two modifiers can amplify the strength of 
				prepositional-phrase disjuncts like this:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Much </span>to her disappointment, the party was 
				postponed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Greatly </span>to my surprise, the meeting was a success</em></dd>
				<dt>Maximisers</dt>
				<dd>are common modifications of disjuncts so we can 
			have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Wholly</span> 
			unexpectedly, the weather turned warm and dry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Completely</span> unfairly, the 
			referee sent him off</em></dd>
				<dt>Downtoners</dt>
				<dd>are less common but exemplified by:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Slightly</span> unexpectedly, she 
				arrived on time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Somewhat</span> unfairly, they 
				raised the price</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>It is common for modifiers to be used ironically either as forms 
			of hyperbole or litotes.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Somewhat</span> magically, the damage was repaired 
			before the homeowners arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Not wholly</span> astonishingly, he accepted the money</em><br />

			</table>
			<p>Conceptually, there is nothing particularly challenging about 
			disjuncts because all languages have a way of making it clear how 
			something is to be understood, what the speaker's reaction to the 
			event is, how certain of the truth a speaker is, how desirable the 
			speakers sees an event or state or what limitations 
			are being imposed on what is said.</p>
			<p>However, the range of possible ways to form disjuncts is quite wide 
			as we have seen so the area repays some attention in the classroom 
			because mastery of style and attitude disjuncts allows speakers to 
			be more precise, sound more natural and express their feelings 
			better.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Style disjuncts are the smallest group and the least varied 
				so it makes sense to start with them.</dt>
				<dd>The easiest way to practise is to get learners to amend a 
				statement by the application of a style disjunct to modify what 
				is said in terms of the speakers' truthfulness signalling or any limitations 
				they want to impose.&nbsp; A simple noticing exercise is a 
				good place to start.&nbsp; For example:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder" style="width: 50%">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style80" colspan="3">What is the speaker 
						saying?&nbsp; Match the meaning to the adverb:</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style81"><em>Frankly, that's nonsense</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style83" rowspan="4" style="width: 35px">
						<em>&nbsp;</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style86"><em>I am not joking</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style81"><em>Confidentially, I don't want 
						the job</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style82"><em>I'm not certain that I'm 
						exactly right</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style81"><em>Seriously, this is quite a 
						difficult job</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style82"><em>I am being honest</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style84"><em>Roughly, I think half of the 
						population want it</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style85"><em>Please don't tell anyone</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br />
				Step 2 can require learners to insert the disjuncts to express 
				the meanings.&nbsp; This may be a free choice or involve 
				selection from a limited list (i.e., with or without the 
				right-hand column).<br />
				For example:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style4" style="width: 50%">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style8" colspan="2">Insert expressions 
						to make the sentence match the meaning on the right.</td>
						<td class="auto-style8">Choose from:</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>_____________, I can't do 
						this now</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>I am not joking</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style65" rowspan="4"><em>seriously<br />
						in fact<br />
						between you and me<br />
						definitely<br />
						undoubtedly<br />
						quite likely<br />
						to be frank<br />
						certainly</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>_____________, I don't want 
						the job</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>I am being honest</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>_____________, this will be 
						a long job</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>I am not sure but it's 
						possible</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>_____________, I think he 
						will resign</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>Keep this a secret</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				Once the learners' awareness of what style disjuncts do has been 
				raised, they can go on to apply them in free speech through 
				exercises which require the expression of opinion.&nbsp; The 
				topic should be one in which the use of style disjuncts is 
				appropriate and might include, for example: political and social 
				views, artistic judgements, personal information and so on.<br />
				The next step, once a range of style disjuncts is available to 
				the learners, is to look at the alternative structures (see 
				above concerning finite and non-finite verb forms, clauses and 
				prepositional phrases) and then re-do the exercise, with, perhaps, a different 
				topic so the prepositional phrases and other forms can be 
				practised.</dd>
				<dt>Attitude or content disjuncts are less challenging structurally 
				(because they are so often -<em>ly</em> adverbs) but more 
				challenging semantically because of the shades of meaning and 
				types of concepts they signal.</dt>
				<dd>Again, a matching exercise may be helpful to raise awareness 
				of meaning and speaker intention.&nbsp; It pays to treat the 
				three 
				sorts of attitudinal disjuncts separately because they carry 
				such different meanings.<br />
				In terms of certainty:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style4" style="width: 50%">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style8" colspan="3">What is the speaker 
						saying?&nbsp; Match the meaning to the adverb:</td>

				<br />
				In terms of duty or obligation:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style4" style="width: 50%">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style8" colspan="3">What is the speaker 
						saying?&nbsp; Match the meaning to the adverb:</td>

						<td class="auto-style7" rowspan="4" style="width: 35px">
						<em>&nbsp;</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>I think he was stupid</em></td>

					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>Rightly, he's in London with

					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>Idiotically, he carried all 
						his money with him</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>I think this was logical</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>Quite sensibly, she took her 
						concern to the boss</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>I think he is doing the 
						correct thing</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br />
				In relation to the speaker's emotional reaction:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style4" style="width: 50%">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style8" colspan="3">How does the speaker 
						feel?&nbsp; Match the meaning to the adverb:</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>Astonishingly, that's true</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7" rowspan="4" style="width: 35px">
						</td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>relieved</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>Unfortunately, we lost</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>very surprised</em></td>

					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>Happily, she is feeling 
						better</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>miserable</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>Tragically, we lost 
						everything</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>disappointed</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br />
				Then learners can express a fact and add a disjunct to it 
				to make it clear what their reactions are to the facts.<br />
				You can supply the facts, then the learners can add the 
				appropriate disjunct.&nbsp; For example:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style4" style="width: 50%">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style8" colspan="2">Add an adverb to the 
						beginning of these statements to express how you feel.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7">_______________</td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>USA TV is very influential 
						in Europe</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7">_______________</td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>the teacher has won the 
						lottery</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7">_______________</td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>the teacher has set a lot of 
						homework</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7">_______________</td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>I don't do much housework at 
						home</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br />
				Once that is done, learners can then challenge each other to 
				respond to facts they provide.&nbsp; A useful homework task is 
				to come up with a list of ten facts to present to their 
				classmates in the following lesson.<br />
				Modification is, in fact, quite straightforward because the 
				number of possible, or, at least, likely, modifiers is quite 
				limited.&nbsp; They can be introduced and practised once the 
				main forms have been acquired and revision and extension is 
				needed.&nbsp; As a first step, the modifiers <em>quite, rather
				</em>and <em>very</em> form a teachable unit and the anomalous 
				behaviour of <em>enough</em> (which follows the adverbial) can 
				be introduced in the same teaching slot.<br />
				<br />
				Once mastery of <em>-ly</em> adverbs has been achieved, it is 
				often possible to go on, with more advanced learners, to teach 
				alternative formulations.&nbsp; This can first be done with 
				matching exercises such as:<br />
				<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style4" style="width: 50%">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style8" colspan="3">Match the adverbs to 
						alternative ways of saying the same thing:</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>Obviously, that's not true</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7" rowspan="4" style="width: 35px">
						<em>&nbsp;</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>Speaking for myself, I can't 
						see the effectiveness</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>Unsurprisingly, he was late</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>To be sure, that's not the 
						way to fix the problem</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>That is definitely the wrong 
						solution</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>He didn't arrive on time 
						which surprised nobody</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>Personally, I don't think it 
						will be work</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>What is certainly not 
						unclear is that the statement is untrue</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br />
				The next step might be to provide skeleton sentences or gap-fill 
				tasks to complete 
				before learners can safely be asked to produce their own 
				alternatives to simple adverbs.&nbsp; For example:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style4" style="width: 50%">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style8">Complete the 
						following:</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>__________ __________ 
						predictability, she argued the point</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>They got married almost 
						immediately __________ was __________ surprising 
						__________ everyone</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>__________ to my __________, 
						the work came in under budget</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7"><em>__________ was more __________, 
						it was completed on time</em></td>
					</tr>
					</table>
				<br />
				To make this sort of exercise slightly less challenging, you can 
				provide a list of possible items to fill the gaps:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>delight, more, much, pleasing, 
				quite, to, total, what, which, with</em></span></dd>

			<p>You are likely to have to do a good deal of preparation is this 
			area for two reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Coursebooks and published materials rarely focus on

				and style disjuncts because they send very different messages.<ol class="auto-style92">

					<li>Style disjuncts refer to how the speaker's wishes to be
