			<p>The second clause in the sentence above is a nominal clause.&nbsp; 
			It acts, in this case, as the object of the verb <em>know.</em>&nbsp; 
			If you are unsure about the nature of clausal analysis, there is
			<a href="clauses.html" target="_blank">a guide on this site</a>.</p>
			<p>The usual way to analyse this question for learners is to refer 
			to it as an indirect question (to which there is also
			<a href="../../initial/grammar_essentials/indirect_questions_essentials.html" target="_blank">a guide on 
			this site</a>) but there is an alternative view and that is what we 
			are concerned with here.<br />

			<p>Simply put, a nominal clause is <span class="style_black"><em>a

				<li><em>I want to come to the wedding.</em></li>
				<li><em>I didn't see whoever did the damage.</em></li>
				<li><em>I told him he was wrong.</em></li>
				<li><em>To be, or not to be, that is the question</em></li>
			</ol>
			<ol id="answer1" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li><em>I don't think <strong>stealing in order to eat </strong> 
				is wrong.<br />
				</em>In this case, we have a non-finite <em>-ing</em> clause 
				acting in two ways:<ol class="auto-style59">
					<li>it is the object of the verb <em>think<br /></em>and</li>
					<li>it is the subject of the verb <em>be</em> and has an 
					adjective complement, <em>wrong.</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em><strong>What you need to do</strong> is <strong>open the 
				tap fully</strong>.<br />
				</em>Here, we have another non-finite clause, <em>open the tap 
				fully</em>, acting as the complement of the verb <em>be</em>.&nbsp; 
				It is a bare infinitive nominal clause.<br />
				We also have a <em>wh-</em>clause, <em>what you need to do</em>, 
				acting as the subject of the verb, <em>be</em>.<br />
				In this case, the two clauses are in apposition because they 
				refer to the same thing.</li>
				<li><em>I want <strong>to come to the wedding</strong>.<br />
				</em>This is slightly simpler.&nbsp; We have a <em>to-</em>infinitive acting as the object of the verb <em>want</em>.</li>
				<li><em>I didn't see <strong>whoever did the damage</strong>.<br />
				</em>Not quite so simple.&nbsp; In this case, the clause, <em>
				whoever did the damage</em>, is a nominal <strong>relative</strong> 
				clause.&nbsp; It is still a <em>wh-</em>clause.</li>
				<li><em>I told him <strong>he was wrong</strong>.<br />
				</em>In this one, we can insert the word <em>that</em> without 
				any change in meaning.&nbsp; The way to think is to call it a 
				form of <em>that-</em>clause without the word <em>that</em>.&nbsp; 
				In other words, it's a zero-<em>that</em> clause.&nbsp; If you 
				make the clause the subject of the sentence, it is impossible to 
				omit the word <em>that</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he was wrong is what I told him.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*He was wrong is what I told him</em>.</li>
				<li>This is probably the best-known Shakespearean quotation 
				(Hamlet, Act III, Scene I) and the clause is made up of two 
				coordinated <em>to-</em>infinitive clauses.&nbsp; If we strip 
				out the poetic word ordering, the case is simpler to recognise 
				so we could rephrase it as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is to be or not to be</em><br />
				in which case, it is obvious that the two infinitive clauses are 
				acting as the complement of the copular verb <em>be.</em></li>

					<td class="auto-style4">
					<h2>Characteristics of nominal clauses</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>There are some general characteristics of all nominal clauses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Nominal clauses are usually subordinate clauses dependent 
				for their meaning on a main clause as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think
				<span class="style_underline">that she will be pleased</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't imagine <span class="style_underline">why he said 
				that</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me <span class="style_underline">when the train 
				gets in</span>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't like <span class="style_underline"> to ask too many 
				questions</span></em></li>
				<li>As we saw above with the initial examples, nominal clauses 
				can act in place of noun phrases in many circumstances.&nbsp; So 
				we have, for example:<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li>nominal clauses as the subject of the copular verb:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">What you 
					asked for</span> is too expensive</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Asking for 
					more </span>will not be welcomed</em></li>
					<li>nominal clauses as the complement of a copular or 
					pseudo-copular verb:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My argument is <span class="style_black">that we need to go 
					as soon as possible</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her reasoning was <span class="style_black">what he couldn't 
					understand</span></em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>That appeared <span class="style_black">to be what he was 
					having trouble understanding</span></em></li>
					<li>nominal clauses in apposition to the subject noun 
					phrase:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your request, <span class="style_black">that the matter be 
					overlooked</span>, has been granted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem, <span class="style_black">who to invite</span>, 
					remains</em></li>
					<li>nominal clauses acting as the subject of the verb:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">That she 
					was ignored </span>angered her</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">What you did </span>appalled me</em></li>
					<li>nominal clauses operating as the direct object:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I accept <span class="style_black">
					that she has been badly treated</span></em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dislike <span class="style_black">
					what she has proposed</span></em></li>
					<li>nominal clauses as the complement of an adjective:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm glad <span class="style_black">that she arrived</span></em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure
					<span class="style_black">what you want </span></em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's unhappy
					<span class="style_black">driving so far at night</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am delighted <span class="style_black">to see you looking 
					so much better</span></em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>As the indirect object<br />
				Most nominal clauses represent abstract phenomena such as 
				events, states, ideas and so on so they cannot normally be the 
				indirect object of a ditransitive verb.&nbsp; The exception to 
				this is a nominal relative clause which can be the indirect 
				object so we allow, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give <span class="style_black">whoever 
				asks</span> the same answer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave <span class="style_black">who needed some </span>a bit 
				of food<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teacher gave <span class="style_black">the children who 
				behaved badly</span> extra homework<br />
				</em>Nominal <em>that-</em>clauses cannot act as indirect 
				objects but they do act as direct objects of ditransitive verbs.&nbsp; 
				We allow, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told him that we would be late.<br />
				</em>The word
				<em>that c</em>an be omitted, leaving a zero that-clause as in, 
				e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said I was stupid</em></li>
				<li>Some nominal clauses can act as complements of prepositions 
				(analysed as prepositional objects in some grammars):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From <span class="style_black">what he 
				told her</span>, she assumed I was coming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They talked about <span class="style_black">who to invite</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They argued over <span class="style_black">spending all that 
				money on a new garage</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was disappoint by
				<span class="style_black">what he had to say</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They travelled without
				<span class="style_black">buying a ticket</span></em><br />
				But <em>that</em>-clauses and <em>to-</em>infinitive clauses 
				cannot do this so, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We were surprised by
				<span class="style_black">that he had lived in Spain</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They travelled without
				<span class="style_black">to buy a ticket</span></em><br />
				are not allowed (but may be in other languages).</li>

			<p>Traditionally, teachers have told learners that this is something 
			called a gerund and, indeed, there are times when that explanation 
			will do.&nbsp; For example, in clauses such as:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>I enjoy <strong>fishing</strong></em></li>
				<li><em><strong>Fishing</strong> is a relaxing hobby</em></li>
				<li><em>His favourite hobby is </em><strong><em>fishing</em></strong></li>
				<li><em>I'm tired of <strong>fishing</strong></em></li>
				<li><em>His hobby, <strong>fishing</strong>, takes up all his 
				time</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In sentence 1: the verb clause is acting as the <strong>object</strong> of <em>
			enjoy</em>.<br />
			In sentence 2: the verb clause is acting as the <strong>subject</strong> of the 
			copular verb <em>be</em>.<br />
			In sentence 3: the verb clause is the <strong>complement</strong> of the copular verb
			<em>be</em>.<br />
			In sentence 4: the verb clause is the <strong>complement (or object)</strong> of the preposition
			<em>of</em>.<br />
			In sentence 5: the verb clause is operating in <strong>apposition</strong> to the 
			noun phrase <em>his hobby</em>.</p>
			<p>In all five instances, the <em>-ing</em> clause can be replaced 
			by a simple noun, e.g., <em>football</em>.&nbsp; Traditionally, 
			therefore, we can call them gerunds.</p>
			<p>However, the situation is complicated by a number of factors.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The <em>-ing</em> clause can also act as the complement of 
				an adjective phrase as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She and her colleagues were extremely busy <strong>preparing 
				the presentation</strong></em>.<br />
				and it is difficult there to see how a simple noun can be 
				substituted for the <em>-ing</em> clause.&nbsp; We can't have, 
				e.g.,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She and her colleagues were extremely busy preparation 
				of the presentation.<br />
				</em>It is, therefore, a participial nominal clause rather than a 
				gerund.</li>
				<li>The use of the genitive or the object case.&nbsp; For 
				example, we can have both:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was surprised by my getting so angry</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was surprised by me getting so angry </em>(less formal)<br />
				In the first case, we can replace the verb with a simple noun:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was surprised by my anger</em><br />
				but in the second case, we can't:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She was surprised by me anger</em><br />
				so the verb is <strong>not</strong> acting purely as a noun in 
				that case.&nbsp; To call it one is misleading.<br />
				When the subject of the sentence is inanimate, the case becomes 
				even clearer:<br />
				We can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her having done the calculation, we assumed it was OK</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary's having done the calculation, we assumed it was OK</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She having done the calculation, we assumed it was OK</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary having done the calculation, we assumed it was OK</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer having done the calculation, we assumed it was 
				OK</em><br />
				but, we can't have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The computer's having done the calculation, we assumed it 
				was OK<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Its having done the calculation, we assumed it was OK<br />
				</em>Again, in the last two examples, the <em>-ing</em> clause is clearly not acting as a 
				noun.&nbsp; It is not, in other words, a gerund at all.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The safest option is probably to call this construction a nominal 
			participle -<em>ing </em>clause and leave it at that, without confusing our 
			students (or ourselves) too much.</p>

			<p>This is a minor form of nominal clause but it is not 
			allowable in many languages and causes some difficulty in both 
			production and reception.<br />
			In the example above, there are two noun clauses connected by the 
			copular verb <em>be</em>.&nbsp; The function of the clause is to 
			provide more data about the verb <em>do.&nbsp; </em>That is how 
			these types of clause always appear.<br />
			As far as teaching the form is concerned, the first thing that needs to 
			be noticed by learners is that the <em>to-</em>infinitive can also 
			be used in the construction so we can have, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing he did was (to) have breakfast<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next thing he did was (to) drive to work</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we need to do is (to) go shopping</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			However, the second issue is that when the clause functions as the subject, we <strong>must</strong> 
			omit the <em>to</em>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have breakfast is what I'll do first</em><br />
			is acceptable, if a little unusual, but:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *To have lunch is what I'll do later</em><br />
			is not.</p>

			<p>These are much more common and cause much more serious problems 
			for learners, especially concerning the role of the function word
			<em>for</em>.</p>
			<p>Nominal <em>to-</em>infinitive clauses can perform a number of grammatical 
			functions.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the example above, the clause is acting as a <strong>
				subject</strong> of the copular verb <em>be</em>.&nbsp; We could 
				also have, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>For him to be so rude</strong> is not acceptable</em></li>
				<li>In, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want<strong> to come early</strong></em><br />
				The clause acts as the object of <em>want</em>.</li>
				<li>In e.g.:<br />
				<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be bilingual</strong> is <strong>to have a great 
				advantage in life</strong></em><br />
				We have two <em>to-</em>infinitive clauses, one acting as the subject of 
				the verb <em>be</em> and the other as its complement.</li>
				<li>In, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hope, </em><strong><em>to come in first place</em></strong><em>, 
				was realised</em><br />
				The clause is functioning in apposition to the noun phrase <em>
				Her hope</em>.</li>
				<li>In e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be happy <strong>to help with the arrangements</strong></em><br />
				The clause is acting as the complement of the adjective <em>
				happy</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h4 class="auto-style75">Weak forms:</h4>
			<p class="auto-style76">While this is not a hard rule, when the <em>
			to</em>-infinitive clause is the subject, the word <em>to </em>is 
			usually pronounced in its full form (/tuː/ rather than /tə/) so the 
			transcriptions of, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be, or not to be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to be there<br />
			</em>are, respectively:<br />

				</table>
			<p>The use of clauses introduced with <em>for</em> has some unusual 
			and non-intuitive restrictions.&nbsp; They can be used in the 
			following ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>When the clause acts as the <strong>subject</strong>, the 
			function word <em>for</em> frequently introduces it, as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">For</span> him to be so 
			dim</strong> surprised me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>
				<span class="style_underline"><span class="auto-style68">F</span>or</span> 
			her to drive us all to the airport</strong> became the plan<br />
				<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">For</span> me to be asked to 
			do that</strong> pleased me a lot</em><br />etc.</li>
				<li>Clauses which form the subject of pseudo-copular and copular verbs also take
				<em>for</em> so we have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><span class="style_underline">For</span> 
				him to be so overworked</strong> appeared unfair<br />
				<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">For</span> 
				her to meet the guests</strong> seemed the best plan</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><span class="style_underline">For</span> 
				that to have happened</strong> is not very surprising</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>This is also the case when the clause is the complement of 
				the colourless copular verb <em>be</em> so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best arrangement was <strong>
				<span class="style_underline">for</span> her to meet the guests 
				at the door<br />
				</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposal was <strong>
				<span class="style_underline">for</span> him to do the work 
				alone</strong></em></li>
				<li>Clauses which form the complement of adjectives can also 
				take the <em>for</em> construction so we see:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am unhappy <strong>
				<span class="style_underline">for</span> him to do all the work 
				alone</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible <strong><span class="style_underline">for</span> 
				her to take us to the airport</strong></em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>However:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Other copular verbs apart from <em>be</em> do not work with 
				the <em>for</em> clause as the complement, so we cannot allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The plan became for her to meet the 
				guests at the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The proposal seemed for him to do the work alone</em></li>
				<li>When the clause is the object of the verb, inserting <em>
			<strong>for</strong></em> is also wrong so we can't have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They want for her to drive them to the airport<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*They asked for me to do that</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>For speakers of many languages, even those which allow infinitive 
			clauses to act in this way, this is deeply confusing and leads to 
			consistent error of the sort exemplified above.</p>
			<h4 class="auto-style75">Weak forms:</h4>
			<p class="auto-style76">While this is not a hard rule, when the <em>

			<p>These kinds of clauses are extremely common.&nbsp; As was noted 
			at the beginning, they are commonly taught as indirect question 
			forms such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>where the stations is?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what time the 
			bus leaves?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when the train goes?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to get to Margate?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether this is the right room<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who(m) to 
			ask for directions?</strong></em><br />
			etc.<br />
			However, they do not only occur as objects in indirect questions.&nbsp; 
			They can also be:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Objects</strong> in affirmative statement as in the 
				example above:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They told me <strong>how to get there</strong></em></li>
				<li><strong>Subjects</strong> as in:<br />
				<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where it is all going to end up </strong>
				worries me</em></li>
				<li><strong>Adjective complements</strong> as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was unsure <strong>where he was</strong></em></li>
				<li><strong>Prepositional complements</strong> as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked them about <strong>what would 
				happen next</strong></em></li>
				<li><strong>In apposition</strong> to nouns as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His question, <strong>who would do the work</strong>, 
				remained unanswered</em></li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Properly handled, nominalised <span class="style_underline"><em>
			wh</em></span>-clauses are a useful way to encapsulate information.&nbsp; 
			However, taken too far, nominalisation of <em>wh</em>-clauses results in clumsy and impenetrable language and that is one reason they 
			are disparaged by those who campaign for clear English.&nbsp; Here's 
			a real example of this clumsiness in action:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">How you must inform us of your decision to 
			receive future notices and disclosure in paper format and withdraw 
			your consent to receive notices and disclosures electronically is 
			described below.</p>
			<p>That is a 27-word nominalised clause acting as the patient of a 
			very simple passive expression of three words.&nbsp; Making the 
			sentence active only means that the nominalisation becomes the 
			object of the verb <em>describe</em> which would have been 
			preferable but still hard to unpack and clumsy.&nbsp; Even better 
			would have been a decision by the writer to go back to the drawing 
			board and construct something clear.</p>
			<p><em>Wh</em>-clauses often suggest, naturally, some level of 
			uncertainty in the speaker (hence their association with question 
			forms).&nbsp; For this reason, they occur semantically with 
			expressions of uncertainty where sureness in the speaker would 
			normally demand a <em>that</em>-clause (see below).&nbsp; We get, 
			therefore, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am certain (that) he is driving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure who will drive<br />
			</em>Uncertainty is also expressed via <em>whether</em> and <em>if</em> 
			clauses as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know whether I can be there on time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's unsure if she can finish the work<br />
			</em>See below for a little more.</p>
			<p>An oddity in English which is not parallelled in all languages is 
			that all <em>wh</em>-words <span class="style_underline"><strong>
			except</strong></span> <em>why</em> can be followed by the <em>to</em>-infinitive 
			so, we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to know where to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me how to start the engine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They explained what to do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't know whether to laugh or cry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said when to come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know who to ask</em><br />
			but not<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *I don't understand why to start so early</em><br />
			Simply alerting learners to this restriction can help considerably 
			because it is not parallelled in many languages.</p>

			<p>These operate in similar ways and can be seen as a sub-set of 
			<em>wh-</em>clauses.<br />They are formed in the same way as <em>wh-</em>clauses but, instead 
			of the <em>wh-</em>word, we use <em>if</em> or <em>whether</em>.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know </em><strong><em>if the train is on time</em></strong>?<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me 
			</em><strong><em>whether this is the right bus stop</em></strong>?<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't matter 
			</em><strong><em>whether we are late or not</em></strong>.<br />These clauses are almost always the objects of verbs although it is 
			possible to see them functioning in other ways, grammatically, such 
			as:<br /><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether he will be late</strong> is the 
			question</em> (subject)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am surprised <strong>if you believe that</strong></em> (adjective complement)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thought over <strong>whether she should go</strong></em> (prepositional 
			complement)<br /></p>
			<p>There are complications to consider, which cause quite 
			serious difficulties for learners:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Both <em>if</em> and <em>whether</em> can be combined with
				<em>or</em> to form alternative statements such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't see whether / if his help will make any difference 
				or not.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I matters whether / if she comes or not</em></li>
				<li>In alternative statements, <em>if </em>cannot be followed 
				directly by <em>or not </em>but <em>whether</em> can be used 
				this way so we can have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She doesn't know whether or not she can come<br />
				</em>and we can have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She doesn't know if she can come or not<br />
				</em>but we cannot have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*She doesn't know if or not she can come</em></li>
				<li>In other (non-alternative) statements we can make a negative 
				with <em>if</em> but we can't do this with <em>whether</em> so 
				we can have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not important if you don't come at 6</em><br />
				but we can't have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is not important whether you don't come at 6</em></li>
				<li>We can use <em>whether </em>in a clause acting as the 
				subject but we cannot use<em> if </em>in this way so we can 
				have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Whether she comes or not is quite important<br />
				</em>but we cannot have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*If she comes or not is quite important</em></li>
				<li>Only <em>whether </em>can function in a prepositional 
				complement clause so we can have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They spoke about whether they could do the work<br />
				</em>but not:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*They spoke about if they could do the work</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here's a summary:<br />
			<img alt="summary" height="225" src="../../imagesgraphics/whether_if.png" width="620" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>If <em>wh-</em>clauses are taught following this kind of analysis 
			then indirect <em>wh-</em>questions, <em>yes-no</em> indirect questions and 
			reported questions such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you let me know when he arrives</em>?<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me if / whether he is coming</em>?<br />

			<p>This rather odd expression refers to the habit in English of 
			reducing <em>wh-</em>clauses to the single <em>wh-</em>word or a 
			short <em>wh-</em>phrase.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard someone singing that song but I don't 
			know who</em><br />
			in which <em>was singing that song</em> has simply been ellipted for 
			brevity.<em><br />
			</em>This happens with many <em>wh</em>-clauses and other examples are:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They told us to expect some deliveries but didn't say what<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were obviously arguing but I don't know what about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They said they couldn't come but not why<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary telephoned but I don't know from where</em></p>
			<p>The preposition itself is frequently ellipted along with the rest 
			of the clause in such formulations and that gives us, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was looking at something but I don't know what<br />
			</em>Ellipting the preposition is a rare event in other languages 
			and when it is done in English, the result is often some difficulty 
			for learners in comprehending what is meant.</p>

			<p>These are as common as <em>wh-</em>clauses and share many

			<ol>
				<li>The subject:<em><strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he will be late</strong> is certain</em></li>
				<li>The object:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She assumed <strong>that he would arrive</strong></em></li>
				<li>The complement of the copular verb:<br />
				<em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appeared <strong>that he 
				was late</strong></em></li>
				<li>In apposition to another noun:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her assumption, <strong>that he

				<li>As an adjectival complement:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was certain <strong>that he 
				would be late</strong></em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>But there are some differences and complications.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>When a <em>that-</em>clause is the object, we usually omit 
				the word <em>that</em> and make it a <strong>zero-<em>that</em> clause</strong>.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me (that) I was too early<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He said (that) I was dead right</em><br />
				But, when the clause is the subject, we <strong>must</strong> 
				include <em>that</em> as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That she was right was recognised immediately</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She was right was recognised immediately<br />
				</em>However, there is a complication:<br />
				When the reporting verb expresses both <strong>how</strong> the 
				statement is made as well as what was said, <em>that</em> is 
				usually included so we prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She whispered that the chairman looked 
				very tired<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She loudly insisted that the weather made no difference</em><br />
				over<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She whispered the chairman looked very 
				tired<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She loudly insisted the weather made no difference<br />
				</em>The guide to reported or indirect speech, linked below has 
				a fuller discussion of this distinction between bridge and 
				non-bridge verbs.</li>
				<li>These clauses <strong>cannot</strong> act as the complement 
				of a preposition so while we can have, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He talked about having the work done<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They talked over what to do<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He was astonished by what came next<br />
				</em>we cannot have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*He talked about that he will have the work done<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They argued over that they had to do<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*He was astonished by that it came next<br />
				</em>In many languages, this restriction in use does 
				not apply and that leads to a good deal of error.</li>
				<li>The longer a clause is, the more likely we are to include
				<em>that</em> or the listener / reader can get lost looking for 
				the clause.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I hoped he would come<br />
				</em>is fully acceptable with or without<em> that </em>but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I hoped, without much optimism based on his previous track 
				record, he would come<br />
				</em>is technically correct but difficult to follow and most 
				native speakers would insert <em>that</em> to make:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I hoped, without much optimism based on his previous track 
				record, that he would come</em></li>

					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told whoever asked me that I wasn't coming<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					The snow caused whoever needed to travel serious problems</em><br />
				When relative clauses are the objects of verbs the -<em>ever</em> 
				formulation is very common.&nbsp; In fact, <em>whoever</em> has 
					now become the most frequent form and <em>who</em> sounds 
					very stilted to many people.<br />
					Routinely, a nominalised relative clause is replaced by a 
					different formulation, using a 'normal' relative clause such 
					as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told anyone who asked me that I 
					wasn't coming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The snow caused people who needed to travel serious problems</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Subjects:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you are asking for is too much<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the train will arrive is a mystery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who said that is wrong<br />
				</em>Even in subject roles, the use of <em>whoever</em> is now 
				common and many would prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever said that is wrong</em></li>
				<li>Complements:<ol class="auto-style60">
					<li>Subject complements:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the office where most of the work is done</em></li>
					<li>Object complements:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make of him what you like</em></li>

			<p>So far, this guide has only considered clauses, whether finite, 
			non-finite, subordinated or relative, as the topics of 
			nominalisation but, to complete the picture, we can turn to the 
			nominalisation of phrases which do not contain verbs and therefore 
			are not clauses in their own right.<br />
			In this part, we are not considering the ways in which adjectives, 
			verbs and other word classes can be nominalised by altering their 
			structure as in, for example, changing the verb <em>analyse</em> to 
			the noun <em>analysis</em> or changing <em>young</em> to <em>youth</em> 
			because that mostly concerns the process of word formation.&nbsp; 
			Here we are considering these four phrase classes which can be 
			converted to nouns (i.e., nominalised) in terms of their syntactical 
			relationships.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Nominalised adjective phrases:<br />
				The process of forming a noun phrase from an adjective phrase 
				results in a nominal adjective or adjective phrase so we get, 
				for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is work only for young, fit people</em><br />
				changed and nominalised to:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the young and fit do this work</em></li>
				<li>Nominalised prepositional phrases:<br />
				This is quite rare but an example is given above.&nbsp; Other 
				examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the house is not a good place for 
				these animals<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the table seems to be where he dropped it</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				When prepositional phrases are nominalised like this, they are 
				usually followed by a copular or pseudo-copular verb.</li>
				<li>Nominalised adverb phrases:<br />
				These are even rarer but examples are:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Keenly and deeply is how I would describe how he felt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly and forthrightly appears to be the best way to 
				answer that question<br />
				</em>Again, when adverb phrases are nominalised like this, they 
				are usually followed by a copular or pseudo-copular verb.<em><br />
				</em>Adverbs can also be nominalised in the sense that they can 
				form the complement or object, if you prefer, of a limited range 
				of prepositions and that is a role normally reserved for noun 
				phrases.&nbsp; We find, for example:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was here until recently<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up until then, she didn't know</em></li>
				<li>Nominalised determiner phrases:<br />
				Aside from using pronouns derived from determiners, very 
				occasionally a determiner phrase may be nominalised in its own 
				right as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked me which I wanted and I opted 
				for each and every</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Phrasal nominalisation, rather than pre- and post-modified noun 
			phrases and verb phrases (which were considered above) is a 
			reasonably rare event in English but it occurs.</p>

			<p>This guide is about clauses but there is a trick in most 
			languages through which entire texts and sets of propositions can be 
			effectively nominalised through the use of shell nouns.<br />
			These are discussed at a greater level of detail in the guide to 
			them, linked below, so here we will just cite more or less what is 
			said in the guide to nouns in general to give you a flavour of how 
			they operate to nominalise propositions.<br />
			Briefly, what shell nouns do is to 
			encapsulate ideas in a way that makes the noun itself the shell for 
			a set of propositions.&nbsp; For example in:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>The problem is that too many vehicles use 
			the new bypass causing congestion at peak times so the aim is to 
			limit the traffic by improving and extending alternative routes 
			through the suburbs.</em></p>
			<p>we have two shell nouns, <span class="style_black"><em>problem</em></span> 
			and <span class="style_black"><em>aim</em></span> which respectively 
			encapsulate the propositions of identifying an issue and seeking a 
			solution.<br />
			what can then be done, to simplify the discourse and maintain good 
			cohesion is to make reference simply to the shell noun (using 
			pronouns such as <em>it, that, this </em>etc.) rather than making 
			the reader hunt for what the pronouns might be references to.&nbsp; 
			The shell noun referent then serves to encapsulate the whole set of 
			propositions, not just one of them.<br />
			The shell noun is usually followed by the proposition that it 
			encapsulates linked either with a <em>that-</em>clause (<em>problem</em>) 
			or just a simple copula such as <em>be</em> (<em>aim</em>).<br />
			Shell nouns fall into recognisable categories (after Schmid, 2018) 
			like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Factual<br />
				Factual shell nouns include, e.g., <em>fact, phenomenon, reason, 
				result, proof, sign, difference, similarity, aspect, part, 
				problem, advantage, drawback </em>and so on into which clauses 
				or very much longer stretches of text are conceptualised.</li>
				<li>Mental<br />
				Mental shell nouns include, e.g., <em>idea, theory, mystery, 
				belief, knowledge, view, illusion, doubt, question, disbelief, 
				aim, plan, solution, regret, delight, fear, worry</em> etc.</li>
				<li>Modal<br />
				Modal shell nouns express most kinds of modality:<br />
				Epistemic (related to truth): <em>possibility, danger, truth, 
				reality</em><br />
				Deontic (related to duty): <em>permission, mission, need</em><br />
				Dynamic (related to ability and willingness): <em>ability, 
				capacity, opportunity</em><br />
				If the terms for modality do not seem familiar and you want to 
				know more, try the guide to types of modality, linked in the 
				list of related guides at the end.</li>
				<li>Eventive<br />
				These shell nouns include: <em>event, act, situation, attempt, 
				effort, struggle, priority, trouble, problem, success, mistake, 
				situation, context, position, place, time, way, procedure, 
				provision</em> etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The use of shell nouns is particularly common in some kinds of 
			academic texts in which the author is concerned to set up a series 
			of propositions under an overall heading of, e.g., <em>reason, 
			problem, theory, outcome, necessity</em> and so on.<br />

			<p>You cannot plan to teach everything about nominal clauses in a 
			lesson or even a series of lessons but you can take each type at a 
			time and plan a series of lessons to cover them.<br />
			Much will depend on the level of the learners and the amount of 
			detail they can cope with.<br />
			Here are a few suggestions:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>At lower levels<ul class="greybullet">
					<li><em>wh-</em>clauses and <em>yes-no</em> clauses can be introduced 
					via reported or indirect questions because the structural 
					issues and functions are parallel.&nbsp; See
					the 
					guide to indirect questions for more in this area 
					including a link to a lesson on this site for B1 / B2 
					learners.</li>
					<li><em>that</em>-clauses usually function as the objects of verbs or 
					the complements of adjectives and the structures are 
					parallel.<br />
					A way to introduce the ideas is <em>via</em> adjective complements 
					and this can include all sorts of different clause types 
					(but not all at the same time, please).<br />
					For example:<br />
					<table cellpadding="0" class="tableblueborder">
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style70">This might serve ...</td>
							<td class="auto-style65">... to introduce</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style71">
							<img alt="happy" class="auto-style9" height="133" src="../../images/woman_happy_jump200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
							<td class="auto-style72"><em>-ing </em>clauses: <em>
							Being on holiday made her happy</em><br  />
							<em>to-</em>infinitive clauses: <em>She was happy to 
							have a holiday at last</em><br  />
							<em>that</em>-clauses: <em>She was happy that she 
							was on holiday</em><br  />
							<em>wh</em>-clauses: <em>She loved where she was / 
							what she was doing</em></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style73">
							<img alt="sorry" class="auto-style9" height="133" src="../../images/statue_sad200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
							<td class="auto-style74"><em>-ing </em>clauses: <em>
							Having so many problems made her worry</em><br  />
							<em>to-</em>infinitive clauses: <em>She was sad to 
							hear the news</em><br  />
							<em>that</em>-clauses: <em>She was sorry that she
							had to stay in the garden</em><br  />
							<em>wh</em>-clauses: <em>She hated where she was / 
							what she was doing</em></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					Given an introduction to a structure, the learners 
					themselves can respond to pictorial prompts like this to 
					make the correct structures.<br />
					From there, it's a short step to getting them to talk about 
					themselves with sentences such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It makes me angry when ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					People doing XXX make me happy<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I was happy that ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					One day,
					I would really love to ...</em><br />
					and so on.<br />
					Don't go on and consider the complications until the 
					learners have mastered these simpler structures.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>At higher levels<ul class="redbullet">
					<li class="greybullet">It is possible to combine the 
					teaching of nominal clauses as above but demanding more 
					complex sentences making the clauses perform different 
					grammatical functions such as:<br />
					<img alt="father son" height="133" src="../../images/father_son200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					<em>Son, we need to talk about: </em>+ <em>wh-</em>, + <em>-ing</em><br />
					<em>They agreed </em>+ <em>that</em>, + <em>wh-</em>, + <em>to-</em>infinitive<br />
					<em>They were worried </em>+ <em>that</em>, + <em>about</em> + complement 
					nominal clause<br />
					etc.</li>
					<li class="greybullet">It is possible to revisit areas 
					such as direct and reported speech and focus on the nominal 
					clause rather than the other structures (which will be 
					known).&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style62">Reporting ...</td>
							<td class="auto-style61">... with a nominal clause 
							like ...</td>
							<td class="auto-style65">... rather than the dull 
							...</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style63"><em>Can you tell me where 
							the station is?</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style10"><em>She wanted ... (to know 
							where the station was)<br  />							She wondered 
							... (if / whether I knew how to get to the 
							station)<br  />							She wanted 
							... (me to direct her to the station)<br  />							She needed 
							... (directing to the station)<br  />							She asked about 
							... (getting to the station)</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style66"><em>She asked me where the 
							station was</em></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style11"><em>Are we leaving soon?</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style67"><em>She asked about ... 
							(leaving soon)<br  />							She was interested in knowing ... (whether / if we 
							were leaving soon)<br  />							She clearly wanted ... (to leave soon)<br  />							It mattered to her ... (whether or not we were 
							leaving soon)</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style57"><em>She asked if we were 
							leaving soon</em></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					and so on.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Whatever you do and whatever you teach, be aware that this is a 
			complicated area that needs careful handling.<br />
			Many of your learners' languages will not have parallel nominal 
			clause structures at all and, even if they do allow the use of 
			clauses in the place of nouns, their languages will almost certainly 
			work differently.<br />
			What is forbidden in English may be allowed in their languages and
			<em>vice versa</em>.</p>
