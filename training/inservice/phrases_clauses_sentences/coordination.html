			<p>It would be useful if you have followed
			<a href="subordination_and_coordination.html" target="_blank">the general
			guide in 
			this area</a> which distinguishes between coordination and 
			subordination.&nbsp; Other relevant guides can be tracked via the
			<a href="../indexes_is/syntax_index_is.html" target="_blank">index to 
			syntax: clauses, phrases and sentences</a>.&nbsp; Those links open in 
			new tabs.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Traditionally, the central coordinators in English are identified as <em>
			and, or</em> and <em>but</em>.&nbsp; To that list, some would 
			add <em>for</em> (in its meaning of <em>because</em>), <em>yet, nor, 
			so
			</em>and <em>so that</em>.&nbsp; All other conjunctions then fall 
			into the class of correlators or subordinators.&nbsp; However, there are 
			differences hidden in this simplicity which are important.</p>
			
			<p>It is a simple enough matter to place the conjunctions <em>and</em> 
			and <em>or</em> firmly in the camp of coordinators proper for a 
			number of reasons revealed by the structure of the sentences in 
			which they occur.<br />
			There are five tests to apply to a conjunction to distinguish 
			coordination from subordination.<br />
			Here they are:</p>

			<p>We can have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John came home </em>
			<strong><em>and</em></strong><em> cooked 
				a meal</em><br />with two main clauses, the subject ellipted from the second,
				and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because John was so tired when he came home, he decided not 
				to cook </em><strong><em>and</em></strong><em> went straight to 
				bed <strong>and</strong> fell fast asleep immediately</em><br />with a main clause and three subordinate clauses connected with
				<strong><em>and</em></strong><br />We can also have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll arrive late 
			<strong>or</strong> he'll be very early</em><br />with two main clauses in which it is optional to ellipt the verb 
				phrase (<em>He'll arrive late or very early</em>))<br />and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the train times are awkward, John will arrive late
				<strong>or</strong> he'll be very early <strong>or</strong>, of 
			course, he won't come at all</em><br />with a main clause and three subordinate clauses joined by 
			<strong><em>or</em></strong>)<br />
			In theory, at least, there is no limit to the number of subordinate 
			clauses which can be joined like this.</p>
			<p>The conjunction <em>but</em> can link subordinate clauses but
			<strong>a maximum of two clauses is allowable</strong>.&nbsp; So we can allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary said that she would come to the dinner 
			but could be late</em><br />
			but not:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Mary said that she would come to the dinner

			<ul class="smallredbullet">
				<li>It is limited to linking no more than two subordinate 
				clauses (Test 1., see above)</li>
				<li>It cannot be used to link 
				multiple clauses and only appear before the last, so we 
				cannot have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He called, I was out, the telephone was not working but the 
				neighbour took a message.<br />

			<p>That's all OK for the three core coordinators <em>and,</em> <em>or,</em>

			<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>FOR</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The conjunction <em>for</em> to mean <em>because</em> is now 
				quite rare except in formal and academic writing.&nbsp; In this 
				sense, it shares some of the characteristics 
				of the three core coordinators.<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>It can't link two subordinate clauses (so does
					<strong class="style_red">not </strong>pass<strong> </strong>
					Test 1):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Before he spoke to her he decided not to tell her for she 
				would be angry</em></li>
					<li>The conjunction is fixed in place between the two 
					clauses (so it passes Test 2) and we do not allow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>For she would be angry he didn't tell her</em></li>
					<li>It cannot be preceded by another conjunction (so passes 
					Test 3) and we do not allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was late and for his car had broken down</em></li>
					<li>We can't leave out the subject in the second clause (so does
					<span class="style_red"><strong>not</strong></span> pass 
					Test 4):<br />
				We can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't tell her for I knew she would be angry</em><br />
				but not:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I didn't tell her for knew she would be angry</em></li>
					<li>It can't be left out in a string of clauses (so does
					<span class="style_red"><strong>not</strong></span> pass 
					Test 5) and we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He got up early, ran to the station, caught the first train for 
					he wanted to be in 
				good time</em></li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>SO THAT</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The conjunction has two distinct meanings and there are two other issues:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li><strong>Resultative meaning</strong>:<br />
					Here s<em>o that</em> mean much the 
					same as the subordinator <em>so</em>, with which it is often 
					replaced, and 
					refers to a result of an event or state but it is less common.&nbsp; 
					It is a coordinator<strong> only</strong> 
				in this sense.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The garden was covered in snow so that he could see the 
				footprints clearly.</em><br />
				When used in this way, it shares the 
				characteristics set out above for the conjunction <em>for</em>.<br />
					It cannot be preceded by another conjunction (so passes Test 3) 
					and we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The garden was covered in snow and so that he could see the 
				footprints clearly.</em><br />
				The clause it is part of cannot be moved so we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *So that the garden was covered in snow he could see the 
				footprints clearly.</em><br />
					In sum, the phrase passes tests 2 and 3 but
					<span class="style_red"><strong>fails</strong></span> tests 
					1, 4 and 5.<br />
				In this resultative meaning, the conjunction is often 
				replaceable with the simpler <em>so</em>.&nbsp; But, because <em>
					so</em> is a subordinator, it can be preceded by another 
					conjunction so we allow, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The garden was covered in snow and so 
					he was able to see the footprints clearly</em></li>
					<li><strong>Purposive meaning<br />
					</strong>Here it means much the same 
					as <em>in order that</em> 
				and this is the more common use.&nbsp; It is a subordinator in 
				this sense, not a coordinator, and is treated as such in
				the guide to subordination, linked below<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrived early so that he could prepare for the meeting.<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				So that he could prepare for the meeting, he arrived early.<br />
				</em>The ability to swap the clauses around with the conjunction 
				moving with the subordinate clause (Test 2) is a sure sign that it is a 
				subordinator in this sense.&nbsp; Another sign is that we cannot 
					ellipt the subject in the second clause (Test 4) and we 
					cannot allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*So that he could prepare for the meeting, arrived early.</em>.<br />
					In this meaning, the conjunction is replaceable by the 
					simpler <em>so</em>.</li>
					<li><strong>Ambiguity of meaning<br />
					</strong>It is possible that some 
					ambiguity may arise.&nbsp; For example, does:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone stole my car so that I 
					couldn't get to work<br />
					</em>mean that someone stole the car i<span class="style_underline">n 
					order to</span> prevent me getting to work (subordinating) 
					or is <span class="style_underline">the result</span> of the 
					theft the fact that I couldn't get to work (coordinating)?</li>
					<li><strong>Non-conjunction use</strong><br />
					The phrase<em> so ... that </em>can also be a modifier of an adjective or adverb when it 
					means <em>to the extent that</em> as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flight was so late that I missed my connection</em><br />
					and in neither of these cases is the use of <em>so</em> or
					<em>so ... that </em>conjunctional.&nbsp; What is happening 
					is that <em>so</em> is modifying the adverb or adjective and 
					that is followed by a <em>that-</em>clause complement.<br />
					The word ordering matters because if the word <em>so</em> 
					and <em>that</em> are separated or form a single 
					conjunction, the meaning is radically different.</li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>YET</strong></em> and <em><strong>NOR</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>also pass two of the tests for coordinators but not 
				others.<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>They cannot join two subordinated clauses (so they do
					<span class="style_red"><strong>not</strong></span> pass 
					Test 1) and we do not allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was tired yet he worked on yet the work wasn't easy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She didn't want to go out nor have guests round nor watch a 
					movie</em></li>
					<li>The clauses they connect are in a fixed sequence (so 
					they pass Test 2):<br />
				We can have<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tried hard yet he failed<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I don't want to see it nor do I want to read about it</em><br />
				but not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Yet he tried hard he failed</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Nor do I want to see it I do not want to read about it</em></li>
					<li>Both these conjunctions may appear with other 
				conjunctions (so they do <span class="style_red"><strong>not</strong></span> 
					pass Test 3) and we allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is poor and yet she spends money on luxuries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They didn't like the food and nor did I</em></li>
					<li>We can leave out the subject of the second clause 
					providing it is the same as the first, although we 
					frequently do not (so they pass Test 4):<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He was angry yet didn't show it<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He didn't want to see nor want to talk to her</em></li>
					<li>They can't be left out in a string of clauses (so the do
					<span class="style_red"><strong>not</strong></span> pass 
					Test 5):<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They started late, were delayed again yet arrived in time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She didn't want to change the venue, 
					delay the meeting nor cancel it</em></li>
				</ul>
				<em>Nor </em>is particularly difficult for learners because it 
				requires the use of a question-form word ordering (or inversion) 
				so we have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He didn't pay attention nor did he look interested <br />
				</em>and not:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*He didn't pay attention nor he looked interested</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The conjunction <em>so</em> is generally a subordinator and does 
			not appear in this list but it does have some coordinating 
			characteristics because it can perform the same resultative function 
			as <em>so that</em>.&nbsp; Here are the issues in brief:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>When <em>so</em> functions to signal a result, it can 
					replace <em>so that</em> and we allow, therefore:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain had eased a little so that 
					he could go for a walk<br />
					and</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain had eased a little so he could go for a walk<br />
					However, <em>so that</em>, as we saw, is a coordinator and 
					we do not allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The rain had eased a little and so 
					that he could go for a walk<br />
					</em>but we do allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain had eased a little and so he 
					could go for a walk<br />
					</em>because the conjunction serves to subordinate.</li>
					<li>When it functions to signal a purpose, <em>so</em> is a subordinator and moves around with its clause.&nbsp; 
					For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I could meet the new boss I came to the party</em><br />
					and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I came to the party so I could meet the new boss</em><br />
					are both acceptable.<br />
					Compare <em>because</em> in this respect.<br />
					We saw above that the phrase <em>so that</em> can also 
					perform this purposive function and, when it does, it is 
					synonymous with <em>so</em> and a subordinator.</li>
					<li>the word is frequently a conjunct implying something 
					like It follows from what has 
				been said.&nbsp; In this case, the sense is not one of 
				cause and effect, it is one of summation, and the punctuation and intonation alerts the 
				hearer / reader to the function of the word.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you think this will work, do you?</em></li>
					<li>the word can be an emphasising adverb as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meal was so nice.&nbsp; Thanks 
					very much.</em><br />
					in which is means more or less <em>very</em>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The diagram from the general guide to subordination and 
			coordination sums up the position.&nbsp; We have included <em>but</em> in the 
			list of core coordinators because it passes nearly all the 
			tests with one odd exception (Test 5).</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="sums up" height="199" src="../../imagesgraphics/subordinator_coordinator_overlap.png" width="465" /><br />
			We can also represent the relationship like this:<br />
			<img alt="cline" height="124" src="../../imagesgraphics/coordination_subordination_cline_a.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>
			Here is a grid showing the characteristics of the conjunctions which 
			are considered coordinators of one kind or another.&nbsp; From that, 
			you can see that only <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> pass all five 
			tests but all seven coordinators pass test 2.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="grid" height="362" src="../../imagesgraphics/coordinators_grid.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>
			Notes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The conjunction <em>for</em> in this grid means <em>because.</em></li>
				<li>The conjunction <em>but </em>may only link a maximum of two 
				subordinate clauses (see above).</li>
				<li>The conjunction <em>so that</em> is a coordinator when it 
				refers to result (as here) but when it refers to purpose, it is 
				a subordinator (meaning <em>so</em>) and fails all the tests.</li>

			<p>This may seem rather simple, and it often is but there are some 
			elements of coordination with <em>and</em> that exist in English and 
			do not in other languages.<br />
			The other issue is the ordering of the clauses.&nbsp; It is 
			sometimes said that clauses connected with <em>and</em> can usually be 
			reversed with no change in meaning.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is raining <strong>and</strong> it is cold</em><br />
			can be stated as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is cold <strong>and</strong> it is raining</em><br />
			In fact, reversing the clauses more often than not creates nonsense 
			as we shall see.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Commonalities</strong></dt>
				<dd>It is unusual for two clauses to be connected with <em>and</em> 
				if they do not have something obvious in common.&nbsp; Compare, 
				for example,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is very rich, lives in a large house and drives an 
				expensive car</em><br />
				with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is very rich, lives in a large house and doesn't 
				understand thermodynamics<br />
				</em>When the clauses do not exhibit commonalities, English 
				prefers the use of a quasi-coordinator like <em>as well as</em> 
				so we might allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?She is very rich and lives in a large house as 
				well as not understanding thermodynamics</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Consequences</strong></dt>
				<dd>If one action is seen as a consequence of another, <em>and</em> 
				is often the coordinator of choice, especially in spoken English 
				(but it is not in other languages, many of which would reserve a 
				causal conjunction for this role).&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw the accident and called the 
				ambulance</em><br />
				the clauses cannot be reversed without making nonsense because 
				the sense of the coordinator is resultative and causes come 
				logically before results.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Chronology</strong></dt>
				<dd>Again, in English, <em>and</em> is often the coordinator of 
				choice when two events are seen to be chronologically connected.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John came home and cooked a meal</em><br />
				Reversing the clauses creates something surprising if not 
				incomprehensible.<br />
				Again, many languages would prefer a subordinating time 
				conjunction for this concept and even in English, many prefer to 
				insert the temporal adverb <em>then</em> after <em>and</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Commentary</strong></dt>
				<dd>English speakers will often select <em>and</em> when what 
				follows is seen as a comment on the previous clause.&nbsp; For 
				example,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was furious and I don't blame her</em><br />
				Reversing the clauses creates nonsense.<br />
				This can be rephrased using a disjunct such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was furious.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Rightly so</span>, 
				in my view.</em><br />
				Some languages simply won't do this and will use always a disjunct 
				to express, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was furious and understandably so.<br />
				</em>as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was furious.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Clearly</span>, there was a good reason.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Conditionality</strong></dt>
				<dd>Especially in spoken English, native speakers will often 
				select <em>and</em> in preference to the traditionally taught
				<em>if</em>-clause.&nbsp; For example,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me a lift and I'll buy you a drink later</em><br />
				Reversing the clauses creates nonsense.<br />
				We often insert <em>then</em> into these sentences after <em>and</em> 
				to create the sense of conditionality.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's leave now and then we can catch an 
				earlier train</em><br />
				The first clause in such sentences is almost always an 
				imperative or contains a modal auxiliary verb and the second clause 
				contains a modal auxiliary verb as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must go quietly and then we won't wake him up<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Let's leave now and then we can take the early train</em></dd>
				<dd>Again, in many languages some kind of conditional marker 
				(conjunction or mood such as the subjunctive) would be preferred.<br />
				It is noteworthy that when the coordinator <em>and</em> is used 
				in this way it actually becomes a subordinating conjunction 
				(because conditional forms in English are subordinating forms).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Syndetic and Asyndetic coordination</strong></dt>
				<dd>The first of these horrible terms means the inclusion of the 
				coordinator as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hot and exhausted, he gave up</em><br />
				Asyndetic coordination omits the conjunction and would be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hot, exhausted, he gave up</em>.<br />
				This effect also occurs with clauses as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come over here, sit down, tell me all 
				about it.</em></dd>

			<p>This is again often considered a simple area but languages work 
			slightly differently and what is allowable in English may not be in 
			other languages.</p>
			<p>Again, it is often averred that reversing the clauses makes no 
			difference to the sense.&nbsp; Sometimes, doing so loses little but 
			it should be noted that English speakers will often elect to put the 
			preferred option first.&nbsp; In some cases, nonsense is created by 
			reversing the clauses.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Commonality</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is even more important in this case because if the two 
				clauses are not connected, the sense is lost.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can fly or I can take the train</em><br />
				is acceptable, but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I can fly or Rome is 400 kilometres away</em><br />
				is not.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Interpretation</strong></dt>
				<dd>In English, <em>or</em> is exclusive.&nbsp; That means that 
				it connects two mutually incompatible ideas.&nbsp; This is not 
				the case in some languages.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can walk or I can take you in the car</em><br />
				clearly implies that both possibilities are not allowable at the 
				same time.<br />
				When both possibilities are allowable, English speakers 
				will often make that explicit.&nbsp; For example,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can have the strawberry or the chocolate, or both, of 
				course.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Conditionality</strong></dt>
				<dd>As we saw above with <em>and</em>, the conjunction is often also 
				preferred to a traditional <em>if</em>-clause.&nbsp; The conjunction 
				<em>or</em> 
				can work similarly but has a negative sense and does not always carry the same imperative 
				force.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They obviously didn't enjoy the play or they wouldn't have 
				left early</em></dd>
				<dd>instead of the more complex:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They wouldn't have 
				left early if they had been enjoying the play</em><br />
				The conjunction can also work in conditional threats such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay me the money or I'll take you to court<br />
				</em>instead of the conditional:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't pay me the money, I'll take you to court<br />
				</em>In both these cases, reversing the clauses connected with
				<em>or </em>creates 
				nonsense (because it is a coordinator) but reversing the clauses connected with <em>if</em> is 
				acceptable (because it is a subordinator).</dd>

			<p>The coordinator <em>but</em> is often treated simple as a way of stating a 
			contrast.&nbsp; It often is but there's slightly more to it.&nbsp; 
			It can, of course be used discoursally to interrupt and present an 
			alternative viewpoint (the <em>Yes, but ...</em> event).<br />
			It is, however, used in two different ways:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Contrast</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is the familiar one exemplified in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came to see you but you were out</em><br />
				contrasting hope with reality<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to finish but the work took longer than I thought<br />
				</em>contrasting plan with reality<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may seem that way but it's actually quite simple<br />
				</em>contrasting appearance with reality<br />
				and so on.<br />
				The clauses can very rarely be sensibly reversed 
				because the contrast is usually expressed in the second clause.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Confirmation</strong></dt>
				<dd>The conjunction can also be a restatement and confirmation 
				of what has come before, implying no real contrast.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't rush into to it but gave the move a good deal of 
				thought<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				We mustn't assume he'll be late but work on that principle</em></dd>

			<p>We saw above that the subject (providing it is the same subject)

				<dd>

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was very tall so that could see over my 
			head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He told her a lie for knew the truth would hurt<br />
				</em>(The third example in this list is somewhat controversial.&nbsp; 
				An American user of the site (to whom gratitude is expressed) 
				has has noted that AmE speakers do not use <em>nor</em> in 
				combination with the negator <em>hardly, </em>preferring <em>or</em> 
				in this sentence.&nbsp; However, the adverb <em>hardly</em> is 
				generally perceived as strongly negative by many speakers of BrE 
				so the use of the negative coordinator is acceptable (if often 
				disparaged).)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Omit the auxiliary verb(s)</strong> if it applies to both main verbs</dt>
				<dd class="auto-style8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She can come and tell us how to do

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He could dive well as a child for hold his breath for four 
				minutes</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Omit the subject and the verb phrase</strong> when clauses are

			We cannot do this with the other conjunctions.<br />
			This is often the way in which writers and speakers can create what 
			is called a zeugma when the verb senses do not match.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paid the bill but very little attention</em><br />

			<p>Ellipsis is normally anaphoric in these cases and the examples 
			above because the first clause has contained the recoverable data so 
			reference back to them can be made.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children came in and sat at the table</em><br />
			it is a simple matter to refer back to the first clause to identify 
			the fact that <em>the children</em> is the subject of <em>sat</em> 
			in the second clause.<br />
			Sometimes, complex ellipsis allows us to leave out a section of the 
			clause cataphorically and we must refer forward in the sentence to 
			recover the data as in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She can or should do the work<br />
			</em>Here, the reader / listener has to refer forward in the 
			sentence to discover the main verb (<em>do</em>).<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			They ordered, ate and paid for the food.<br />
			</em>In this case, the reader / listener has to refer forward to 
			discover the object of <em>ordered</em> and <em>ate</em>.</p>
			<p>We saw above that we can omit the subject in some coordinated clauses 
			so we get, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary was exhausted but worked on till six<br />
			</em>in which it is clear that Mary is the subject of both clauses.<br />
			We cannot do this with subordination so we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Although Mary was very tired, worked on till six</em></p>
			<p>However, coordinated clauses only allow anaphoric referencing of 
			pronouns (i.e., with reference to a previous noun).<br />
			Therefore, while we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary was unhappy and she argued</em> 
			(reference ←)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John arrived late but he didn't miss the 
			speeches</em> (reference ←)<br />
			we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She argued and Mary was unhappy</em><br />
			unless <em>she</em> and <em>Mary</em> refer to different people, or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't miss the speeches but John arrived 
			late</em><br />
			unless <em>he</em> and <em>John</em> refer to different people.</p>
			<p>There is, however, a little more to it than that because in a 
			sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was exhausted but John worked on till six</em><br />
			it is averred by some that <em>he</em> and <em>John</em> <strong>must</strong> refer 
			to different people.&nbsp; In other words, <em>he</em> cannot be a 
			cataphoric reference to <em>John</em> in a coordinated sentence.&nbsp; 
			This is somewhat questionable and the sentence is at best ambiguous 
			insofar as <em>he</em> and <em>John</em> could refer to the same 
			person or to different people depending on context and co-text.<br />
			With subordination, on the other hand, cataphoric reference is 
			assumed so in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he was exhausted, John worked on 
			till six</em><br />
			it is inevitable that <em>he</em> and <em>John</em> will be assumed 
			to be the same person.</p>

			<p>These are complex prepositions which often

			He complains <strong>as much as</strong> his wife<br />
			The manager came to my retirement party <strong>accompanied by</strong>

			<p>They can all be replaced with coordinators proper so we could

			<p class="auto-style8"><em>I fixed the car <strong>and</strong> the 
			lawnmower<br />
			He came to the party <strong>and</strong> so did most of his friends

			<p>but some sense is lost.</p>
			<p>Grammatically, the terms function in a way closer to prepositions 
			than conjunctions because they are not all susceptible to being 
			followed by clauses so we cannot have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I fixed the car as well as I painted the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He came to the party along with his friends did too<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He came accompanied by his mother came</em><br />

			<p>The suspicion is that these are called quasi-coordinating

			<p>Unlike relative pronoun clauses, which are subordinating, adverb 
			relative clauses also act as grammatical and semantic coordinators 
			so, for example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those were the shoes which they were wearing

			<ol>
				<li>The pronoun relative clause:<br />

				<li>The adverb relative clause:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when they got married</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>We cannot remove the pronoun relative clause (because its 
			function is subordination) so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those were the shoes.&nbsp; They were wearing 
			when they got married</em><br />
			is malformed.&nbsp; However, removing the adverb relative clause is 
			permissible and leaves a well-formed pair of clauses:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those were the shoes which they were wearing.&nbsp; 
			They got married</em><br />
			although some sense is lost, of course.</p>
			<p>Adverb relative clauses can, therefore, perform a coordinating

			<p>The ways in which languages deal with coordination are quite 
			variable (although they all do it, of course) so the area needs some 
			careful handling and concept checking.&nbsp; Here are a few 
			examples:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>In German, and other Germanic languages, coordination occurs in similar ways to English 
				although the conjunctions used to coordinate equal-weight 
				clauses are different.&nbsp; The use of <em>and</em> to express 
				consequence or conditionality is vanishingly rare and will 
				confuse German speakers.&nbsp; For chronologically linked 
				clauses, German will usually insert a temporal conjunction 
				rather than rely on <em>and</em>.&nbsp; So, a speaker from a 
				Germanic-language background will often prefer the unnatural<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw the accident then called the 
				police</em><br />
				rather than<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw the accident and called the police</em></li>
				<li>In English, subordination is more common than coordination.&nbsp; 
				In Arabic the case is reversed so translations of texts from 
				Arabic into English sound simpler than they should be and in 
				reverse they sound more complex than is necessary.<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Unlike the English
				</em>and<em>, the Arabic
				</em>wa<em> is repeated before every item coordinated 
				with the one before, no matter how many items are listed.&nbsp; But 
				the fact of the matter is that the Arabic </em>wa<em> 
				is not one but several particles, each having a different 
				function.<br />
				Coordination is the main key for coherence in Arabic, just like 
				subordination in English.</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style56">(Othman, 2004)</span></li>
				<li>In Japanese, the particle <em>to</em> is often considered an 
				equivalent of <em>and</em> but, in fact, it can only be used to 
				coordinate two noun phrases.&nbsp; Coordination of verb phrases 
				or clauses is much more complex and results in unpredictable 
				outcomes in English.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Korean differs from English in 
				that it has very little true coordination.&nbsp; According to 
				some descriptions of Korean grammar, “[t]he distinction between 
				coordination and subordination is not clear-cut and is a matter 
				of degree”<br />
				... the </em>ko-<em>construction sometimes behaves as a coordinate 
				structure, and sometimes, as a subordinate one.</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style56">(Polinsky, K and M, n.d)</span></li>
				<li>In Spanish, there are a number of reduplicated conjunctions 
				which coordinate clauses and these do not translate easily.&nbsp; 
				For example, <em>bien ... bien </em>and <em>fuera ... fuera </em>are used 
				where English settles for <em>or</em> or <em>either ... or</em>.</li>
				<li>In Italian and some other Romance languages the conjunctions
				<em>because</em> and <em>so that </em>may be realised with the 
				same word (<em>perché</em>&nbsp;in Italian) and that can cause difficulties 
				when using <em>so that</em> in English.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.&nbsp; Languages differ quite dramatically in this area and it is perilous to assume that coordination will be 
			understood and produced with any ease.</p>

			<p>It is clearly arguable that the core coordinators, <em>and, but</em> 
			and <em>or</em> should be the focus of teaching at any level.&nbsp; 
			To that list, most people would add the common subordinator <em>so</em>.<br />
			Not all the uses can be tackled at once, of course, and some of 
			them are probably better left until more advanced levels.&nbsp; 
			These include:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>the use of <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> to replace 
				conditional structures and the constraints on clause type that 
				we saw above</li>
				<li>the use of <em>and</em> to introduce a comment instead of 
				the use of a disjunct of some kind</li>
				<li>The use of <em>but</em> as a confirmation of the previous 
				clause rather than a contrast</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are, however, four main ideas which should be tackled at lower 
			levels:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The need for a <strong>commonality</strong> between the 
				clauses</li>
				<li>The implication of <strong>chronological ordering</strong> 
				with <em>and</em> (so no reversal of clause ordering)</li>
				<li>The idea of <em>and</em> used to express a <strong>consequence</strong> 
				(so no reversal of clause ordering)</li>
				<li>The fact that coordinators must occur <strong>between</strong> 
				ideas and are not integral to either clause in the way that 
				subordinators are</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If we don't focus on these four fundamental ideas, we may 
			encourage errors even though the conjunctions work very similarly 
			across a range of languages.</p>
			<p>This leaves the four other coordinators: <em>for, so that</em>,
			<em>yet</em> and <em>nor</em>.&nbsp; None of these is particularly 
			common.</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>for</em>, meaning <em>because</em>, is confined to 
				formal texts and should probably only be taught for receptive 
				purposes to those who need to access such texts.</li>
				<li><em>so that</em> is rare as a coordinator but common as a 
				subordinator expressing purpose.&nbsp; It should probably be confined to the latter 
				use as it can almost always be replaced with <em>so</em> in its 
				coordinating role.</li>
				<li><em>yet</em> can normally be replaced with <em>but</em> and 
				its use is uncommon.&nbsp; Again, for receptive purposes it may 
				be worth addressing but it is formal and unusual in speech.</li>
				<li><em>nor</em> as a coordinator is also rare and normally 
				replaced by the correlator <em>neither ... nor</em>.&nbsp; Even 
				for receptive purposes only, it's hard to make a case for 
				teaching it except at quite high levels.&nbsp; The complication 
				of the word ordering after <em>nor</em> is another reason for

			<p>The solution, as usual, is to ensure two things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Providing context so that the speaker's meaning is 
				transparent and it is clear e.g.:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>whether<em> but</em> is being used to contrast two ideas as in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I waited for hours but nobody arrived</em><br />
					or to confirm and support the first idea as in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't work at all but just lay around watching TV</em></li>
					<li>whether<em> and</em> is being used to join or to perform another function 
					such as suggesting consequence, chronological ordering or 
					conditionality.&nbsp; For example, in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a student and doesn't have much money<br />
					and
					</em>is a simple logical connector but in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Tell him that and he'll get really angry with you</em><br />
					it is expressing conditionality [<em>If you tell him that he'll 
					be really angry with you</em>]<br />
					but in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I heard the bang and went to see what had happened<br />
					</em>the coordinator shows the chronological ordering of events [<em>After I heard the 
					bang I went to see what had happened</em>]<br />but in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The vase broke and spilled water all over my desk</em><br />
					the coordinator expresses consequence [<em>Water was spilled all over my desk 
					because the vase broke</em>]<br />These uses will affect whether the clauses can safely be 
					reversed.</li>
					<li>whether <em>so that</em> and <em>so</em> are being used synonymously or whether 
					the use of <em>so that </em>is coordinating (a resultative) rather 
					than subordinating (a purposive use) in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fog was thick so that I couldn't see him clearly </em>
					(resultative)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I opened the window so that I could see him clearly</em> 
					(purposive)<br />
					because this will affect whether the clauses can be shifted 
					around.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Providing co-text so that it is clear what can be ellipted, 
				what must stay, what can be included and what can be moved to 
				avoid errors such as<ol class="greybullet">
					<li><em>*We ate early for knew the restaurant closed at 7</em></li>
					<li><em>*So I could take a holiday, saved money carefully</em></li>
					<li><em>*They drove because the buses are unreliable and but 
					the car broke down</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>

			<p>Some comparative work translating in and out of first languages 
			can be productive in this area and raise the learners' awareness of 
			what is and is not possible in English.&nbsp; To do that 
			successfully, of course you'll have to know or at least know about 
			your learners' first language(s).</p>
			<p>Comparisons, too, between acceptable and unsuccessful sentences 
			in English can help learners see how the forms work and be 
			productive.&nbsp; For example:</p><table class="auto-style4">
				<tr>
					<td class="style_black" colspan="3" style="border-top-width: 1px">Mark the sentences 
					right or wrong and then see if you can say why</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style7">Sentence</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">
					<em>
					<img alt="right" height="20" src="../../../gfx/tick-cross-icons-1.gif" width="30" /></em></td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Why is it wrong?</td>

			<p>There is also a need to be alert to your learners' production 
			and, instead of just noting that there is some kind of syntactical 
			error, consider whether it is caused by false coordination and treat 
			it accordingly.<br />
			Often, there is a temptation to fall back on the 
			<span class="style_black"><em>because-it's-not-English</em></span> explanation rather than look for a deeper 
			cause.<br />
			That cause is often found to be a lack of understanding of 
			coordination.</p>

			<p>The central coordinators <em>and</em> and <em>but</em> are 
			usually reduced in connected speech, especially when it is quite 
			rapid and learners need to be alerted to the fact so that they can 
			both identify coordinated clauses and be able to produce 
			natural-sounding sentences.<br />
			Additionally, the usual issues around rhythm and stress in longer 
			sentences need to be addressed.</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>and</em><br />
				is often reduced to /ənd/, /ən/, /nd/ or /n̩/ rather than 
				appearing in its citation form /ænd/ so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came and talked to me</em><br />
				may be pronounced as:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ʃi.keɪm.ənd.ˈtɔːkt.tə.miː/</span><br />
				or<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				/ʃi.keɪm.ən.ˈtɔːkt.tə.miː/<br />
				or</span><br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				/ʃi.keɪm.n̩.ˈtɔːkt.tə.miː/.</span></li>
				<li><em>but</em><br />
				is often reduced to /bət/ or /bə/ rather than appearing in its 
				citation form /bʌt/ so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came but didn't talk to me</em><br />
				may be pronounced as:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				/ʃi.keɪm.bət.ˈdɪdnt.ˈtɔːk.tə.miː/</span><br />
