			the product of its history, origins and development.&nbsp; Other languages do 
			things differently.</span></p>

			<p><span class="style_brown">Answer: 5 other possibilities: SOV, 
			OVS, OSV, VSO and VOS so we can have:</span></p>
				<ol class="style_brown">
					<li><em>John a fat cigar took </em>[SOV]</li>
					<li><em>A fat cigar took John </em>[OVS]</li>
					<li><em>A fat cigar John took </em>[OSV]</li>
					<li><em>Took John a fat cigar </em>[VSO]</li>
					<li><em>Took a fat cigar John </em>[VOS]</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p>And that is exactly what other people's languages do, in fact.<br />
			However, 75% of languages in the world are either SVO (like English) 
			or SOV (like Japanese, Tamil, Dutch, Maltese, Pashto and a hundred 
			or so others).&nbsp; VSO is rare (but included in that group are 
			Celtic languages along with at least 50 others), VOS is also rare 
			but includes some large languages such as Tagalog and Malagasy, and OVS and OSV are very rare indeed with only 
			one or two attested examples (Mallinson and Blake, 1981).<br />
			Naturally, not all verbs take objects so languages like English may 
			be described as VO languages, placing the verb before the object 
			while others, such as Turkish and Japanese are OV languages, placing 
			the object before the verb.</p>
			<p>For 
			most of our learners, then, the natural word order will be either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">John took a fat cigar</span></em><br />
			or<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John a fat cigar took</em></span></p>

				<td valign="middle" class="auto-style47">
		<h3>Indirect objects</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There is one more complication to consider: indirect objects.</p>
			<p>In English, the indirect object can appear in two places.&nbsp; 
			In the following the direct object is <em>a story </em>and the 
			indirect object is <em>the children</em>.&nbsp; English allows both:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read the children a story<br />
			</em>and, with what is called the dative shift or alternation:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read a story to the children</em><br />
			Other languages do things differently as one might expect although 
			most languages (especially European ones) will follow the ordering 
			of indirect-direct object.&nbsp; The dative shift to reverse the 
			ordering is either not permitted in many languages, however, or 
			considered clumsy and substandard.<br />
			The dative shift cannot be used when the object of the verb is a 
			nominalised clause rather than a noun phrase proper so while we 
			allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me how to do it</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told the man a lie</em><br />
			we cannot allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She told how to do it to me</em><br />
			but do allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told a lie to the man.</em></p>

			<img alt="yes but" height="166" src="../../imagesgraphics/yes_but250.png" width="250" /></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It is, of course, possible in all languages, to vary the word 
			order for effect so we can, theoretically, have all kinds of word 
			orders in English.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style48"><span class="style_brown"><em>With this ring I thee wed </em>
			</span>(SOV)<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>John? Now him I know </em></span>(OSV)<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>Eat the food, you</em></span> (VOS)<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>The dragon slew he</em></span> (OVS)<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>Eat you that food now </em></span>
			(VSO)</p>
			<p>Poets and song writers will often vary the word order for effect 
			or to make the rhyme and scan work.&nbsp; And, of course, we vary 
			the word order in things like questions and to make passive 
			sentences (as do many languages).<br />
			English can also have changes to basic word order in other types of 
			sentence.&nbsp; For more, see 
			the guide to cleft sentences and/or
			the guide to fronting on 
			this site, both linked in the list at the end.</p>
			<p>One small oddity in English which does not occur in most other 
			languages concerns the ordering of subject and object in direct 
			speech quotations.<br />
			The rule for ordering the items is that you cannot reverse the verb 
			and subject pronoun but you can reverse a noun or noun phrase subject and 
			verb.&nbsp; We allow, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the bus," said John</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the bus," John said</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the bus," he said</em><br />
			but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the bus,", said he</em><br />
			is now hopelessly archaic.<br />
			The same situation applies to other reporting verbs such as <em>
			explain, point out, exclaim, suggest, propose, complain</em> and so 
			on.<br />
			However, if the reporting verb is transitive and has the direct 
			object, we cannot reverse the ordering so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *"That's the bus," told me John</em><br />
			is not allowed.</p>
			<p>However, what we are talking about here is known as <strong>
			canonical word order</strong>, i.e., the normal, unmarked word order 
			of simple positive (declarative) sentences.</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>Any other word ordering will be 
			construed as a token of 
			markedness.</strong></p>
			<p>So, for example, we vary the word order to mark a question form 
			or mark a passive.&nbsp; We can also vary the ordering to mark an 
			emphasised item of almost any kind in a sentence.&nbsp; When we do 
			this we get sentences such as:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Have you seen my pen?<br />
				</em>marked as an interrogative by reversing the subject and 
				auxiliary verb</li>
				<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>My pen has been stolen<br />
				</em>marked as a passive by raising the erstwhile object to the 
				theme position</li>
				<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Yesterday, I had a pen<br />
				</em>marked for emphasis on the time adverbial by placing it in 
				theme position</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.</p>

		<h2>Free word order</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are some languages in which the speakers are far freer to 
			vary the word order as they please.&nbsp; Examples of these 
			languages are Latin, Modern Greek, Turkish and Finnish.&nbsp; Most 
			languages with freer word order have a way or ways of marking the nouns to 
			make it clear which is the object and which the subject.&nbsp; They 
			also usually inflect the verb so its subject is clear.&nbsp; A good 
			example is Greek in which the verb changes for number and person and 
			the noun along with any determiner or adjective is changed to indicate its status in the sentence.&nbsp; 
			For more on this, see
			the guide to case on this site, linked in the list at the end.<br />
			No language, incidentally, has entirely free word ordering; there 
			are always tendencies, sometimes quite strong ones.</p>
			<p>English does not have free word order and is, in fact, very 
			strict normally.&nbsp; This is because the language has no way of 
			marking what the subject is and what the object is.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John 
			loved Mary<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary loved John<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem caused the delay<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The delay caused the problem<br />
			</em>are <strong>only</strong> 
			distinguished by the ordering of the elements in the sentence.</p>
			<p>By comparison, the same two sentences translate like this into 
			some other languages:</p>
			<p>In Greek (with different forms of the article):</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Η καθυστέρηση προκάλεσε το πρόβλημα (I kathystérisi 
				prokálese to próvlima)</em></li>
				<li><em>Το πρόβλημα προκάλεσε την καθυστέρηση (To próvlima 
				prokálese tin kathystérisi)</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In Czech (with different forms of the verb):</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Zpoždění způsobilo problém</em></li>
				<li><em>Problém způsobil zpoždění</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In Basque (with many alterations to determiners and verbs):</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Atzerapenak eragin du arazoa</em></li>
				<li><em>Arazoak atzerapena eragin zuen</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In Russian (with changes to the endings on the nouns):</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Задержка вызвала проблему (Zaderzhka vyzvala problemu)</em></li>
				<li><em>Проблема вызвала задержку (Problema vyzvala zaderzhku)</em></li>

			<p>Some languages show more complex patterns.</p>
			<p>Around 70 languages, including German, Dutch and Hungarian are 
			recorded as having two dominant orderings (usually varying between 
			SVO and SOV).</p>
			<p>German, for 
			example, has the usual order of SVO (<em>ich sah ihn [I saw him]</em>) 
			but in subordinate clauses it becomes SOV (<em>weil ich ihn sehen 
			will [because I him see want]</em>).<br />
			French, too, inserts the 
			pronoun object after the subject (<em>je le vois [I him see]</em>) 
			so it partly shows SOV word order in these cases although it is 
			canonically SVO (<em>je vois Marie [I see Marie]</em>) when no 
			pronoun is used.</p>

			<p>The list above refers to the most common ordering in the 
			languages listed.&nbsp; This is not to say that the order is the 
			only possible one.<br />
			The languages on the left are generally regarded as having the most 
			rigid word ordering rules but even within them there are variations, 
			especially in terms of alterations to the canonical (usual) ordering 
			to achieve special emphasis or marking (see the guide to markedness 
			linked in the list at the end).<br />
			Subject-Object-Verb languages are somewhat more forgiving and most 
			will have Object–Subject–Verb as an alternative ordering.&nbsp; A 
			very few, mostly small and often endangered languages, require O-S-V 
			as the canonical or most normal ordering of elements of a clause.&nbsp; 
			In Turkish, the canonical word ordering is S-O-V in almost all 
			declarative clauses.<br />
			Both Japanese and Korean allow O-S-V ordering when the object is 
			being marked for special emphasis (as does English as we have seen).<br />
			Some heavily inflected languages have much freer word ordering than, 
			say, English because the relationship between elements of a clause 
			is signalled by inflexions for case.</p>

			fewer people than those in the list above and they include:</p>

			<p>Languages will differ and put all of the above in different

			<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>numerals</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>all European languages prefer Numeral–Noun but many 
				South-East Asian and African languages reverse the order.&nbsp; 
				Some languages allow both and some, such as Egyptian Arabic, 
				prefer Noun–Numeral for 1 and 2 and then reverse the order for 
				other numbers.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>adjectives</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>French prefers the Noun–Adjective pattern in, e.g., <em>un 
				vase fabuleuse</em> (although some common adjectives precede the 
				noun (<em>un beau vase</em>).&nbsp; Greek and most Germanic 
				languages (German, Dutch etc.) and the Scandinavian languages 
				follow the Adjective–Noun pattern.<br />
				Slavonic languages such as Polish, Russian and Czech also 
				usually have Noun–Adjective as do Thai and the Romance languages 
				(Italian, Romanian, Portuguese, Spanish etc.)<br />
				All varieties of Arabic are Noun–Adjective, too.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>classifiers</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>Many languages, listed below, are left headed so the 
				classifier follows the noun.&nbsp; More on headedness below.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>genitives</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>many languages have a single ordering (unlike English).<br />
				Some languages put a possessive before a noun (as in
				<em>my life </em>[English]<em>, ma vie </em>[French]<em>, mein leben </em>[German]<em>, mit 
				liv</em> [Danish] but that is not the point here.&nbsp; English 
				has an <strong>inflected</strong> genitive (<em>Mary's book</em>, 
				for example) for which Romance languages do not have an 
				equivalent, always preferring a construction such as <em>the 
				book of Mary.</em><br />
				Romance languages generally prefer the Noun–Genitive pattern but 
				Scandinavian languages use Genitive–Noun.<br />
				All forms of Arabic are Noun–Genitive but Chinese languages, 
				Japanese and Thai are Genitive–Noun.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>prepositions</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>English has prepositions but other languages use 
				postpositions (<em>London in</em> not <em>in London</em>).&nbsp; 
				Among them are Turkish, Japanese, Korean and the Chinese 
				languages.<br />
				German also uses postpositions as well as prepositions, depending 
				on the word in question.<br />
				There are eleven items which sometime function as postpositions in English:
				<em>ago, apart, aside, away, hence, notwithstanding, on, over, 
				short, through, withal </em>(rare / dialect).</dd>

				<h2>Patterns across languages</h2>

			</table>
			<p>Although there are exceptions, there are some interesting (for 
			some) correlations across languages which have been uncovered.<br />
			The table above considered two fundamental and common types of 
			languages.&nbsp; Those, like English, in which the Object follows 
			the verb, called VO languages, and those, like Japanese in which the 
			Verb follows the Object, called OV languages.<br />
			Essentially this just means do you say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John the book stole </em>(OV)<em><br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John stole the book </em>(VO)<em>.</em></p>
			<p>The picture looks a bit like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="vo and ov" height="556" src="../../imagesgraphics/VO_OV.png" width="620" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>For teaching purposes, this may not be very helpful but it may 
			explain why certain learners make some simple word-ordering errors 
			and allow you to alert them to the fact that English is, 
			predominantly (i.e., bar the odd genitive forms), a VO language and 
			follows the general patterns of such things.<br />
			If we take the number of languages in the world to be around 7000, 
			very roughly 5600 will fall into one or other of these categories, 
			3400 or so into the VO section and 2200 into the OV section.</p>

		<h2>Headedness</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Headedness refers to what comes first, i.e., what the head of phrase 
		or compound is.&nbsp; The head of a phrase or compound determines its 
		grammatical function in the syntax of the language.<br />
		The two pairs of terms used in this respect are right- or left-headed or 
		head final and head initial.</p>
		<p>For example, in English a compound noun is usually formed with the 
		head to the right so we have, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a record player</em><br />
		is a type of player, not a type of record and<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; a walking stick</em><br />
		is a noun for a type of stick, not a verb form.<br />
		Other languages may be left headed in this respect so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>znaczek Pocztowy<br />
		and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; timbru poștal <br />
		</em>are the Polish and Romanian respectively for <em>postage stamp</em> 
		and nouns not adjectives so left-headed compounds.<br />
		And in French, <em>a walking stick</em> is <em>un bâton de marche</em> 
		and <em>a record player</em> <em>un tourne-disque</em>.</p>
			<p>To complicate matters, some languages, particularly Slavic ones such as 
		Polish and Russian, will place the adjective before the noun but choose 
		to place a classifier after the noun.&nbsp; In Polish, for example,
		<em>large postage stamp</em> translates as <em>duża znaczka pocztowa</em> 
		(literally <em>large stamp postage</em>).</p>
			<p>For a little more, see the guide to compounding linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>
		<p>Headedness also affects other word ordering.<br />
		Every phrase in a language has a head so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>at the market<br />
		</em>is a prepositional phrase with the head <em>at</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>has walked out the door</em><br />
		is a verb phrase with the head <em>walked</em> post-modified by a 
		prepositional phrase (<em>out the door</em>) which has <em>out</em> as 
		its Head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>an old man</em><br />
		is a noun phrase with the head <em>man</em><br />
		In English, noun phrases are usually right-headed because the adjective 
		and determiner (<em>old</em> and <em>an</em>) lie to the left of the 
		head.<br />
		Prepositional phrases and verb phrases, on the other hand, are usually 
		left headed with the head of the phrase preceding the complement 
		although the alternative analysis calling the noun phrase the object of 
		the preposition rather than the complement, restores the situation 
		somewhat and mirrors the verb-object ordering of other clauses.<br />
		It is unlikely that any languages are wholly consistent in this respect 
		but English, apart from, arguably, prepositional phrases, is predominately 
		right headed (or head final) with the head in the second 
		position in the phrase.<br />
		The more complex a modifier is, however, the more likely it is, in 
		English, to follow the head.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an old man out there in his boat</em><br />
		contains two sorts of modification:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Light elements (<em>an</em> and <em>the</em>) which come to the left of the head</li>
			<li>Heavy elements (<em>out there</em> and <em>in his boat</em>) which follow the 
			tendency of the language to end-weight such elements and appear to 
			the right of the head.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>and it would be unusual marking to render that as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out there in his boat is an old man</em></p>
			<p>Japanese is the usual example of a right headed language in which the 
		head follows the rest of the phrase as the normal ordering of the 
		elements.&nbsp; So for example, the object of the verb will precede the 
		verb and the prepositional complement will precede the preposition 
		(which is, in fact, a postposition).&nbsp; We get therefore e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He books bought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was home at</em><br />
		etc.</p>
			<p>Languages will differ in this respect so, for example, in English it is 
		usual to have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>my book</em> (right headed)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>three books</em> (right headed)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>that book </em>(right headed)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>went crazy </em>(left headed)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>through the park</em> (left headed)<br />
		and so on, but other languages will do things differently and get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>book my</em> (e.g., Greek)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>books three</em> (e.g., Swahili and many other 
		Niger-Congo languages)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>book that</em> (e.g., Hebrew)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>crazy went</em> (e.g., Japanese)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the park through</em> (e.g., Turkish)</p>
		<p>The jury is still out concerning how fundamental the right- <em>vs</em>. 
		left-headed nature of languages is and how sustainable it is as a way to 
		classify languages but here is a short list:</p>

		<h2>Topicalisation</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Some languages, for example, the Chinese languages, are known as 
		topicalising languages.<br />
		Simply put, this means that instead of having a subject or object as the 
		first item, these languages front the topic of the sentence regardless 
		of its grammatical function.<br />
		We get, therefore, something like:<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noodles I like spicy ones best</em></span> 
		(with a fronted object)<br />
		or<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marriage that is not yet for me</em></span> (with 
		a fronted subject)<br />
		or<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave, I'll go tomorrow</em></span> 
		(with a fronted verb)</p>
		<p>All languages are capable of this to some extent but it's quite rare 
		in English.<br />
		Some European languages, such as Spanish, employ the tactic frequently 
		and it is at least arguable that the habit in German and Dutch (as well 
		as some others) of putting the time adverbial at the front of the 
		sentence and altering the word order following it to Verb + Subject, 
		rather than the usual Subject + Verb, is also an example of 
		topicalisation.&nbsp; For example, in German, the unmarked<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am seeing the doctor next week<br />
		</em>becomes:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nächste Woche gehe ich zum Arzt<br />
		</em>although<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ich gehe nächste Woche zum Arzt<br />
		</em>is also a common ordering.<br />
		The ordering in English of:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next week I am seeing the doctor</em><br />
		is reserved for times when we wish to mark the adverbial time expression 
		for emphasis.</p>
		<p>Learners with a topicalising language background will produce a range 
		of connected errors, often involving doubling the subject such as <em>
		*That factory, there is where my father works</em>.<br />
		Yes, that's why they do that.<br />
		There is a guide to how fronting 
		works on the site, linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>

				<li>Because word order is English is often the only way of 
				knowing what's the object and what's the subject, getting it 
				wrong can have severe communicative implications.&nbsp; 
				Especially at lower levels, therefore, we need to focus on 
				canonical word order &ndash; most declarative sentences in English follow 
				the SVO pattern.</li>
				<li>Models are important.&nbsp; As is mentioned above, poets and 
				song writers often corrupt the natural word order in English for 
				effect.&nbsp; Presenting songs and poems needs to be carefully 
				done and you need to inspect the content in order to alert your 
				learners to any unnatural ordering.</li>
				<li>Postpositional first languages will cause potential problems 
				when teaching prepositional structures and especially 
				prepositional phrases.&nbsp; Handle with care.&nbsp; There are only 
				eleven (probably ten) 
				or so postpositions in English (with over 200 prepositions) so 
				it's important to point out their unusual nature when 
				your learners encounter, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The food <span class="style_black">
				<strong>aside</strong></span>, the party was very successful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived over an hour <span class="style_black"><strong>
				ago</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's two miles <span class="style_black"><strong>away</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They met again three years <span class="style_black"><strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's two inches <span class="style_black"><strong>short</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They worked the whole night <span class="style_black">
				<strong>through</strong></span><br />
				</em>etc.</li>
				<li>Languages which are heavily inflected for case will often 
				have very flexible word order.&nbsp; That is definitely not the case 
				in English and learners need to have their attention drawn to 
				the fact.</li>
				<li>English, somewhat confusingly, requires a subject 
				for a verb such as <em>snow</em> although it's hard to see what it is.&nbsp; 
				The reason is to do with the tendency to state facts in the 
				language using an anticipatory or dummy <em>it </em>or <em>there</em> 
				as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an opener in the drawer</em><br />
				rather than, as is common in many languages:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An opener is in the drawer</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult to use the opener</em><br />
				rather than the more obvious:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the opener is difficult</em><br />
				For more, see the guide to the anticipatory <em>it</em> and <em>there</em> linked 
				in the list at the end.</li>
				<li>The genitive in English is unusual and needs careful 
				treatment if you are to avoid errors such as<em><br />

				<li>At lower levels in particular, it is necessary to be 
				explicit in exemplification of the Numeral–Noun, Adjective–Noun, 
				Classifier–Noun 
				and Demonstrative–Noun patterns.&nbsp; A focus on headedness 
				pays dividends.</li>
				<li>Covert error is common when word ordering is carried over 
				from a learner's first language so, while:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next week I'm going home<br />
				</em>is perfectly acceptable in English, the raising of the time 
				phrase to the theme position in the sentence marks it for an 
				emphasis which the learner may not have intended.&nbsp; Equally, 
				on hearing the phrase in English, a learner may not understand 
				the speaker's intention to mark the time phrase.</li>
				<li>Headedness needs handling to avoid the clumsiness of, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The driver of the taxi helped me with my bags</em></li>
				<li>Topicalising is, as we noted, quite rare in English but 
				learners with a topicalising first language are likely to carry 
				over the structure into English with usually erroneous or odd 
				production as a result.&nbsp; They need guidance concerning how 
				English identifies the topic of sentences.</li>

			<p>As is mentioned above, much of this is involved with getting 
			models right and encouraging noticing.&nbsp; However, there are some 
			things to consider when you focus on this area.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Jumbled sentences to reorder are helpful but keep the focus 
				and don't jumble all the words or the learners will not see the 
				patterns.&nbsp; For example, presenting lower-level learners 
				with a task such as<span class="style_black"><br /><em>Put these words in the right order:</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38"><em>lovely in vases of window for I my 
				two those collection pottery want the</em><br />
				</span>is too hard to do and doesn't provide any focus.<br />
				It would 
				be better as:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Put the words and phrases in the right place</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38"><em>I want _______ _______ _______ vases 
				_______ the 
				window _______ for _______ 
			collection _______.</em></span><br /><span class="style_black"><em>Choose from:</em></span><span class="auto-style38"><br /><em>those | two | lovely | in | my 
				| of pottery</em></span><br />
				This exercise focuses the learners on noticing which things 
				precede or follow which.</li>
				<li>It's also a good idea to get the learners to try to insert 
				elements of the language into utterances for themselves so they 
				get a feel for what goes where.&nbsp; For example,<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>What words can go in the gaps in this?</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38"><em>A: Come _______ the garden, I want to 
				show you something _______.<br />
				B: OK.&nbsp; What is this _______ thing you want _______ to see 
				_______?<br />
				A: _______ is ______ here, _______ the shed.</em></span><br />
				etc.<br />
				You can also focus the learners by giving them a list of words 
				to insert, some possible, some not.</li>
				<li>At lower levels, it's important to focus on elements 
				separately.&nbsp; For example,<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Fill the gaps with the words in the list.</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38"><em>There is no reason to worry _______ 
				the _______ weather.&nbsp; I have brought _______ umbrellas and 
				_______ _______ coat for you.</em></span><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Choose from:</em></span><span class="auto-style38"></span><br /><span class="auto-style38"><em>two | warm| terrible | a | about</em></span><br />
				This focuses <strong>only</strong> on determiners and adjective 
				positions.</li>
				<li>Spot the mistake activities are useful, too, to get people 
				to notice the importance of word order in English.<br />
				Take a story you have presented in class and make up sentences 
				about it reversing the order of some elements and keeping others 
				intact.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Mark each sentence true or false:</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38"><em>She kissed him </em> </span>
				<span class="style_black"><em>T / F</em></span><br /><span class="auto-style38"><em>He gave her the flowers </em> </span>
				<span class="style_black"><em>T / F</em></span><br /><span class="auto-style38"><em>They gave the flowers to him</em></span>
				<span class="style_black"><em>T / F</em></span><br /><span class="auto-style38"><em>She introduced him to the man 
				</em> </span>
				<span class="style_black"><em>T / F</em></span><br />
				etc.&nbsp; Mixing direct and indirect objects is a good way to 
				alert people to the relationships indicated by English word 
				order.</li>
				<li>An awareness raising exercise involves taking these sorts of 
				elements and embedding them in sentences for the learners to 
				translate into their own language in order to compare the 
				ordering of items.&nbsp; For example,<br />
				<em><span class="auto-style38">I came today because I wanted to 
				buy some tickets</span></em><br />
				becomes, in German, often<br />
				<em><span class="auto-style38">Today, came I because I some 
				tickets (to) buy wanted</span><br />
				</em>In other languages, the differences will be more or less 
				extreme but they will almost certainly be different.&nbsp; It 
				can be both fruitful and fun to compare how things work, 
				especially in multi-lingual classes.&nbsp; In monolingual 
				classes, you have the advantage that you can focus on specific 
				differences, of course.</li>
