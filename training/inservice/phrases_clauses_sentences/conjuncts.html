			<h1>Conjuncts (or conjunctive adverbs)</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="conjuncts" height="207" src="../../images/door_latch310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>The term conjunct is variably used by grammarians but most will 
			include conjunctions as a special form of conjunct.&nbsp; You may 
			also find these forms referred to as <strong>conjoins</strong>.&nbsp; 
			Another common way to describe the role is as a conjunctive adverb.&nbsp; 
			That makes sense, because they are adverbs and the act in a 
			conjunctive fashion.&nbsp; We'll stick to 
			the more common <em>conjunct</em> in what follows.<br />
			This guide mostly concerns conjuncts which are <strong>not</strong> 
			conjunctions, although it will often contrast them and see how 
			conjuncts and conjunctions co-occur.&nbsp; There is a separate guide on this site to 
			conjunctions, linked in the list of related guides at the end, which considers matters of coordination, 
			subordination and correlation and there are also separate guides to 
			subordination and coordination which contain more detail.</p>
			<p>Conjuncts form a class of adverbials, the other three being 
			adjuncts, disjuncts and subjuncts.&nbsp; If you need to place 
			conjuncts in that context, you may find it helpful to look at the general guide to adjuncts, 
			conjuncts, subjuncts and disjuncts on this site, linked in the list of related 
			guides at the end.</p>

			<p>Although we have already noted that conjunctions are a class of 
			conjuncts, it is important now to get the distinctions clear because 
			what follows will be difficult to understand until that is done.</p>
			
		<p>Look at these four and focus on <span class="style_black"><strong>
		<em>the bits 
		in black</em></strong></span>.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>I was very late </em><span class="style_black"><em><strong>so</strong></em></span> 
			<em>I had 
			to run to catch my train.</em></li>
			<li><em>I came late.&nbsp; </em><span class="style_black"><strong>
			<em>Therefore</em></strong></span><em>, I missed his introduction.</em></li>
			<li><em>He is being obstructive <span class="style_black"><strong>
			and</strong></span> he isn't helping.</em></li>
			<li><em>He is being rude.&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>
			Moreover</strong></span>, 
			he isn't helping.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>What happens if you remove the bits <strong class="style_black">in black</strong>?&nbsp; 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'conj1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when 
		you have an answer</a>.</p>
		<div id="conj1"style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" >
		<ol>
			<li><em>I was very late </em><span class="style_black"><em><strong>so</strong></em></span> 
			<em>I had 
			to run to catch my train.<br />
			</em><span class="style_brown">If you remove the bit in black here, 
			you get an ungrammatical sentence (called a run-on sentence, by the 
			way):<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was very late I had to run to catch my train<br />
			</em>If you want to avoid that, you have to split the sentence into two 
			parts.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was very late.&nbsp; I had to run to catch my train<br />
			</em>You then lose some of the sense of the result of being late 
			although a sympathetic listener can make the connection.</span></li>
			<li><em>I came late.&nbsp; </em><span class="style_black"><strong>
			<em>Therefore</em></strong></span><em><span class="style_black">, 
			</span>I missed his introduction.<br />
			</em><span class="style_brown">In this, removing the bit in black 
			does not produce anything ungrammatical although some sense is lost.</span></li>
			<li><em>He is being obstructive <span class="style_black"><strong>
			and</strong></span> he isn't helping.<br />
			</em><span class="style_brown">If you remove the bit in black, you 
			get an ungrammatical sentence (another run-on sentence):<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is being obstructive he isn't helping<br />
			</em>You also lose 
			some sense of the addition of the two behaviours.</span></li>
			<li><em>He is being difficult.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
			<strong>Moreover</strong></span>, 
			he isn't helping.<br />
			</em><span class="style_brown">Removing the bit in black leaves two 
			perfectly grammatical sentence but, again, you lose the sense of the 
			additional sense.</span></li>
		</ol>
		<p><span class="style_brown">In 1. and 3. we have two types of
		<strong>conjunction</strong>.<br />
		2. and 4. express similar concepts but they contain <strong>
		conjuncts</strong>, not conjunctions.</span></p>
		<p><span class="style_brown">The test is: <strong>are the expressions an 
		integral part of the sentence or not?<br />
		</strong>If they are, you are dealing 
		with conjunctions, if they are not, you are dealing with conjuncts.</span></p>
		
		</div>
			<p>To check if you can distinguish between a conjunct and a 
			conjunction, <a href="conjuncts1hp.htm">try this test</a>.</p>
			<p>If you got all those right, it's safe to move on.</p>

				<h2>The difference between conjuncts and adjuncts</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>As you will know, if you have followed the general guide to 
			adverbials, adjuncts are integral to the clause in which they occur.&nbsp; 
			So, for example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called on John but
			<span class="style_black">unfortunately</span> he was out at work</em><br />
			we have the adjunct adverbial <em>unfortunately</em> which is 
			integral to the second clause.&nbsp; It does not act to link the 
			clauses because there is no logical connection between them.&nbsp; 
			We can, therefore, have a perfectly understandable clause such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, John was out at work</em><br />
			However, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I called on John and I telephoned him
			<span class="style_black"><strong>as well</strong></span>.</em><br />
			we have a conjunct,<em> as well, </em>reinforcing the additional 
			event.<br />
			We cannot, in this case, have a standalone clause as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I telephoned him as well<br />
			</em>because it presumes the first clause.</p>
			<p>Some words can act in both ways and that can cause some 
			confusion.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wanted an explanation and we, too, were 
			keen to know why it had happened</em><br />
			the role of <em>too</em> is simply as an adjunct, concerning the 
			second clause.&nbsp; The conjoin in this case is the conjunction <em>
			and</em>.<br />
			But in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;They take their spring holidays in France.&nbsp; They 
			take a cruise once a year, <span class="style_black"><strong>too</strong></span>.</em><br />
			the word <em>too</em> is acting as a conjunct and could be replaced 
			by, for example, <em>furthermore, and what's more, to boot</em> or
			<em>in addition</em>.</p>
			<p>Whether you choose to analyse something as an additive adjunct or 
			a reinforcing / additive conjunct is often a matter of emphasis.<br />
			This somewhat technical difference is not one with which to trouble 
			learners but it is quite important to know what function words are 
			performing.&nbsp; See, too, below, the discussion of syntactical homonymy.</p>

				<td class="auto-style38">
				<h2>The form of conjuncts</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>All conjuncts are a form of adverbial but they are not all 
			adverbs.&nbsp; Here's a short list of the various forms that 
			conjuncts may take:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Adverbs<br />
				These are the most frequent form.&nbsp; Examples are:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He has spent all his money.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_black"><strong>Besides</strong></span>, there 
				is nothing he really wants to buy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has lots of money.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
				<strong>However</strong></span>, there's nothing he wants to 
				buy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was late.&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>
				Additionally</strong></span>, it was overcrowded and 
				uncomfortable.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We waited forever in the rain.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_black"><strong>Eventually</strong></span>, 
				the train turned up.</em></li>
				<li>Prepositional phrases<br />
				These are generally slightly more formal alternatives to simple 
				adverbs and can be formed from them providing there is an 
				available noun to function as the complement of the preposition.&nbsp; 
				Examples are:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is snow forecast.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
				<strong>In addition</strong></span>, it's going to be windy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is snow forecast.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
				<strong>Notwithstanding the weather</strong></span>, we are 
				taking the trip.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trains here are rarely late.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_black"><strong>By contrast</strong></span>, 
				they are always late in my country.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came late.&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>In 
				consequence</strong></span>, she missed the chairman's 
				introduction<br />
				</em>There is no noun available from the adverbs <em>eventually</em> 
				or <em>subsequently</em> so no prepositional phrase alternative 
				can be constructed.&nbsp; (There is a noun, <em>eventuality</em>, 
				but it concerns a possible event or outcome.)</li>
				<li>Finite clauses (often conditional or contingent)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was late.&nbsp; </em>
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>If it hadn't been</em></strong></span><em>, 
				I would have been early.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll leave soon.&nbsp; </em><span class="style_black">
				<strong><em>Unless I do</em></strong></span><em> I'll miss my 
				train.</em></li>
				<li>Non-finite verb forms are used but less commonly<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will snow tomorrow.&nbsp; </em>
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>Taking that into account</em></strong></span><em>, 
				we'll leave a bit earlier.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a shambles.&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>
				Better put</strong></span>, it's irreparable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>To sum up</strong></span>, 
				the situation is a bit difficult<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>That said</strong></span>, 
				it's going to be a better result than last year</em></li>
				<li>Even less commonly and formally, demonstrative pronouns 
				exhibit conjunct-like behaviour although they are not adverbial; 
				they are pro-forms.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John wanted evidence of progress.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_black"><strong>That</strong></span> I could 
				not find.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why don't we go out for dinner.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_black"><strong>That</strong></span> I would 
				enjoy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stays out till all hours.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
				<strong>This</strong></span> her father will not tolerate.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tells me the paint is here.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_black"><strong>This</strong></span> I cannot 
				see.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She pointed out her new shoes.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_black"><strong>Those</strong></span> I did 
				not like.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the old tools he gave me.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_black"><strong>These</strong></span> I do not 
				use.<br />
				</em>Only <em>that</em> and <em>this</em> can be used to refer 
				to a clause, incidentally, as in the second and third examples, 
				because, by their nature, clauses are singular.&nbsp; Even when 
				reference is to more than one clause, <em>these</em> and <em>
				those</em> are not used, so. e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why don't we go out, see a film and have 
				dinner in town later?&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">That
				</span>I would enjoy.<br />
				</em>is allowed, but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why don't we go out, see a film and have 
				dinner in town later?&nbsp; *Those I would enjoy.<br />
				</em>is not.</li>

			This horrible expression refers to the fact that words and 
			phrases can slide between classes because they can perform 
			different functions depending on the intended meaning.<p>Some words and phrases exhibit this phenomenon and can act as 
			conjuncts in certain settings, as conjunctions in others and 
			prepositions in other environments.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>
			Notwithstanding</strong></span> his objections, I am determined to 
			do it.</em><br />
			the word is acting as a preposition, but in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He objects.&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>
			Notwithstanding</strong></span>, I am determined to do it.</em><br />
			the word is acting as an adverb and a conjunct, although <em>
			nevertheless</em> would be a more common choice, and in:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>Notwithstanding</strong></span> 
			that he objects, I am determined to do it.</em><br />
			the word is acting as a subordinating conjunction.<br />
			What this means is that we have an case of categorical 
			indeterminacy: we do not know, just by looking at it, whether the 
			item in question is a conjunct or a simple prepositional phrase.</p>
			<p>Adverbs, too, of course, are not always conjuncts affecting the 
			whole of the second clause and linking it to the first.&nbsp; 
			Sometimes, they function to modify only the verb phrase of which 
			they are part and are simple adjuncts.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John <span class="style_black">eventually</span> told me 
			the truth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary <span class="style_black">certainly</span> believed him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_black">initially</span> forgot to pay</em><br />
			the adverbs are operating as adjuncts modifying the verbs in the 
			usual way.<br />
			They also modify adjectives and other adverbs, too, of course, so in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was <span class="style_black">obviously</span> 
			tired<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He argued <span class="style_black">rather</span> fervently 
			for the idea</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was <span class="style_black">still</span> 
			unhappy</em><br />
			the adverbs are modifying adjectives and adverbs, respectively.<br />
			However, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can't wait forever.&nbsp;
			<span class="style_black"><strong>Eventually</strong></span>, we 
			will have to make a decision<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to start somewhere.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
			<strong>Initially</strong></span>, we need a plan of action.</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was poor.&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>
			Still</strong></span>, she spent her money freely.</em><br />
			the adverbs are functioning as conjuncts, linking the clauses.&nbsp; 
			How they are doing that is described below.</p>
			<p>This phenomenon is even more marked in the case of disjuncts, to 
			which there is a separate guide linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>

			<p>Conjuncts are frequently written rather than spoken but they are 
			used in oral communication, and a few, as we shall see, are almost 
			confined to spoken language.<br />
			The intonation on the conjunct, whether a single word or a phrase, 
			or even a finite clause, tends to be a rise-fall to indicate its 
			importance.&nbsp; Like this:<br />
			<img alt="intonation" height="114" src="../../imagesgraphics/conjunct_intonation.png" width="250" /></p>
			<p>If you are going to practise using conjuncts in spoken language,

			<p>So far, an effort has been made to keep things separate and 
			clear.&nbsp; However, it is quite common to find both conjunctions and conjuncts 
			occurring in tandem.&nbsp; This can confuse learners because the 
			conjunction often serves a different purpose from the conjunct and 
			the reader or hearer needs to combine the notions to get the full 
			meaning.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>coordinating conjunction + conjunct</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came with most of his family and, 
				additionally, with a number of friends<br />
				</em>in which the clauses are connected with the coordinator <em>
				and</em> with the conjunct, <em>additionally</em>, serving to 
				emphasise the additive nature.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's not very hard working but, that 
				said, she is good at what she does<br />
				</em>in which we have an adversative coordinator, <em>but</em>, 
				and a concessive conjunct, <em>that said</em>.&nbsp; Both senses 
				are encoded in the sentence.</dd>
				<dt><strong>subordinating conjunction + conjunct</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They made too many mistakes because, for a 
				start, they didn't check the figures and, secondly, because they 
				didn't get the maths right<br />
				</em>in which we have the causal subordinating conjunction <em>
				because</em> used twice, a coordinating conjunction, <em>and</em>, 
				and a listing and enumerative conjunct,<em> for a start</em> and
				<em>secondly</em> in the same sentence.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was happy with the work whereas I, 
				however, did not think it was good enough<br />
				</em>in which we have a contrastive subordination conjunction,
				<em>whereas</em>, and a concessive conjunct, <em>however</em>.</dd>

			<p>There are as many ways of classifying what conjuncts do as there

			intended to be an original contribution to the discussion and you 
			will see that some of the categories overlap (or are contiguous).<br />
			For teaching purposes, however, they are helpful in terms of 
			planning what to teach so that you are focusing on a limited range 
			of concepts in a lesson.&nbsp; Mixing up lots of different functions 
			when teaching the area is a sure way to confuse your learners.</p>
			<p>All conjuncts function to join independent clauses.&nbsp; That is

			<p>Listing conjuncts imply that what is being said forms 
				part of a series.&nbsp; The simplest way of doing this in 
				English is by the use of commas but certain conjuncts perform 
				this function and emphasise the fact that we are dealing with a 
				list.&nbsp; Examples are:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>For a start</em></strong></span><em>, you are late.</em><span class="style_black"><br /></span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="style_black">

			<p>When listings are ordered, a number of other conjuncts are

			<span class="style_black"><strong>At the end</strong></span>, 
				it'll be quite satisfying.<br /></em>For obvious reasons, enumerative conjuncts often appear in 
				tandem with an initial listing conjunct.<br />These sorts of conjuncts are often referred to as sequencers and 
				that is a familiar way of talking about them.&nbsp; They are 
				sequencers but they are also conjuncts.</p>

			<h3><strong>Additive / reinforcing</strong></h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Closely connected to the ideas of listing and enumerating is the category of 
				additive conjuncts which often perform a reinforcing function, 
				making the connection more forceful.&nbsp; These are common and 
				commonly taught.&nbsp; Examples are:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is late. 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;In addition</strong></span>, he has forgotten his 
				notes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have completed the project.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_black"><strong>Furthermore</strong></span>, 
				we have written up the report.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is on holiday.&nbsp; Her secretary is
				<span class="style_black"><strong>as well</strong></span>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather's getting chilly.&nbsp; 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>Moreover</strong></span>, the forecast is for snow.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work is essential.&nbsp; 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>Additionally</strong></span>, it's urgent.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lost his way.&nbsp; 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>Into 
				the bargain</strong></span>, he had forgotten to bring a map.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was rude to the manager.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
			<strong>What's more</strong></span>, she was wrong.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has no work and no hope of getting any,
				<span class="style_black"><strong>to boot</strong></span>.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<em>He came with some friends and he brought his sister,
				<span class="style_black"><strong>too</strong></span>.</em><br />The conjuncts 
			<em>too</em> and <em>as well </em>can only occur at the end of a clause and 
				that is unusual because most conjuncts are conventionally 
				initial.&nbsp; It leads to errors such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was late.&nbsp; He
				<span class="style_black"><strong>as well</strong></span> lost 
				his notes.</em><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was late.&nbsp; 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>As well</strong></span> 
				he lost his notes.</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>He was late.&nbsp; 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>Too</strong></span>, 
				he lost his notes</em>.<br />Other constructions which perform an additive function can be 
				placed initially, in medial position or terminally:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's cold.&nbsp; It's very windy,
				<span class="style_black"><strong>moreover</strong></span>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's cold.&nbsp; It is, 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>moreover</strong></span>, very windy</em><br />etc.<br />An oddity with the adverb 
			<em>too</em> is that it can function 
				to modify a noun phrase but it still has its additive function.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She loves parties and he, 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>too</strong></span>, is quite happy to go to them.</em><br />and here the word is functioning as an adjunct modifying the 
				pronoun, not a conjunct.<br />Additive conjuncts often occur in tandem with additive 
				conjunctions and play an amplifying role so we see, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather's getting chilly, and,
				<span class="style_black"><strong>moreover</strong></span>, snow 
				is the forecast.</em></p>
			<p>There is a good deal of stylistic variation with additive 
			conjuncts, some being quite formal, others confined to informal 
			speech and very informal writing.&nbsp; In the first category we 
			find <em>furthermore, moreover </em>and<em> in addition</em>.&nbsp; 
			In the second category, we find <em>what's more, to boot </em>and<em> 
			into the bargain</em>.&nbsp; Others are more neutral in tone.</p>

			<p>Apposition refers to the fact that the topic is common to 
				both clauses.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has gone horribly wrong.&nbsp; 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>In 
				other words</strong></span>, it's a disaster.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's not the man for the job.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She won't be at work for a week or so.&nbsp;
			<span class="style_black"><strong>That is to say</strong></span>, 
			you need to find someone else to do this.</em></p>
			<p>A sub-group of this category are conjuncts used to  rephrase  
				or slightly correct what has been said or written and it is sometimes impossible 
				(and rarely necessary) to separate the functions.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's working off and on.&nbsp; 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>Better 
				put</strong></span>, it's an intermittent fault.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's not coming.&nbsp; 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>Rather</strong></span>, he can't come until later.<br />
			</em>The last example could also be classified as a concessive 
				use.</p>
			<p>A further subset occurs in dialogue and signals an inference made 
			by the second or subsequent speaker.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm afraid I can't come.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">In other words</span>, you don't 
			want to</em><br />

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My car's in the workshop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">In that case</span>, I'll take 
			the train</em></p>
			<p>The conjunction <em>or</em> is often seen in tandem with these 
				conjuncts so we may have, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's not happy with the work or
				<span class="style_black"><strong>rather</strong></span> she 
				wasn't pleased at first</em></p>

			These are sometimes called subject-switching conjuncts.<br />For example:<br />

			<p>By their nature, conjuncts are ideal cohesive devices to maintain 
			theme-rheme structures in both writing and speech (more usually the 
			former).<br />
			If the concept of theme-rheme coherence is unfamiliar to you, there 
			is a guide on this site, linked below.&nbsp; Here it will suffice to 
			say that the theme is the subject or main participant in a clause 
			and the rheme is all that follows.&nbsp; The rheme is often taken up 
			immediately or at a later stage in a paragraph or longer spoken turn 
			to become the theme of the next clause and so on.<br />
			To exemplify, here is a slightly adapted company memo:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">After consultation with department 
			representatives, a new company working policy will soon be 
			implemented. <strong>Accordingly</strong>, everyone will be enabled 
			to do a number of things. <strong>Firstly</strong>, flexi-working 
			will be permitted. <strong>Consequently</strong>, this means that, 
			providing your work is not affected, you will be able to come to 
			work and go home at any time between 8 am and 9pm. <strong>Of course</strong>, 
			the hours one spends at work will be unchanged. <strong>However</strong>, 
			more individual flexibility is allowed. <strong>For example</strong>, 
			if you wish, you can work for 10 hours a day for four days and have 
			a 3-day weekend. <strong>Alternatively</strong>, you may prefer to 
			work two half days every week and spread the work over six days.<br />
			<strong>Secondly</strong>, everyone will be able to access the 
			server from home, providing they have a secure terminal. <strong>
			Therefore</strong>, there will be the possibility to work at home 
			sometimes. <strong>However</strong>, if your presence in the 
			building is required because you are meeting customers or agents, 
			then that will not be an option on those days. <strong>Otherwise</strong>, 
			at-home working will not be affected.</p>
			<p>The conjuncts have been highlighted and you can see that they are 
			of different sorts.&nbsp; The function of them all, however, is to 
			link the themes and rhemes in the text, like this:<br />
			<img alt="text" height="316" src="../../imagesgraphics/theme-rheme_conjuncts.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>To explain a little:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first sentence sets the scene (a topic sentence) and 
				alerts the reader to the content to follow.&nbsp; The theme of 
				that sentence is <span class="style_black"><em>a new company 
				working policy</em></span>.</li>
				<li>That rheme is linked to the next sentence by the conjunct
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>accordingly</strong></em></span> 
				and becomes the new theme, <span class="style_black"><em>everyone</em></span> 
				(meaning the people whom the policy affects), which 
				has the rheme <span class="style_black"><em>will be enabled to 
				do a number of things</em></span>.</li>
				<li>The first of what those things are becomes the theme of the 
				next sentence, linked to it by the enumerator 
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>firstly</em></strong></span>, and 
				concerns the theme <span class="style_black"><em>flexi-working</em></span>.</li>
				<li>Because the passive is used throughout this text, the themes 
				of <span class="style_black"><em>you</em></span> and
				<span class="style_black"><em>everyone</em></span> are assumed.&nbsp; 
				In the active, most themes are simply the subjects of the verb 
				but in the passive, they are normally the patients.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and so on.&nbsp; Refer to the table above to see how the rest 
			works out.</p>

			<p>By their nature, conjuncts often perform an anaphoric function 
			linking what follows to what has come before.&nbsp; Therefore, they 
			most frequently occur in the initial position in a clause (but see 
			below for some exceptions).<br />
			Wherever they occur, they are usually signalled either in writing by 
			a comma or, in speaking, by forming a tone unit separated by slight 
			pauses from the rest of the utterance.<br />
			Here are some examples of what is meant with '<em>||</em>' used to 
			mark the tone units in speech and commas for writing:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway || do you need my help || or not?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, we'll be charging no entry fee at the door.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is, anyhow, the best person for the job.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will || otherwise || have to talk to the customers</em></p>
			<p>In addition, conjuncts are often separated from the preceding 
			clause by a full stop or, at least, by a semi-colon:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She won't be coming to the party; in any case, that's what I 
			understand her to have said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They can't be serious.&nbsp; Or if they are, they must be 
			very confident.<br />
			</em>Not to separate the clauses by at least a semi-colon results in 
			a run-on sentence which is considered bad form in any but the most 
			informal writing.</p>
			<p>There are some exceptions:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>The conjuncts <em>yet</em> and <em>else</em> are usually not 
				separated by tone units or by punctuation so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to hurry 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>else</strong></span> we'll miss the 
				train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no heating in the office <span class="style_black">
				<strong>yet</strong></span> the staff stayed to 
				finish the job<br />
				</em>(The word <em>yet</em> is often considered a coordinating 
				conjunction and you will find it discussed on this site in the 
				guide to coordination.&nbsp; However, it exhibits the 
				characteristics of a conjunct in many ways and is another 
				example of syntactical homonymy or gradience.)</li>
				<li>The word <em>so</em> acts as conjunction in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came so he could help</em><br />
				where no punctuation is needed and no discernible tone unit 
				alerts the hearer to the form.&nbsp; The word links cause and 
				effect.&nbsp; In fact,<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *He came.&nbsp; So, he could help</em><br />
				is unacceptable because the word is a conjunction, not a 
				conjunct.<br />
				When <em>so</em> acts as a conjunct, the normal rules of 
				intonation and punctuation usually apply as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, how can I help?<br />
				</em>When it is a conjunct, <em>so</em> does not mean the same 
				as it does when it is a conjunction:<br />
				As a <strong>conjunction</strong>, <em>so</em> means <em>as a result</em>.<br />
				As a <strong>conjunct</strong>, <em>so</em> means<em> 
				</em>something like<em> 
				to sum up where we are now.<br />
				</em>There is more on this below, including discussion of how 
				the intonation and tone unit structure serves to disambiguate 
				the use of <em> 
				so.</em></li>
				<li>However, <em>so</em> can also act as a conjunct with no 
				punctuation or intonation marking as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was late so we left without him</em><br />
				and we allow conventional conjunct punctuation, and intonation, 
				in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was late.&nbsp; So, we left without him.</em><br />
				or, in speaking:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was late | so | we left without him</em><br />
				Compare, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was late.&nbsp; Consequently, we left 
				without him</em><br />
				which means the same but must be conventionally marked to show 
				the conjunct function and needs at least a semi-colon to 
				separate the clauses and the tone units would be clear in spoken 
				language.</li>

			<p>There are a number of generalities concerning conjuncts which 
			actually make them quite a neat and useful teaching target.&nbsp; 
			However, there are also a few irregularities and pitfalls that it 
			makes sense to be prepared for or avoid.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>All conjuncts, by their nature, refer anaphorically (i.e., 
				back) to a previous notion.&nbsp; In this sense, they are a good 
				deal easier to get right than conjunctions which can operate 
				both anaphorically and cataphorically.<br />
				For example, the subordinating conjunction <em>because</em> 
				works in both ways:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because she was very late, we ate before she came</em><br />
				cataphoric reference to the result, anaphoric reference to the 
				cause<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; We ate before she came because she was very late</em><br />
				anaphoric reference to the result, cataphoric reference to the 
				cause.<br />
				However, when the two ideas are joined with a conjunct, no such 
				reversal of cause and effect is possible and only<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was very late.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
				<strong>Therefore</strong></span>, we ate before she came.</em><br />
				is the possible ordering and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *<span class="style_black"><strong>Therefore</strong></span>, 
				we ate before she came.&nbsp; She was very late</em><br />
				is close to nonsense.</li>
				<li>Because of the anaphoric referencing, nearly all conjuncts 
				are conventionally placed in the initial position of the second 
				clause and it is unusual and often very formal to place them 
				elsewhere.&nbsp; It occurs in writing but rarely in speech that 
				we have, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a good source of help and advice.&nbsp; He is,
				<span class="style_black"><strong>furthermore</strong></span>, 
				generous with his time.</em><br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a good source of help and advice.&nbsp; He is generous with his time,
				<span class="style_black"><strong>furthermore</strong></span>.<br />
				</em>Some conjuncts are irregular in this respect:<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>The conjuncts <em>too</em> and <em>as well </em>only come in 
				final positions in the second clause so while, e.g.:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					<em>He's a good source of help and advice.&nbsp; He is 
				generous with his time, <span class="style_black"><strong>too</strong></span>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a good source of help and advice.&nbsp; He is generous 
				with his time, <span class="style_black"><strong>as well</strong></span>.<br />
					</em>are acceptable, no other position for the conjuncts is 
					usually possible.&nbsp; We cannot have:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					<em>*He's a good source of help and advice.&nbsp; 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>Too</strong></span>, he is 
					generous with his time.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He's a good source of help and advice.&nbsp; 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>As well</strong></span>, 
					he is generous with his time.<br />
					</em>It is, however, possible in formal language to insert 
					the conjuncts in medial position although this is a rare 
					ordering so, just possibly, we may find:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is, <span class="style_black">
					<strong>too</strong></span>, generous with his time</em><br />
					or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is, <span class="style_black"><strong>as well</strong></span>, generous with his time</em><br />
					Where exactly the conjunct is placed is somewhat tricky 
					because it must occur only between not within phrases so we 
					cannot have, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is generous with, <span class="style_black"><strong>too</strong></span>, his time.<br />
					</em>The word <em>too</em> is also an adjunct rather than a 
					conjunct in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He, too, is generous with his time.</em><br />
					which refers only to the subject of the sentence and does 
					not coordinate.&nbsp; That can be a source of confusion.</li>
					<li>The conjunct<em> though</em> is also slightly unusual in 
					often coming terminally but it can come in other positions, 
					albeit more rarely, so:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a good source of 
					help and advice.&nbsp; He is very busy,
					<span class="style_black"><strong>though</strong></span>.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a good source of 
					help and advice.&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>
					Though</strong></span>, he is very busy.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a good source of 
					help and advice.&nbsp; He is,
					<span class="style_black"><strong>though</strong></span>, 
					very busy.<br />
					</em>are all acceptable.<br />It is also unusual in not always being followed 
					by a comma when it is in initial position.<br />There's a little more on <em>though</em> 
					below because it also functions as a conjunction.</li>
					<li>When finite clauses are used as conjuncts, they often demand 
				the initial position and cannot be placed elsewhere, even in 
				formal writing.&nbsp; For example:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's reached the point of no return.&nbsp;
					<span class="style_black"><strong>By which I mean</strong></span> 
				we need to replace it completely.</em><br />is an acceptable rephrasing but the conjunct clause cannot be 
				placed anywhere else in the second sentence.<br />The 
					exemplifying conjunct 
					<em>such as</em> shares this requirement and is 
				only placed initially in the second clause, but needs a 
					non-finite clause construction or a noun phrase to follow it, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He was always prepared to give time to his students.&nbsp;
					<span class="style_black"><strong>Such as</strong></span> 
					helping them with after-hours homework clubs.</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Stylistically, conjuncts are often more formal than the 
				conjunction equivalent so appear most frequently in the written 
				form.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He went to school by bus.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
				<strong>Additionally</strong></span>, he came home in the same 
				way.</em><br />
				is formal to the point of unnatural stiffness<br />
				so<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He went to school 
				by bus <span class="style_black">and</span> came home in the same way</em><br />
				would be preferred.<br />
				There are exceptions here, too:<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>Conjuncts used to change the subject are nearly confined to 
				spoken interaction and very informal writing (such as personal 
				emails, which share stylistic characteristics).&nbsp; In written, 
				especially formal, language, therefore, we do not encounter 
					<span class="style_black"><em><strong>anyway, anyhow, come to think of it, by the bye</strong></em></span> and so on used 
				as subject-switching conjuncts.<br />The exceptions are the conjunct adverbs 
					<em>incidentally</em> and 
				<em>parenthetically</em>, which are used, even in formal writing, to 
				introduce or mark a non-essential but related point.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> The plans include a new Thames bridge.&nbsp; The structure, 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>incidentally</strong></span>, will be paid for with private capital.</em></li>
					<li>The conjunct <em>then </em>is informally used to mean 
					something like a challenge to what has been said.&nbsp; For 
					example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have paid the bill so I assume,
					<span class="style_black"><strong>then</strong></span>, you 
					are happy with my work</em><br />
					and in this case the conjunct can occur initially, medially 
					(as above) or terminally.<br />
					It may also act to show that the speaker has inferred 
					something from what is said as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you are coming to the meeting </em>
					<span class="style_black"><strong><em>then</em></strong></span><em>?</em><br />
					and in this case, it generally occurs terminally in the 
					clause.&nbsp; The conjunct is comparable to a question tag 
					in many cases, especially when the intonation rises towards 
					the end of the clause.</li>
					<li>Some other conjuncts are, by contrast, less formal than the 
				conjunction equivalents and they include many prepositional 
				phrases like<br /><span class="style_black"><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to 
					boot, into the bargain, for a start, on top of 
				that, in a nutshell, what's more, on the other hand</strong></em></span><br />as well as some finite and non-finite clauses including<br />
					<span class="style_black"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a case 
				in point is, if that wasn't enough, to cut a long story short</em></strong></span>.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>We saw above in the section headed Syntactical homonymy that some words can act as adverb adjuncts or as 
				conjuncts proper.&nbsp; An example there was the word <em>
				eventually</em> which in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He </em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>eventually</em></strong></span><em> 
				arrived at the meeting but was very late</em><br />
				it acts as an adjunct, modifying only the verb but in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>He didn't arrive.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
				<strong>Eventually</strong></span>, we started without him</em><br />
				where it acts as a conjunct modifying the whole of the following 
				clause and linking it to the first sentence.<br />
				So, for example, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>Anyway</strong></span>, did you speak to him?</em><br />
				the adverbial, <em>anyway</em>, is functioning as a conjunct to switch to a 
				related topic and means something like <em>leaving that aside</em>, 
				but in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't afford it and 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>anyway</strong></span> I don't 
				really need it</em><br />
				the word is an adverb meaning something like <em>more 
				importantly</em>.<br />
				The word can also act as a conjunct to mean <em>at least</em> as 
				in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She will be here.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
				<strong>Anyway</strong></span>, that's what she told me.<br />
				</em>and in this case, the word is concessive in function.<br />
				The moral is to be aware of the function of the item, not 
				focused too obsessively on its form.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is as well to bear these points in mind when teaching, or 
			planning to teach, conjuncts.</p>

		</table>
		<p>It is important that the distinction between conjunctions and 
		other conjuncts is made clear.<br />
		Much erroneous language or unnatural expression is caused by the 
		failure to distinguish between conjuncts and conjunctions.</p>
			<p>For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She came to the party <span class="style_black">
			<strong>additionally</strong> </span>with her sister</em><br />
		where the speaker has failed to realise that <em>additionally</em> is a 
		conjunct, not a conjunction.&nbsp; The sentence has to be split to allow 
			for that so either:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She came to the party <span class="style_black">and</span> brought her sister</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She came to the party and, <span class="style_black">
			<strong>additionally</strong></span>, brought her sister</em><br />
			or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came to the party.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
			<strong>Additionally</strong></span>, she brought her sister</em><br />
			are correct forms.</p>
			<h4><em>though</em> and <em>although</em></h4>
			<p>A particular difficulty arises with the words <em>although</em> and 
			<em>though</em> 
			which are both usable as conjunctions so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He bought her a present <span class="style_black">
			although</span> he doesn't have much money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He brought her a present <span class="style_black">though</span> 
			he doesn't have much money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Though</span> it was raining, he 
			took the dog out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Although</span> it was raining, he 
			took the dog out</em><br />
			are all acceptable.</p>
			<p>When the word <em>though</em> acts as a conjunction, it can, in 
			rather formal English, appear in an unusual non-initial position in 
			a clause so we can have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Though</span> it 
			was difficult, the work was done in time</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Difficult <span class="style_black">though</span> 
			it was, the work was done in time</em><br />
			which marks the clause to emphasise the adjective.<br />
			The word <em>although</em> cannot be used this way and, as it is a 
			conjunction, always appears in initial position.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was done in time
			<span class="style_black">although</span> it was difficult<br />
			</em>but:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The work was done in time difficult although it was</em><br />
			is not acceptable.</p>
			<p>The main difficulty arises if the two words are taught as, or assumed to be, 
			synonyms.&nbsp; Conceptually, they are but syntactically they are 
			not.&nbsp; The word <em>though</em> can be a conjunct or a 
		conjunction but <em>although</em> is <span class="style_underline">only</span> 
			a conjunction.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He bought her a present.&nbsp; He doesn't have much 
			money, <span class="style_black"><strong>though</strong></span></em><br />
			is acceptable but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He bought her a present.&nbsp; He doesn't have much 
			money, </em><span class="style_black"><em><strong>although</strong></em></span><br />
			is not and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They were happy with the work.&nbsp; 
		<span class="style_black"><strong>Although</strong></span>, it 
		cost more than they expected.</em><br />
			is not acceptable either.<br />
			We can accept, therefore:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was done on time.&nbsp; It was more expensive 
		than I expected, <span class="style_black"><strong>though</strong></span>. </em>(conjunct)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was done on time <span class="style_black"><strong>though</strong></span> it was more expensive than I 
		expected </em>(conjunction)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was done on time <span class="style_black"><strong>although</strong></span> it was more expensive than 
		I expected</em> (conjunction)<br />
		but not:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The work was done on time.&nbsp; It was more expensive 
		than I expected, <span class="style_black"><strong>although</strong></span>.</em></p>
			<h4><em>so</em></h4>
			<p>A similar difficulty arises with <em>so</em> used as a conjunct 
			(when it expresses a summative concept and means <em>it follows 
			logically that ...</em>) and <em>so</em> used as a 
			conjunction when it expresses a resultative concept.&nbsp; Here's 
			what is meant:<br />
			In:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came early, <span class="style_black">so</span> I can help</em><br />
			the word is a conjunction and expresses:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I came early, I can help</em><br />
			However, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>So</strong></span>, ladies and gentleman, we now come to the 
			last item on the agenda</em><br />
			the word is a conjunct, separated by commas or a slight pause in 
			speech, and expresses:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>In conclusion</strong></span>, ladies and gentlemen, we now 
			come to the last item</em> <em>on the agenda</em><br />
			The problem often arises when the resultative meaning is applied to 
			the conjunct and we get:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *I came early.&nbsp; So, I can help.</em><br />
			The test is to see if <em>so</em> can be replaced by rephrasing the 
			sentence with <em>because</em> or whether it can be replaced with
			<em>To sum up, It follows that </em>or <em>In conclusion</em>.&nbsp; In the former 
			case, it's a conjunction and should be used as such and in the 
			latter cases it is a conjunct and needs separating off with commas or 
			intonation phrasing.<br />
			Sometimes, only punctuation or phrasing can separate the functions.&nbsp; 
			For example, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't need the car.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
			<strong>So</strong></span>, if you want to, you can use it to go to 
			college.</em><br />
			the words so is acting as a conjunct and means something like <em>
			consequently</em>.<br />
			However, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't need the car <span class="style_black"><strong>so</strong></span> 
			if you want to, you can use it to go to college.</em><br />
			the word is acting as a conjunction and the meaning is causal.<br />
			The intonation and phrasing can be illustrated like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="conjunct" height="37" src="../../imagesgraphics/so_conjunct_intonation.png" width="465" /><br />

				<h2>Teaching conjuncts: some ideas</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Conceptually, there is little difficulty here because all 
			languages use some form of conjunct to connect ideas logically.&nbsp; 
			How they do it is different, naturally, and what appears as a 
			conjunct in English may be a simple conjunction in other languages 
			and <em>vice versa</em>.<br />
			The area does deserve, therefore, some care and attention.</p>
			<p>Form is not usually an issue although teachers need to be aware 
			of the four major types covered above so they do not mix them up at 
			the presentation stage.&nbsp; It is probably simplest to begin with 
			the adverbs, move on to prepositional phrases and only later 
			consider the roles of finite and non-finite clauses as these are 
			less frequent and a bit more troublesome.&nbsp; At lower levels, the 
			first two of these categories are the only ones worth considering, 
			arguably.<br />
			The small issues mentioned above concerning word order are also 
			important.</p>
			<p>Concept is another matter.&nbsp; In the analysis above and the 
			PDF document listing common conjuncts, we have considered 13 
			categories of function.&nbsp; Jumbling these up or presenting 
			learners with too many types at once is a sure way to classroom 
			purgatory.<br />
			The trick, when planning, therefore, is to take one or a few 
			connected categories and deal with them discretely.&nbsp; Which 
			categories you select will depend on two main factors:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Level:<br />
				At lower levels, conjuncts need to be left alone until the 
				corresponding conjunctions have been mastered.&nbsp; These will 
				include at least additive, contrastive, temporal and resultative 
				concepts realised with conjunctions such as <em>and, but, 
				although, so, because, then, after, before</em> etc.<br />
				At around B1 / B2 level, the most frequent categories need to be 
				presented.&nbsp; This list will probably include the same 
				categories (additive, resultative, temporal and contrastive) 
				with the addition of enumeration which is achieved mostly 
				through the use of conjuncts, not conjunctions, and focus on 
				commoner realisations such as <em>moreover, furthermore, as a 
				result, therefore, for that reason, initially, meanwhile, in the 
				meantime, nevertheless, however, firstly, finally, at the outset</em> 
				etc.<br />
				At higher levels, especially if learners need to operate in 
				business or academic settings, the more complex and rarer items 
				should be the focus to extend the repertoire and focus on issues 
				of style.</li>
				<li>Learner needs:<br />
				Unless learners need to be able to write formal reports and 
				essays, a passive understanding of many conjuncts such as <em>in 
				view of that, correspondingly, as an illustration, in the 
				interim</em> etc. is adequate.<br />
				Learners operating in academic, technical or business settings 
				may need to master the items productively.</li>
			</ol>

				<h3>Awareness raising</h3>

		</table>
			<p>By the time conjuncts are the focus, learners should be aware of 
			the logical connections realised by conjunctions so a simple 
			beginning is to match ideas.&nbsp; Something like this, suitably 
			amended for focus and level, works well as a starting point:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style52" colspan="3">Which ones have the 
					same connection?&nbsp; Match the sentences on the right to those 
					on the left.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style64"><em>He left because he was bored.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style63" rowspan="4" style="width: 30px">&nbsp;</td>
					<td class="auto-style69"><em>The price was more than we 
					expected.&nbsp; However, the work had to be done.</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style64"><em>Although the weather was appalling, 
					he took the dog for a walk.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style66"><em>She took a few days off to see her 
					mother.&nbsp; In the meantime, I looked after her cats.</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style64"><em>We can go to the cinema or stay in 
					and watch TV.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style66"><em>The film didn't interest her.&nbsp; 
					In view of that, she left after the first half hour.</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style67"><em>He worked on his essay while I was 
					preparing dinner.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style68"><em>If we have the time, we can take 
					the airport bus. &nbsp;Alternatively, there are lots of taxis at 
					the bus station.</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This kind of exercise, suitably adjusted for the various 
			functions described above, is a form of presentation.&nbsp; The next 
			step is controlled production.&nbsp; Here is an idea for that:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style52" colspan="3">Match the sentences on 
					the right to those on the left.&nbsp; What follows 
					logically?</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style64"><em>We can't hang about.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style63" rowspan="4" style="width: 30px">&nbsp;</td>
					<td class="auto-style69"><em>In fact, John had done that.</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style64"><em>He's a bit demanding.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style66"><em>Eventually, a decision must be 
					made.</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style64"><em>They accused us of not paying.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style66"><em>It can be, subsequently, 
					altered.</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style67"><em>This is the plan for now.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style68"><em>Still, it's the job, I guess.</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This exercise can be done in a number of ways for variety with 
			alternative conjunct classes.&nbsp; A classroom mingle to find who 
			has the appropriate partner clause on a slip of paper is lively and 
			productive, for example, and that can be extended to finding two 
			people, one who has the opening clause and another who has the 
			conjunct on slips of paper.</p>
			<p>For written productive work an alternative approach can be used 
			which involves re-writing short texts, removing the conjunctions and 
			replacing them with conjuncts, making adjustments to the punctuation 
			along the way.&nbsp; For example, the following can be adjusted:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The film was pretty dull so we left early and 
			went to a caf&eacute; for a drink before catching the last bus home.&nbsp; 
			John didn't come with us because he was enjoying the film, or so he 
			said.</p>
			<p>like this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The film was pretty dull.&nbsp; Consequently, 
			we left early.&nbsp; At first, we went to a caf&eacute; for a drink.&nbsp; 
			Then, we caught the last bus home.&nbsp; John was enjoying the film; 
			certainly, he said he was and, as a result, he didn't come with 
			us.</p>
			<p>a good deal of useful discussion of matters of style can arise 
			from this sort of exercise.&nbsp; It can be made easier by 
			highlighting the conjunctions to replace and providing a list of 
			possible conjuncts for the  rephrasing exercise.</p>
			<p>Productive work can then be further extended with oral or written 
			work which demands the use of certain types of conjuncts.&nbsp; This 
			is often best done as a hybrid of a free- and structured-response 
			task with learners obliged to use a set of conjuncts but free to 
			write or talk about whatever they want.&nbsp; Here are some 
			examples:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li >Write about / prepare a short presentation on a subject of 
				your choice describing the advantages and disadvantages, the 
				good points and the bad.&nbsp; In your text use 8 of the

				<li >You are going to talk to your partner about your own family 
				but during the conversation, you will need to change the subject 
				three times to insert information about where you live, your 
				education and your hobbies.&nbsp; To do that, you need to use 
				three of the following expressions to introduce the new topic:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style70" valign="top"><em>anyhow<br />
						anyway<br />
						as an aside<br />

					</tr>
				</table>
				Make sure you are getting the intonation right!&nbsp; It rises 
				and then falls on the expression:<br />
