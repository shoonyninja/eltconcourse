		<p>An early definition of an idiom comes from the linguist and teacher 
		Henry Sweet (a major influence in the Reform Movement's reaction to 
		grammar-translation approaches, incidentally).&nbsp; He stated:</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>The meaning of each idiom is an isolated 
		fact which cannot be inferred from the meaning of the words of which the 
		idiom is made up.<br />
		</em></span><span class="auto-style27">(Sweet, 1889:139)</span></p>
		<p>Since Sweet's time, the area has been continually revisited by 
		researchers interested in finding out what constitutes idiomaticity in 
		languages and how the various types of idiom can be classified and 
		analysed.&nbsp; What we have ended up with is a confusing muddle of 
		terms, definitions and classifications which is, to say the least, 
		unhelpful.&nbsp; You may, for example, come across any or all of the 
		following terms if you research this area:</p>

		<p>
		It is not the suggestion here that such refinements are useless or 
		deliberately confusing but we are interested in classifications which 
		will be useful to us as English-language teachers rather than research 
		linguists so this guide will focus on two the central characteristics of 
		idiomatic language: <strong>fixedness</strong> and <strong>opacity</strong> 
		(or non-compositionality, if you prefer).<br />
		This will be at the expense of some precision so if you are looking for 
		more, there are references at the end to on-line, more scholarly 
		articles that you may want to read.<br />
		In some analyses, the definition of an idiom includes both fixedness 
		(the inability to change any of the components) and opacity 
		(non-compositionality) but both these phenomena exist on a scale from 
		fully fixed and opaque through semi-fixed and opaque to variable and 
		easily understood.&nbsp; The definition soon breaks down.</p>

			<p>
			There are three areas in which the distinction between idioms in the 
			true sense and other word combinations is not distinct.<br />
			In some analyses, the definition of idiom is so broad as to 
			encompass most of the language.&nbsp; For the sake of sanity, the 
			following are not considered here as representing true idioms.<br />
			They have their own guides on this site which you will find linked 
			in the list of related guides at the end.</p>

			<p>
			In the list above, we have something called semi-idioms and the 
			examples are <span class="style_black"><em>pay attention</em></span> 
			and <span class="style_black"><em>foot the bill </em></span>in which 
			only one part of the expression is used figuratively.<br />
			There is a range of verbs which act in this way, collocating with 
			nouns in predictable and fixed patterns.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; find fault<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lose confidence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make arrangements<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay a compliment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take notice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; win respect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make an excuse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do justice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lend a hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gain admiration</em><br />
			and, although the verbs will collocate with a range of 
			other nouns, in these meanings there is usually only one possible 
			choice.&nbsp; We cannot, for example have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *say excuses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *do arrangements<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *borrow a hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *discover fault</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			Some of the combinations do allow a certain flexibility so it is 
			possible to have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; win admiration<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gain, achieve </em>or<em> earn respect<br />
			</em>These items are semi-idioms insofar as only one feature of the 
			definition of an idiom applies.&nbsp; The verb in such expressions 
			is often described as delexicalised although in some the verb's 
			usual meaning plays a minor role.<br />
			Because the nouns are usually transparent in meaning, they are not 
			particularly opaque and the meaning can be derived from 
			understanding their components.&nbsp; In that sense they are not 
			true idioms.<br />
			It is also the case that some verbs may be considered only 
			semi-delexicalised in that their meaning does contribute something 
			to the overall meaning of the clause in which they appear.&nbsp; For 
			example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay a compliment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take an interest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set an example<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; catch a name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throw a tantrum<br />
			</em>there is some sense of the verb's usual meaning in the clause 
			but it is still very hard to predict which verb will form an 
			acceptable collocation so the expressions may be considered 
			idiomatic in that respect.<br />
			They are, however, more or less fixed as we saw and in that respect 
			they <strong>are</strong> idioms.</p>
			<p>
			It is also the case that delexicalised verbs can function almost 
			wholly idiomatically.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the bucket to the tap</em><br />
			contains a use of <em>take</em> which is wholly transparent and 
			non-idiomatic.&nbsp; However:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a hammer to it</em><br />
			is an idiomatic use of <em>take</em> which is non-transparent 
			because it means something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hit it with a hammer</em><br />
			And in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They made him the manager</em><br />
			we have a non-idiomatic use of <em>make</em> but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he's lived here since the war, that makes 
			him over 90</em><br />
			is an idiomatic use of <em>make </em>which is akin to:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he's lived here since the war he must be 
			over 90</em></p>
			<p>
			For a list of semi- and fully delexicalised verbs, click
			<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_empty_verbs.pdf" target="_blank">
			here</a>.<br />
			There is also a lesson for B1 / B2-level learners on delexicalised 
			verbs
			<a href="../../../learners/lessons/b1b2lessons/b1b2vocabulary/b1b2empty_verbs.html" target="_blank">
			here</a> (new tab).</p>
			<p>
			We also encountered what some people call frozen collocations which 
			are so strong that they act as single words, always appearing in 
			combination.&nbsp; The example was <em>a can of worms</em> but many 
			partitives are restricted in their collocations and we also find, 
			e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a rasher of bacon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pane of glass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a gust of wind</em><br />
			and so on which can only occur in the context of the commodity or 
			substance they describe.&nbsp; For more, see the guide to 
			classifiers and partitives, linked below.<br />
			Other very strong collocations which are produced and understood as 
			single concepts and not constructed from their component parts 
			include, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vested interests<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rock solid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; special pleading<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heart rending</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Whether such expressions are considered idioms (because they are 
			clearly idiomatic) or just very strong collocations is a matter of 
			taste and authorities differ.<br />
			When the collocation is noun + noun, some will shade into compound 
			nouns so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; light bulb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tree surgeon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; garden rake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; baby sitter</em><br />
			are all analysable as compound nouns and may even be written as one 
			word.<br />
			In that sense they are not idioms because it is a simple matter, 
			usually, to add meaning one to meaning two and arrive at the meaning 
			of the whole expression.</p>
			<p>
			The upshot of all this is that there is probably no way in principle 
			that one can draw a line between a reasonably strong collocation and 
			an idiom although it an easier task to identify one or the other.</p>

			</table>
			<p>
			We owe the term lexical chunk to Lewis (1993) and his investigation 
			of a lexical approach to teaching.&nbsp; He suggests that there is a 
			range of more or less fixed chunks in the language including:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>polywords, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inside out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back to front<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in that case<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if only</em></li>
				<li>institutionalised utterances, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry to have kept you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take my word for it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's that</em></li>
				<li>sentence frames, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's not as ... as you think<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what follows ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upshot was ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And quite predictably ...</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			Lewis also focuses on the fact that some verbs, as we saw above, 
			take their meaning from the noun with which they form a strong 
			collocation.&nbsp; This is what he calls delexicalisation and it 
			mostly affects:<br />
			<span class="style_black">do | have | get | go | make | put | set | 
			take</span><br />
			although we can add other marginal cases such as <em>earn, pay, run</em> 
			and <em>save</em>.<br />
			All such multiple-word units (or MWUs in the trade) certainly 
			exhibit some fixedness and are probably produced and understood as 
			single items but they are not opaque in meaning.&nbsp; They are 
			idioms in the first sense but not in the second.<br />
			You may, incidentally, also find such chunks described as 
			holophrases, prefabricated routines or formulas.</p>

					<h3><a name="pvs"></a>Phrasal verbs</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			One definition of a phrasal verb is that the adverb particle 
			combines with the verb to produce a meaning which cannot be 
			retrieved from understanding the sense of the adverb and the sense 
			of the verb: a third meaning needs to be discovered.<br />
			Clearly, for example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; sit back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sit down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sit up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sit in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sit out</em><br />
			are all verbs post-modified by an adverb but the meaning is 
			extractable by understanding both parts so they are not phrasal 
			verbs or idioms.&nbsp; Changing the adverb has no effect on the 
			meaning of the verb at all.<br />
			However,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sit by</em> (fail to take action)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sit on </em>(suppress)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sit around</em> (be idle)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sit up</em> (take notice)<br />
			are not easily understood by understanding their elements so count 
			as idiomatic because they are both fixed (in the senses used) and 
			opaque.&nbsp; In this case, changing the particle will affect the 
			meaning of the verb because it is the combination which supplies the 
			third meaning.<br />
			Again, of course, there are degrees of opacity, but not of 
			fixedness, because it is possible to understand the meaning of many 
			by a small leap of imagination from the usual meaning of the 
			prepositional use of the particles.&nbsp; For example, once one has 
			grasped that one of the meanings of<em> out</em> is<em> clear</em> 
			or <em>loud</em> then combinations such as<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speak out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shout out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make out<br />
			</em>and more are quite easily understood as are:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; get on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walk on</em><br />
			once we understand that one of the meanings of <em>on</em> is <em>
			make progress.</em><br />
			Opacity is consequently low.<br />
			Phrasal verbs have their own section on this site (as part of the 
			consideration of multi-word verbs in general) so will not feature in 
			this guide to idiomaticity.&nbsp; See the link at the end for more.</p>

			Although this distinction is not necessary for teaching purposes, it 
			is sometimes helpful in terms of memorisation to know the origin of 
			the idiom one encounters.&nbsp; There are two possible sources

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Fixed metaphor<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="shakespeare" height="133" src="../../images/shakespeare200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Frequently, very influential texts in English, such as the 
				bible, Shakespeare's works and others, contain metaphors which 
				have come into everyday use and become fixed idioms.&nbsp; Some 
				metaphorical uses are obscure in origin.&nbsp; Examples include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heart of gold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laughing stock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wild goose chase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wear your heart on your sleeve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a foregone conclusion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be cruel to be kind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; salad days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cold comfort<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a tower of strength</em><br />(all from Shakespeare)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the eleventh hour<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the skin of your teeth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a millstone around your neck<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the writing on the wall</em><br />(all biblical)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it gives me the creeps<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go on the rampage</em><br />(both from Charles Dickens)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spill the beans<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; straight from the horse's mouth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let the cat out of the bag<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; count your chickens before they are hatched<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out to lunch<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just my cup of tea</em><br />(all obscure in origin but some may conveniently but 
				speculatively be derived from some occupations)</li>
				<li><strong>Historical and specific register origins</strong><br />
				<img alt="castle" height="133" src="../../images/history_castle200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Other idioms derive from certain registers: sport, the military, 
				trade, sailing and so on and are often opaque without a certain 
				amount of knowledge of the history of the domains.&nbsp; They 
				are usually not <strong>completely</strong> opaque, however.<br />
				Examples include:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a sticky wicket</em> (from cricket)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>cover all the bases</em> (baseball)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>run with the ball </em>(rugby or American football)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>game, set and match </em>(tennis)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a level playing field</em> (many sports)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>plant a seed</em> (horticulture)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>plough through</em> (farming)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>cut a deal </em>(obscure but possibly from card games)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>hit a snag</em> (angling or river navigation)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a loose cannon</em> (from naval warfare)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>flash in the pan</em> (musketry)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>close ranks</em> (army parade term)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>half-baked </em>(cookery)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;cut and dried</em> (herbalism)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sail close to the wind</em> (sailing)<br />

		<p>On the left-hand end of the cline, we can arrange those idioms which 
		are clearly fixed in which we cannot add words, replace words or delete 
		words without changing the meaning entirely.&nbsp; These include:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt class="style_brown"><strong>hammer and sickle, aid and abet, 
				life or death</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are fixed-order binomials, sometimes called frozen 
				binomials.&nbsp; You can't reverse the order without sounding 
				odd and neither part can be replaced to maintain the meaning.&nbsp; 
				Nor can you insert anything between the parts.&nbsp; When they 
				are nouns, such binomials are treated as singular in English (<em>the <span class="style_black">hammer and sickle</span> 
				is, <span class="style_black">thunder and lightning</span> was</em> 
				etc.).<br />
				They belong on the far left.</dd>
				<dt class="style_brown"><strong>left, right and centre</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is similar but is actually called a trinomial (for a 
				pretty obvious reason).&nbsp; Other examples are:
				<span class="style_black"><em>blood, sweat and tears; cool, 
				calm, and collected; win, place, or show; tall, dark and 
				handsome </em></span>and so on.<br />
				True trinomials like these belong on the left of the cline.</dd>
				<dt class="style_brown"><strong>call it a day, cut corners, put 
				all your eggs in one basket, wouldn't be caught dead, miss the 
				boat, make the grade, raining cats and dogs, through thick and 
				thin</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are all fixed idioms.&nbsp; The last of these (<span class="style_black"><em>through 
				thick and thin</em></span>) is often classed as a fixed 
				binomial.&nbsp; We can't vary the order of words, insert words, 
				replace words or delete words in these expressions.&nbsp; We 
				can't have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>put all your eggs in one tray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miss the train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				rain cats and monkeys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call it a busy day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cut sharp corners<br />
				</em>if we want to retain the meaning.<br />
				Note, however, that even with fixed idioms, we can alter the 
				tense and must make the pronouns agree (<em>they <span class="style_black">called / 
				are calling it a day</span>, he <span class="style_black">missed 
				/ will miss the boat</span>, she<span class="style_black">'ll
				</span>never <span class="style_black">make the grade</span></em> 
				etc.)&nbsp; Other structural changes are possible but very rare such 
				as <em>cut a corner</em> but most are forbidden such as <em>*put 
				all your eggs in baskets </em>or<em> *make the grades.<br />
				</em>They belong close to the far left of the cline.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>On the right we have the most flexible expressions and there are 
			only two of these:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt class="style_brown"><strong>torrential rain, make the beds</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are strong collocations because there is a limited 
				number of possible substitutions with verb + <em>the beds</em> 
				or <em>torrential</em> + noun.&nbsp; We can, just possibly, have
				<em>do the beds </em>and<em> make up the beds</em> and have <em>
				torrential waterfalls</em> or <em>torrential rivers</em> but 
				it's hard to find more replacements.&nbsp; The other way round, 
				however, produces a wider range of possibilities.&nbsp; The verb 
				<em>make</em> collocates with an enormous number of nouns (<em>mistakes, 
				haste, mess</em> etc.) and the number of possible adjectives for 
				<em>rain</em> is also large (<em>heavy, light, drizzly, hard, thin</em> 
				etc.).&nbsp; However, some strong collocations are so 
				predictable as to constitute real idioms.&nbsp; For example,<br />
				We <em>pay attention, a compliment </em>and <em>our respects</em> 
				but <em>take an interest</em>, <em>offence, place</em> etc. and
				<em>give explanations, thanks</em> and <em>promises</em> etc.<br />
				It is quite arguable that collocations of this sort do not fully qualify 
				at all as idioms and won't be considered further here.&nbsp; 
				There is a separate
				guide to 
				collocation on this site, linked below.</dd>
			</dl>
		
		<p>The rest of the expressions fall somewhere in the middle of the 
		cline:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt class="style_brown"><strong>have a blast, hit the sack, off 
			one's rocker, back to the drawing board</strong></dt>
			<dd>These all have alternates with the same or a very similar 
			meaning so they are semi-fixed idioms.&nbsp; We can have:<em><span class="style_black"><br />
			</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">have a 
			hoot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have a whale of a time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit the hay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off one's trolley</span></em><em><span class="style_black"><br />
			</span>  
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">back to square one<br />
			</span></em>which all carry the same sorts of meaning, although they are 
			sometimes stylistically different.&nbsp; Expressions such as these 
			only have a very limited number of alternatives and they belong on 
			the mid-left of the cline.&nbsp; They share other characteristics with 
			true fixed expressions in not allowing deletions or insertions but a 
			severely limited range of alternate words is possible.</dd>
			<dt class="style_brown"><strong>assets and liabilities</strong></dt>
			<dd>This is rather an unusual case because it is a binomial but the 
			ordering is not fixed (although this is the preferred one).&nbsp; 
			Other examples of binomials which do not have fully fixed ordering 
			include:<em><span class="style_black"><br />
			</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">salt and pepper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see and hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			friends and family<br />
			</span></em>etc.<br />
			There is usually a preferred order with all binomials but the 
			reasons for it are complex.&nbsp; See Benor and Levy (no date) for a 
			technical discussion.</dd>
		</dl></div>
		<p>There is an interesting exception to fixedness.<br />
		Some idioms and even binomials which are normally considered wholly 
		fixed can be modified with intensifiers.&nbsp; It is possible, 
		therefore, to have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been rushing </em><span class="style_black"><em>hither and </em></span>
		<em>bloody </em><span class="style_black"><em>yon</em></span><em> all 
		day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I </em><span class="style_black"><em>smell a</em></span><em>n 
		extremely large </em><span class="style_black"><em>rat</em></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've </em><span class="style_black"><em>missed the </em></span>
		<em>damn/an important </em><span class="style_black"><em>boat<br />
		</em>
		</span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_black"><em>have a</em></span><em> 
		total/absolute/complete </em><span class="style_black"><em>blast<br />
		</em></span>etc.&nbsp; In particular, the so-called taboo words, <em>bloody, 
		bleeding, damn</em> etc., are used in this way.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Idioms may be flexible to a certain extent, then, but the 
			flexibility is also analysable by type.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Conjugation<br />
				Idioms which contain verbs are frequently conjugated to conform 
				to the normal rules so, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pass the buck</em><br />
				may be<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passes, passed, is passing the buck<br />
				</em>and so on and the 
				verb can be nominalised as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I resent your passing the buck<br />
				</em>Pronouns will change in the normal way and may be 
				accompanied by other changes, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bit off more than she could chew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has bitten off more than anyone could chew</em></li>
				<li>Passivisation<br />
				Such idioms can also be made passive so we can allow<br />
				&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; They have
				cooked the books</em><br />
				and<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The books have been cooked</em></li>
				<li>Insertion of words (usually adjectives or adverbs)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">right</span> at the eleventh hour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; teaching new tricks to a <span class="style_underline">very</span> old dog<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the <span class="style_underline">absolute</span> skin of my teeth</em></li>
				<li>Re-formulation<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need a level playing field &rarr; We

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has a heart of gold → Her heart is of pure gold</em></li>

			</table>
			<p>Some idioms are constrained structurally.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Some can only be used in the negative so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't sleep a wink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't make head (n)or tail of it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wouldn't be caught dead with him</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I slept a wink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made head or tail of it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would be caught dead with him</em></li>
				<li>Some can only appear in the passive or active voice so we 
				allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's fed up with the work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am snowed under with emails<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't beat about the bush<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's call it a day</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The work fed him up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The emails snowed me under<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The bush was beaten about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It was called a day</em><br />
				However, reformulation is often allowed so we see and hear:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He missed the boat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boat was missed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave him the benefit of the doubt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was given the benefit of the doubt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefit of the doubt was given to him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was let off the hook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They let her off the hook</em><br />
				and so on.</li>

		<p>Very few of these idioms are going to be on the 
		far left of the cline.&nbsp; If they were, they would hardly qualify as 
		idioms at all.<br />
		So, we have the first group of idioms whose meaning can be worked out 
		quite easily from their literal interpretation or whose meaning
		<span class="style_underline">is</span> literal, in fact.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt class="style_brown"><strong>heads or tails, a dime a dozen, 
			research and development, at a snail's pace</strong></dt>
			<dd>These are the most literal.&nbsp; It is easy to work out what 
			they mean from understanding their constituents.&nbsp; Many bi- and 
			tri-nomials fall into this category:<em><span class="style_black"><br />
			</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">knife and fork<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; law and order<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; salt and pepper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sick and tired<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; red, 
			white and blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll<br />
			</span></em>etc.&nbsp; 
			Many do not have transparent meanings, however, such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm all <span class="style_black">fingers and 
			thumbs</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's <span class="style_black">neither fish nor fowl</span></em><br />
			Most idioms do not fall into this 
			category.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>The figurative section is the most crowded and it's a matter of 
		opinion whether an expression falls to the left or right of the centre 
		of the cline.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt class="style_brown"><strong>barking up the wrong tree, a bitter 
			pill to swallow, kiss and tell, holding all the aces, bite off more 
			than one can chew, hot and bothered, come rain or shine</strong></dt>
			<dd>In many of these sorts of expressions, only one of the items is 
			used figuratively so it's possible to work out what's meant.&nbsp; 
			In others, it is a short step from the literal to the figurative 
			meaning.&nbsp; For example, imagining a picture of a dog barking up 
			the wrong tree immediately allows you to make the jump to the 
			figurative meaning of <span class="style_black"><em>barking up the 
			wrong tree</em></span>.<br />
			Equally, if you know something about 
			many card games, you'll know that <span class="style_black"><em>
			holding all the aces</em></span> is likely to lead to a win.&nbsp; 
			Even <span class="style_black"><em>kiss and tell </em></span>needs 
			little context for you to understand its meaning.<br />
			With binomials and some other idioms, it's possible to assume that 
			the terms are synonyms or antonyms of sorts and understanding one allows you to 
			understand the whole.&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>hot and 
			bothered</em></span> and <span class="style_black"><em>come rain or 
			shine</em></span> fall into this category.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>Finally, there are the wholly opaque idioms:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				<span class="style_brown"><strong>by the skin of one's teeth,
				spick and span, cut the mustard, bob and weave, under the 
			weather, Tom, Dick and Harry</strong></span></dt>
			<dd>All these are opaque and you'd have to be very lucky to guess 
			their meaning even with context to help.&nbsp; Many idioms are like 
			these and they have to be learned as single units of meaning.<br />
			There are also a number of common binomials in which one or both 
			items is only seen in that context.&nbsp; The example here is
			<span class="style_black"><em>spick and span</em></span> but others 
			include:<em><span class="style_black"><br />
			</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">to and fro<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; harum-scarum<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			helter-skelter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hem and haw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nip and tuck<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deeply regret<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wholly unacceptable</em><br />
			and thousands more by understanding the words in them, even when, as 
			in the fourth case, the verb carries little real meaning.</p>
			<p>There are, however, some collocations which may be literal in 
			meaning in one sense and used figuratively in another.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a fine-tooth comb<br />
			</em>may be reference to a particular type of comb which has small 
			gaps between the teeth.&nbsp; However, when we say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They went through the accounts with a 
			fine-tooth comb<br />
			</em>we are referring to very careful examination and not to a comb 
			at all.&nbsp; Equally,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a slippery slope<br />
			</em>may simply refer to an ice-like surface on an incline but in 
			something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's on a slippery slope to being dismissed<br />
			</em>we are referring to the fact that small actions or omissions 
			can result in large, negative consequences.<br />
			Furthermore, some idiomatic expressions which look like simple 
			collocations are, in fact, only used figuratively so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a big noise in the army<br />
			</em>refers to someone who is important and influential but the 
			words <em>big</em> and <em>noise</em> do not elsewhere form a 
			natural collocation (the preferred adjectives being, <em>loud, huge, 
			deafening</em> etc.).</p>
			<p>Macis and Schmitt (2017) estimate that a quarter of strong 
			collocations have figurative (i.e., idiomatic) meanings and are, 
			therefore, more sensibly dealt with in the classroom as idioms which 
			should be learned and produced as single lexical chunks.<br />
			Looking out for collocations which are, in fact, being used 
			figuratively and idiomatically may pay dividends in terms of 
			teaching and remembering lexis.</p>

			<p> We can use the concepts of opacity and fixedness to try our hand 
			at classifying the range of idioms in English.&nbsp; Such a 
			classification ignores form for the most part and that we shall deal 
			with shortly but it does give us a way of making sense of large 
			amounts of data.&nbsp; It also, unfortunately, means that categories 
			have blurred edges but that is what always happens when we try to 
			draw lines on a continuum.&nbsp; This will also give us the 
			opportunity to add a few more examples of the kinds of idioms we 
			have discussed so far.<br />
			For teaching purposes, the following categories have some utility 
			because it allows us to focus our learners on idiomatic language 
			which shares definable characteristics rather than just showering 
			them with random examples of idioms.&nbsp; Later, we will suggest 
			other ways that idioms can be classified for teaching purposes which 
			rely more heavily on meaning and conceptual hooks for their effect.<br />
			It is also possible to add to the categories we will use here by 
			inventing new intermediate ones to extend the possibilities but blurred edges 
			will always be with us.<br />
			Whether you choose to use fixedness or opacity as the measuring 
			stick for these categories is entirely up to you.&nbsp; Either 
			approach will make sense in the classroom.&nbsp; The first 
			categories in the first two sections of what follows are the same.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Fixedness does not always refer to an absolute quality because 
			function words (particularly determiners) and tense forms may be 
			altered to suit the context.&nbsp; So, for example, we can have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>keep an / your / my / his eye on</em><br />
			in which the lexical items (<em>keep, eye</em>) cannot be altered 
			and even the preposition is fixed.&nbsp; The determiner can vary 
			however and so can the tense.&nbsp; It is, therefore, rare for any of the 
				lexical constituents to be changed (and even number and mood are 
			frequently fixed).&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bells and whistles</em><br />
			is always plural<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; storm in a teacup</em><br />
			is always singular and the determiner is also fixed.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make head or tail of</em><br />
			is always negative.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Fixed and opaque</strong><br />
				These idioms usually constitute single lexemes and are learnable 
				as language chunks.<br />
				These types are also characterised by having a high level of 
				non-compositionality.&nbsp; Even with context and co-text, it is 
				often impossible to work out the meaning despite knowing all the 
				words which make up the expression.<br />
				Examples are:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a can of worms</em> (a complex and difficult situation or 
				set of things)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the black sheep of the family</em> (a family member who 
				is considered to deviate from the norm)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>up the garden path</em> (a misleading direction)</li>
				<li><strong>Fixed and semi-opaque</strong><br />
				While maintaining a high level of fixedness, these idioms may be 
				accessible to comprehension providing one is alert to 
				metaphorical and figurative uses of lexemes.&nbsp; Context and 
				co-text will often help.<br />
				Examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as different as chalk and cheese </em>
				(completely different)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither here nor there</em> (irrelevant)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>making a mountain out of a molehill </em>(exaggerating an 
				issue)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>bend over backwards</em> (go to great lengths to be 
				helpful)</li>
				<li><strong>Fixed and transparent</strong><br />
				Here we verge on strong collocation rather than idiomaticity <em>
				per se</em>.&nbsp; These expressions are fixed but if you know the 
				meaning of the elements within them, the meaning can be easily 
				surmised so they are virtually transparent.<br />
				Examples are:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>set in stone </em>(a fixed rule)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>love at first sight</em> (instant adoration)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a bull in a china shop</em> (being careless of the damage one's 
				actions may cause)</li>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Opaque and fixed</strong><br />
				This is essentially the same category as 1. above because we are 
				identifying the extreme ends of the clines.&nbsp; As above, 
				these expressions usually operate as single lexemes and can be 
				learned and used as prefabricated chunks.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feeling under the weather </em>(ill)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the back of beyond</em> (remote and 
				isolated)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pass the buck</em> (transfer 
				responsibility or guilt to another)</li>
				<li><strong>Opaque and semi-fixed</strong><br />
				These are opaque but some variation is possible.&nbsp; They are, 
				however, not accessible for meaning without a great deal of 
				guesswork and use of co-text and context.&nbsp; Even then, 
				comprehension is not assured.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>throw in the towel / sponge </em>(resign or surrender)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>take the mickey / piss / a rise</em> (ridicule)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>have a bash / go / stab / shot</em> (try)</li>
				<li><strong>Opaque and variable</strong><br />
				Here again, we wander into the realm of simple collocation or 
				delexicalisation.&nbsp; The opacity stems from the fact that the 
				verb is empty of any obvious meaning so it can only be processed 
				by understanding the noun and even then may remain opaque.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; make a promise / a friend / a difference<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay a visit / a complement / one's respects<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; catch a cold / sight of / fire / a train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lose heart / confidence / the plot / the thread</em></li>

			</table>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Verbs</strong><br />
				This differs from delexicalised use of verbs insofar as the verb 
				retains its meaning but it has been extended to the point at 
				which the meaning is no longer transparent although some 
				imagination may help to unpack the significance.<br />
				Examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spend time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; close a deal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pencil someone in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crash a party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fall asleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bear a hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drop a hint</em></li>
				<li><strong>Nouns</strong><br />
				These are often nouns being used outside the field in which they 
				normally operate.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a team player<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a point of view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a short head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a hair's breadth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bird's eye view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a rat's nest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the end of one's tether</em></li>
				<li><strong>Adjectives and adverbs</strong><br />
				Colour adjectives are frequently used figuratively and cultural 
				influences come into play.&nbsp; Other adjectives and adverbs 
				referring to perceptions are also often used figuratively.&nbsp; 
				Most are sometimes considered very strong collocations but, 
				because of the metaphorical use, we prefer to classify them as 
				idioms.&nbsp; They are not duplex forms because there is no 
				literal sense.<br />
				example are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a black look<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a white lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warm welcome<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a hot reception<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hotly contested<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coolly received<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bitterly contested<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flatly refuse</em></li>

		<p>There is a tendency for these two characteristics to rise and fall 
		together.&nbsp; In other words, the more fixed and inflexible the 
		expression, the more likely it is to be opaque in meaning and <em>vice 
		versa</em>.</p>
		<p>We can find low fixedness with some expressions but they are likely 
		to be quite literal in meaning.&nbsp; For example,
		<span class="style_black"><em>as old as ... </em></span>can be followed 
		by a number of expressions (<em>God, the hills, Noah</em> etc.) but 
		opacity is also low.<br />
		Similarly, strong collocations such as
		<em>a pronounced accent</em> are not firmly fixed (we can have <em>
		strong, broad </em>etc. as the adjective with roughly the same meaning) 
		but they are usually easy to understand (if not to learn).&nbsp; Such 
		expressions have low fixedness and also low opacity.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, an expression such as <span class="style_black">
		<em>off one's rocker</em></span> has quite high fixedness (there's only 
		one conventional alternative to <em>rocker</em>, <span class="style_black"><em>trolley</em></span>) and it is also quite high in opacity.&nbsp; 
		Extreme cases of fixedness are also, often, extreme cases of opacity.&nbsp; 
		Expressions such as <span class="style_black"><em>let the cat out of the 
		bag</em></span> are both opaque and fixed as are binomials such as
		<span class="style_black"><em>helter-skelter</em></span>.</p>
		<p>There are, nevertheless, instances, especially with binomials, of low 
		opacity and high fixedness.&nbsp; In other words, they always occur 
		together and in the same order but are straightforward to understand.&nbsp; 
		Examples are:<em><span class="style_black"><br />
		</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">here and there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand in hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		dead and buried<br />
		</span></em>etc.</p>
		<p>The moral?<br />
		Whenever we find a highly opaque expression, the way to bet is that it 
		is also firmly fixed.&nbsp; The reverse is not always true: firmly fixed 
		expressions are not always opaque..<br />
		Here's a graphical representation of that.&nbsp; Before teaching idioms, 
		it is worth 5 minutes of the planning time to consider where in the 
		matrix the target language items fall.<br />

			<p>Idioms are usually understood to be phrases or clauses which 
			cannot be immediately understood by retrieving the meaning of the 
			words in them.&nbsp; However, many words, especially verbs, are or

			(obviously) fixed with synonyms rarely having the same effect and 
			they are often quite opaque in meaning.<br />
			Some examples are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The show bombed<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a pig<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My printer died</em><br />
			etc.<br />

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The show shelled<br />

		<p>Because these are so common in English, they merit a short section to 
		themselves.&nbsp; Many of these items are worth teaching as single 
		lexemes because they are handy language chunks, they are extremely 
		common and they are not easily paraphrased.<br />
		There are some general characteristics of binomial expressions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Form:</strong><br />
				They consist of two lexical items belonging to the same word 
				class so they are, noun + noun, verb + verb, adjective + 
				adjective, adverb + adverb.&nbsp; Examples of the four main 
				sorts are:<br />
				<strong>Noun + Noun:</strong><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has lived here
				<span class="style_black">man and boy</span><br />
				</em><strong>Verb + Verb</strong><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can <span class="style_black">take it or leave it</span><br />
				</em><strong>Adjective + Adjective</strong><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's the truth, <span class="style_black">pure and 
				simple</span><br />
				</em><strong>Adverb + Adverb</strong><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will do it </em><span class="style_black"><em>sooner or 
				later</em></span><br />
				(Rarely, the two items are not of the same word class but follow 
				similar structural forms so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were <span class="style_black">home 
				and dry</span></em><br />
				in which <span class="style_black"><em>home</em></span> is an 
				adverb and <span class="style_black"><em>dry</em></span> an 
				adjective but both are joined to the subject by the copular 
				verb.&nbsp; That is probably not something with which to trouble 
				your learners.)</li>
				<li><strong>Meaning:</strong><br />
				Some are literal (<span class="style_black"><em>apples 
		and oranges</em></span> etc.), some are figurative (<span class="style_black"><em>the 
		chicken or the egg</em></span> etc.) and some are wholly opaque (<span class="style_black"><em>milk 
		and honey, fiddle-faddle</em></span> etc.).</li>
				<li><strong>Rarity:</strong><br />
				Some, such as <em><span class="style_black">helter-skelter</span>, 
				<span class="style_black">super-duper, to and from, hither and 
				yon</span></em> etc.<em>, </em>contain words found 
				nowhere else or retained from archaic forms.</li>
				<li><strong>Concord:</strong><br />
				When two nouns are joined, the resulting expression is 
				often singular, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Fire and 
				brimstone</span> is all he shouts about</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Thunder and lightning</span> is 
				on its way</em><br />
				but, if the nouns are already plural, that is not the case:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His <span class="style_black">eyes and 
				ears </span>are everywhere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span class="style_black">stars and stripes </span>are 
				flying over The White House</em></li>
				<li><strong>Ordering:</strong><br />
				The order of the items is usually fixed although with some, 
				reversal has no effect.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She worked <span class="style_black">day 
				and night</span></em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She worked <span class="style_black">
				night and day</span></em><br />
				We allow<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll do it <span class="style_black">
				sooner or later</span></em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'll do it later or sooner</em></li>
				<li><strong>Inflections:</strong><br />
				The tenses, verbs forms, adjective inflexions and numbers of items are normally retained in 
				both constituents so we get, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's <span class="style_black">done and dusted</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's <span class="style_black">bigger and better</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It comes with many <span class="style_black">bells and 
				whistles</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll <span class="style_black">name and shame</span> him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be some <span class="style_black">naming and 
				shaming</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were <span class="style_black">named and shamed</span><br />
				</em>etc. and:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *for all intent and purpose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It's time to cut and be running</em><br />
				are not encountered.</li>
				<li><strong>Coordination:</strong><br />
				The items are frequently joined with the coordinator <em>and</em> 
				but there are other possibilities including: <em>but, or, either 
				... or, neither ... nor, to, after, by, in</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Prosody:</strong><br />
				Often the items rhyme or are, more often, alliterative as 
				in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">make or break<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high and dry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; house and home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do or die</span></em><br />
				etc.<br />
				In some, a phenomenon called <strong>assonance</strong> is discernible so for 
				example, a stressed vowel will be the same in both items or a 
				consonant duplicated with different vowels as in<em><span class="style_black"><br />
				</span> </em><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; harum scarum</em></span><br />
				or<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tittle-tattle</em></span>.</li>
				<li><strong>Collocation:</strong><br />
				Because binomials operate as single lexemes, they are 
				subject to the same collocational forces as all other lexemes so, for 
				example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_black">high and dry</span> </em>collocates strongly with the verb <em>
				leave</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>high and low</em></span> 
				collocates with verbs such as<em> look (for), search, hunt </em>
				and <em>seek</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_black">dead and buried</span> </em>
				collocates with nouns such as <em>ideas, proposals, suggestions, 
				schemes </em>and <em>plans</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li><strong>Effect:</strong><br />
				Binomials often intensify, especially reduplicative ones, 
				so, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went from <span class="style_black">
				strength to strength</span></em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They asked <span class="style_black">again and again</span></em><br />
				Ones in which the two items are synonyms have the same effect:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's at my <span class="style_black">beck 
				and call</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth is <span class="style_black">pure and simple</span><br />
				</em>and, perversely, antonym pairs also intensify:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We searched <span class="style_black">
				high and low</span>, <span class="style_black">in and out</span>, 
				in <span class="style_black">each and every</span> part of the 
				house<br />
				</em>The intensification is either echoic (repeating the word) 
				as in the first two examples or a function of synonymy or antonymy as 
				in the other examples.</li>

		search.</p>

			&dagger; there is disagreement about the spelling of this item so we 
			may see, <em>higgelty-piggelty, higgeldy-piggleldy</em> as well.<br />
			Hyphenation (see below) is also variable and idiosyncratic with some items so we 
			also see <em>flimflam, shilly-shally, mishmash, chitchat, 
			knick-knacks, dingdong</em> etc.<p>
			<span class="style_brown"><strong>ordering the items<br />
			</strong></span><a name="ablautredup"></a>There are, interestingly 
			for some, rules for which item is placed first when the 
			vowel sounds differ and they have to do with what is called <strong>ablaut 
			reduplication</strong>.&nbsp; Ablaut describes the alternation in vowels that 
			we see in, e.g., <em>sing, sang, sung</em> or <em>ring, rang, rung</em> 
			and so on.<br />
			Although there are very rare exceptions, the rule is that the first 
			item contains a higher vowel than the second.&nbsp; That is to say, 
			the tongue is higher in the mouth when the vowel in the first item 
			is produced than in the second.<br />
			High vowels in English include: /ɪ/ as in <em>kid, </em>/iː/ as in
			<em>heel, </em>/ʊ/ as in <em>foot </em>and /uː/ as in <em>
			shoe</em>.<br />
			Low vowels include /æ/ as in <em>hat, </em>/ɒ/ as in <em>wash, </em>
			/ʌ/ as in <em>cup</em>, /ɔː/ as in <em>taught</em> and /ɑː/ as in
			<em>car</em>.<br />
			So it is that we get <em>shilly-shally</em>, not <em>shally-shilly</em>,
			<em>ping pong</em>, not <em>pong ping</em>,<em> chit-chat</em> not
			<em>chat-chit</em>, <em>ding-dong</em> not <em>dong ding</em>, <em>
			flim-flam</em> and <em>flip-flop</em> not <em>flam-flim</em> and <em>
			flop-flip</em> and so on.<br />
			It also explains why most speakers will say <em>this and that</em> 
			not <em>that and this,</em> <em>knife and fork</em>, not <em>fork 
			and knife</em> and so on.<br />
			This phenomenon is rarer for trinomials in the list below but is 
			evident in, e.g., <em>cool, calm and collected, eat, drink and be 
			merry </em>and<em> this, that and the other</em>.<br />
			This appears to be non-language specific, incidentally.</p>
			Some quite common words in English are derived by reducing rhyming 
			or similar-sounding binomials so, e.g.<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patter</em> is a reduction of <em>pat-pat</em> (to hit 
			gently).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>blabber</em> is a reduction of <em>blab-blab</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>paddle</em> is a reduction of <em>pad-pad</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			The technical term for this phenomenon is that the word is a <strong>
			frequentative</strong>.<br />

			<p>Most idiomatic language is stylistically informal and 
			inappropriate in a number of situations.&nbsp; Idioms are used 
			extensively in informal speech and writing (especially in 
			newspapers), however, so a knowledge of common ones is very helpful 
			for learners of English.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are, by some 
			estimates, 25,000 of them in English.<br />
			In more formal contexts, idioms will often be avoided so we are 
			unlikely to find, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen is under the weather<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The government negotiators are reluctant to open a can of worms, 
			said the White House spokesman.<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Learners of the language can be tempted to overuse idiomatic 
			language in situations where it is not appropriate or they can get 
			the meaning just slightly wrong and produce, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'll do it willy-nilly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'm down in the dumps with her<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*The government isn't cutting the mustard for it</em><br />
			In common with many idiomatic expressions, bi- and trinomials are 
			often informal and common in spoken language.<br />
			A few, however, such as <em>first and foremost, more and more, 
			intents and purposes </em>and others are encountered in formal 
			writing and some are confined to specific registers such as 
			economics (<em>supply and demand</em>), the law (<em>aid and abet</em>), 
			education (<em>reading, writing and arithmetic</em>) or engineering, 
			politics and commerce (<em>research and development, wear and tear, trial and error, ways and 
			means</em>).<br />
			They are, to some extent, clichés and accordingly much used in 
			journalese.</p>
			<p>The same considerations of grammar and form apply here as they do in 
			the teaching of any lexis.<br />
			It is important to make sure, then, that idiom presentation is set 
			in an appropriate context (both style and register) and that word class is considered along 
			with aspects of transitivity, complementation and so on.</p>

				Most binomials are evenly stressed with the coordinating item

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>fun and games </em>/ˈfʌn.n̩.ˈɡeɪmz/<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>shoulder to shoulder </em>/ˈʃəʊl.də.tə.ˈʃəʊl.də/<br />
				A few may
				operate like compound nouns and take the stress on 
			the first element, e.g.:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<em>near and dear</em> (/ˈnɪər.n̩.dɪə/)<br />
				but stressing both components equally is more common.<br /></li>
				<li>Trinomials are lists but, because they are processed as 
				single units, the normal list intonation, with rises after each 
				item and a fall at the end, is compromised.&nbsp; We may get, 
				therefore, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; game, set and match</em><br />
				pronounced as<br />
				/ˈɡeɪmset.n̩.ˈmætʃ/<br />
				rather than<br />
				/ˈɡeɪm.ˈset.ənd.ˈmætʃ/<br />
				with the normal pause after the first item and equal stress on 
				all the items.<br />
				More commonly, the stress on each item is retained but the 
				intonation does not rise as it would in a list of less connected 
				items:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>beg, borrow and steal</em> /ˈbeɡ.ˈbɒ.rəʊ.n̩.ˈstiːl/</li>
				<li>Many idioms operate as single lexemes and only one tone unit 
				is discernible so we have, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I wouldn't be caught dead<br />
				</em>/ˈaɪ.wʊdnt.bi.kɔːt.ˈded/<br />
				with only two stressed syllables.<br />
				Compare:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I wouldn't do that if I were you</em>:<br />
				/ˈaɪ.wʊd.də.ˈðət.ɪf.ˈaɪ.wə.ˈju/<br />
				with four stresses.</li>
				<li>Because of their single lexeme nature, idioms are spoken 
				rapidly as one chunk so syllable reduction and weak forms are 
				common.&nbsp; E.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She's bitten off more than she can chew</em><br />
				is often pronounced as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ʃiz.ˈbɪt.n̩.ə.mɔː.ðən.ʃi.kn̩.tʃuː/<br />
				with two syllabic consonants and weak forms (/ə/, /i/).&nbsp; 
				See, too, the pronunciation of <em>and</em> in the binomial examples 
				which is often reduced to a single syllabic consonant 
				(/n̩/).</li>

		<p>Idioms present some serious difficulties for learners and that is one 
		reason that they have fallen out of fashion of late.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Idioms date quite rapidly.<br />
				It may be the case that native speakers of English used to 
				exclaim<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye Gods and little fishes!<br />
				</em>when astonished by something but to do so now would make 
				the speaker sound very odd and old fashioned.<br />
				The popular example of dating is the expression<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; raining cats and dogs<br />
				</em>which almost no native speaker would use but which is often 
				heard from learners of English.&nbsp; Other examples of dated 
				idioms to avoid include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be in seventh heaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to keep up with the Joneses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gift of the gab<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be dead beat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to take a rise out of someone<br />
				</em>and there are many more with which it is unwise to burden 
				learners.</li>
				<li>Idioms require learning and reproducing as a string of words 
				exactly.<br />
				Some idioms are quite long strings and impose something of a 
				strain on the memory.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; choose the lesser of the two evils<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; give someone the benefit of the doubt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cross that bridge when you come to it<br />
				</em>are all quite long and hard to remember as language chunks.</li>
				<li>Fixedness and naturalness.<br />
				Getting even one word wrong in an idiom can often result in the 
				expression sounding absurd and unnatural, although it will 
				rarely be misunderstood.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's a sour pill to swallow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I wash my hands from it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Speak of a devil<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It's not rocket physics<br />
				</em>are all wrong by one word and even missing or misusing an 
				article can make the speaker sound foreign or amusing.</li>
				<li>Some idioms are stand-alone expressions but some can only be 
				used embedded in co-text.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get your act together<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better late than never<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far so good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can say that again<br />
				</em>are all routinely used as isolated phrases (although they 
				can be embedded in other language).<br />
				However:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the best of both worlds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miss the boat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beat around the bush<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the ball<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the mire<br />
				</em>are only used when they are embedded in other language and 
				cannot stand alone.</li>

			<p>One can, of course, teach idioms only as and when they arise in 
			texts used in the classroom or in response to learner enquiries.&nbsp; 
			That makes some sense because it avoids problematising the issue and 
			demystifies a complicated area.<br />
			However, especially at more advanced levels, many learners 
			appreciate that they can only sound truly natural in English if they 
			are able to use a reasonably wide range of idiomatic expressions.&nbsp; 
			They will often, therefore, appreciate and be motivated by lessons 
			which focus specifically on idioms and idiomatic language.<br />
			The teacher's problem is how to select, group and present the most 
			common ones.&nbsp; There are three main ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A shared conceptual category<br />
				It has been noted that some words in English feature in idioms 
				more than most and provide a jumping-off point as well as a 
				conceptual hook to help people remember the expressions.&nbsp;

			<p>A web search will reveal some very long lists of idioms which you 
			may be tempted to teach to your long-suffering learners.&nbsp; There 
			is nothing wrong with accessing such materials providing:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li>you are aware that many lists are collected by people who do 
				not really understand the difference between an idiom, a proverb 
				and a strong collocation.</li>
				<li>you are alert to issues of fixedness and opacity and react 
				accordingly making a principled selection</li>
				<li>you know a little about how learners may be helped to 
				remember items by linking them to conceptual categories or 
				embedding them in a memorable setting or text</li>
			</ol>
			<p>With all that in mind, the following is a selected list of around 
			380 common idioms which attempts to exclude items which are not 
			actually idioms at all, ones which are rare or ones confined to 
			certain registers only.&nbsp; We have also excluded any we didn't 
			know and those which, while classifiable as idioms, are wholly 
			transparent in meaning.</p>

			<p>If you would like all those lists as a single PDF document, it's available
			<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_common_idioms.pdf" target="_blank">
			here</a> and from the links at the end.</p>
			<p>Clearly, such a list is only useful for planning purposes and as 
			an <em>aide memoire</em>.&nbsp; Please do not be tempted to give it 
			to your learners to commit to memory.<br />
			One way of approaching the area which has found some success is to 
			alert the learners that every lesson will include a new idiom from 
			this list.&nbsp; Their job is to try to identify it when it appears 
			in the materials or in something you say and point this out to the 
			class.<br />
			In this way, an enjoyable and simple challenge can be set and the 
			learners are not overloaded with too many idioms they can neither 
			remember easily nor use naturally.</p>

			<p>Idioms and idiomatic language have some characteristics that 
		make certain approaches more worthwhile and productive than others.</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li><strong>Context and co-text</strong><br />
			Idioms are, as we saw above, not confined to general informal speech 
			but that is the setting in which they are most frequently used.<br />
			It makes sense, therefore, to ensure that we set them in a clear 
			informal social context with language used among people well known 
			to each other and without too many disparities in roles and power.<br />
			Idioms occur more naturally in informal story-telling language so 
			that's a good place to situate them.&nbsp; Context will also help 
			learners appreciate issues of style and co-text will often 
			disambiguate meaning successfully.<br />
			In particular, idioms are frequently used to sum up a situation and, 
			without the preceding text are almost impossible to understand.<br />
			An expression such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is a whole new ball game</em><br />
			is superficially opaque but if it comes at the end of a conversation 
			about possibilities and suggestions, it may be easy to grasp the 
			meaning.</li>
			<li><strong>Illustrations</strong><br />
			Because idioms are so picturesque, it makes it comparatively easy to 
			link them to illustrations (see the introduction to this guide for 
			examples).</li>
			<li><strong>Figurative meaning</strong><br />
			Group and pair-work to decipher figurative meaning is helpful 
			because people see different things in language and have different 
			mental metaphors so they can help each other significantly.&nbsp; 
			Obviously, the more transparent the meaning is, the less hard the 
			expression will be to understand and learn.</li>
			<li><strong>Retelling stories</strong><br />
			Retelling exercises can be a powerful way of consolidating idiomatic 
			language as can dialogue writing and creative story writing.</li>
			<li><strong>Translation</strong><br />
			Idioms rarely translate exactly between languages but it is 
			surprising how similar <span class="style_underline">concepts</span> are encoded in idiomatic language.&nbsp; 
			For example, the expression <span class="style_black"><em>it cost 
			an arm and a leg</em></span> is rendered in Spanish with something 
			like <span class="style_black"><em>it cost an eye of your face</em></span> 
			and in German, <span class="style_black"><em>a hook in the matter</em></span> 
			means <span class="style_black"><em>there's a fly in the ointment</em></span>.&nbsp; All languages exhibit a rich 
			and picturesque range of metaphorical meaning.&nbsp; It can be 
			educational, interesting and fun to compare how meanings are encoded 
			in various languages and that, too, can help retention.<br />
			Here are some examples for fun.&nbsp; Can you match the English 
			idioms on the left to their equivalents in other languages on the 
			right?&nbsp; Click on the image when you have an answer.<p>

			You can, of course, get your learners to make up quizzes like this 
			and challenge others to find the English equivalent or figure out 
			the meaning.</p>
