			<h1>Pre-modification of noun phrases</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="modify" height="207" src="../../images/modification_welding310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>There is a 
			<a href="modification_nouns.html" target="_blank">guide to noun modification</a> in general on this site which 
			you may also like to consult.&nbsp; Here we are concerned only with 
			pre-modification of noun phrases.</p>
			<p>Pre-modifying noun phrases is a concise and stylistically 
			sophisticated way to add information because:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style23">
				<li>pre-modifiers use fewer words to convey the same information 
				as longer and more complex relative clauses.&nbsp; Compare, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people who arrived late</em><br />
				with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The late arrivals</em></li>
				<li>pre-modifying adjectives and classifiers are also concise 
				ways of delivering information.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman with the red hair</em><br />
				with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The red-haired woman</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shop on the corner</em><br />
				with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The corner shop</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are a number of ways we can pre-modify the noun phrase in 
			English.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Pre-modifying adjectives</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Most students of English will be happy with this, the easiest 
			form: pre-modification with adjectives.&nbsp; There are, however, 
			some issues.&nbsp; As our examples, we'll use:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>the delicious meal</em></li>
				<li><em>the vicious dog</em></li>
				<li><em>the ugly building</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is straightforward enough to see that all these are 
			attributive adjective use and could be rearranged to use the 
			adjective predicatively (i.e., as a post-modifier) so we can get:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>the meal was delicious</em></li>
				<li><em>the dog is vicious</em></li>
				<li><em>the building is ugly</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p><a name="1"></a>If you have followed
			the guide to adjectives (linked in the list of related guides at the end), 
			you'll know that most (but not all) adjectives can be used in both 
			ways.&nbsp; Now try to use the following predicative adjectives 
			attributively to 
			<strong>pre</strong>-modify the noun and you'll discover the problem.&nbsp;
			<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'list1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you see it</a>.</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>the meal was not delicious</em></li>
				<li><em>the dog is so vicious</em></li>
				<li><em>the building looks ugly</em></li>
			</ul>
			<ul id="list1" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li class="redbullet">When we use a negator, 
				pre-modification is at best clumsy, at worst downright wrong.&nbsp; 
				Few would accept<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*The not delicious meal<br />
				</em>and it is not easy to rephrase the sentence with a 
				different adjective.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The foul-tasting meal<br />
				</em>does not convey the same sense at 
				all.</li>
				<li class="redbullet">The adverb <em>so </em>cannot be 
				transferred to the attributive position.<em>&nbsp; </em>Again, 
				the sentence has to be  rephrased as something like:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very 
				vicious dog<br />
				</em>because the adverb <em>very</em> <strong>can</strong> 
				be used to modify the pre-modifying adjective.&nbsp; Lots of 
				adverbs can be used this way: <em>extremely, undoubtedly, 
				obviously </em>etc.</li>
				<li class="redbullet">When a copular verb other than <em>be</em> 
				is used to link subject to complement, attributive use won't 
				work unless one rephrases the sentence as, e.g.<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the 
				ugly-looking building<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the odd-seeming man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the foul-tasting 
				food<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the peaceful-sounding music<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				In other words, we have to 
				include the sense of the copular verb in the pre-modification.</li>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>You will know if you have followed the guide to adjectives that 
			we need to distinguish between an adjective proper (sometimes called 
			an epithet) and a noun being used adjectivally (often called a 
			classifier or noun adjunct).&nbsp; A simple test is to ask whether the word can be 
			modified with <em>very</em> or made comparative with <em>more</em> 
			or -<em>er.</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet">We can have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a fast car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a faster 
				car<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a very fast car<br />
				</em>so <em>fast</em> is a 
				pre-modifying epithet or adjective proper.</li>
				<li class="greybullet">We can have<br /><em>a sports car<br />
				</em>but 
				not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a sportser car<br />
				</em>or<br />
				<em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a very sports car<br />
				</em>so 
				the word <em>sports </em>is a noun pre-modifier or classifier, not an 
				adjective.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The relationship between the two nouns is often very close and 
			they may better be considered simply compound nouns but that is not 
			always the case.&nbsp; We need to consider the stress patterns:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li class="greybullet">Compound nouns are generally stressed 
				on the first item because they are conventionally considered 
				single concepts so we get, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>gla</strong>ss house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>i</strong>nk jet<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spo</strong>rts car<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door</strong> key<br />
				</em>etc.&nbsp; All of those could, 
				incidentally, be joined with a hyphen or written as one word.</li>
				<li class="greybullet">When the first noun is acting as a 
				classifier, however, in less common combinations, the stress 
				remains on the noun being modified so we have, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a 
				software de<strong>vel</strong>oper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a mountain <strong>ref</strong>uge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				a garden <strong>seat<br />
				</strong></em>etc.<br />
				(As a noun-noun combination becomes increasingly common, the 
				stress will slowly slide to the first item.&nbsp; For example, 
				what began as <em>a hard <strong>dri</strong>ve </em>has become<em> 
				a<strong> hard</strong> drive</em> and <em>a wind <strong>tur</strong>bine</em><strong><em>
				</em></strong>is slowly becoming <em>a <strong>wind</strong> turbine</em> 
				etc.)</li>
			</ul>

					<h2>The genitive <em>'s</em> pre-modifier</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The genitive <em>'s</em> is straightforward usually and causes 
			few problems so<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter's car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man's cottage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sea's power<br />
			</em>etc. are readily understood.<br />
			It is worth recalling here that the structure does not only refer to 
			ownership (which is why we prefer the term genitive to possessive).&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his father's advice<br />
			</em>refers to origin, and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his father's belief<br />
			</em>describes the belief.<br />
			There are times when the situation is not so clear.&nbsp; Consider 
			these four phrases and their meanings.<br />
			<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'list2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have done that</a>.</p>
			<ol >
				<li><em>this is a young man's job</em></li>
				<li><em>there's a gardener's hut over there</em></li>
				<li><em>this is the young man's job</em></li>
				<li><em>she rides an old man's bicycle</em></li>
			</ol>
			<ol id="list2" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li >In this case, the speaker is probably referring to the fact 
				that the work is hard and not easily done except by young, fit 
				people.&nbsp; However, it <strong>could </strong>mean that the 
				job is that of a particular young man.</li>
				<li >This is truly ambiguous.&nbsp; It probably means that the 
				hut is typical of gardeners' huts everywhere and not that it 
				belongs to a particular gardener (or any gardener at all).&nbsp; 
				On the other hand, it could mean that the hut belongs to, or is 
				generally used by, one particular gardener from a group of 
				gardeners.&nbsp; The genitive <em>'s</em> form is commonly used 
				to refer to professions as in, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a barber's shop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a 
				greengrocer's business<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a doctor's surgery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an agricultural 
				worker's cottage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an artisan's dwelling<br />
				</em>etc. and it is also 
				often ambiguous whether the reference is to a particular 
				artisan, agricultural worker or to the class of objects 
				associated with them.</li>
				<li >Compare this to sentence 1.&nbsp; Here the meaning is almost 
				certainly that a particular young man is the holder of this job, 
				hence the use of the definite-article determiner.</li>
				<li >This is also almost unambiguous because of the sex of the 
				people.&nbsp; It almost certainly refers to the type of bicycle, 
				not its owner.&nbsp; There is an outside chance, however, that 
				she has begged, borrowed or stolen an old man's bicycle.</li>

			<p>There are two sorts of these.</p>
			<h3><em>-ing</em> participles</h3>
			<p>Under the image above we have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">the howling wind</span><br />
			</em>and it looks like <em>howling is
			</em>acting as a simple adjective.&nbsp; 
			There are two problems with that analysis.</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>If we try to use <em>howling</em> predicatively, we get 
				something like <em>the wind is howling</em> and that's a 
				progressive tense aspect, not an adjectival use.</li>
				<li>We can't have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the very howling wind<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the 
				more howling wind<br />
				</em>so the word is not functioning at all as 
				an adjective in the proper sense.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now consider:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>She has a number of irritating habits</em></li>
				<li><em>She has a number of very irritating habits</em></li>
				<li><em>That's a shocking idea</em></li>
				<li><em>That's the most shocking idea I've heard today</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>All of these are quite acceptable so here the words <em>shocking</em> 
			and <em>irritating</em> are functioning as normal adjectives, not as 
			participles <em>per se</em>.<br />
			They are, of course, strongly 
			associated with their verb forms so are participial adjectives.<br />
			It is worth noting here that many participles with negative prefixes 
			can only be used as adjectives because no parallel verb is 
			available.&nbsp; We can have, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circus acts were exciting</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children were excited by the circus acts</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The circus acts were unexciting</em><br />

				<li ><em>the grinning man</em></li>
				<li ><em>the laughing group of students</em></li>
				<li ><em>the reassuring person</em></li>
				<li ><em>the reassuring conversation</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Why are some more acceptable than others?&nbsp;
			<a href="#3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'permanence',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have an idea</a>.</p>
			<p id="permanence" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
			The reason that the first two and the last phrases seem more natural 
			is that they are <strong>permanent</strong> states.&nbsp; The skull, 
			the Cavalier (in the famous painting by Frans Hals) and the 
			conversation are fixed in place or time and have the attributes of
			<em>grinning, laughing </em>and<em> reassuring </em>permanently 
			associated with them.&nbsp; (And you are right; the cavalier in 
			question is not actually laughing.)<br />
			The others are less natural because a <em>man</em>, a <em>group of 
			students</em> and a <em>person</em> cannot, usually, 
			be described as <em>grinning, laughing </em>or <em>reassuring  
			</em> <strong>permanently</strong>.</p>
			<h3><em>-ed / -en </em>participles</h3>
			<p>(The term <em>-ed /-en</em> participles applies here to forms such as 
			<em>completed</em> as well as to irregular but parallel forms such as <em>
			spoken</em>.)</p>
			<h4>The concept of permanence applies here, too.</h4>
			<p>We can have, e.g.,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his forced laugh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her broken shoes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an accomplished performance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			their excited shouting<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			These attributes are permanently assigned to the nouns either 
			because they are fixed in time or fixed in space.&nbsp; In all the 
			examples, the attribute applies to a single incidence and is fixed 
			in time:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the laugh was forced<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the shoes were broken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the performance was 
			accomplished<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the shouting was exited<br />
			</em>But we cannot have, e.g.,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *an arrived man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a begun job<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a started war<br />
			</em>etc. because the 
			attributes cannot be permanently ascribed to the noun.<br />
			As another example, <em>a worn dress </em>refers to its 
			permanent condition not the fact that someone is temporarily wearing 
			it.</p>
			<h4>Active and passive</h4>
			<p><em>-ed / -en</em> participles are used both actively (as in, e.g., <em>I 
			have spoken to him</em>) and passively (as in e.g., <em>The job has 
			been finished</em>).</p>
			<p>This is a key distinction because using an active participle as a 
			pre-modifier is quite rare and subject to some constraints.<br />
			If we want to use an active <em>-ed / -en</em> participle attributively for 
			a temporary state it <strong>must</strong> be pre-modified so, e.g.:<br />
			We can allow:<br />
			<em>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			a recently started war<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			a newly begun job<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			But we cannot allow, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*a started war<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*a begun job</em></p>
			<p>Passively, the <em>-ed / -en</em> participle is much more frequently used 
			and not subject to so many constraints so we can have any of the 
			following whether the attribute is permanent or temporarily applied:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a broken vase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an insulted participant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a forgotten treasure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an 
			angered tiger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a disappointed lover<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a chewed bone<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<p>The passive is usually used to refer to a
			<strong>permanent</strong> state and that is why the following are 
			not usually acceptable:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a constructed dam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a mentioned person<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a named baby<br />
			</em>unless they are pre-modified with an adverb as we saw above 
			(and we could have <em>recently, frequently</em> or<em> strangely</em> 
			as modifiers in these cases).</p>
			<p>The issues in English with the use of participles of verbs as

			<p>A short cut allowed in English but not in many languages involves 
			rephrasing a noun post-modified by a prepositional phrase to one 
			pre-modified by the erstwhile prepositional complement (or object).&nbsp; 
			So, for example, we can go from:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The houses in the middle<br />
			</em>to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The middle houses<br />
			</em>in which the noun<em> middle</em> has been converted from its 
			prepositional complement or object role into a classifier (and some 
			might describe it as an ungradable adjective).</p>
			<p><a name="central"></a>There are, however, two restrictions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Not all prepositions allow this conversion and it is limited 
				to those which are most central in meaning.<br />
				Prepositions such as <em>near, like</em> or <em>close to</em> do not 
				allow this conversion because they are peripheral, lying on the 
				borderline between prepositions and adjectives.&nbsp; (We can 
				have, for example, comparative and superlative forms such as <em>
				nearer, more like</em> and
				<em>closest</em> which central prepositions do not allow.)<br />
				We do not therefore allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The factory near the town</em><br />
				to convert to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The town factory</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house opposite the park<br />
				</em>to convert to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The park house<br />
				</em>with anything like the same meaning.<br />
				We can, however, use the simple central prepositions of place to make 
				the conversions as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house at the corner &rarr; The corner 
				house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bus from London → The London bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The table in the centre → The centre table<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book on the top → The top book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train to Margate → The Margate train</em><br />
				The list of truly central prepositions is generally confined to:
				<em>at, from, in, on </em>and<em> to.</em></li>
				<li>The permanent or temporary nature of the relationship and 
				the possibility of movement also plays a role.&nbsp; We allow, 
				when looking at a photograph:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The end person</em><br />
				instead of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person at the end</em><br />
				because the photograph is fixed in time and the person will not 
				move.<br />
				We cannot, however, do this with temporary situations and with 
				items which move around so we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman in the corner<br />
				</em>to be converted to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The corner woman<br />
				</em>That is not a particularly intuitive restriction.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Some words function as adverbs as well as prepositions.&nbsp; 
			A few are sometimes used as pre-modifiers of noun phrases, so we 
			get, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inside / outside furniture<br />
			</em>from<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The furniture which is used inside / outside<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above / below items<br />
			</em>from<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The items listed above / below</em></p>

				</table>
			<p>There are guides to determiners and pre-determiners on this site 
			so this section is confined to exemplification only.<br />
			Some determiners act to specify, rather than classify, the 
			noun phrase, like this:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>articles</dt>
				<dd>These are familiar determiners and may specify:<br />
				A member of a specified group of entities:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man came in</em><br />
				A particular instance of an entity known to the hearer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man said he was from the phone company</em><br />
				A general reference to a type of entity:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Oslash; Tigers are dangerous </em>(zero article)</dd>
				<dt>demonstratives</dt>
				<dd>These point to particular items and simultaneously specify<br />
				Number:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these books</em><br />
				vs.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this book</em><br />
				Proximity:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that book</em><br />
				vs.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this book</em></dd>
				<dt>interrogatives (<em>which, whose</em> and <em>what</em>)</dt>
				<dd>These are used to form <em>wh-question</em>s:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which man did you see?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What house did he buy?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose car was stolen?</em></dd>
				<dt>possessives</dt>
				<dd>These signal ownership, origin or description as in, 
				respectively:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His car was stolen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your letter has been received<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government's policy</em></dd>
				<dt>quantifiers</dt>
				<dd>This is a large group with complex rules of use and 
				includes:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few people came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less money is available<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some cars were badly parked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much time has been lost</em><br />
				etc.</dd>

					<h2>Pre-modification instead of relative pronoun clauses</h2>

				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Language (such as Turkish, Korean, Tamil and Japanese) which do 
			not use relative clauses often rely on pre-modification of nouns to 
			do the same job. So, for example, instead of:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house which was destroyed in the fire<br />
			</em>we get:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The in the fire destroyed house<br />
			</em>or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*The destroyed in the fire house<br />
			</em>Some languages, such as German, which have parallel relative 
			clause structures can also use pre-modification instead of a 
			relative pronoun clause to achieve the same effect, so we might get 
			something like<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The on the wall hanging picture<br />
			</em>instead of<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The picture (which is) hanging on the wall</em></p>
			<p>English generally resists this kind of pre-modification and 
			prefers relative pronoun structures.&nbsp; Occasionally, however, it 
			is possible so we can have either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expenses which were allowed for</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The allowed-for expenses<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guests who were admitted<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The admitted guests<br />
			</em>For teaching purposes we need to be careful with such 
			structures because they are uncommon in English and may lead to an 
			assumption that relative clauses can be replaced with 
			pre-modification in all cases and that will encourage errors such 
			as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *My in America cousins<br />
			</em>instead of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My cousins who are in America.</em></p>
			<p>(Relative adverb clauses cannot be converted in this way at all 
			so we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The we were married church<br />
			</em>instead of<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The church where we were married</em>.)</p>

			<p>Mostly, teaching implications stem from the need for the teacher 
			to be aware of the complications of noun pre-modifiers and to make 
			sure that presentation, practice and correction is consistent and 
			principled.<br />
			Your final task is to review the analysis above and pick out the 
			three most important ideas that you need to be aware of in the 
			classroom and when you are reviewing, planning or correcting.<br />

				<li><strong>The distinction between epithets and classifiers.<br />
				</strong>So you can spot when a learner confuses the ideas 
				and produces, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the very retired teacher<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the gardening 
				hard work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the more Ancient Greek<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				Classifiers almost always come immediately before the noun they 
				modify and cannot be themselves modified by adverbs.&nbsp; The 
				adjective which comes before the classifier modifies the noun, 
				not the classifier itself:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a green mountain bike<br />
				</em>is not 
				for use on green mountains.<br />
				Classifiers are also sometimes called noun adjuncts, 
				incidentally.</li>
				<li><strong>The concept of (im)permanence.<br />
				</strong>This is 
				vital because it applies across the range of pre-modification 
				both by <em>-ing</em> participles and <em>-ed /-en</em> participles.&nbsp; 
				You can teach the difference between<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bored person<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a boring person<br />
				</em>from the point of view of the speaker 
				and the person but, unless the concept of temporary vs. 
				permanent attribution is made clear, your job is only half 
				accomplished.&nbsp; The concept needs explicit analysis in the 
				classroom.</li>
				<li><strong>The distinction between pre-modifying noun 
				classifiers and compound nouns.<br />
				</strong>Unless this is 
				made clear, attempts to teach learners how to stress noun 
				phrases is very difficult.&nbsp; You will be reduced to telling 
				learners that it's all just 'irregular' and they have to learn 
				each combination's stress pattern separately.&nbsp; We can be 
				more helpful than that.</li>
