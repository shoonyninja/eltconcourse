		On the right we have reported or indirect speech &ndash; how the message 
		is passed on.</p>
		<p>On the face of it, there's nothing terribly difficult about this

			<p>A small but significant source of error in reporting in British 
			English is that the intrusive <em>got</em> in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have got enough money</em><br />
			is dropped when the tense is backshifted so we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he had enough money</em><br />
			However, when the structure is used to express either:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>strong obligation as 
			in:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have got to go now</em><br />the 
				<em>got</em> may be retained and the reporting becomes:<br />&nbsp; 
				<em>&nbsp; He said he had got to go then</em></li>
				<li>the sense of <em>receive</em>, as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have got a letter from her</em><br />
				the <em>got</em> may also be retained and the reporting becomes:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she had got a letter from her</em></li>

			<p>Here's a definition:</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><em>The name given to those aspects of language whose interpretation 
			is relative to the occasion of utterance<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style71">Fillmore (1966) in Harman (1989)</span></p>
			<p>It's an important phenomenon in this area because the use of 
			deixis neatly explains a lot of the so-called anomalies of indirect 
			speech.&nbsp; Because meaning is dependent on the identity, point of view, 
			time and location of the speaker / writer we are 
			obliged (or not) to change, e.g., <em>I </em>to<em> he </em>or<em> 
			she, we </em>to <em>they</em>, <em>bring </em>to<em> come, come
			</em>to<em> go </em>(and<em> go </em>to<em> come</em>)<em>, this
			</em>to<em> that, here </em>to<em> there, yesterday </em>to<em> the 
			previous day, now </em>to<em> then, bring </em>to<em> take </em>and 
			so on.<br />
			We make these changes because of a movement to the deictical centre.&nbsp; 
			This is usually <em><strong>I, now</strong></em> and <em><strong>
			here</strong></em> so we make changes to allow for this.<br />
			There are three types of deixis which affect the way we report what 
			people say:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Personal deixis:<br />
				We change pronouns to reflect who is addressing whom so we 
				report, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you please come early?"<br />
				</em>as any of<br />
				<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;</span><em><span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				She asked me to come early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked him / her to come early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked you to come early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked them to come early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked [name(s)] to come early</span></em><br />
				depending on the context of who was addressed.</li>
				<li>Spatial deixis:<br />
				When the reporting occurs at a different place, changes need to 
				be made to reflect the fact so we can report, e.g.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to London"</em><br />
				as<br />
				<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she is 
				coming to London<br />
				</em>if the reporting happens to take place in London.&nbsp; If 
				it takes place elsewhere, the verb will not need to change.<br />
				Equally, for the same reason we need to make changes when we 
				report adverbials which may not hold true when the reporting 
				happens so, e.g.: we report:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please put it on the left<br />
				</em>as<br />
				<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked me to put 
				it on the right<br />
				</em>if the reporter has moved.<br />
				When the reporting takes place at another time and place, other 
				minor changes will occur because the use of demonstratives, in 
				particular, becomes irrelevant so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want that one<br />
				</em>may be reported something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she wanted the one on the shelf<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the right train<br />
				</em>may be reported as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked if it was the right train<br />
				</em>Spatial deixis also explains why<ol class="auto-style15">
					<li>we often need to change <em>bring</em> to
					<span class="style_brown"><em>take</em></span> when 
					reporting in another place.</li>
					<li>we often need to change <em>this</em> to
					<span class="style_brown"><em>that</em></span> and <em>these</em> 
					to <span class="style_brown"><em>those</em></span> (and <em>
					vice versa</em>)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Temporal deixis:<br />
				When reporting times, we need to consider that most people will 
				expect any utterance to be centred on now so we make the 
				appropriate changes as in, e.g., reporting:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to see you this afternoon"<br />
				</em>as<br />
				<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked to see me 
				that afternoon<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm leaving next year"<br />
				</em>as<br />
				<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she was 
				leaving the following year<br />
				</em>if the reporting takes place much later.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this regard, the following changes now make more sense:</p>

			<p>Of course, not all changes are always appropriate (but using the 
		changes will usually be correct).<br />
		If we are reporting something virtually simultaneously, then we often 
		don't change the tense or time expressions.&nbsp; If we are reporting 
		something in the same place, then we don't change the place expressions.<br />
			Another way of putting this is to refer to the encoding time (when 
			the statement was made) and the decoding time (when the statement 
			was reported).&nbsp; If the encoding and decoding times are the 
			same, few if any changes need to be made to time markers and tense 
			forms.<br />
			So we might get:<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: I'm going there now.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		B: What did he say?<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		C: He said he's going there now<br />
			</em></span>However, if the encoding and decoding times are 
			sufficiently separated, we do make changes accordingly so the 
			exchange might end as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he was going there then.</em></p>
		<p>If an utterance remains true, we often don't change the tense so we 
		get, e.g.,<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm from South Africa = </em> 
		<span class="style_brown"><em>He said he's from 
		South Africa</em></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		I love the countryside = </em> <span class="style_brown"><em>She said she loves 
		the countryside</em></span></p>
		<p>Try this <a href="../../initial/grammar_essentials/reported_speechhp.htm">matching exercise</a> 
		to make sure you have understood so far.</p>
		<p>Did you notice the changes, particularly with time and place 
		expressions but also with the verb <em>come</em> (which changed to <em>go</em>)?</p>
		<p>If you have followed so far, this will be 
		familiar:</p>

		<p>It's clear that we have examples of direct speech and indirect speech 
		here in sentences 1, 4, 2 and 5 but <strong>Sentence 6 </strong>is what is called a hybrid form because the first part follows the 
		'rules' but the second part actually changes only the pronoun, from <em>
		you</em> to <em>I</em>.<br />
		If the sentence followed the reported speech 'rules', it should be<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said I was welcome to come and asked 
		if I would like to bring Mary<br />
		</em>which is another possibility, of course, but sounds quite formal.</p>

				<li>The omission of <em>that</em>.<br />
				All the examples in the table here include <em>that</em>.&nbsp; 
				However, it can be and routinely is omitted (something which, 
				incidentally, is not allowed in some languages which have a 
				parallel structure).<br />
				When it is omitted, it is still, in technical terms a <em>that-</em>clause 
				but referred to as a zero-<em>that-</em>clause, often written as
				<em><strong>&Oslash;-that</strong></em><strong>-clause</strong>.<br />
				When the clause is short and concise, <em>that</em> is 
				conventionally ellipted so most users of English will prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said it's OK</em><br />
				rather than:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said that it's OK</em><br />
				However, if the utterance is structurally heavy, including 
				multiple adverbials, subordinated and coordinated clauses and 
				other modifiers, it is usually stylistically inappropriate to 
				ellipt <em>that</em>.&nbsp; For example, if we report:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary explained, "Up to now, I had always assumed the guy 
				in the suit was the boss of the enterprise but now I see I was 
				mistaken."</em><br />
				we would normally include <em>that </em>in indirect speech and 
				have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Mary explained that she had up to then she had always assumed that the guy in 
				the suit was the boss of the enterprise but now she saw that she 
				was mistaken.</em></li>
				<li>Reporting verbs.<br />
				If we report something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's the switch on the left," explained 
				Peter.</em><br />
				we may choose to structure the report differently and simply 
				have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter explained which switch it was</em><br />
				rather than the more tortuous:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter explained that it was the switch on 
				the left.<br />
				</em>There is more on reporting verbs below.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Incidentally, the rule for ordering in <strong>direct</strong> speech is that you 
			cannot reverse the verb and subject pronoun but you can reverse a 
			noun or noun phrase subject and verb.&nbsp; We allow, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the bus," said John</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the bus," John said</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the bus," he said</em><br />
			but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the bus,", said he</em><br />
			is now hopelessly archaic.</p>

		<p>Closed questions are those which require a <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em> response and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Are you going to the cinema?</em><br />

			<p>The other important thing to make sure that learners get right is the 
			word ordering when reporting a question.&nbsp; There are three 
			issues to consider:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The word order in these clauses is the one we would expect 
				for a normal declarative statement.&nbsp; We have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked if he was coming</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I asked if was he coming</em></li>
				<li>The <em>do, does, did</em> operator which is used for 
				forming questions in present and past simple tenses is not used 
				in a reported question.&nbsp; We have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enquired if she worked in London<br />
				</em>not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I enquired if did she work in London</em></li>
				<li>There is no reversal of subject and object with primary or 
				modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; We have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wondered if she could manage the 
				project<br />
				</em>not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He wondered if could she manage the 
				project</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Many languages do not work this way and the transfer from L<sub><span class="auto-style115">1</span></sub> 
			to L<sub><span class="auto-style115">T</span></sub> often produces 
			errors like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She asked were they English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She wondered should she go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They enquired whether did the train stop at Margate?</em></p>

			</table>
		<p>Questions phrased using <em>wh-</em>words: <em>who, 
		what, why, when, which, where, how</em> cannot be predicted to have a 
		<em>Yes-No-Maybe</em> answer.<br />
		Questions formed in this way cannot be reported with <em>if</em> or <em>
		whether</em>.&nbsp; The reporting is done by embedding the questions.<br />
		This means that reporting this type of question requires a different 
		word ordering from that used in reporting yes-no questions (see above) 
		and that is non-intuitive.&nbsp; Many learners, having struggled to get 
		the word ordering of yes-no questions right, logically transfer the rule 
		concerning not disturbing the natural word ordering to <em>wh-question</em>s with resulting error.&nbsp; We can get, therefore:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She asked me where is the station<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They enquired when are we coming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She asked what did I do for a living</em><br />
		etc.</p>
		<p>Embedding is often associated with polite questioning so, instead of 
		the direct:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the station?</em><br />
		we form polite embedded questions such as <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Can you tell me where the station is?</em></p>
		<p>So it is with reported questions.&nbsp; Thus:</p>
			<table class="tableblueborder" style="width: 85%">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style98" style="width: 25%"><em>Where is the 
					station?</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style99">&rarr;</td>
					<td class="auto-style92"><em>He asked me where the station 
					is / was</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style89" style="width: 25%"><em>What is the 
					time?</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style45">&rarr;</td>
					<td class="auto-style94"><em>She asked me what the time was 
					/ is</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style89" style="width: 25%"><em>When are you 
					arriving?</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style22">&rarr;</td>
					<td class="auto-style93"><em>He asked me when I was / am 
					arriving</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style89" style="width: 25%"><em>Who is 
					coming with you?</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style22">&rarr;</td>
					<td class="auto-style93"><em>She asked them who was / is 
					coming with them</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style95" style="width: 25%"><em>Why are they 
					late?</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style96">&rarr;</td>
					<td class="auto-style97"><em>She asked why they were / are 
					late</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
		<p>The tense chosen will often conform to the time and place of the 
		reporting using the common-sense rules discussed above although 
		back-shifting tenses where possible is common even when the reporting is 
		virtually simultaneous.</p>
		<p>The big issue for learners with this kind of reporting is the 
		ordering of the subject and verb.&nbsp; Most first languages will lead learners 
		to produce errors such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Can you tell me when is the film beginning?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Do you know who is the lady there?</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		And this will also carry over to reported questions so we get:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She asked me where is the zoo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They enquired what time did the train leave</em><br />
		and so on.</p>
		<p>Other reporting verbs such as <em>explain, clarify, complain, 
		mention, remember</em> and <em>state</em> will produce similar errors 
		because the structures are parallel to reported questions in English but 
		not parallelled in many other languages.&nbsp; We may encounter, 
		therefore:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She explained how did the machine work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They clarified what did they need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I remembered where was I going</em></p>
			<p>There is more on the quirky nature of some reporting verbs below.</p>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Disturbing the word order</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>If the direct question is formed with <em>who, which</em> or <em>
			what</em> with the verb <em>be</em> as part of the predicate, it is 
			possible to disturb the word order outlined above.&nbsp; For 
			example, the following can be reported in two ways, like this:</p>
			<table class="tableblueborder" style="width: 85%">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style126" style="width: 25%"><em>Who was the 
					winner?</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style45"><em>&rarr;</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style94"><em>She asked me who the winner was</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style92">or</td>
					<td class="auto-style94"><em>She asked me who was the winner</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style95" style="width: 25%"><em>Which were 
					the fastest cars?</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style45"><em>&rarr;</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style94"><em>She asked me which the 
					fastest cars were</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style92">or</td>
					<td class="auto-style94"><em>She asked me which were the 
					fastest cars</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style89" style="width: 25%"><em>What were 
					his friends doing?</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style22"><em>&rarr;</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style93"><em>She asked me what his 
					friends were doing</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style92">or</td>
					<td class="auto-style93"><em>She asked me what were his friends 
					doing</em></td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			
		<p>However, the word ordering with the reversal of subject and verb is 
		always correct, so, for teaching purposes, that is the way to go.&nbsp; 
		Your learners may, however, encounter this disturbance so it's as well 
		to be prepared for it and note that it only occurs in the limited 
		circumstances set out here.</p>
			<p>The disturbed word order is, however, <strong>always</strong> 
			conventional when the question involves <em>be</em> as a simple 
			copula with an adjectival attribute.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is best?</em><br />
			is reported as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked which was best</em><br />
			not as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She asked which best was</em></p>

		<p class="style_brown" ><strong>Rule 1: you can't use </strong> <em><strong>that</strong></em><strong> in reporting questions or

			<p>As we saw in part 1 of this guide, tense shifting is common in 
			English and it is rarely wrong to do it.&nbsp; However:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style15">
				<li>If the reporting verb is in the present, we don't shift 
				tenses.&nbsp; So we get<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She often says, "I don't know what

				<em><span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John tells me there was a nasty accident 
				here / there last night.</span><br />
				</em>(Note that <em>last night</em> 
				does not change because the reporting is of a recent 
				utterance.)</li>
				<li>If the validity of what was said still holds.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Darwin wrote, "There is grandeur in this view

				<li>Although back-shifting could be used in all the above

				and so on.<p>It is possible roughly to divide reporting verbs 
				into three overlapping categories, like this:<br />
			<img alt="strength" height="231" src="../../imagesgraphics/reporting_verbs_strength.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>in which the verbs are arranged in relation to the strength 
				of the statement made so, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I must have the steak," she said<br />
			</em>could be reported as:<br /><em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She insisted on having the steak<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'd like the steak," she said<br />
			</em>as<br /><em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she'd like the steak<br />
			</em>but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wonder if I might have the steak," she 
				said<br /></em>as<br /><em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enquired whether she could have the 
				steak<br /></em>This has some pedagogical utility, of course, because it 
				gives learners a way of understanding the connotations of the 
				verbs.<br />However, the categories are not unarguable and 
			people will put different verbs in different boxes.&nbsp; It is a 
			rule of thumb at best.</p>

					<h3>Reporting comment clauses</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Some reporting verbs are used to report an embedded or fronted 
			comment clause so, for example, something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is, as you well know, quite capable."</em><br />
			may be reported as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He insisted that I knew that she was quite 
			capable.</em><br />
			Other comment clauses such as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, to be honest, I don't have a clue."</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As you know, I've been living here for 
			years."</em><br />
			may be reported using an appropriate reporting verb but maintaining 
			the adverbial as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He explained that he honestly didn't have a 
			clue.<br />
			</em>or as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He reminded me that he had been living there for years.</em></p>
			<p>There is a difference in the way that such clauses are reported 
			depending on the role of the disjunct adverbial.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Style disjuncts express the speaker / writer's view of what 
				is being expressed and how it should be understood.&nbsp; So, 
				for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seriously, I don't think it will arrive 
				in time."</em><br />
				expresses how the speaker wishes to be understood and may be 
				reported as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She seriously doubted whether it would 
				arrive in time.</em></li>
				<li>Attitude disjuncts indicate how generally the speaker wants 
				to be understood or what limitations apply and they are reported 
				using the same disjuncts usually (so are considerably easier to 
				form).&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "More or less, that's the same conclusion 
				I arrived at."</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Administrationally, this is quite a simple matter."</em><br />
				can be reported simple as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that it was more or less the same 
				conclusion he had arrived at.</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said it was administrationally quite 
				a simple matter.</em></li>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The issue here is whether one can omit the word <em>that</em> 
			from a reported statement.<br />The theoretical distinction is between what are called bridge 
			verbs and non-bridge verbs.&nbsp; Many simple reporting verbs verbs 
			such as <em>say, tell, think, know, write, claim</em> and <em>hear</em> 
			are bridge verbs and it is perfectly in order to omit the word <em>
			that</em> when they are followed by a clause so we allow both:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that he was coming tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John thinks that it's too expensive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She claims that she lost the money<br />
			</em>etc. and:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he was coming tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John thinks it's too expensive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She claims she lost the money<br />
			</em>Many find (that) the sentences without <em>that</em> are more 
			stylistically acceptable.</p>
			<p>However, some verbs, exemplified above with verbs like <em>cry, 
			sneer</em> and <em>shout</em>, refer not only to what was 
			said but to <strong>how</strong> it was said and these are often 
			non-bridge verbs and leaving out <em>that</em> results in clumsiness 
			at best.&nbsp; For example, many people find:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shouted she was coming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She whispered the chairman was drunk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lied he was married<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They acknowledged coming late was rude</em><br />
			are all clumsy or even wrong and should be expressed with <em>that</em> 
			as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shouted that she was coming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She whispered that the chairman was drunk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lied that he was married<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They acknowledged that coming late was rude</em><br />
			In general terms, the less common and more loaded reporting verbs 
			require <em>that </em>when followed by a clause<em>.<br />
			</em>Here are some examples of how non-bridge verbs are used when 
			reporting:</p>
			<table class="tableblueborder" style="width: 85%">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style126" style="width: 25%"><em>"We could 
					always climb Everest," she joked</em></td>

					<td class="auto-style93"><em>The minister conceded that 
					having long periods of unemployment made it difficult to get 
					work in the future</em></td>
				</tr>
				</table>
				<p>In all those case where we choose to follow the reporting 
				verb with a clause, the insertion of <em>that
			</em>is almost obligatory.<br />
				In the last case, not including <em>that</em> results in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minister conceded having long periods of unemployment 
				made it difficult to get work in the future<br />
			</em>which forces the hearer to reconsider who has long periods of 
				unemployment.</p>
			<p>In academic writing simple verbs are often avoided for the sake 
			of style or precision and less frequently used so non-bridge verbs are 
			usually preferred.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru confirms that the results are reliable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He acknowledged that the experiment was flawed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The findings indicate that there is a need for ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She emphasises that findings are provisional<br />
			</em>all sound clumsy without <em>that</em>.</p>
			<p>Here's a brief summary:<br />
			<img alt="bridge and non-bridge verbs" height="345" src="../../imagesgraphics/bridge_verbs.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>Clause length is a factor which tends to override the omission of
			<em>that</em> even with simple reporting verbs so while, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I said, without much optimism based on his previous track 
				record, he would come<br />
				</em>is correct and the omission of <em>that</em> is acceptable, 
			most native speakers would insert it to signal the subordinate 
			clause as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I said, without much optimism based on his previous track 
				record, that he would come</em></p>

			<p>Colligation with reporting verbs is something of a headache for 
			learners of English and there are numerous constraints and 
			possibilities.<br />
			Reporting verbs can be categorised by what they may be followed by 
			and it is certainly not intuitive to understand, for example, that 
			we can say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He confirmed that I had passed<br />
			</em>but we cannot say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He congratulated that I passed<br />
			</em>Here are some of the common issues.&nbsp; For a list of 
			reporting verbs and their grammatical constraints and possibilities, 
			download the PDF file from the link above or at the end.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>+ </strong> <em><strong>that</strong></em><strong> clauses</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is a very common way to follow a reporting verbs.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She complained that the food was cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They boasted that they had lots of money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She considered that it was good enough</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				With common verbs, such as <em>say</em> or <em>tell</em>, the word <em>that </em>
				may be omitted so we allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she was ill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They told me it was finished</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				With less common verbs and verbs which signal how something is 
				said as well as what was said, <em>that</em> is usually retained 
				(see above under the discussion of <a href="#bridge">bridge and 
				non-bridge verbs</a>).<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She quipped that we could borrow the 
				money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They muttered that they had not had the money</em><br />
				Of the list of nearly 100 reporting verbs well over half can 
				naturally be followed by a <em>that</em> clause.&nbsp; Some 
				verbs may not, however, so we do not allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She ordered that we come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We offered that we do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *John and Mary discussed that they could go</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>+ </strong> <em>-<strong>ing </strong> </em><strong>or a noun phrase</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is another common construction.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She admitted stealing the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She admitted the theft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She discussed meeting the clients<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They discussed the meeting</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>preposition + </strong> <em>-<strong>ing</strong></em><strong> or a noun phrase</strong></dt>
				<dd>Many reporting verbs are prepositional so we find, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She laughed about coming so late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They blamed us for the delay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I inquired about taking the bus</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>transitive </strong> <em><strong>vs</strong></em><strong>. intransitive uses</strong></dt>
				<dd>Some reporting verbs are transitive, some intransitive and, 
				because the distinction is often not parallel in other 
				languages, the area causes a good deal of error.&nbsp; For 
				example,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She accused </em><strong><em>me</em></strong><em> 
				of the error<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They claimed the prize<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I encouraged </em><strong><em>her </em></strong><em>to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He warned </em><strong><em>me</em></strong><em> not to be 
				late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She replied that she was unable to come</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>putative </strong><em><strong>should </strong> </em>
				<strong>clauses</strong></dt>
				<dd>The verbs <em>advise, beg, demand, insist, plead, prefer, propose, 
				recommend, request</em> and <em>suggest</em> can be followed by 
				clauses containing <em>should</em>.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She advised that we should take a taxi<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He begged that he should be allowed to come, too<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He proposed that we should go to The Alps</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				No other reporting verbs work this way.<br />
				The name for this use of <em>should</em>, by the way, is <strong>
				the putative <em>should</em></strong>.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>if / whether </strong> </em><strong>clauses</strong></dt>
				<dd>The verbs <em>argue, ask, discuss, enquire / inquire, know, 
				remember, say, see</em> and <em>wonder</em> are often followed 
				by <em>if</em> or <em>whether</em> clauses.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary wondered if she was late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't remember whether he spoke French<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said whether it was allowed or not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We discussed whether to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They argued whether it was possible</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				The verb <em>forget</em> can also be used this way but its use 
				is rarer and more limited:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I have forgotten whether I invited her</em><br />
				The constraints on using these two conjunctions discussed above 
				still apply.

			<p>There are times when the source of something said or written is 
			obscure, unknown or unimportant and others when we wish to disguise 
			the source and in these cases a passive clause construction with the 
			dummy <em>it</em> comes to the rescue.<br />
			In academic texts the structure is also used to cite something so 
			well known in a field of enquiry that it needs no sourcing.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been suggested that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is often questioned whether ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been asked whether ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is generally reckoned that ...</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			These constructions are not difficult to teach and are 
			communicatively very useful ways of avoiding the need to say who 
			said or wrote something.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, we can use the same kind of passive construction 
			without the dummy pronoun when the source of what has been said or 
			written is unknown, absent or unimportant.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been told to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have often be accused of ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are said to be ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is reputed to be ...</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p>At other times, we may wish to emphasise the source of a 
			statement and the passive is also used in this way, of course, so we 
			may encounter, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been accused by Mary of ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been asked by the boss to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The comment has been made by the department head that ...</em><br />
			and so on.</p>

			<p>There is nothing very difficult about the form of reported speech

			and place to be authentic.</li>
			<li>You need to make sure that learners are aware of the common-sense issues and don't slavishly transform every utterance.</li>
			<li>Languages deal with the issues differently.&nbsp; Some, for 
			example, reserve a subjunctive tense for reported speech and some 
			hardly make any changes at all.</li>

			<p>Teaching the mechanics of indirect speech is not too challenging

			A sensible approach is to apply the analysis as above, focusing on 
			reporting declarative statements, yes-no questions, open, <em>wh-</em>questions, 
			exclamations, orders and so on separately before making any attempt 
			to combine ideas.</p>
		<p>Here's an idea for teaching indirect speech and still applying the 
		common-sense rules.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>
				<img alt="1" height="44" src="../../../gfx/step1.png" width="70" /></dt>
				<dd>Use a little task sheet like this:<table class="auto-style49">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style51" colspan="3"><em>Write three things 
				which are true about you now:</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style51">Your name: ________________</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style50">Always true</td>
				<td class="auto-style50">Example: <em>I like reading</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style50">Your sentence:</td>
				<td class="auto-style50">____________________________________</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style50">The past</td>
				<td class="auto-style50">Example: <em>I studied Italian at 
				school</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style50">Your sentence:</td>
				<td class="auto-style50">____________________________________</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style50">Tomorrow</td>
				<td class="auto-style50">Example: <em>I am having lunch at home 
				tomorrow</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style50">Your sentence:</td>
				<td class="auto-style50">____________________________________</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		Now collect all the papers and store them away for at least two days.</dd>
				<dt>
				<img alt="2" height="44" src="../../../gfx/step2.png" width="70" /></dt>
				<dd>Distribute the papers randomly but making sure the learners don't get 
		their own.<br />
		Now we come to the crux:<br />
		Statements like<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy classical music</em><br />
		can be reported in two ways (both correct):<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheena wrote that she enjoyed classical music</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheena wrote that she enjoys classical music</em><br />
		Other statements will need to be amended according to the rules of 
		deixis in English so we might get:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raoul wrote that he was going to the cinema the next day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michel wrote that he had eaten macaroni for lunch that day</em><br />
		etc.</dd>
			</dl>
		<p>Obviously, this is contrived and artificial to some extent but it is 
		personalised and situates the language temporally and spatially.&nbsp; 
		It is certainly better than meaningless sentence-transformation 
		exercises.</p>

					<h3>The word-order issue: <em>What was the question?</em></h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Because the word order when reporting questions and using a 
			number of the reporting verbs is a common source of error, it is 
			worth practising separately.&nbsp; Fortunately, the use of 
			back-shifting, even for virtually simultaneous reporting, is also 
			common so there is less need to set up delayed reporting.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>
				<img alt="1" height="44" src="../../../gfx/step1.png" width="70" /></dt>
				<dd>Focus on an area in which it will be natural to ask lots of questions.&nbsp; 
				Asking about the teacher's life experiences is a good way to begin so 
		that might evince questions like<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did you go to school?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you decide to be a teacher?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where have you taught?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you enjoy teaching?</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		Depending on the level of the learners a list of 20 or so things they 
		want to know about the teacher is not too ambitious.</dd>
				<dt>
				<img alt="2" height="44" src="../../../gfx/step2.png" width="70" /></dt>
				<dd>Once the learners, in pairs or individually, have their lists of things 
		they want to know and have properly formed questions they can ask them 
		in open class.&nbsp; Unfortunately, at this point, the teacher becomes 
		somewhat deaf and is forced to ask another student what the question was 
		so we get, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Petra: <em>Where did you train to be a teacher?</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher: <em>I didn't get that.&nbsp; What was the question, 
		Maria?</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria: <em>She asked you where you trained.</em><br />
		and so on.</dd>
				<dt>
				<img alt="3" height="44" src="../../../gfx/step3.png" width="70" /></dt>
				<dd>Now, in groups of three, the learners play the same game, deciding on 
		what things they want to know about the others in their group and having 
		one questioner, one slightly deaf responder and one reporter in each 
		trio.&nbsp; They all get a turn at playing each role.</dd>
			</dl>
		<p>Note that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You have to teach the forms before you can launch into this kind 
			of practice and</li>
			<li>The questions may well be mixes of <em>wh-</em>questions and 
			closed questions so the reporting will include formulations such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked you why you became a teacher</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked you if / whether you enjoy teaching</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can set up the task to exclude one or other type of question, of 
		course, but that's a lot less natural.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Reporting verbs in English need careful handling and there are a 
			number of issues:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Grammatical / Colligational</strong> issues<br />
				We saw above that these verbs vary considerably in the 
				constructions they can appear in.<br />
				When deciding on a set of reporting verbs to teach, therefore, 
				it makes sense to focus on those which are colligates and share 
				structural characteristics or we risk encouraging error rather 
				than helping our learners to avoid it.<br />
				The simplest way to start is to take common verbs which can be 
				followed by <em>that</em> clauses (i.e., most of them) before 
				getting into other complications.<br />
				Even at higher levels, it makes sense to select sets of verbs 
				which take the same structural forms in the following clauses.</li>
				<li><strong>Attitudinal</strong> issues<br />
				Above, we divided reporting verbs into three classes: tentative, 
				neutral and assertive.<br />
				While this is a rather crude categorisation (and the diagram was 
				meant to alert you to the fact that there is a cline rather than 
				a simple three-part division), it has some utility as far as 
				classroom approaches are concerned because it provides a 
				memorable hook on which to hang the verbs.</li>
				<li><strong>Stylistic</strong> issues<br />
				Some reporting verbs are rare and more formal in style or, 
				sometimes, rarer and quite colloquial.<br />
				We need, therefore, to alert learners to the stylistic 
				differences between, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enquired how he felt<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked how he was<br />
				</em>because learners need these kinds of data to be able to use 
				the words naturally.<br />
				We also need to remember the distinction between bridge and 
				non-bridge verbs and the effect of dropping or including <em>
				that</em>.</li>
