			The three guides in this area also deal with a number of issues covered in more detail

					<td class="auto-style2"><h2>Subordination <em>vs.</em> Coordination</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>This is the traditional analysis and one which you will find in 
			many teachers' grammars and those written for learners.&nbsp; It is 
			only accurate as far as it goes.</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Coordination involves the joining together of two 
				potentially independent clauses.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>
				<span class="style_black">I was unhappy and I left<br />
				I was unhappy but I stayed<br />
				She was unhappy so she left<br />
				She can stay or she can leave<br />
				</span>
				</em>
				<span class="auto-style27">Three</span> notes:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>In all these cases, the coordinating conjunction 
					(hereinafter simply <strong>coordinator</strong>) can be 
					replaced by <em>and</em> or removed altogether and leave two 
					independent clauses (although some sense is lost, the new 
					simple sentences remain comprehensible and grammatically 
					acceptable).<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was unhappy.&nbsp; I left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was unhappy and I left<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was unhappy.&nbsp; I stayed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was unhappy and I stayed<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was unhappy.&nbsp; She left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was unhappy and she left<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She can stay.&nbsp; She can leave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She can stay and she can leave</em></span></li>
					<li>It is not possible to move the coordinating conjunction 
					and an attempt to do so results in ungrammaticality:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *And I was unhappy I left<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*But I stayed I was unhappy<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*So she left she was unhappy<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*Or she can stay she can leave</em></span><br />
					The coordinator must come between the two clauses which are 
					being joined together to make a compound sentence.&nbsp; 
					Coordinators, in this sense, do not belong to either clause.</li>
					<li>The ordering of the clauses is often not reversible but 
					the restriction is semantic not grammatical.&nbsp; So, for 
					example, we can have:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She can 
					stay or she can leave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary drove and John took the train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We left early so we could catch the train</em></span><br />
					or<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She can 
					stay or she can leave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John took the train and Mary drove<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we could catch the train we left early</em></span><br /> with no change in meaning because the coordinators simply connect with no other semantic information grafted on.&nbsp; However, 
					the clauses in:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called but you were out<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came home and she made herself dinner</em></span><br />
					cannot be reversed without creating nonsense because in the 
					first case the coordinator represents an adversative meaning 
					and we have to know what it is being opposed to and in the 
					second the coordinator expresses the ordering of events.<br />
					It bears repeating, however, that this is not a structural 
					rule, it is a meaning issue.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Subordination, on the other hand, is an asymmetrical 
				relationship between two clauses with one, as the name suggests, 
				being subordinate to and relying on an independent clause for 
				its meaning.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I left because I was unhappy<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I stayed although I was unhappy<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She left since she was unhappy<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She can stay unless she wants to leave</span><br />
				</em>Two notes:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>Only one of the clauses can stand alone (i.e., function 
					independently) and make a grammatically acceptable sentence.<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>I left.&nbsp; *Because I was 
					unhappy.<br />
					I stayed.&nbsp; *Although I was unhappy.<br />
					She left.&nbsp; *Since she was unhappy.<br />
					She can stay.&nbsp; *Unless she wants to leave.</em></span></li>
					<li>The subordinating conjunction (hereinafter simply 
					<strong>subordinator</strong>) can be moved because it is an 
					adjunct and forms part of the subordinate clause so clause 
					ordering is flexible.<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>Because I was unhappy, I left<br />
					Although I was unhappy, I left<br />
					Since she was unhappy, she left<br />
					Unless she wants to leave, she can stay</em></span><br />
					With very rare exceptions (such as the subordinator <em>whereas</em>), 
					clause ordering is unaffected by semantic issues.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The difference between subordination and coordination can be very 
			simply illustrated like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="co- and sub-ordination" height="134" src="../../imagesgraphics/coordination_and_subordination.png" width="250" /></p>
			<p>If you have followed the guide to clause structure, linked at the 
			end, you will know 
			that an alternative analysis is to consider the whole sentence or 
			clause 
			as the matrix in which a subordinate clause or clauses can be 
			embedded.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="complicated" height="133" src="../../images/cogs_machinery200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2"><h3>It can get complicated</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>The structure of complex sentence (i.e., one involving 
			subordination rather than coordination) can be very complicated so 
			we may have, for example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style3"><em>She came home because the dogs needed 
			feeding but discovered that there was no food for them so she had to 
			go out to the supermarket and get some before she could relax in 
			order to finish the book she was reading so that she could take part 
			sensibly in the reading circle at the weekend.</em></p>
			<p>In that (made up) sentence there are instances of both 
			<span class="style_black">coordination</span> and 
			<span class="auto-style4">subordination</span>.</p>
			<p>An independent clause may itself be coordinated:<br />
			<em>
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came home and (she) cooked a huge meal </span>
			<span class="auto-style4">because she was so hungry</span></em><br />
			This has two coordinated independent clauses with the second having a 
			subordinate clause.&nbsp; It looks like this:<br />
			<img alt="1" height="163" src="../../imagesgraphics/co_and_sub1.jpg" width="250" /><br />
			and subordinate clauses may be coordinated, too:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came home and she cooked a huge 
			meal</em> </span>
			<span class="auto-style4">because she was so hungry</span><span class="style_black"> 
			and she hadn't eaten lunch</span><br />
			This has two coordinated independent clauses with the second having 
			a subordinate clause which is also coordinated.&nbsp; It looks like 
			this:<br />
			<img alt="2" height="174" src="../../imagesgraphics/co_and_sub2.jpg" width="250" /><br />
			and subordinate clauses can have their own subordinate clauses:<br />
			<em>
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came home and she cooked a huge meal </span>
			<span class="auto-style4">because she was so hungry since she hadn't 
			eaten lunch</span></em><br />
			This has two coordinated independent clauses with the second having 
			a subordinate clause which itself has a subordinate clause.&nbsp; It 
			looks like this:<br />
			<img alt="3" height="240" src="../../imagesgraphics/co_and_sub3.jpg" width="250" /></p>
			<p>and so on, <em>ad infinitum</em>.&nbsp; There is, in theory at 
			least, no limit to the number of clauses which a sentence may 
			contain.&nbsp; In practice the limit is provided by the brain's 
			ability to process information and that is usually around eight clauses.</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>Coordination and subordination are very often accomplished in 
			many languages with the use of conjunctions and that is what we have 
			exemplified so far.<br />
			However, the same grammatical functions can be achieved with other 
			structural resources.<br />
			Here is what is meant but for more detail you should go to the 
			guides dedicated to each area.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Non-finite verb forms</dt>
				<dd>Both participle forms and infinitive forms can achieve 
				coordination and subordination, usually the latter.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having no money he walked home (=Because 
				he had no money ...)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make sure it wouldn't come loose, he nailed it firmly in 
				place (=So that it wouldn't come ,loose ...)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Broken, the pump was no use to me (=As it was broken, ...)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Telling her that will make here angry (=If you tell her that 
				...)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working all night, he got it done (He worked all night and 
				...)</em></dd>
				<dt>Asyndetic coordination</dt>
				<dd>Coordination can be achieved without any conjunction at all 
				so we may have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tired, unhappy, depressed, he left his 
				home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spoken to, told what the problem was, he became a reformed 
				character<br />
				</em>Subordination is never asyndetic because the joined items 
				are not independent and equal.</dd>
				<dt>Relative pronoun clauses</dt>
				<dd>Relative pronoun clauses are often indicators of 
				subordination so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car, which broke down, made me late 
				(=Because the car broke down I was late)</em></dd>
				<dt>Relative adverb clauses</dt>
				<dd>Relative adverb clauses also subordinate:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She explained the issue and that was when 
				I realised my mistake (=When she explained the issue, I realised 
				my mistake)</em></dd>
				<dt>Conjuncts</dt>
				<dd>Conjuncts can be both subordinating, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was late and consequently missed his 
				speech (=She was late so ...)<br />
				</em>and coordinating, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't go out.&nbsp; Instead, she 
				worked on her essay (=She didn't go out but worked on her essay)</em></dd>
				<dt>Prepositions</dt>
				<dd>Many prepositions have a subordinating or coordinating 
				function.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eating, he went off to the cinema 
				(=After he had eaten ...)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the cooking, he cleaned the kitchen (=He 
				cooked and cleaned the kitchen)</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="right" height="166" src="../../images/sign_right250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2"><h2>The tendency to the right</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Clauses can be ordered in three main ways.&nbsp; If we take, for 
			example, a simple main clause and a subordinate clause, we can have:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>I asked my question when he paused for thought</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>in which we have the main clause followed by a subordinate time 
			clause linked with <em>when</em>.<br />
			But there are two other ways we can order the sentence:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2"><em>When he paused for thought I asked my question</em></li>
				<li><em>I asked, when he paused for thought, my question</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The three positions for the subordinate clause are described as 
			Final or Terminal (example 1), Initial (example 2) and Mid or Medial (example 3).</p>
			<p>In English, there are strong tendencies which control how we decide where to 
			place the subordinate clause in a sentence.&nbsp; This is the case, 
			however the subordination is achieved.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We cannot usually embed one subordinate clause within another in the initial 
			position so while we allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>I came</strong></span>
				<span class="style_red"><strong>because he invited me</strong></span>
				<span class="auto-style4"><strong>when he realised I would be alone 
			for Christmas</strong></span></em><br />where we have two subordinate clauses, one 
				<span class="style_red"><strong>red</strong></span> and one 
				<span class="auto-style4"><strong>green</strong></span> following the main clause in
				<span class="style_black"><strong>black</strong></span>, we cannot 
			usually embed the subordinate clauses and allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<span class="style_red"><strong>Because 
				<span class="auto-style4">when he 
			realised I would be alone for Christmas </span>he invited me</strong></span>
				<span class="style_black"><strong>I came<br /></strong></span>
				</em>It is possible to have both the subordinated 
			clauses in initial position as in:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>
				<span class="style_red"><strong>Because he invited me</strong></span>
				<span class="style_red"><strong><span class="auto-style4">when he 
			realised I would be alone for Christmas,</span></strong></span><strong>
				<span class="style_black">I came
			</span></strong></em><br />but that is quite rare and the longer 
			either or both of the subordinate clauses becomes, the more 
			difficult it is to understand the sentence.&nbsp; For example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<em><span class="style_red"><strong>Because he was kind and 
			generous enough to invite me </strong></span>
				<span class="auto-style4"><strong>when he realised that this would 
			be the first Christmas I was spending alone since my divorce</strong></span>,
				<span class="style_black"><strong>I came</strong></span></em><br />is very clumsy.</li>
				<li>It is also possible to place one subordinate clause within another 
			following the main clause, 
			thus embedding it as in:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><strong>I came</strong></span>
				<span class="style_red"><strong>because</strong></span><strong>,
				</strong><span class="auto-style4"><strong>when he realised I would 
			be alone for Christmas</strong></span><strong>, </strong>
				<span class="style_red"><strong>he invited me</strong></span></em><br />but 
			embedding a subordinate clause within another generally makes 
			comprehension difficult and is usually avoided.</li>
				<li>When there is no subordinating conjunction, the rules of English 
			syntax make it impossible to construct a complex sentence with two 
			subordinate clauses in the initial position so:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em><span class="style_red"><strong>Because he invited me</strong></span></em>
				<span class="auto-style4"><strong><em>realising I would be alone for 
			Christmas</em></strong></span> <span class="style_black"><em>
				<strong>I came</strong></em></span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The result of these restrictions is that the more complex a sentence becomes and the 
			more subordination it includes the stronger will be the tendency to 
			place subordinate clauses to the right of the main clause.<br />
			We may begin a sentence with a subordinate clause (and frequently 
			do) but any subsequent subordination will usually follow the main 
			clause and not precede it or be embedded within it.<br />
			If you prefer diagrams, 
			the structure of most complex sentences in English will either be:<br />
			<img alt="1" height="84" src="../../imagesgraphics/right_tending1.png" width="250" /><br />
			or<br />
			<img alt="2" height="84" src="../../imagesgraphics/right_tending2.png" width="250" /><br />
			</p>
			<p>Other arrangements are possible but much rarer and often very 
			difficult to understand.<br />
			This right-ordering tendency applies to English syntax and may not 
			be parallelled in your learners' first language(s).</p>

					<img alt="cline" height="166" src="../../images/buildings_cline250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2"><h2>Coordination <em>vs</em>.

				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>The difference between coordinator and subordinators is actually 
			a rather more complicated matter than the analysis so far has 
			revealed.</p>
			<p>It is tempting but ultimately misleading to make a sharp 
			distinction between coordination and subordination.&nbsp; The 
			reality of the English language is that there is a cline from the 
			conjunctions which may be considered central coordinators and those 
			which may be considered full subordinators only with some grey areas 
			in between concerning conjunctions which exhibit characteristics of 
			both.<br />
			There are a number of criteria for identifying the nature of 
			coordinators which are discussed in the guide to coordination.</p>
			<p>In some analyses, there are the following coordinating 
			conjunctions:<br />
			<em>
			and, or, but, for</em> (in its meaning of <em>because</em>), <em>yet, nor
			</em>and <em>so that.</em><br />
			All other conjunctions are subordinators, correlative or otherwise.<br />
			The guide to coordination makes it clear, however, that only <em>and</em>,
			<em>or</em> and <em>but</em> (probably) meet the criteria for true 
			coordinators and the rest are in some way defective.</p>
			<p>The true picture is more like:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="overlap" height="199" src="../../imagesgraphics/subordinator_coordinator_overlap.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			or:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="cline" height="124" src="../../imagesgraphics/coordination_subordination_cline_a.png" width="465" /></p>

					<td>
					<img alt="explain" height="133" src="../../images/man_explain200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2"><h3>To explain</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>
			The true coordinators are, arguably, only the words <em>and</em> and 
			<em>or</em> 
			because:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style28">
				<li>They remain immobile <strong>between</strong> clauses.<br />
				We can reverse the ordering of the clauses with <em>and</em>,
				<strong>providing</strong> there is no semantic prohibition 
				(which there usually is, in fact).&nbsp; That means that we 
				allow, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John visited to his mother and telephoned 
				his father</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John telephoned his father and visited 
				his mother</em><br />
				because it is unimportant to signal which action came first or 
				whether there was any logical, causal connection between the 
				clauses.<br />
				Usually, such reversal is not allowed because we cannot change<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John came home and cooked a meal</em><br />
				into:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John cooked a meal and came home</em><br />
				because it sends a very different message.<br />
				The conjunction <em>or</em> is rather more forgiving because it 
				does not usually signal the temporal ordering of events or any 
				causal connection so both:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John will take the train or rent a car</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John will rent a car or take the train</em><br />
				perform a synonymous (but slightly differently emphasised) 
				communicative function.<br />
				We cannot, however, move either conjunction to the beginning of 
				the sentence and have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *And cooked a meal John came home<br />
				or</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Or rent a car John will take the train</em></li>
				<li>Are never preceded by other conjunctions so we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *You can take the train because or the 
				bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She went to his house but and he was out</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>They allow us to omit the subject <strong>if it is the same 
				for both clauses</strong> so we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John came to the party and met her there</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John came to the party and he met her 
				there.</em><br />
				However, any alteration in the subject produces nonsense or 
				sends the wrong signal if one is omitted, so:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John came to the party and she spoke to 
				him there</em><br />
				has to retain the subjects because they differ so:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John came to the party and spoke to him 
				there</em><br />
				sends a very different message.</li>

			There are other tests to identify true or central coordinators which 
			are considered in the guide devoted to them, linked below.&nbsp; 
			Here's the sort of things that is meant:</p>
			<p>The causal coordinators <em>for</em> and <em>so that </em>share 
			the first two of these characteristics but not the third because we 
			can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't suggest it for I knew she would 
			object</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was getting light so that I could see the 
			mountains</em><br />
			but we cannot allow<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *For she would object I didn't suggest it</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *So that I could see the mountains it was 
			getting light</em><br />
			because the conjunctions are immobile between clauses (1. above)<br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I didn't suggest it because for she would 
			object</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It was getting light and so that I could see 
			the mountains</em><br />
			because the conjunctions cannot be preceded by another (2. above).<br />
			However, we also do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I didn't suggest it for knew she would 
			object</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It was getting light so that could see the 
			mountains</em><br />
			because the conjunctions require the subject in both clauses.<br />
			The adversative coordinator<em> but</em> does allow the omission of 
			the subject as in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked everywhere but (I) couldn't see her</em></p>
			<p>
			See the dedicated guide linked below for more on the restrictions on 
			coordinators in particular.</p>

			English is slightly unusual in having no fewer than 6 causal 
			conjunctions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em><strong>because</strong></em><br />
				As in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was late because his train was

				<li><em><strong>so</strong></em><br />

				As in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was late as his train was delayed</em></li>
				<li><em><strong>since</strong></em><br />
				As in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was late since his train was delayed</em></li>
				<li><em><strong>for</strong></em><br />
				As in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was late for his train was delayed</em></li>
				<li><strong><em>so that</em></strong><br />As in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John's train was delayed so that he was late</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			There are, however, some obvious differences:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>style</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em>because</em> and <em>so</em> are neutral in style, 
					both being used to signal causality in everything from 
					casual speech to the most formal writing.</li>
					<li><em>as</em> and <em>since</em> are generally more formal 
					and the latter is falling rapidly out of fashion, being 
					confined to its grammatical functions of preposition and 
					adverb.&nbsp; The conjunction <em>as</em> is also unusual in 
					this use because it, too, often functions as a temporal 
					subordinating conjunction (akin to <em>when</em>) and as an 
					adverb or even a relative pronoun.</li>
					<li><em>so that</em> is rare as a resultative conjunction and is 
					mostly confined to its purposive meaning (akin to <em>in 
					order to</em>).</li>
					<li><em>for</em> is the most formal of these and is now 
					limited in this use to formal writing for the most part.</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>structure</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em>because</em> and <em>as</em> are the most mobile and 
					we can accept:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because his train was delayed, John was late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was late because his train was delayed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because John's train was delayed, he was late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As his train was delayed, John was late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was late as his train was delayed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As John's train was delayed, he was late</em></li>
					<li><em>so</em> is less mobile because it lies at the 
					coordinating end of the cline and when the clauses are 
					reversed, generally produces nonsense so while:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His train was delayed so John was 
					late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John's train was delayed so he was late</em><br />
					are both acceptable, we do not allow:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *So John was late, his train was delayed</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *So he was late, John's train was 
					delayed<br />
					</em>because the word's coordinating rather than 
					subordinating characteristics tie it to the central 
					position.<br />
					(When the word operates to signal <strong>purpose</strong> 
					rather than result, it acts as a subordinating conjunction 
					and moves with its clause.)</li>
					<li><em>so that</em> is a coordinator <strong>only</strong> 
					and cannot be used as a subordinator.&nbsp; Moreover, its 
					use is mostly confined to a purposive subordinator.&nbsp; As 
					a coordinating, causal conjunction, we can allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His train was delayed so that John 
					was late</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John's train was delayed so that he 
					was late</em><br />
					which is slightly unusual because coordinating conjunctions 
					do not, on the whole, allow both directions of referencing 
					for a pronoun.<br />
					We do not allow reversal of the clauses because that then 
					implies the purposive role for the conjunction and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that he was late, John's train was 
					delayed</em><br />
					can only mean that someone deliberately delayed the train to 
					make John late.<br />
					(In the latter, subordinating and non-resultative, purposive role, 
					it is quite flexible so we can allow, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I glued it so that it wouldn't move<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that it wouldn't move, I glued it</em>)</li>
					<li><em>for</em> is also a coordinator <strong>only</strong> 
					and cannot be used as a subordinator.&nbsp; Therefore, we 
					allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was late for his train was 
					delayed</em><br />
					but we do not allow the reversal of the clauses such as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *For his train was delayed, John was 
					late</em><br />
					because coordinators always lie <strong>between</strong> the 
					clauses, or any other formulations such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was late for John's train was 
					delayed</em><br />
					because most coordinators <strong>only</strong> allow 
					anaphoric pronoun reference (see below).</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>There is a range of other ways to signal cause and effect in 
			English, including non-finite clauses such as <em>seeing that</em> 
			and complex prepositions such as <em>as a result of, on account of</em> 
			and so on.&nbsp; Here, we are only concerned with conjunctions but 
			if you'd like to learn more, try the guide to cause and effect, 
			linked below.</p>

			<p>
			When subordinators are used, pronoun reference can work both forward 
			in the text (cataphoric) and backwards (anaphoric) so we allow, for 
			example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Because she was angry, Mary argued </em>(reference &rarr;)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Because Mary was angry, she argued </em>(reference ←)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Although he arrived late, John didn't miss the speeches
			</em>(reference &rarr;)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Although John arrived late, he didn't miss the speeches</em> 
			(reference ←)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>When he arrived at the station, Fred saw the train had 
			already left</em> (reference &rarr;)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>When Fred arrived at the station, he saw the train had 
			already left </em>(reference ←)</p>
			<p>
			However, true coordinators only allow anaphoric reference so, while 
			we allow:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary was unhappy and she argued</em> (reference ←)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John arrived late but he didn't miss the 
			speeches</em> (reference ←)<br />
			we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She argued and Mary was unhappy</em><br />
			unless <em>she</em> and <em>Mary</em> refer to different people, or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't miss the speeches but John arrived late</em><br />
			unless <em>he</em> and <em>John</em> refer to different people.</p>
