			<p>A prepositional phrase has two parts: <span class="style_black">

			complement</span>.&nbsp; There are five kinds of prepositional 
			complement.&nbsp; Can you identify them in the following examples?&nbsp; 
			The preposition is <span class="style_black">in black</span> and 
			the complement is <span class="style_brown">in this colour</span>.&nbsp;

				(accusative) case:</strong><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please keep this between you and me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't talk to her</em></li>
				<li><strong>a </strong> <em><strong>wh-</strong></em><strong> clause

				<em><span class="style_black">by</span>
				<span class="style_brown">what I've heard</span>,

				<span class="style_brown">losing his keys<br />
				</span> </em>etc.<br />
				Arguably, this is sometimes a case simply of a verb acting as a 
				noun and a subset of the examples in point 1.</li>
				<li><strong>an adverb or adverb phrase complement</strong>:<em><span class="style_black"><br />
				from</span> here to 
				there, <span class="style_black">until</span> very recently<br />
				</em>etc<em>.<br />
				</em>Only adverbs of place and time can function as complements 
				in prepositional phrases and even then there are clear 
				restrictions.<em><br />
				</em>The guide to adverbs has much more on how certain adverbs 
				co-occur restrictively with certain prepositions.</li>
				<li><strong>another prepositional phrase complement</strong>:<em><span class="style_black"><br />
				out from</span> <span class="style_brown">under the car</span>,
				<span class="style_black">until</span> <span class="style_brown">
				after my graduation<br />
				</span> </em>etc<em>.</em></li>
			</ol>
				<p>We <strong>cannot</strong> have a <em>that</em>-clause 
			or an infinitive clause as the complement of a preposition so we 
			can't say, e.g.<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I understand from that he told me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He came in by to break open the window<br />
			</em>etc<em>.<br />
			</em>Other languages do things differently and that accounts for a good 
			deal of error.&nbsp; Simply telling learners this little fact can be 
			most helpful.</p>

				<h2>A slightly different way to analyse prepositional phrases</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Some functional approaches to grammar analysis take a slightly 
			different view of the prepositional phrase.</p>
			<p>The analysis is that most phrases can be described as an expanded 
			version of the Head of the phrase.<br />
			For example, in this sentence:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The cautious old man spoke slight hesitantly at the 
			meeting</em><br />
			the noun phrase, <em>The cautious old man</em>, can be analysed as 
			the Head (<em>man</em>) being expanded by the pre-modifying 
			adjectives and the determiner.<br />
			In the same way, the verb phrase, <em>spoke slightly hesitantly</em>, 
			can be analysed as the Head (the verb <em>spoke</em>) expanded by 
			the post-modifying adverbs.&nbsp; Strictly, a verb phrase contains 
			only verb forms, of course, but this matters little here.<br />
			However, the prepositional phrase cannot be analysed in exactly the 
			same way because the phrase <em>at the meeting</em> is not a simple 
			expansion of the Head (<em>at</em>) but may be better considered as 
			the preposition plus its object (<em>the meeting</em>).<br />
			In this way, prepositional phrases function more like small clauses 
			than phrases <em>per se</em>.</p>
			<p>We do not follow that analysis here, staying with the word <em>
			complement</em> to refer to the object of the preposition but it is 
			worth explaining, albeit briefly.</p>

				<h2>Blurring at the edges: borderline cases of word class</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Some words can only function as prepositions and present no 
			serious comprehension or use issues.&nbsp; They include:<br />
			<em>against, among, at, bar, barring, beside, despite, during, 
			except, following, from, including, into, like, minus, of, per, 
			plus, to, toward(s), upon, via</em> and <em>with</em>.</p>
			<p>Other words with dual or triple class membership can be problematic.&nbsp; 
			The first group includes most prepositions not in the list above 
			because simply removing the complement results in an adverbial use.&nbsp; 
			It may be argued that the elision of the complement leaves the 
			prepositional nature of the word intact.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They met outside the pub</em><br />
			which is prepositional and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We can't smoke inside</em><br />
			which is adverbial, with<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was still walking up the mountain while they were 
			already walking down</em><br />
			where the first use is prepositional but in which the second use is
			<span class="style_underline">either</span> prepositional (with an 
			implied complement of <em>it</em> or <em>the mountain</em>)
			<span class="style_underline">or</span> adverbial (with no 
			complement).<br />
			We have, therefore:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Words which can function both as prepositions and adverbs, 
				for example:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>They came <span class="style_black">aboard</span> </em>(adverb)<br /><em>They aren't aboard the boat</em> (preposition)</li>
					<li><em>She drove <span class="style_black">past</span></em> (adverb)<br /><em>She drove 
					<span class="style_black">past</span> my house</em> (preposition)</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Words which can function as prepositions, adverbs or 
				conjunctions:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>They had met <span class="style_black">before</span></em> (adverb)<br /><em>They spoke 
					<span class="style_black">before</span> the meeting</em> (preposition)<br />
					<em>They spoke <span class="style_black">before</span> the chairman opened the meeting</em> 
					(conjunction)</li>
					<li><em>I haven't seen him <span class="style_black">since</span></em> (adverb)<br /><em>She has waited 
					<span class="style_black">since</span> the summer 
					</em>(preposition)<br /><em>I'll tell you, 
					<span class="style_black">since</span> you ask</em> (conjunction)</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Words which can function as prepositions or conjunctions:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>I bought it <span class="style_black">for</span> $400</em> (preposition)<br />
					<em>You can't speak yet <span class="style_black">for</span> questions are only allowed at 
					the end</em> (conjunction)</li>
					<li><em>She dressed <span class="style_black">as</span> Cleopatra</em> (preposition)<br />
					<em>She asked <span class="style_black">as</span> she needed to know the answer</em> 
					(conjunction)</li>
					<li><em>She smiled <span class="style_black">like</span> a 
					cat </em>(preposition)<br />
					<em>They did it <span class="style_black">like</span> they 
					were told </em>(conjunction)</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>A few words which span other word classes:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>He walked <span class="style_black">through</span> the park </em>(preposition)<br />
					<em>I'm not <span class="style_black">through</span> yet</em> (adjective)</li>
					<li><em>The <span class="style_black">opposite</span> meaning </em>(adjective)<br /><em>Leave it on the 
					<span class="style_black">opposite</span> side 
					</em>(adjective)<br /><em>I placed it 
					<span class="style_black">opposite</span> the mirror</em> (preposition)</li>
					<li><em>It was an <span class="style_black">inside</span> job</em> (adjective)<br /><em>I left it 
					<span class="style_black">inside</span></em> (adverb)<br />
					<em>The <span class="style_black">inside</span> is painted red </em>(noun)<br /><em>It's 
					<span class="style_black">inside</span> the house</em> (preposition)</li>
					<li><em>She came to a <span class="style_black">like</span> 
					conclusion</em> (adjective)<br />
					<em>There was a fish <span class="style_black">like</span> 
					smell in the house</em> (adverb)<br />
					<em>We put <span class="style_black">like</span> with like
					</em>(noun)<br />
					<em>It looked just <span class="style_black">like</span> it 
					did in the brochure</em> (conjunction)<br />
					<em>I had a house <span class="style_black">like</span> the 
					one over there </em>(preposition)<br />
					<em>I <span class="style_black">like</span> that</em> (verb)</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Some prepositions lie on the borderline between prepositions 
			proper and conjunctions or adverbs and in these cases, the distinctions become blurred.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em><strong>in that</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>looks like a preposition phrase and, what's more, like an 
				exception because we have <em>in</em> followed by a <em>that</em>-clause 
				as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has an advantage, 
				<span class="style_black">in that</span> she speaks 
				both languages</em><br />
				It is, in fact, a rather unusual conjunction meaning <em>because</em> 
				or <em>for the following reason</em> and is better analysed that 
				way.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>but / bar</strong></em></dt>
				<dd><em>but</em> is usually analysed as a conjunction and that is 
				its function in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called but you were out</em><br />
				However, the word also has prepositional characteristics and can 
				be followed by an infinitive as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did nothing <span class="style_black">
				but</span> work<br />
				</em>and it can be followed by a noun phrase or pronoun quite 
				normally as a preposition in, for example:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone came <span class="style_black">but</span> the Smiths<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody wants to go <span class="style_black">but</span> her<br />
				</em>We saw above that prepositions are followed by pronouns in 
				the object case and here the distinction becomes even more 
				blurred because<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody <span class="style_black">but</span> her knew the 
				truth</em><br />
				is acceptable and prepositional although<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody but she knew the truth</em><br />
				is also acceptable but not prepositional because the pronoun is 
				in the subject case.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody knew the truth but she did</em><br />
				The preposition <em>bar</em> follows the same patterns and also 
				means <em>except for </em>as in, for example:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's all over <span class="style_black">bar</span> the 
				shouting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the people <span class="style_black">bar</span> Mike and 
				John were satisfied</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>than</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>functions as a conjunction in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spends more than he can afford<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's more expensive than I hoped</em><br />
				but can also be prepositional as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is taller <span class="style_black">
				than</span> me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's more <span class="style_black">than</span> 5 miles from 
				here<br />
				</em>The prepositional use allows an infinitive complement, with 
				and without <em>to</em> as in, for example:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is better to call by <span class="style_black">than</span> 
				to 'phone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd prefer to stay <span class="style_black">than</span> go</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>except</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>also functions as a conjunction in for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to come except I had no money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't hurt except when I'm very tired</em><br />
				in which case it means roughly <em>but</em>, and in common with
				<em>but</em> can also be used prepositionally in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone one came <span class="style_black">except</span> 
				Julian</em><br />
				and, like <em>but</em>, can be followed by an infinitive<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She does little <span class="style_black">
				except</span> sleep</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>as well (as)</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>is an adverb (an additive adverbial adjunct to be precise) 
				in many circumstances as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It snowed a little and rained as well</em><br />
				and can also function as what is sometimes called a 
				quasi-coordinating conjunction in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He writes novels as well as contributing 
				to the newspaper</em><br />
				but the phrase is also prepositional in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll paint the door as well as the window 
				frames</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>instead</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>is an adverb conjunct in for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want to go swimming.&nbsp; 
				Instead, I'll stay in and read.<br />
				</em>but combined with <em>of</em>, the word is a preposition as 
				in<br />

			<p>This is another large category but, in fact, only three 
			prepositions are common in these phrases.&nbsp; They all express the 
			notion of having an attribute.&nbsp; Some examples:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>The woman <span class="style_black">with</span> 
				<span class="style_brown">red 
				hair</span></em></li>
				<li><em>A man <span class="style_black">of</span> 
				<span class="style_brown">honour</span></em></li>
				<li><em>A girl <span class="style_black">without</span> 
				<span class="style_brown">humour</span></em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Prepositional phrases with <span class="style_black"><em>without</em></span> 
			and <span class="style_black"> <em>with</em></span> are frequently a form of relative clause.&nbsp; 
			Compare<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man <span class="style_black">with</span> a grudge<br />
			</em>with<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man who has a grudge<br />
			</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman
			<span class="style_black">without</span> any money<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
			woman who has no money</em>.<br />
			You can't do that with phrases with <span class="style_black"><em>of</em></span> 
			(and they are less common).&nbsp; The <span class="style_black"><em>
			of</em></span>-phrases are normally only used with abstract 
			properties so we can have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman 			<span class="style_black">of</span> great determination<br />
			</em>but not<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A woman <span class="style_black">of</span> beautiful hands</em>  
			etc.</p>
			<p>Many other types of prepositional phrases can act as post-modifiers, often stating where or when something is.&nbsp; For 
			example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>The house <span class="style_black">on</span>
				<span class="style_brown">the corner</span></em></li>
				<li><em>The meeting <span class="style_black">on</span>
				<span class="style_brown">Monday</span></em></li>
				<li><em>The girl <span class="style_black">in</span>
				<span class="style_brown">the queue</span></em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are some prepositions which appear to be verbs because they 
			end in -<em>ing</em>, but aren't.&nbsp; They include:<br />
			<em>concerning, considering, excepting, excluding, failing, 
			following, including, notwithstanding, pending, regarding, 
			respecting</em> and <em>saving</em>.<br />
			They are troublesome because they occur in constructions which look 
			like reduced relative clauses but for which there is no 
			corresponding -<em>ing</em> form in the relative clause or for which 
			no relative clause at all can be constructed with a parallel 
			meaning.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>He wrote a letter concerning his complaint</em><br />
				which cannot be re-phrased as<br />
				<em>*He wrote a letter which was concerning his complaint</em></li>
				<li><em>Everyone arrived excepting only the Jones family<br />
				We will wait pending your answer<br />
				He responded following the same format<br />
				</em>for none of which can a corresponding relative clause can 
				be constructed</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The confusion arises because formulations using non-finite 
			clauses to post-modify the noun such as</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>A car resembling hers</em></li>
				<li><em>A tie matching his shirt</em></li>
				<li><em>A meal consisting of beans and potatoes</em><br />
				etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>can all be re-phrased as relative clauses although the -<em>ing</em> 
			form of these verbs is not always available:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>A car which resembled hers</em></li>
				<li><em>A tie which matches his shirt</em></li>
				<li><em>A meal which consists of beans and potatoes</em></li>
			</ul>

			<p>We need to be slightly careful in deciding what exactly a 
			prepositional phrase is modifying or our hearers can misinterpret 
			what we mean.<br />
			For example, the sentence:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Jane spoke to the man behind the bar</em><br />
			can be understood in two ways, like this:<br />
			<img alt="ambiguity" height="78" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituents_preposition.jpg" width="400" /><br />
			In the first sentence, the <strong>verb</strong> is being 
			post-modified and tells us where she spoke so the modified verb 
			phrase is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>spoke ... behind the bar</em><br />
			In the second sentence, the <strong>noun</strong> is being 
			post-modified and the object noun phrase is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the man behind the bar</em><br />
			When the first sense is intended, speakers will insert a slight 
			pause between <em>the man</em> and <em>behind the bar</em>, making 
			two tone units each with a stressed syllable: <em>the </em><strong>
			<em>man</em></strong> and <em>behind the </em><strong><em>bar</em></strong>.<br />
			When the second sense is intended, <em>the man behind the </em>
			<strong><em>bar</em></strong> will constitute a single tone unit 
			with one stressed syllable.&nbsp; (For more, see
			the links at the end.)</p>

			<p>Prepositional phrases can themselves be modified with adverbial 
			phrases.&nbsp; The modification always precedes the phrase.<br />
			Prepositional phrases of time and place are most commonly (i.e., 
			not solely) the ones we can modify.<br />
			The modifiers are adverbials (and nearly always simple adverbs) and serve to amplify or tone down the 
			phrase.&nbsp; They are, in other words, intensifiers.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>His explanation went <strong>completely</strong>
				<span class="style_black">over</span> <span class="style_brown">my head</span>.</em></li>
				<li><em>His house is <strong>far</strong>
				<span class="style_black">off</span> <span class="style_brown">
				the road</span></em></li>
				<li><em>They came <strong>dead</strong>
				<span class="style_black">on</span> <span class="style_brown">

				<li><em>They were <strong>very nearly</strong>
				<span class="style_black">on</span> <span class="style_brown">time</span>.</em></li>
				<li><em>The bullet went <strong>clean / clear</strong>
				<span class="style_brown">through the window</span>.</em></li>
				<li><em>It's <strong>almost directly</strong>
				<span class="style_black">opposite</span> 
				<span class="style_brown">the station</span>.</em></li>
				<li><em>The meeting started <strong>shortly</strong>
				<span class="style_black">after</span> <span class="style_brown">6 o'clock</span>.</em></li>
				<li><em>The film started <strong>long</strong>
				<span class="style_black">after</span> <span class="style_brown">
				the advertised time</span></em></li>
				<li><em>They didn't arrive until <strong>way</strong>
				<span class="style_black">after</span> <span class="style_brown">
				midnight</span>.</em></li>
				<li><em>The man spoke <strong>purely</strong>
				<span class="style_black">in</span> <span class="style_brown">his own interests</span>.</em></li>
				<li><em>That's a comment <strong>very much </strong>
				<span class="style_black">out of</span> 
				<span class="style_brown">order</span> here.</em></li>
				<li><em>The came <strong>well</strong> <span class="style_black">
				before</span> <span class="style_brown">time</span>.</em></li>
				<li><em>We looked <strong>all</strong> <span class="style_black">
				over</span> <span class="style_brown">the town</span> for a 
				replacement.</em></li>
				<li><em>My house is <strong>right</strong>
				<span class="style_black">behind</span>
				<span class="style_brown">the school</span></em>.</li>
				<li><em>He planted the seeds </em><strong><em>wide</em></strong>
				<span class="style_black"><em>apart from</em></span>
				<span class="style_brown"><em>the others</em></span></li>
				<li><em>That's <strong>wide</strong> <span class="style_black">
				of</span> <span class="style_brown">the mark</span></em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The last example is a fixed idiom with <em><strong>wide</strong></em> 
			deriving from archery.&nbsp; In this case, it is adjectival rather 
			than adverbial but behaves a little like a prepositional phrase in 
			itself.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His estimate was wide of the real cost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The actual quantity was wide of the amount we wanted</em></p>
			<p>There is a slightly grey area here.<br />
			Prepositional phrases are, as we see above, normally only 
			pre-modified.&nbsp; However, in sentences such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The science of black holes is <span class="style_black">over</span>
			<span class="style_brown">my head</span> <strong>entirely</strong></em>.<br />
			it appears that the prepositional phrase <em>over my head</em> is being 
			post-modified by the intensifying adverb <em>entirely</em>.<br />
			The argument here is that it isn't only the prepositional phrase 
			that is being modified but the whole preceding clause that is being 
			modified by the adverb (it is, in other words, a disjunct or 
			sentence adverbial).<br />
			The same consideration applies to, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Wholly</strong> <span class="style_black">in</span>
				<span class="style_brown">my opinion</span>, this is the wrong 
				way to proceed.</em></p>

				<h2>The position of prepositional phrases</h2>

		</table>
			<p>Syntactically, where prepositional phrases come in a clause 
			depends to a large extent on the function they are performing.<br />
			They can come at the beginning, in the middle or at the end (called 
			initial, medial and final positions in the trade).<br />
			Here's how it usually works:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Prepositional phrases modifying nouns<ol class="auto-style82">
					<li>These normally post-modify and follow the noun phrase 
					immediately as in, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man<span class="style_brown"> in the corner<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					</span>The cars <span class="style_brown">on the road</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bus 
					<span class="style_brown">at ten past 
						six</span></em></li>
					<li>When there are two or more noun phrases, the 
					prepositional phrases modify them in the same way; i.e., the 
					phrase modifies the immediately preceding noun.&nbsp; 
					This means that people will understand them that way so, for 
					example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The man walking the dog
						<span class="style_brown">with red hair</span></em><br />means the dog had red hair but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The man <span class="style_brown">with red hair
						</span>walking the dog</em><br />means the man had red hair.</li>
					<li>The position of the prepositional phrase can lead, as we 
					saw, to ambiguity.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He used the computer <span class="style_brown">at his office</span></em><br />can mean either<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>While he was in his office, 
						he used the computer</em><br />or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He used the computer which was in his office<br />
					</em>Because the prepositional phrase so strictly follows the 
						noun phrase, the normally interpretation with be the 
						second one.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Prepositional phrases as adverbial adjuncts<ol class="auto-style82">
					<li>When the phrase is modifying the verb and integral to 
					the clause, it usually comes immediately after the verb 
					phrase or its object.&nbsp; That is its commonly unmarked (i.e., having no 
					special emphasis) position.&nbsp; Like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She saw him <span class="style_brown">at the hotel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They met <span class="style_brown">on Monday</span></em></li>
					<li>To deal with the possible ambiguity issue, the 
					prepositional phrase is often moved to the initial or final 
					position as we saw above.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>His friends <span class="style_brown">at that time</span> were working</em><br />which could be a phrase modifying the friends (i.e., 
						they were friends then but not now) or an adjunct 
						modifying the verb phrase <em>were working </em>(i.e., telling us 
						when they were working)<br />with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">At that time</span>, 
						his friends were working</em><br />or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>His friends were working 
						<span class="style_brown">at that time</span></em><br />both of which can only be interpreted as prepositional 
						phrases modifying the verb (i.e., adverbial adjuncts) 
					and refer to the time the friends were working.</li>
					<li>When they are marked in some way, however, the phrase is 
					often elevated to the initial position.&nbsp; This is common in 
					written English because the phrase cannot be marked by 
					stress or intonation as it can in spoken texts, so word 
					ordering is the only option.&nbsp; In writing, the phrase is 
					separated from the rest of the clause by a comma; in 
					speaking, by a slight pause after the phrase.&nbsp; 
					E.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">At the hotel</span>, she saw him</em> (i.e., nowhere else)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">On Monday</span>, they met</em> (i.e., not on any other day)</li>
					<li>When the prepositional phrase is an adjunct <strong>very</strong> 
					closely connected to the verb as in, e.g., a verb of 
					movement and its destination or a prepositional verb, the 
					prepositional phrase is rarely moved to the initial 
					position unless some heavily marked meaning is intended:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Mary marked the house <span class="style_brown">on the map</span><br />
					<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the map</span> Mary marked the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They jumped <span class="style_brown">over the wall</span><br />
					<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the wall 
					</span>they jumped</em></li>
					<li>Placing a comma or a pause in spoken language, after the 
					prepositional phrase produces a slightly different meaning:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">Over the wall</span> they jumped</em><br />emphasises what was jumped over<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">Over the wall</span>, they jumped</em><br />means that they were 
					already over the wall and then jumped.</li>
					<li>The medial position is also possible for adverbial 
					adjunct prepositional phrases but there is a need to be 
					careful to avoid ambiguity and the phrases usually have to 
					be separated by commas or pauses in speaking.&nbsp; For example:<ol class="auto-style83">
						<li>After the subject:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dave, </em><span class="style_brown"><em>at the moment</em></span><em>, 
						is too busy to do it</em></li>
						<li>After the verb phrase and its complement:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dave is too busy, </em><span class="style_brown"><em>at the moment</em></span><em>, 
						to do it</em></li>
						<li>After the auxiliary verb or operator<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dave is, </em><span class="style_brown"><em>at the moment</em></span><em>, 
						too busy to do it</em></li>
						<li>Between the object and its complement:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dave did it, </em><span class="style_brown"><em>on the whole</em></span><em>, rather 
				badly</em></li>
						<li>Finally:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dave is too busy to do it </em><span class="style_brown">
						<em>at the moment</em></span></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Prepositional phrases as conjuncts<ol class="auto-style82">
					<li>Because the function of a conjunct is to provide a 
					connection between clauses, the preferred position is the 
					initial one for the second clause or sentence.&nbsp; We get, for 
					example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He refused to come with us.&nbsp; 
						<span class="style_brown">Without him</span>, we 
						had a lot more fun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last pair played very well.&nbsp; 
						<span class="style_brown">But for that</span>, 
						we would have lost the match</em></li>
					<li>Prepositional phrases as disjuncts</li>
					<li>Disjunct prepositional phrases, expressing the speaker / 
					writer's attitude or a viewpoint, normally come in the 
					initial position but can take the final position.&nbsp; For 
					example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">To my disappointment</span>, the weather turned cold and wet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather turned cold and wet, 
						<span class="style_brown">to my 
						disappointment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From my point of view</span>, that's a poor idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a poor idea, <span class="style_brown">from my point of view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the study of language</span>, the word 'register' is 
						used in a special sense<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word 'register' is used in a special sense, 
						<span class="style_brown">in 
						the study of language</span></em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Multiple prepositional phrases<ol class="auto-style82">
					<li>When a clause contains more than one adverbial adjunct prepositional 
					phrase, they are usually ordered in relation to how closely 
					connected they are to the verb phrase and its object.&nbsp; So, for 
					example, we get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She spoke to him <span class="style_brown">in French after dinner</span></em><br />rather than<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She spoke to him </em><span class="style_brown"><em>after dinner in French</em></span><br />because the language she spoke in is more closely 
						connected to the verb than the time she did the speaking, or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He walked <span class="style_brown">across the park in the rain</span></em><br />rather than<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He walked <span class="style_brown">in the rain across the park</span></em><br />because where he walked is more closely connected to the 
						verb than the weather conditions.</li>
					<li>An alternative positioning is to use one prepositional 
					phrase initially and keep the most closely connected 
					phrase in the final position following the verb phrase and 
					its object, if any, as 
					in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">After dinner</span>, she spoke to him 
						<span class="style_brown">in 
					French</span></em><br />or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">In the rain</span>, he walked 
						<span class="style_brown">across the 
					park</span></em></li>

			precise times (<em><span class="style_black">at</span> 16:15,
				<span class="style_black">at</span> 9</em> etc.)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are 
			exceptions, notably <span class="style_black"><em>at</em></span><em> 
			night</em> (reserving <span class="style_black"><em>in</em></span> 
			for other parts of the day) and <span class="style_black"><em>at
			</em></span><em>the weekend</em>.<br />However, if we use referencing (i.e., deictic) words like 
			<em>next, 
			last, this, after next, before last</em> etc., we can drop the 
			preposition.&nbsp; We get, therefore, for example</p>
			<p class="auto-style17"><em>I'm seeing her (the) Monday after next<br />We met (the) January before last<br />I'll come next week<br />I saw him last Thursday<br />We married that month / year etc.</em></p>
			<p>We also do this when we quantify the noun in some way: e.g.</p>
			<p class="auto-style17"><em>I take some Mondays off<br />I work every afternoon<br />I have a meeting most weeks etc.</em></p>
			<p>Informally, we can also drop the preposition on days of the week: 
			e.g., <em>I'll see you Monday</em>.</p>

			<p>No analysis for teaching purposes like this one would be complete 
			without some consideration of how other languages address the issue 
			of saying where and when an event took place or a state existed.&nbsp; 
			The term to use here is adposition rather than speaking loosely of 
			prepositions as we shall discover.</p>
			<p>English, as we saw above prefers prepositions inasmuch as the 
			Head of a phrase is followed by its complement rather than preceded 
			by it.&nbsp; That is why they are called <strong><em>pre</em></strong>-positions, 
			of course.<br />There are two other ways to order the data in languages around the 
			world and many opt for one or other.&nbsp; Here's what is meant:<br />In English we have a phrase such as 
			<span class="style_black"><em>on 
			the table</em></span>.&nbsp; This will translate into a variety of 
			languages in the same ordering so we have, e.g.:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style79">
				<tr>
					<td>Swedish</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>på bordet</em></td>
					<td>French</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>sur la table</em></td>
					<td>German</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>auf dem Tisch</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Spanish</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>en la mesa</em></td>
					<td>Bulgarian</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>на масата</em></td>
					<td>Greek</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>πάνω στο τραπέζι</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Polish</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>na stole</em></td>
					<td>Russian</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>на столе</em></td>
					<td>Swahili</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>juu ya meza</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Scots Gaelic</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>air a 'bhòrd</em></td>
					<td>Albanian</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>mbi tavolinë</em></td>
					<td>Igbo</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>ke okpokoro</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>and so on.&nbsp; In all these languages, and hundreds more, the 
			adpositional phrase is left headed.&nbsp; That is to say that the 
			head of the phrase, what we can call in English and these languages 
			the preposition, lies to the left.<br />Most South-East Asian languages, such as Thai, Lao, Vietnamese and 
			Khmer are also left headed.</p>
			<p>That is not the only way to order the elements and many languages 
			are right headed so the adposition lies to the right with the noun 
			phrase complement or object preceding it.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style79">
				<tr>
					<td>Basque</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>mahai gainean</em></td>
					<td>Turkish</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>masanın üstünde</em></td>
					<td>Somali</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>miiska dushiisa</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Estonian</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>laua peal</em></td>
					<td>Japanese</td>
					<td class="auto-style80">テーブルの上に</td>
					<td>Finnish</td>
					<td class="auto-style81"><em>pöydällä</em>&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Kasakh</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>үстелдің үстінде</em></td>
					<td>Korean</td>
					<td class="auto-style80">책상 위에</td>
					<td>Kyrgyz</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>столдун үстүндө</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>all of which translate, approximately, as <em>the table on</em>.<br />Other languages which are right headed include: Telugu, Marathi, 
			Hindi, Kannada, Gujarati (and nearly all other Indian languages), 
			many African languages, almost all Austronesian languages and many 
			North and South American languages.<br />There are few, quite limited, examples of postpositions in English 
			including, expressions such as <em>the whole day through</em>.&nbsp; 
			Other expressions in which it appears that English is using 
			postpositions are usually better analysed as either adverbs as in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<em>from that day <span class="style_black">on</span></em>(<em>wards</em>)<br />or as elided complements as in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<em>the church <span class="style_black">opposite</span></em> 
			(<em>me, you, us</em> etc.)</p>
			<p>A third way of ordering things is one used by a smaller number of 
			languages, albeit with very large numbers of speakers.&nbsp; These 
			languages use what is known as circumpositions, splitting the 
			adposition in two with one element preceding the noun phrase and one 
			following it.&nbsp; Most Chinese languages do this although 
			postpositions are also common and prepositions occur, too, so the 
			languages are often classified as having no canonical or default 
			ordering of the elements.<br />Circumfixing adpositions is also common in Pashto and other Iranian 
			languages.</p>
			<p>Here's a summary:<br />
			<img alt="summary" height="360" src="../../imagesgraphics/adposition_summary.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>A rare form of adpositioning is one used by some Austronesian 
			languages in which the particle is placed within the noun phrase 
			itself.&nbsp; These are, rather obviously, referred to as 
			inpositions.</p>
			<p>The implications for learners of non-left-headed-language 
			backgrounds are obvious.</p>
