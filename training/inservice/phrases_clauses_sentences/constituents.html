			<p>The trick is to decide, in this case, whether the prepositional 
			phrase, <em>in room 13</em>, is a constituent in its own right, in 
			which case Interpretation 2 applies, or whether it forms a part of 
			the constituent noun phrase, <em>the boy in room 13</em>, in 
			which case Interpretation 1 applies.</p>
			<p>If you prefer a diagram, it looks like this.&nbsp; The subject 
			noun phrase is in green, the verb phrase and accompanying adverbial in blue and the object noun 
			phrase in red.&nbsp; The question to answer is<br />
			<strong><em>Does the prepositional phrase tell us about the verb (in 
			which case it is an independent constituent) or does it modify the 
			noun (in which case it forms part of the constituent noun phrase)?</em><br />
			<img alt="constituents" height="85" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituents7.png" width="465" /></strong></p>
			<p>If you yearn for a neat technical term for this kind of 
			phenomenon, it's called syntactic ambiguity.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="ambiguity" height="166" src="../../images/directions_giving250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style8"><h2>Levels of ambiguity</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>There are many times, of course, when no, or very little, 
			ambiguity exists and in these cases we can normally rely on our 
			intuition to decide what qualifies as an independent constituent.&nbsp; 
			For many learners, intuition alone is not always enough so 
			we need to be clear in our presentation.<br />
			At other times, various levels of ambiguity exist.&nbsp;
			For example:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><em>John upset the lady in the red dress</em><br />
				Here, it seems reasonable to suppose that the constituent (in 
				this case the object noun phrase, <em>the lady in the red dress</em>) 
				cannot be broken into two elements or we end up with the 
				unlikely, but just possible:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the red dress, John upset the lady<br />
				</em>which means that John was wearing the red dress.&nbsp; That 
				is not a conclusion to which people would naturally come on 
				hearing / reading the sentence with no other context so the 
				level of ambiguity is quite low.&nbsp; The reason for this is 
				purely semantic: the fact that, generally speaking, it is 
				unusual for people called John to wear dresses.<br />
				However, the level of ambiguity is higher when semantic issues 
				are stripped out and we consider:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John upset the lady in the garden</em><br />
				in which we truly do not know, without context to help, whether 
				the lady whom John upset is identified as being the one in the 
				garden or whether the place in which John upset her was the 
				garden.</li>
				<li><em>He cut down the tree in the corner</em><br />
				Here, too, the noun phrase, <em>the tree in the corner</em>, 
				logically forms a single constituent but a small change can 
				introduce a degree of ambiguity as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cut up the tree in the corner</em><br />
				in which we cannot be sure whether it was <em>the tree in the 
				corner</em> that he cut up or the place where he cut up the 
				tree was <em>in the corner</em>.</li>
				<li><em>She promised to talk to the boss today</em><br />
				When verbs come in pairs like this (i.e., they are catenative) 
				some ambiguity concerning the direction of the adverbial is 
				created.&nbsp; This sentence could mean:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, she promised to talk to the boss</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some other time, she promised to talk 
				to the boss today</em><br />
				so, we need to disentangle whether the adverbial is modifying
				<em>promise</em> or <em>to talk</em>.</li>
				<li><em>He read his book on the train</em><br />
				Here, we intuitively identify four constituents:<br />
				<em>He</em> (the subject noun phrase)<br />
				<em>read</em> (the verb phrase)<br />
				<em>his book</em> (object noun phrase)<br />
				and<br />
				<em>on the train</em> (prepositional phrase)<br />
				so it is logical to form, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the train, he read his book</em><br />
				Again, however, a small change can produce some ambiguity as to 
				what we understand as the constituents, as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read his book on the philosopher</em><br />
				where our intuition is not that he rested his book on a 
				philosopher but that <em>his book on the philosopher</em> forms 
				a single constituent noun phrase telling us what the book was 
				about, rather than where he read it.<br />
				It is wholly impossible, without context, to decide if<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read his book on the island</em><br />
				means <em>the island </em>was where he read the book or the 
				subject of the book was <em>the island</em>.</li>
				<li><em>They provided more accurate figures</em><br />
				You may have understood this to mean one of two possibilities:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figures they provided were more 
				accurate than the existing ones</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figures they provided were accurate 
				and additional to the accurate ones already existing</em><br />
				In spoken language, there would be a very slight pause after <em>
				more</em> (which would also be stressed) to signify the second 
				meaning.&nbsp; The first meaning would be signified by no 
				pausing and the stress falling on <em>accurate</em> rather than
				<em>more</em>.<br />
				The issue here is whether <em>more</em> is an adverb modifying 
				the adjective <em>accurate</em> (the first meaning) or whether 
				it is a determiner relating to the noun phrase <em>accurate 
				figures</em> (the second meaning).&nbsp; The key to unravelling it, which cannot be 
				done from the written form, is to see whether the object is <em>
				figures</em> (the first meaning) or <em>accurate figures </em>
				(the second meaning).</li>
				<li>From CNN news:<br /><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<em>We are now actively investigating the Trump Organization 
				in a criminal capacity, along with the Manhattan DA," ... Fabien 
				Levy told CNN.</em></span><br />which has two prepositional phrases:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a criminal capacity</em><br />and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with the Manhattan DA</em><br />and it takes the reader a moment to figure out that the 
				sentences should be:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We, along with the Manhattan DA, are now actively 
				investigating the Trump Organization in a criminal capacity</em><br />or it reads as if the Manhattan DA is being investigated rather 
				than being part of the investigating team.<br />
				<span class="auto-style89">(https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/18/politics/new-york-attorney-general-trump-organization-criminal-probe/index.html, 
				[accessed 21 May 2021])</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is not only noun and prepositional phrases which need to be disambiguated.&nbsp; 
			The same phenomenon of trying to decide what belongs where can occur 
			with verb phrases:&nbsp; For example, the sentence:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; The people who came quickly got lunch</em><br />
			has two interpretations:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The verb phrase is <em>came</em>, with the modifying 
				adjunct,<em> quickly</em>, in which case we 
				have:<br />
				<img alt="1" height="34" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituents_verb_phrase1.png" width="310" /></li>
				<li>The verb phrase is <em>got</em>, pre-modified by the 
				adverbial, <em>quickly</em>, in which case we 
				have:<br />
				<img alt="2" height="34" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituents_verb_phrase2.png" width="310" /></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The only way that can properly be disambiguated is by pausing in 
			speech after <em>quickly</em> (and signalling sense 1.) or after <em>
			came</em> (and signalling sense 2.).<br />
			In writing, only  rephrasing the sentences will completely remove 
			the ambiguity although inserting commas (after <em>quickly</em> and
			<em>came</em> respectively) may help.&nbsp; Moving the adverb 
			settles the matter but for many, <em>quickly came</em> sounds 
			clumsy.&nbsp; We might  rephrase, then, as:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>The people who were quick to arrive got lunch</em></li>
				<li><em>The people who came got lunch quickly.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you can see, the situation is not at all obvious so we need to 
			have some tests to determine which phrases in a clause actually form 
			independent constituents.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="testing" height="166" src="../../images/test_tubes250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style8"><h2>Testing for constituents</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>There are a number of tests we can apply to see if our intuitions 
			about what is really an independent constituent and what is a phrase 
			forming part of a constituent are correct.<br />
			Authorities vary on how many of 
			these tests there are and whether they are all valid but we will 
			content ourselves with six well known ones and a seventh which is 
			based on grammatical analysis.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="links" height="133" src="../../images/link_anchor_chain250.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style8"><h3>Test 1: joining another 
					constituent (the coordination test)</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Depending on the function of the phrase, we have to use a 
			different sort of language if we want to add to the phrase in 
			question.&nbsp; 
			For our example:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><em>The teacher shouted at </em><span class="style_black">
				<em>the boy in room 13</em></span><em> 
				and </em><span class="style_red"><em>all his friends</em></span><em>
				</em>(this follows interpretation 1)</li>
				<li><em>The teacher shouted at the boy</em><span class="style_black"><em> 
				in room 13</em></span><em> and </em><span class="style_red"><em>
				in the corridor</em></span> (this follows 
				interpretation 2)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the first case, we have to add another noun phrase (<span class="style_red"><em>all 
			his friends</em></span>) to perform the same function and in the 
			second case we have to add another prepositional phrase (<span class="style_red"><em>in 
			the corridor</em></span>) to perform the same function.</p>
			<p>We can do this, too, with some of the examples above and extend a 
			sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read his book on the island</em><br />
			to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read his book on the island 
			<span class="style_red">and its people</span></em><br />
			where it becomes obvious that the subject of the book is in 
			question, not where he read it so the object noun phrase is <em>his 
			book on the island and its people</em>.</p>
			<p>Extending other constituents is also revealing, so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read his book on the island
			<span class="style_red">and on the way home</span></em><br />
			makes it clear where the reading took place so <em>on the island</em> 
			can only be interpreted as a prepositional phrase which is a 
			constituent in its own right.<br />
			It is also possible to have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cut up the tree in the corner 
			<span class="style_red">and the old 
			shed</span></em><br />
			so we know that what he cut up was <em>the tree in the corner and 
			the old shed </em>
			and that in the corner does not refer necessarily to where the 
			cutting took place.&nbsp; But,<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He cut up the tree in the corner <span class="style_red">
			near the garage</span></em><br />
			makes it clearer that we are talking about position.</p>
			<p>However, this test will not work with one of the examples above 
			because:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They provided more accurate figures</em><br />
			can be extended as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They provided more accurate figures 
			<span class="style_red">and lots 
			of other information</span></em><br />
			but we still do not know whether <em>more</em> is an adverb 
			modifying <em>accurate</em> or a determiner relating to <em>accurate 
			figures</em>.</p>

			<p>When we make a passive, we keep constituents together.&nbsp; For 
			our main example, two passive sentences are possible and they reveal 
			which interpretation is the right one:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><em><span class="style_red">The boy in room 13</span> was shouted at (by the teacher) </em>
				(interpretation 1)</li>
				<li><em><span class="style_red">The boy</span> was shouted at (by the teacher) 
				<span class="style_red">in room 13</span> </em>
				(interpretation 2)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Again, we can apply this test to the sentences we used above and 
			disambiguate the meaning by converting:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read his book on the island<br />
			</em>to<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_red">His book on the island</span> was read</em><br />
			which refers to the subject of the book, or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style_red"> His book</span> was read 
			<span class="style_red">on the island</span></em><br />
			which refers to where it was read.<br />
			It is also possible to convert:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He cut up the tree in the corner</em><br />
			to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_red">The tree in the corner
			</span>was cut up<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_red">The tree</span> was cut up
			<span class="style_red">in the corner</span></em><br />
			so we know that what he cut up was <em>the tree in the corner </em>
			in the first and where it was cut up in the second.</p>
			<p>However, again, this test will not work with one of the examples 
			above, because, although:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They provided more accurate figures</em><br />
			can be rendered as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More accurate figures were provided </em>(<em>by 
			them</em>)<br />
			we still do not know whether <em>more</em> is an adverb 
			modifying <em>accurate</em> or a determiner relating to <em>accurate 
			figures</em>.</p>

			<p>There are a number of ways to make a cleft sentence (there's
			a guide on this site, linked below in the list of related guides at 
			the end) 
			but one example will do to show how the results differ depending on 
			the nature of the phrase.&nbsp; This is called an <em>it</em>-cleft, 
			incidentally.</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><em>It was<span class="style_red"> the boy in room 13</span> that was shouted at by the 
				teacher </em>
				(interpretation 1)</li>
				<li><em>It was <span class="style_red">in room 13</span> that 
				<span class="style_red">the boy </span>was shouted at by the 
				teacher </em>
				(interpretation 2)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>This will also work as a test for some of the other examples so, 
			for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cut up the tree in the corner</em><br />
			can be rendered as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was <span class="style_red">the tree in the corner</span> 
			that he cut up</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was<span class="style_red"> in the corner</span> that he cut up 
			<span class="style_red">the tree</span></em><br />
			and in the first case we know the object noun phrase is <em>the tree 
			in the corner </em>but in the second it is simply <em>the tree</em> 
			and <em>in the corner</em> refers to where the cutting took place.</p>
			<p>We can also render<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read his book on the island</em><br />
			as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was <span class="style_red">on the island</span> that he read 
			<span class="style_red">his book</span></em><br />
			and as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was <span class="style_red">his book on the island</span> that he read</em><br />
			which succeeds in disambiguating the sentence.</p>
			<p>Other <em>wh</em>-cleft forms can be used so we can also 
			disambiguate with, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where he read his book was on the island<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What he read on the island was his book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where he cut up the tree was in the corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What he cut up was the tree in the corner</em></p>
			<p>Making a cleft also disentangles the ambiguity caused by 
			catenating verbs and our example above:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She promised to talk to the boss today</em><br />
			can be clarified by making either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was today that she promised to talk to the 
			boss</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What she promised today was to talk to the 
			boss</em></p>
			<p>Unfortunately, this test will also not work again with:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They provided more accurate figures<br />
			</em>because<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was more accurate figures that they 
			provided</em><br />
			can have exactly the same dual meaning.</p>

			<p>We can, of course, form questions from our first example sentence but, 
			depending on the nature of the constituents, the questions and 
			answers will 
			differ:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><em>Who was shouted at by the teacher?&nbsp;&rarr;
				<span class="style_red">The boy in room 13</span> </em>
				(interpretation 1)</li>
				<li><em>Where was the boy shouted at by the teacher? &rarr;
				<span class="style_red">In room 13 </span> </em>(interpretation 2)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>This test will work to disambiguate:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He read his book on the island</em><br />
			because the two questions are<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; What did he read?&nbsp;→ <span class="style_red">His book on 
			the island</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did he read his book?&nbsp;→ <span class="style_red">On the 
			island</span></em></p>
			<p>And<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cut up the tree in the corner<br />
			</em>also generates two questions:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did he cut up?&nbsp;→ <span class="style_red">The tree in 
			the corner</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did he cut it up?&nbsp;→ <span class="style_red">In the 
			corner</span></em></p>
			
			<p>This test will not necessarily disambiguate issues caused by 
			catenative verbs so from:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She promised to talk to the boss today</em><br />
			we can make two questions<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When did she promise to talk to the boss?</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did she promise?</em><br />
			and both arrive at the same answer with the ambiguity still present 
			because the <em>wh-</em>question word can apply to either verb.</p>
			<p>This is the first test that will partially disambiguate:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They provided more accurate figures</em><br />
			because there are two possible questions:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; What did they provide?&nbsp;→ <span class="style_black">More</span> <span class="style_red">
			accurate figures</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sort of figures did they provide?&nbsp;→ <span class="style_red">More 
			accurate ones</span></em><br />
			but we still do not know in the first answer whether <em>more</em> is an adverb 
			modifying <em>accurate</em> or a determiner relating to <em>accurate 
			figures</em> so disambiguation is not fool proof.</p>

			<p>Pro-forms include many pronouns but the one we select will depend 
			on how we have understood the constituent parts of the sentence.&nbsp; We 
			can have, therefore:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><em>The teacher shouted at <span class="style_red">him</span></em>
				(interpretation 1)</li>
				<li><em>The teacher shouted at the boy <span class="style_red">

			</ul>
			
			<p>This will also work as a test for some of the other examples so, 
			for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cut up the tree in the corner</em><br />
			can be rendered as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cut <span class="style_red">it </span>up in the corner</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cut the tree up <span class="style_red">there</span></em><br />
			and in the first case we know the object noun phrase is <em>it</em> 
			(<em>the tree in the corner</em>) but in the second it is 
			simply <em>the tree</em> and <em>there </em>refers to where the 
			cutting took place.</p>
			<p>We can also render<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read his book on the island</em><br />
			as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read his book <span class="style_red">there</span></em><br />
			and as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read <span class="style_red">it </span>on the island</em><br />
			which succeeds in disambiguating the sentence.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, this test will also work with:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They provided more accurate figures<br />
			</em>because, although<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They provided <span class="style_red">them</span></em><br />
			can have exactly the same dual meaning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They provided <span class="style_red">more</span></em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They provided more accurate <span class="style_red">ones</span></em><br />
			does partially disambiguate because in the first <em>more</em> is

			more</em> in the last example.</p>

			<p>Certain types of phrases allow fronting (i.e., moving to the 
			start of the sentence).&nbsp; We can have, therefore:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><em><span class="style_red">The boy in room 13</span> (whom) 
				the teacher shouted at </em>(interpretation 1)</li>
				<li><em><span class="style_red">In room 13,</span> the teacher 
				shouted at <span class="style_red">the boy</span> </em>(interpretation 
				2)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>We can apply this test to the sentences we used above and 
			disambiguate:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read his book on the island</em><br />
			by moving the prepositional phrase:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_red">On the island</span> he read his book</em><br />
			which can only refer to where it was read.</p>
			<p>It is also possible to have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_red">In the corner</span> he cut the tree up<br />
			</em>so we know that what he cut up was <em>the tree </em>
			and the prepositional phrase provides the location.</p>
			<p>However, again, this test will not work with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They provided more accurate figures</em><br />
			because we cannot move any constituent to the front unless we make a 
			cleft or a passive (see above) which do not disambiguate, as we saw.</p>

					<td class="auto-style8"><h3>Test 7: Grammatical gradience</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>A problem we have identified so far lies with the example of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They provided more accurate figures</em><br />
			which is ambiguous because of the indeterminate function of the word
			<em>more</em>:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>If it is an adverb, then it is modifying the adjective <em>accurate</em> 
			and the sentence refers to the figures being more accurate than the 
			existing ones.</li>
				<li>If it is a determiner, then it must be modifying the phrase 
				<em>accurate figures </em>and the sentence means that they provided 
			additional, equally accurate, figures.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We have also seen that none of the tests we apply wholly successfully 
			disambiguates the sentence.<br />We can, however, apply a special test in this case and recognise 
			that the word <em>more</em> itself is the root of the problem, not 
			the constituents of the phrase in which it resides, because it slips 
			between word-class categories (in this case, adverb to determiner 
			but we also saw that it can be a pronoun).&nbsp; The indeterminate 
			nature of some words regarding their word class is an example of 
			gradience.</p>
			<p>The simple way is to use an alternative and render the sentence as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They provided additional accurate figures</em><br />which can only be interpreted as their providing accurate figures in 
			addition to the existing accurate ones.</p>
			<p>By the same token, we can  rephrase  the sentence using the adjective 
			predicatively as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figures they provided were more accurate</em><br />which can only mean that 
			<em>more</em> is being used as an adverb to 
			modify the adjective and that the existing figures were less 
			accurate.<br />We can also note that we can substitute the determiner 
			<em>more</em> 
			in a predicative form as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The (accurate) figures they provided were 
			additional</em></p>
			<p>The word <em>less</em> suffers from the same categorical 
			indeterminacy so<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want less expensive work done</em><br />can be interpreted as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want less work which is expensive</em> <em>done</em><br />or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want cheaper work</em> <em>done</em><br />Rephrasing is the only option available successfully to disambiguate 
			the sense.&nbsp; That can be achieved by the use of a relative 
			pronoun clause, like this:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They provided figures that were more accurate<br />
			</em>or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I want work which is less expensive done<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want less work which is expensive done</em></p>

			</table>
			
			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>Not all of the first six tests can always be applied because English 
			resists certain types of structure.&nbsp; For example, using <em>who</em> 
			in cleft sentences is not normally allowed (<em>*Who the teacher 
			shouted at was the boy in room 13</em>).<br />
			However, if we can apply two or more of these tests and come 
			up with grammatically acceptable forms, then we have, almost 
			certainly, successfully identified the real constituent phrases.</p>
			<h3>Problems</h3>
			<p>Constituent analysis works very neatly when the constituents know 
			their places and keep to them.&nbsp; For our main example sentence, we 
			can draw two tree diagrams to show the interpretations we can 
			put on the clause.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style27">
					<img alt="interpretation 1" height="290" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituents1.png" width="465" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style26">
					<img alt="interpretation 2" height="290" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituents2.png" width="481" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>On the left, you'll note, the Object noun phrase is a single 
			constituent and on the right, it is made up of two independent 
			constituents.&nbsp; So, Interpretation 1 is that the object of the 
			verb is <em>the boy in room 13</em> and Interpretation 2 is that the 
			object of the verb is <em>the boy</em> with additional adverbial 
			information concerning where the event took place.<br />
			We can refine the analysis by going down a step and analysing the 
			Verb phrase as Verb + Past marker + Prepositional particle and analysing the 
			object noun phrases more carefully as Determiner + Noun etc. but for 
			our purposes here, we won't.<br />
			Unfortunately, constituents don't always know their places and move 
			around as discrete units.&nbsp; Take for example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Did the teacher shout at the boy in room 13?</em></li>
				<li><em>The teacher woke the boy in room 13 up</em></li>
				<li><em>The teacher woke the boy up in room 13</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In these case, the verb phrases have become separated by the noun 
			phrases and the tree diagrams now look very messy if we try to draw 
			them so we are reduced to having something like:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="constituents" height="306" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituents6.png" width="500" /></p>
			<p>because traditional branching tree diagrams just won't work.</p>
			<p>For more concerning this and other objections to constituent 
			analysis, see the guide to 
			Chomsky and transformational functional grammar, linked below.</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>In spoken English, constituents can often be identified by the 
			fact that speakers tend, unless they are speaking very quickly, to 
			insert a slight pause between phrases they perceive as constituents 
			and to create a nuclear stress on each sense or tone unit.<br />
			We can compare our two original interpretations of <em>The teacher 
			shouted at the boy in room 13</em> and split the clause in two 
			possible ways:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style28">
				<li>|| <em>The teacher </em>| <span class="style_black"><em>
				shouted at</em></span> | <span class="style_red"><em>the <strong>boy</strong> in 
				room 13</em></span> ||<br />
				and</li>
				<li>|| <em>The teacher</em> | <span class="style_black"><em>
				shouted at</em></span> | <em><span class="style_red">the <strong>boy</strong></span>
				</em>| <span class="style_brown"><em>in room <strong>13</strong></em></span> ||</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In a., a speaker will tend to keep the rhythm of the sentence 
			intact with the voice tone falling towards the end.<br />
			In this case, the sentence forms a single tone unit with the nucleus 
			on <strong><em>boy</em></strong> and an unstressed tail, <em>in room 
			13</em>.<br />
			In b., by contrast, most speakers will insert a very slight pause 
			between <em>the boy</em> and <em>in room 13</em> and add an 
			additional stress on <em>13</em>.<br />
			In this case there are two tone units, the first with a nucleus on
			<em><strong>boy</strong></em> and the second with a nucleus on <em>
			<strong>13</strong></em>.<br />
			This is by no means easy for learners to hear without a good deal of 
			practice (and is not consistent across all speakers) but it can be 
			illustrated with something like:</p>
			<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>a.&nbsp;</td>
					<td>
					<img alt="1" height="80" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituentintonation1.png" width="300" /></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>b.&nbsp;</td>
					<td>
					<img alt="2" height="86" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituentintonation2.png" width="300" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In the case of b., there is a stress on <strong><em>13</em></strong> but that is 
			absent in case a.<br />
			For more, see the 
			guide to sentence stress, linked below.</p>

			<p>The first thing to note is that languages will have different 
			ways of ordering the constituents of sentences and will even have 
			different tests for identifying constituents so it's not the case 
			that learners can simply transfer their intuitions from their first 
			languages to English.&nbsp; That's one reason we get errors such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *In the room with energy worked the people<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*The working in the factory people<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I like reading and play tennis<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*He looked the children after</em></p>
			<p>The ability to recognise what is and is not a constituent phrase 
			allows learners to develop a sense for what can qualify as the 
			subjects, verbs and objects in sentences and set up mental templates 
			for how acceptable sentences are constructed.&nbsp; This may help 
			them avoid, e.g.:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li class="redbullet"><em>In the corner the person is 
				staring at me </em>(instead of <em>The person in the corner is 
				staring at me</em>)<br />
				This kind of error can be shown up by applying almost any of the 
				tests above and avoiding producing, e.g.<ul class="greybullet">
					<li><em>*It's in the corner that the person is staring at me<br />
					</em>noting that<br /><em>It's the person in the corner who is 
					staring at me<br />
					</em>is the correct interpretation</li>
					<li><em>*I'm being stared at in the corner by the person<br />
					</em>noting that<br /><em>I'm being stared at by the person in the 
					corner<br />
					</em>is meaningful</li>
					<li><em>Where is the person staring at me?<br />
					</em>noting that<br /><em>Who is staring at me?<br />
					</em>is the correct question form</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="redbullet"><em>I don't know her who is wearing the 
				red dress</em> which can be avoided by looking at the natural 
				pro-form:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li><em>I don't know her</em><br />
					or the full form of three constituents (subject pronoun, 
					verb phrase, object noun phrase)</li>
					<li><em>I don't know the woman who is wearing the red dress</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Perversely (to some), one simple way of doing this and getting 
			your learners to recognise what the constituents of a clause 
			actually are is to use precisely the sorts of messy diagrams we saw 
			above.&nbsp; For example, using:<br />
			<img alt="example constituents" height="87" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituents4.png" width="500" /><br />
			can alert people visually to the fact that the verb-phrase 
			constituent comes in two parts and the object noun-phrase 
			constituent is not just <em>the boy</em> but <em>the boy in room 13</em>.<br />
			Contrasting that diagram with:<br />
			<img alt="example constituents" height="87" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituents5.png" width="500" /><br />
			can alert people to the fact that now the prepositional phrase is an 
			independent constituent which has a separate meaning and can be 
			moved around to give<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In room 13, the teacher woke the boy up</em>.<br />
			The obvious follow-up exercise is to get your learners to draw their 
			own block diagrams to show which bits of the clause do what.&nbsp; 
			How complex and interesting these are is dependent on the level of 
			the learners, of course, but a few suitable candidates are:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waited on the platform near the entrance for the train 
				for London</em><br />
				in which the issue is whether there are two constituent 
				prepositional phrases or whether <em>the platform near the 
				entrance</em> is a constituent noun phrase in itself.&nbsp; 
				Compare:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the platform near the entrance, he waited for the train

				with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the platform, he waited near the entrance for the train

				with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the platform, he waited for the train to London near the 
				entrance</em></li>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hit the man with a gun<br />vs.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shot the man with a gun<br />vs.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stabbed the man with a gun<br />
				</em>in which the obvious issue is whether <em>the man with a 
				gun</em> is the constituent noun phrase or whether <em>with a 
				gun</em> is a prepositional phrase telling us about the 
				instrument she used.</li>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They left the money on the table</em><br />
				subject + verb + object + prepositional phrase or subject + verb 
				+ object noun phrase?<br />
				To check the concept, ask:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did they put the money on the table?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Did they take the money?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Did they have the money when they arrived?</em></li>

			<p>The sentence stress and intonation issue mentioned above is probably not something 
			with which you will wish to trouble learners at lower levels but 
			with more advanced learners, the ability to hear the slight pause 
			gives valuable information concerning the speaker's understanding of 
			what is and is not a constituent of the clause.<br />
			For more, see the 
			guide to sentence stress.</p>
			<p>The final important issue is that doing a little constituent 
			analysis on the target language we have in mind to teach will often 
			pay dividends and prevent us from falling into some obvious traps 
			and actually inducing errors.</p>
