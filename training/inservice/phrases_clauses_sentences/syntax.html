			<h1>Syntax: what it is and why we need to know about it</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="syntax" height="207" src="../../images/seven_beads310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Many of the guides on this site are to do with syntax, i.e., the 
			way words are combined in a language (English will be our focus) to 
			make well-formed phrases, clauses and sentences.<br />
			Syntax has been studied in one way or another for thousands of years 
			and there are active scholars today spending honourable and long 
			careers studying just how syntax operates.&nbsp; This is a short(ish) 
			guide to the area for English language teachers and has no ambitions 
			to be an original contribution to the topic.<br />
			The relationships to which the term syntax refers are syntagmatic 
			and, before we begin, we need to discover just what that means.&nbsp; 
			Both terms derive from the Greek <em>syntaxis</em> which means a <em>
			putting together or in order</em>.</p>

			<p>Take the sentence:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>He bought a hat.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>In this sentence,<em> hat</em> can be replaced by almost any noun but it <strong>must</strong> 
		be a noun or a noun phrase.&nbsp; Likewise,
		<em>bought</em> can be replaced by many verbs but they <strong>must</strong> 
		be verbs or a verb phrase.&nbsp; So we can get, e.g.:</p>
		<ol start="2">
			<li><em>He sold a hat.</em></li>
			<li><em>He bought a car.</em></li>
			<li><em>He stole a gadget.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Syntagmatic relationship</strong></dt>
			<dd>This describes the relationship between, e.g., <em>He, bought</em> 
			and <em>a hat </em>in <strong>Sentence 1</strong>, <em>He, sold</em> and
			<em>a hat</em> in <strong>Sentence 2</strong>, <em>He, bought</em> 
			and <em>a car</em> in <strong>sentence3 </strong> and <em>He</em> and <em>stole</em> 
			and <em>a gadget</em> in <strong>Sentence 4</strong>.<br />
			These relationships work horizontally between words.&nbsp; Subjects 
			use Verbs, Verbs sometimes take Objects, Adjectives modify Nouns, 
			Adverbs modify Verbs and so on.&nbsp; The relationship is to do with
			<strong>syntax</strong> (hence the name).</dd>
			<dt><strong>Paradigmatic relationships</strong></dt>
			<dd>These are exemplified by the changes we have made between the 
			sentences and describe the relationships between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bought, sold </em>and <em>stole</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; car, gadget </em>and <em>hat<br />
			</em>These relationships work vertically in the sense that Noun 
			phrases can be replaced by other Noun phrases, Verb phrases by other 
			Verb phrases, Adjectives by other Adjectives, Adverbs by other 
			Adverbs and so on.&nbsp; The relationship is to do with <strong>word 
			and phrase class</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
			<p>It all works like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="relationships" height="226" src="../../imagesgraphics/syntagmatic.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>The words <strong>in</strong> each box have paradigmatic relationships to each 
			other.&nbsp; The red <strong>arrows</strong> show the syntagmatic relationships 
			and it is those with which this guide is concerned.<br />
			It is simple to see that we can combine the seven words in each 
			section in many thousands of ways, not all of which will make sense 
			but all of which will grammatically flawless.</p>

					<h2>Human language and the power of syntax</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>One of the defining characteristics of language rather than mere 
			communication is that it is rule bound.&nbsp; All human languages 
			combine sounds into morphemes, morphemes into words, words into phrases 
			and phrases into clauses according to abstract and 
			often very complex rules.&nbsp; To see what this means, take these 
			five words:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>unicorn</em></li>
				<li><em>woman</em></li>
				<li><em>a</em></li>
				<li><em>the</em></li>
				<li><em>saw</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are in mathematical theory 120 ways in which these words 
			can be combined (expressed as 5! for the mathematicians among you) yet, in English, only four of the possibilities are 
			normally permitted with the remaining 116 forming combinations which 
			are not allowed by the rules of English syntax.&nbsp; (If we add one 
			more word, the possible combinations grow to 720, adding a seventh 
			results 5040 possibilities and an eighth brings the total up to 
			40,320 but of those only a very small proportion of combinations are 
			allowed by the rules of English syntax.)<br />
			If you want to try combining the 5 words into well-formed sentences for yourself do so now.&nbsp; Otherwise, 
			click
			<img alt="eye" class="auto-style2" height="16" src="../../../gfx/eyeopen.gif" width="16" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'first',0,'style.visibility','visible')" /> 
			to reveal the four possibilities.</p>
			<div id="first" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
			<p>They are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>A unicorn saw the woman</em></li>
				<li><em>The unicorn saw a woman</em></li>
				<li><em>The woman saw a unicorn</em></li>
				<li><em>A woman saw the unicorn</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>(It is, just, possible also to have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The unicorn, saw a woman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman, saw a unicorn</em><br />
			but neither of those sentences is likely to be the topic of our 
			teaching and even if we allow them, that still leaves only six out 
			of 120 possible combinations which are permissible in English.)<br />
			So, syntax severely restricts what is possible.</p></div>
			<p>However, at the same time it does exactly the opposite: using the
			<strong>finite</strong> number of rules of syntax, we can create an
			<strong>infinite</strong> number of acceptable, grammatical 
			sentences.&nbsp; To demonstrate the power of syntax to create as 
			well as restrict, consider the following possible sentences:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old woman in the red hat saw a contented 
			unicorn in her garden yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My contented unicorn saw an old woman in a red hat in its 
			garden last week<br />
			</em>Now, it is a reasonable bet that neither of those sentences has 
			ever been said or written before now.&nbsp; Not rarely, never.<br />
			Nevertheless, the assumption here is that you will have no 
			difficulty understanding the sentences (even if they seem unlikely 
			to be true).&nbsp; You can do that because you are able to apply the 
			rules of syntax in English and extract the significance of what the 
			string of words means.&nbsp; What's more, you can do it yourself and 
			create an infinite number of grammatically flawless sentences using 
			the same syntactical rules we have used up to now.&nbsp; It will not 
			take much effort for you to produce sentences such as the ones above 
			which are extremely unlikely to have been written or uttered by 
			anyone else ever in the entire history of the human race.<br />
			All you need to do is apply the rules which we will now consider.</p>

					<h2>Discovering rules</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>While we know there are rules governing a language, it is less 
			simple to discover and then explain what they are.<br />
			For our original four sentences above, however, we can hypothesise 
			what the rules might be and then test the hypotheses and refine them 
			if need be.&nbsp; The process may work something like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We know that:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A unicorn saw the woman<br />
				</em>is a well-formed sentence (because our intuition as 
				speakers of the language tells us so) and we know that:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unicorn a saw the woman</em><br />
				is not acceptable.<br />
				We also know that<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unicorn saw a woman</em><br />
				is acceptable but neither<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unicorn the saw a woman</em><br />
				nor<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unicorn the saw woman a</em><br />
				is acceptable.<br />
				Therefore, our hypothesis is that <span class="style_black">
				<strong>articles must precede nouns (1)</strong></span>.</li>
				<li>We can also hypothesise other rules because we know (again 
				from intuition) that in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman saw a unicorn</em><br />
				it is the woman who did the seeing and in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unicorn saw a woman</em><br />
				it is the unicorn which did the seeing.<br />
				We can hypothesise from this that the rule is
				<span class="style_black"><strong>subjects precede verbs (2)</strong></span>.</li>
				<li>Finally, we can hypothesise from the four acceptable 
				sentences that the objects of the seeing come after the verbs so 
				the rule for that is <span class="style_black"><strong>objects 
				follow verbs (3)</strong></span>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now we can test our three hypotheses with some other data to see 
			if they hold up.&nbsp; We are fine with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sparrow has eaten the seeds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A storm had destroyed the crops<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man owned a boat</em><br />
			and many thousands of other simple sentences.<br />
			So far all our hypotheses are supported by the evidence.<br />
			However, when we encounter:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A sparrow has nested the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A storm had arrived the country<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The man went the boat</em><br />
			our intuition is that something has gone astray with hypothesis 3 
			because none of those is acceptable.<br />
			We have to refine hypothesis three to <span class="style_black">
			<strong>objects follow <span class="style_underline">transitive</span> 
			verbs</strong></span>.<br />
			Similarly, with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has a sparrow eaten the seeds?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had the storm destroyed the crops?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the man own a boat?</em><br />
			we run into a problem with hypothesis 2 because the subject is now 
			sandwiched between verbs and we have to refine it to:
			<span class="style_black"><strong>subjects precede verbs 			<span class="style_underline">in declarative sentences</span></strong></span> 
			and questions follow different syntactical rules (which we can 
			investigate another time).<br />
			Finally, we can try to find example in which hypothesis 1 (that 
			articles precede nouns) is refuted and we find:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man owned a fishing boat</em><br />
			and that single example is enough to cause us to refine hypothesis 1 
			to <span class="style_black"><strong>articles are the first element 
			in noun
			<span class="style_underline">phrases</span></strong></span>.</p>
			<p>What we have done here is something like what many believe our 
			students are doing when they encounter examples of language: forming 
			and refining hypotheses as more data become available by a process 
			of inductive reasoning.</p>
			<p>Now we can take our rules and see how productive they can be.&nbsp; 
			Like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Take a noun phrase and precede it with a determiner and an 
				adjective so we can generate, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a tall person<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some old elephants<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; few difficult problems</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>Take a transitive verb such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; smoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truncate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; visualise</em><br />
				and put that next.</li>
				<li>Take another noun phrase and precede it with a determiner 
				and an adjective to generate, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the running vicar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his beautiful cat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that unpleasant rubbish</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now take one item from each of the three sections and combine 
			them syntactically to make a clause and we might generate, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tall person truncated his beautiful cat<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some old elephants visualised that unpleasant 
			rubbish<br />
			</em>and so on.</p>
			<p>Our troubles are not solved completely, of course, because there 
			are rules concerning what sorts of determiners modify what sorts of 
			nouns (so we can't have, e.g., <em>several rubbish</em> or <em>a 
			problems</em>) but these are refinements we can apply once we have 
			the general syntax right.<br />
			You will also have noticed that many of the possible clauses we can 
			produce are simply impossible or obviously untrue.&nbsp; That, 
			however, has nothing to do with grammar because it's a lexical issue 
			and that is one reason that we may refer not just to grammar but to 
			lexicogrammar when we want to investigate the syntactical rules of 
			English.&nbsp; There is a guide to lexicogrammar linked from the 
			syntax index on this site.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We have begged a question up to now and that is:<span class="style_black"><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just how do we 
			know that words and phrases belong to the categories we are dealing 
			with?</em><br />
			</span>We have encountered three categories so far: nouns (and 
			noun phrases), verbs and articles (determiners of a particular 
			kind).&nbsp; We can extend that list to speak of adverbs, 
			adjectives, prepositions, other types of determiner, pronouns and so 
			on.<br />
			How we determine which item fits into which class is an essential 
			step to forming the rules of English syntax (and the syntax of any 
			other human language).<br />
			There are three ways we can do this:</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="maen" height="133" src="../../images/meaning_woman_a200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style1">
					<h3>Meaning</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We can start with what words mean and form our categories 
			accordingly so we can state, for example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Words that refer to actions are verbs</li>
				<li>Words that refer to people or other entities are nouns</li>
				<li>Words that refer to the property of something are adjectives</li>
				<li>Words which refer to the frequency, time, place or 
				manner of an action are adverbs</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This will work as a definition for many words and from a set of 
			rules 
			like that it is possible to classify an alphabetic list like this:<br />
			<em>dig, extremely, go, great, happily, house, Mary, often, potato, 
			read, trivial, yellow<br />
			</em>into a classified list like this:</p><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style3">
				<tr>
					<td>Verbs:</td>
					<td> <em>dig, go, read</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Nouns:</td>
					<td> <em>house, Mary, potato</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Adjectives:</td>
					<td><em>great, trivial, yellow</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Adverbs:</td>
					<td> <em>extremely, happily, often</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Unfortunately, however, it does not help us to classify words 
			such as:<br /><em>exist, loss, installation, openness<br />
			</em>and thousands 
			more because such words do not fit the meaning (or semantic) 
			categories.&nbsp; In that list we have:<br />
			<em>exist</em> which is a verb that does not represent an action<br />
			<em>loss</em> which is a noun that cannot be used to represent an 
			entity<br />
			<em>installation</em> which is a noun that refers to an action<br />
			<em>openness </em>which is a noun that refers to a property of 
			something or someone<br />
			and the list goes on.</p>

			<p>If meaning categories don't work, we can try categorising words 
			by their form so we have lists such as:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Nouns take plurals in -<em>s</em> or -<em>es</em> and can take a genitive 
				ending in <em>'s</em></li>
				<li>Adjectives take comparative forms in -<em>er</em> and -<em>est</em></li>
				<li>Verbs take -<em>s</em> on the third person singular and -<em>ed</em> to signal 
				a past tense</li>
				<li>Adverbs end in -<em>ly</em> and are formed from adjectives</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and that will allow us to categorise, for example:<br />
			<em>biggest, coldly, computer’s, corrected, crocodiles, cups, 
			enjoys, exceptionally, fairest, fortunately, goes, hoped, longer, 
			older, Peter's, wilfully<br />
			</em>and then we get:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style3">

			<p>But will not work with many words because:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>not all adjectives 
			form comparative and superlative forms like this or at all (e.g., <em>
				fascinating, absent, sunken, lost</em>)</li>
				<li>some adjectives end in -<em>ly</em> (e.g., <em>likely, motherly</em>)</li>
				<li>some adverbs don't end in -<em>ly</em> (e.g., <em>outside, 
				often</em>)</li>
				<li>lots of verbs are irregular (e.g., <em>go, went, gone, put, 
				put, put</em>)</li>
				<li>some

				<li>some nouns have 
			irregular plurals or no plurals at all (e.g., <em>information, 
			sheep, mice</em>)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Form is, in other words, an inconsistent way 
			to categorise words.&nbsp; It is not unusable, of course, because 
			many words we encounter can be categorised by looking at the form.</p>

			<p>Here we are on safer ground and it is here that the concepts of 
			syntax and word or phrase categorisation feed off one another.&nbsp; 
			We are considering the possible <strong>distribution</strong> of 
			items within the syntax of a language.<br />
			The way to determine an item's function is to place it in a 
			syntactical environment so, for example, if we are faced with the 
			gaps in these sentences:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>She has lots of __________</em><br />
				we can only insert a noun or noun phrase into the gap such a <em>
				large dogs</em>.<br />
				We 
				cannot, for example, insert <em>in, happy, many, do </em>and 
				more.</li>
				<li><em>She can __________</em><br />
				we can only insert a verb phrase and no other category such as
				<em>dance well</em>.&nbsp; We 
				cannot, for example, insert <em>without, sad, because, radios </em>
				and more.</li>
				<li><em>I saw the very __________ unicorn</em><br />
				we can only insert an adjective or adjective phrase such as <em>
				happy</em>.&nbsp; We 
				cannot, for example, insert <em>in front of, extremely, lots, 
				smoke </em>and more.</li>
				<li><em>She walked __________ the road</em><br />
				we can only insert a preposition such as <em>over</em>.&nbsp; We cannot, for example, 
				insert <em>because, yellow, and, ca<span class="auto-style9">rried</span> </em>and more.</li>
				<li><em>They have not __________ enjoyed the food</em><br />
				we can only insert an adverb or adverb phrase such as <em>
				greatly, often</em>.&nbsp; We cannot, 
				for example, insert <em>beforehand, delicious, some, read </em>and more.</li>
				<li><em>She came __________ I asked her nicely</em><br />
				we can only insert a conjunction such as <em>because</em>.&nbsp; We cannot, for example, 
				insert <em>in, bicycle, however, do </em>and more.</li>
				<li><em>I discovered that __________ student was late</em><br />
				we can only insert a determiner such as <em>a</em>.&nbsp; We cannot, for example, 
				insert <em>back, disconnect, although, perhaps, do </em>and more.</li>
				<li><em>When I dropped __________, the glass broke</em><br />
				we are constrained to insert a pronoun (and in this case, 
				only one pronoun, <em>it</em>) although a noun phrase such as <em>the thing</em> 
				is a possibility.&nbsp; As nouns and pronouns perform identical 
				syntactic functions, however, this is not damaging to the case.&nbsp; 
				We cannot insert, for example, <em>happily, only, before, 
				association</em> and more.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This way of assigning words to word classes, while being the most difficult to apply, is the one 
			that unequivocally works to categorise the lexemes of the language.&nbsp; It is independent of meaning and form.</p>

			<p>Of these, the first four are considered open-class content word 
			classes to which additions are readily made and which, standing 
			alone, carry a signification which members of the speech community 
			can readily explain.&nbsp; These four categories also, it seems, are 
			common to most if not all human languages.<br />
			The second four are considered members of closed-class, functional 
			words 
			to which additions are very rarely made and which, standing alone, 
			defy clear definition and whose significance is only clear when they 
			function in the syntax of the language.<br />
			The final class falls into a grey area because, although the words carry some 
			kind of meaning in context, standing alone they do not and they also 
			do not perform a distinct grammatical function.</p>
			<p>There are problems with any categorisation of reality because 
			items have an annoying tendency to slide between classes.&nbsp; For 
			example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The words <em>this, that, these</em> and <em>those</em> are 
				determiners in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take this glass <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want that pen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try these glasses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass me those bags</em><br />
				but function very differently in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give him these<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want those</em><br />
				where they are all pronouns.<br />
				Other determiners such as <em>one, each, all, both</em> display 
				the same slipperiness.<br />
				(The word <em>that</em> also appears as a subordinating 
				conjunction in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She told me that was the case)</em></li>
				<li>The word <em>outside </em>is given as an example of an 
				adjective which it is in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is outside furniture</em><br />
				but in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went outside</em><br />
				it is an adverb</li>
				<li>The word <em>since </em>is<br />
				a conjunction in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since she wasn't invited to his party, 
				she didn't invite him to hers</em><br />
				a preposition in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't seen her since the meeting</em><br />
				and an adverb in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw her this morning but not since.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are plenty of other examples of this categorical 
			indeterminacy in
			<a href="../lexicogrammar/gradience.html" target="_blank">the guide 
			to gradience</a> (new tab).</p>
			<p>A further difficulty lies in the fact that although words may 
			fall quite neatly into major classes, the function they perform, 
			syntactically, grammatically and communicatively may be very 
			variable.&nbsp; There is no doubt, for example, that the word <em>
			could </em>should be categorised as a verb but it is one of a very 
			different order from verbs such as <em>cook</em> and different again 
			from a verb like <em>be.</em></p>
			<p>We should remember, therefore, that this is not by any means the 
			only way to categorise the lexemes of the language.<br />
			Traditionally, what we have categorised above as determiners, for 
			example, have previous been dealt with as separate categories for possessive adjectives: <em>my, your, her</em> etc.; 
			demonstrative adjectives: <em>this, that, these, those</em>; 
			quantifiers: <em>many, a few, a good deal of, some</em> etc.; articles: <em>a, an, the</em>,
			<em>&Oslash;</em> (sometimes including <em>some</em>) and so on.<br />
			Quirk and Greenbaum (1973:18) also distinguish demonstratives and 
			articles as separate word classes.</p>
			<p>Other more recent categorisations, notably that of Huddleston <em>
			et al</em> (2002:22), follow something broadly similar to what is 
			used here, although the preferred description is<strong> lexical 
			category</strong> rather than<strong> word class</strong>,<strong>
			</strong>but with significant differences:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first four content-word categories are parallel.</li>
				<li>Pronouns are demoted from a separate category and subsumed 
				as a subset of nouns (because that is how they act).</li>
				<li>The category of conjunctions is removed and replaced with 
				two distinct classes:<ol class="auto-style8">
					<li>Subordinators: <em>that, for, to, whether, if </em>etc.</li>
					<li>Coordinators: <em>and, or, but, nor </em>etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>A new category, determinative, is proposed to include: <em>
				the, this, that, a(n), some, all, every, each </em>etc.<br />
				This is to separate the grammatical function of determination 
				from the lexical category of determinative.&nbsp; So, for 
				example, while the word <em>that</em> in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>that car<br />
				</em>is a determinative<em>, </em>the same word functions 
				differently in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>it was that close<br />
				</em>where it occurs as part of an adjective phrase.<br />
				Determinatives considered in this way may <strong>only</strong> 
				occur as part of a noun phrase whereas the function of 
				determination can be achieved in many ways.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This may seem, and is, a somewhat minor and theoretical 
			distinction but, because word class (or lexical category) is such a 
			fundamental aspect of any understanding of syntax, it is, in 
			reality, quite important.</p>
			<p>We shall persist here and in other guides with the 9-part 
			identification of word class that is set out above but that is more 
			from considerations of usability in the classroom and familiarity 
			than theoretical judgements concerning the sustainability of the 
			concepts.</p>

			examples are illustrated like this.&nbsp; You can click on any of

			<p>An alternative, simpler classification might look like this:<br />
			<img alt="categories" height="490" src="../../imagesgraphics/lexical_categories.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>and it would be possible to graft onto that diagram the various 
			sub-categories of most of the classes.&nbsp; We have not done so 
			here in the interests of clarity but that is set out more 
			comprehensively in the guide to word and phrase class.</p>
			<p>It is worth noting at this point that the classifications used in 
			this section refer to the English lexicon.&nbsp; Other languages 
			differ in having, for example, nominal classifiers as a discernible 
			closed class of words (e.g., Chinese languages, Korean, Japanese and 
			Thai) and in subdividing other classes (such as adjectives).&nbsp; 
			Many languages make no distinction between adjectives and adverbs 
			and some rely on verb modifications and have few or no prepositions 
			or even post-positions.<br />
			In some languages, such as Japanese, adjectives may inflect for 
			tense and the borderline between them and verbs is somewhat blurred.<br />
			Even the distinction between closed- and open-class items is not a 
			universal because, for example, in Japanese, adjectives and verbs 
			are members of closed classes (with new items being formed in other 
			ways) whereas pronouns are open class items (as they are in some 
			other East Asian languages).<br />
			The only truly universal word classes seem to be those of nouns and 
			verbs and words in other languages will be classified differently.</p>

					<h3>Spelling and grammar checkers</h3>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>If you are reading this, it is a reasonable bet that you are also 
			able to use a word processor to create texts of your own and part of 
			your word processor package will normally be a spelling and grammar 
			checker.&nbsp; How does that work?</p>
			<p>A spelling checker will, of course, be able to detect whether a set 
			of characters between two spaces corresponds to any of the entries 
			in its dictionary and it is possible, indeed routine, for users to 
			add unusual or personally relevant items to that list.<br />
			For example, if we type <em>shcool</em>, the program can instantly 
			recognise that this is a misspelling and will suggest the correct
			<em>school</em> as a replacement.&nbsp; That works for words which 
			only have a single spelling.<br />
			However, it will not be able to detect what is wrong in all these:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That child has groan quickly</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to cheque the grammar</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to catch it but mist</em><br />
			because there is no misspelling, just a misuse of homophones (<em>groan/grown, 
			cheque/check, mist/missed</em>).&nbsp; If you enter that text into 
			most word-processing programs, nothing will alert you to the error.<br />
			Speakers of the language will, however, be able to recognise that
			<em>groan</em> is the base form of a verb which cannot occur after 
			the auxiliary verb, <em>has</em>, in a present perfect tense form, 
			<em>cheque</em> is a British English word for a 
			money order and not a verb at all and <em>mist</em> is a noun describing thin fog.</p>
			<p>A grammar checker uses the rules of syntax that it knows to flag up 
			a possible word choice error by noting that <em>groan</em> is both a 
			verb and a noun and cannot be used in that slot in the sentence as 
			it stands.&nbsp; However, <em>mist</em> is a noun and cannot be used 
			in a verb slot but Microsoft Word's built-in grammar 
			checker failed to spot the second two examples altogether, not 
			understanding that<em> mist</em> and <em>cheque</em> are nouns that cannot be used in 
			this kind of construction in that slot in the clause.<br />
			An example often produced by learners of an ill-formed sentence is:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is know about the prices</em><br />
			and the grammar checker correctly identified it as a possible misuse 
			of the verb <em>know</em>.&nbsp; However, its suggestion for a 
			correction is <em>known</em> which is also erroneous.&nbsp; The 
			program can detect a possible passive-voice clause, therefore, and 
			note that the verb <em>be</em> is followed conventional by the 
			participle<em> -ed / -en </em>form but cannot assign word or phrase 
			class accurately.<br />
			As yet, none of the programs is close to being able consistently and 
			accurately to check the syntax of English because:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style8">
				<li>Words in a natural language may occur in more than one word 
				class.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tickets are free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wants to free herself of any influence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the land of the free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The area is now disease-free</em><br />
				In the first case, the word <em>free</em> is an adjective, in 
				the second a verb, in the third a noun and in the last a 
				combining form morpheme.&nbsp; Any grammar checker has to 
				include all four word classes in its dictionary to be able to 
				decide whether the word is being used correctly.&nbsp; Then it 
				has to apply all the rules of English syntax (which are not yet 
				known, incidentally) to decide if what is written is well formed 
				or not.</li>
				<li>Words themselves have grammatical aspects which most 
				programs will also miss so for sentences such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children has arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The furniture are interesting</em><br />
				no warning will be evinced even though the recognition of a 
				plural noun <em>vs</em>. a singular noun should be easy enough 
				to arrange.&nbsp; It is, of course, but the recognition of 
				concord and agreement between noun and verb is much harder.&nbsp; 
				If we take a sentence such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The friend of my mother and my father are 
				coming to the party<br />
				vs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The friend of my mother and my father is coming to the party</em><br />
				then an electronic grammar checker will be wholly at a loss to 
				explain what's right and wrong because it is unclear to it how 
				many people are involved.&nbsp; Humans can recognise it 
				instantly.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The grail of designers of such programs is to make them 
			sophisticated enough to check such things and for that, they need a
			<strong>complete</strong> grammar checker and a grammar checker is 
			just baby talk for a syntax checker.<br />
			Word class is fundamental to syntax and that is the reason that 
			grammar checkers are, as yet, so inconsistent and frustrating.&nbsp; 
			Often, such programs will flag perfectly correct sentences as flawed 
			(and applying any suggestions will usually make matters considerably 
			and sometimes laughably worse) and yet ignore clearly flawed 
			constructions altogether.<br />
			It's just hard.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Once we have the categories of words and phrases in place, we can 
			start to formulate our rules of syntax more precisely and, some 
			claim, scientifically.&nbsp; This means being able to construct 
			paradigms from what we know are well formed sentences, inserting 
			word class into the patterns we have perceived.&nbsp; It works a bit 
			like this:</p>
			<p>Given a set of correctly formed sentences such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truck delivered some boxes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old truck delivered some boxes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truck delivered some large boxes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old truck delivered some large boxes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That truck delivered those very large boxes</em><br />
			and so on, we can construct the pattern as:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>S &rarr; Det (A) N V Det (A) N</strong></span><br />
			in which:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S = Sentence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Det = Determiner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A = Adjective<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V = Verb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N = Noun<br />
			and in which the items (in brackets) are optional elements.&nbsp; We 
			can visualise it like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="syntax" height="58" src="../../imagesgraphics/syntax1.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>and from that simple diagram, we can generate thousands upon 
			thousands of correctly formed sentences.&nbsp; The number is not 
			infinite but it approaches infinity especially if we are prepared to 
			construct long adjective phrases such as <em>large, blue, 
			interesting, Chinese, diesel </em>etc.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My green dog ate her yellow cat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those large, vicious moles attacked that helpless, old man<br />
			</em>and so on.<br />
			Furthermore, because syntax is, in theory at least, separate from 
			semantics, it does not matter if the sentences make any kind of 
			sense so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone's screaming concept devoured my 
			unhappy car</em><br />
			is also derivable from the simple syntactical rule we have 
			established.</p>
			<p>We can do this kind of thing to form the basis of many different 
			sentences so, for example, starting with<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you always have lunch in this room?</em><br />
			we can arrive at:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="syntax 2" height="79" src="../../imagesgraphics/syntax2.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>in which we have:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>S &rarr; Aux + N + (Adv) + V + (N 
			+ P + Det + N)</strong></span><br />
			in which the adverb is an optional part and (in the case of verbs 
			which can be or are intransitive) so is the entire object noun 
			phrase.&nbsp; That pattern will generate:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you sometimes see people in the street?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must he frequently drive buses on his holidays?</em><br />
			and lots more sentences, some of which may even make sense.</p>

			</table>
			<p>There are times, however, when generating the pattern is less 
			straightforward because two possible patterns (and sometimes more 
			than two) are possible.<br />
			For example, sentences such as:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>The neighbour of the woman and the man is complaining</em></li>
				<li><em>The neighbour of the woman and the man are complaining</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>have a single representation as:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="syntax 3" height="69" src="../../imagesgraphics/syntax3.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>but a glance at the two sentences tells us that the constituents 
			of each part are not the same.<br />
			In sentence 1. only one person is complaining and he or she is <em>
			the neighbour of the woman and the man</em>.&nbsp; In sentence 2., 
			two people are complaining: <em>the neighbour of the woman</em> and
			<em>the man</em>.&nbsp; The sentences can be written to show this by 
			putting the constituents in square brackets, conventionally, like 
			this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>[The neighbour of the woman and the man] is complaining</em></li>
				<li><em>[The neighbour of the woman] and [the man] are 
				complaining</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Similar things frequently happen with prepositional phrases so, 
			for example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He photographed the house by the river</em><br />
			we have two possible constituent analyses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>[He] photographed [the house by the river]</em></li>
				<li><em>[He] photographed [the house] [by the river]</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>because in sentence 1., the prepositional phrase modifies <em>the 
			house</em> and tells us where it was but in sentence 2. the phrase 
			modifies the verb <em>photographed</em> and tells us where the 
			photographing happened.</p>
			<p>Word and phrase class analysis alone is, therefore not enough for 
			us to form rules for acceptable sentences in a language.&nbsp; We 
			need to consider the phrase constituents of clauses and the elements 
			of the phrases themselves as well.</p>

			</table>
			<p>There are six main ways to identify the constituents of clauses

			We will use the same example sentence to show what they are:</p>

				<li><strong>Making a cleft</strong><br />
				<img alt="cleft" height="133" src="../../images/cut_avocado200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				There is a guide on this site linked from the syntax index to cleft sentences so 
				this is not the place to explain what they are, how they are 
				formed and why they are used.<br />
				This is how they may identify the constituents of the example 
				sentence, however:<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li><em>It was the house that he photographed by the river</em><br />
					identifies <em>the house </em>and <em>by the river </em>as 
					separate constituents</li>
					<li><em>It was by the river that he photographed the house</em><br />
					identifies where the photographing occurred</li>
					<li><em>It was the house by the river that he photographed</em><br />
					identifies <em>the house by the river</em> as a single 
					constituent.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Questions</strong><br />
				<img alt="?" height="133" src="../../images/question_girl200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				When we pose questions concerning the content of a sentence, we 
				do so by referring to the constituents so, for example:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li><em>Where did he photograph the house?</em><br />
					refers to the prepositional phrase as the modifier of the 
					verb and identifies it as an independent constituent so the 
					short answer would be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>by the river</em></li>
					<li><em>What did he photograph by the river?</em><br />
					assumes <em>the house</em> is a separate constituent so the 
					short answer would be<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the house</em></li>
					<li><em>Which house did he photograph?</em><br />
					refers to the prepositional phrase modifying <em>the house</em> 
					and identifies it as an independent constituent<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the house by the river</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Pro-form substitution</strong><br />
				<img alt="bird" height="133" src="../../images/birds_cat_bird200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				We can use the trick of substituting a constituent with a 
				pro-form to determine its role in the sentences, like this:<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li><em>He photographed it by the river</em><br />
					means that <em>the house </em>is a stand-alone constituent</li>
					<li><em>He photographed it</em><br />
					means <em>the house by the river</em> is the object</li>
					<li><em>He photographed the house there</em><br />
					establishes <em>by the river</em> as the separate 
					constituent phrase</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Coordination</strong><br />
				<img alt="juggler" height="133" src="../../images/man_juggler200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				We can use a conjunction to coordinate a phrase to another and 
				use that test to identify the constituents of the clause.&nbsp; 
				For example:<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li><em>He photographed the house by the river and the boat</em><br />
					establishes that <em>the house by the river</em> is a single 
					constituent</li>
					<li><em>He photographed the house by the river and from the 
					bridge</em><br />
					establishes that <em>by the river</em> modifies the verb 
					phrase and that <em>the house</em> is an independent 
					constituent</li>
					<li><em>He photographed and later bought the house by the 
					river</em><br />
					establishes that <em>the house by the river</em> is a single 
					constituent</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Making a passive</strong><br />
				<img alt="cat" height="133" src="../../images/animals_cat_sleep200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Passive-voice clauses rely on raising the object of a verb to 
				the subject slot in the clause (and we rename it as the patient 
				with the erstwhile subject now the agent).&nbsp; To identify our 
				phrase constituents in the example sentence, therefore, we can 
				produce either:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house by the river was photographed</em><br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was photographed by the river</em><br />
				and in the first case, we know that <em>the house by the river</em> 
				constitutes the patient of the clause and in the second that 
				only <em>the house</em> is the patient.&nbsp; It also 
				establishes <em>by the river</em> as a modifier of the verb, not 
				the noun.</li>
				<li><strong>Mobility</strong><br />
				<img alt="mobile" height="133" src="../../images/man_mobile200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				We can determine what constitutes a phrase by the simple trick 
				of seeing if we can move it and retain the sense of the original 
				clause.&nbsp; Grammatically, this is what we have done above to 
				form passive-voice clauses and cleft sentences.&nbsp; The 
				simpler way is just to move an element, like this:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the river he photographed the house</em><br />
				retains the sense of the prepositional phrase modifying the verb 
				but not the sense of it modifying the noun.&nbsp; However,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house by the river is what he 
				photographed</em><br />
				can only mean that the prepositional phrase modifies the noun 
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is what he photographed by the 
				river</em><br />
				retains the sense of the first example here.</li>

			</table>
			<p>Once we can define what constitutes a clause we can look a bit 
			more closely at what constitutes a phrase and examine the rules of 
			English syntax for making well-formed phrases which we can then 
			combine into well-formed clauses and sentences.<br />
			To decide what the constituent parts of any type of phrase are, we 
			need consider what is its Head.<br />
			Here is how we do that.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Noun phrases</strong><br />
				<img alt="things" height="133" src="../../images/things_to_know200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				If we consider what we can insert in the gap in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __________ enjoyed the play</em><br />
				it is immediately clear that it could be any of:<br />
				<em>he, she, that man, my friends, people, the woman in black, 
				all of us, the people who waited in the rain for hours on end<br />
				</em>and so on, but the gap cannot be filled with:<br />
				<em>happily, green, shoot, up the road, has probably benefited</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				This is because a noun phrase must contain a Head noun or 
				pronoun (and for this analysis, following Huddleston<em> et al</em>, we'll combine those two classes 
				as their grammatical functions are parallel).<br />
				We can also see that a noun phrase can contain a number of 
				optional elements.&nbsp; Breaking down a noun phrase is written 
				like this:<br />
				NP &rarr; (Det*) (A*) N (PP*/S*)<br />
				in which:<br />
				NP = Noun phrase<br />
				Det = Determiner<br />
				A = Adjective<br />
				N = Noun<br />
				PP = a modifying Prepositional phrase<br />
				S = a modifying Sentence<br />
				* = may be repeated<br />
				From that we can see that only the N is obligatory so all of the 
				following will count as noun phrases:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man who came to the party with his 
				sister </em>(Det + N + S)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>she</em> (N [subset Pronoun])<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the woman in the corner, by the fireplace 
				in the red coat </em>(Det + PP*)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the nice, shiny, new, diesel, delivery 
				truck</em> (Det + A* + N)<br />
				The rule we have will not generate:<br />
				<em>the happily man, go house, many pretty </em>etc. because 
				they break the rules for forming noun phrases and cannot fill 
				the gap in the sentence.</li>
				<li><strong>Verb phrases</strong><br />
				<img alt="action" height="133" src="../../images/action_people200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				By the same token, verb phrases must contain a Head verb but 
				other elements are optional.&nbsp; So, to fill the gap in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother __________</em><br />
				we could have:<br />
				<em>wanted some cake, rang, has tried to get her money back, 
				told me she was getting married again, arrived by car</em><br />
				and so on but we cannot fill the gap with:<br />
				<em>happy, in London, the garden</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				Thus a verb phrase is:<br />
				VP → V (NP) (PP*/S*)<br />
				in which only the V is obligatory.&nbsp; The following do not 
				qualify as verb phrases:<br />
				<em>very happy, the wide road, the building, under the carpet</em><br />
				because they do not contain the obligatory V.<br />
				We can also see, incidentally, that in order to form a correct 
				sentence in English the VP is an obligatory element.<br />
				From that we can see that only the V is obligatory so all of the 
				following will count as verb phrases:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left </em>(V)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>left the house </em>(V + NP)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; came to the party which was arranged 
				by the company </em>(V + PP+ S)<br />
				However, verb phrases do not stop there because we can also fill 
				the gap in our example sentence with:<br />
				<em>can play the piano, spoke too loudly, watched from the 
				balcony</em><br />
				and in these cases, we can further define a verb phrase as:<br />
				VP → (Aux) V (NP)<br />
				or<br />
				VP → V (Adv/PP)<br />
				where Adv = modifying adverbial.<br />
				It is worth pausing here to consider finite and non-finite verb 
				forms, both of which can appear in VPs.&nbsp; A finite verb form 
				is marked for tense or person (even when that marking is, as is 
				often the case in English, zero or &Oslash;) so a finite verb 
				phrase might be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she </em><span class="style_black"><em>
				<strong>work</strong></em><strong><em>s</em></strong></span><br />
				with the <em>s</em> ending on the verb marking it for person or:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they </em><span class="style_black">
				<strong><em>work</em></strong></span><br />
				with a &Oslash; inflexion on the verb.<br />
				A non-finite verb phrase might be<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="style_black"><strong>
				<em>to open</em></strong></span><em> the window</em><br />
				in which the verb is unmarked and a non-finite form.<br />
				Some verbs, including the central modal auxiliaries, have no 
				non-finite forms, incidentally.</li>
				<li><strong>Adjective phrases</strong><br />
				<img alt="alone" height="133" src="../../images/alone_beach200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				must contain at least one adjective as the Head but may contain 
				other elements.<br />
				To fill the gap in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary seemed __________</em><br />
				we can select elements such as:<br />
				<em>tired, happy to be there, aware of the problem, happy that 
				her son was going to university</em><br />
				and so on but not<br />
				<em>the house, enjoy, in the garden</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				So an adjective phrase is:<br />
				AP → A (PP/VP/S)<br />
				denoting that these are adjective phrases:<br />
				<em>happy in herself, delighted that she could be there, pleased to 
				help</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>over the road, want to come</em><br />
				because the Head is missing.</li>
				<li><strong>Adverb phrases</strong><br />
				<img alt="accurately" height="133" src="../../images/accuracy_dart200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				must contain at least one adverb as the Head but may be quite 
				complex.<br />
				To fill the gap in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John spoke very __________</em><br />
				we can select:<br />
				<em>loudly, frequently, privately, persuasively, almost endlessly, 
				twice, again and again</em><br />
				and so on but we cannot select:<br />
				<em>happy, in the garden, the house</em><br />
				because the syntactical rules of English forbid this.<br />
				Thus:<br />
				AdvP → (AdvP) Adv<br />
				Which willgenerate:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>movingly </em>(Adv)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>lengthily at the meeting</em> (Adv + AdvP)<br />
				and so on.&nbsp; In the second example, we have a prepositional 
				phrase, of course, but, because it is adverbial in nature, we 
				can represent it as AdvP.</li>
				<li><strong>Prepositional phrases</strong><br />
				<img alt="box" height="133" src="../../images/box_table200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				are even simpler and we can fill the gap in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary arrived __________</em><br />
				with an adverb phrase as we saw above but also with a 
				prepositional phrase such as:<br />
				<em>at the hotel, before six, by car, with her mother</em><br />
				and so on but not with<br />
				<em>the hotel, goes, who wanted to see her</em><br />
				Thus:<br />
				PP → P NP<br />
				which means that both the P and the NP are obligatory 
				constituents.<br />
				(In some analyses, a preposition may stand alone and be 
				designated as an intransitive preposition so, by that analysis:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went outside</em><br />
				is represented as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N + V + P<br />
				but that is not the line taken here.&nbsp; We would analyse that 
				as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N + V + Adv<br />
				with <em>outside</em> categorised as an adverb.)</li>

			<p><a name="return"></a>If you like, you can take
			<a href="syntaxhp1.htm">two little matching tests</a> to see if you 
			have understood this section.</p>
			<p>An alternative classification of phrase classes is reasonably 
			similar to what has been discussed here and, based on Huddleston <em>et 
			al</em> (2002:23), looks like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="phrases" height="397" src="../../imagesgraphics/phrase_classes_huddleston.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>Elsewhere on this site, this is not the categorisation which is 
			generally followed and, although it is stated that a verb phrase may 
			only contains verbs, it is conceded that, for teaching purposes, the 
			verb plus any modifiers, the object and the adverbials may be 
			considered together as a single phrase.</p>
			<p>There is one other category in that classification that has not 
			yet been explained: the nominal.<br />
			Most analyses will not see a nominal as a separate and distinct form 
			of phrase but doing so has some utility.&nbsp; Almost any phrase in 
			English may be nominalised and therefore act as if it was a noun 
			phrase in terms of syntax so, for example, in the following we have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the corner is the best place for that</em><br />
			in which the prepositional phrase is nominalised.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the young and fit are able to do that</em><br />
			in which we have a nominalised adjective phrase.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being criticised irritated her</em><br />
			in which we have a nominalised non-finite verb phrase.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enthusiastically is how they responded</em><br />
			in which the adverb is nominalised.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he was allowed to go home was a sensible 
			decision</em><br />
			in which we have a nominalised subordinate clause.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They got married which pleased her mother</em><br />
			in which we have a nominalised finite verb phrase (including the 
			subject noun).<br />
			There are guides to nominalisation linked from the syntax index.</p>

			<p>We have now reached the stage where we can recap and see how it 
			all works in combination.&nbsp; So far, we have established that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A sentence in its minimal form consists of&nbsp;a noun phrase 
				plus a verb phrase or:<br />
				S → NP VP<br />
				and that will generate, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They went home</em><br />
				and verb phrases, as we saw have a number of optional potential 
				elements (see 3., below).</li>
				<li>A noun phrase consists minimally of a noun but may have 
				optional elements like this:<br />
				NP &rarr; (Det*) (A*) N (PP*/S*)<br />
				and that pattern will generate, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the woman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the young woman</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the old car in the garage with the broken windscreen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his old computer I repaired last week</em></li>
				<li>A verb phrase consists minimally of a verb but may have 
				optional elements like this:<br />
				VP → V (NP) (PP*/S*)<br />
				which might generate:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has left the keys under the mat</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; went to London along with his sister to 
				see the changing of the guard</em><br />
				or it may appear as:<br />
				VP → (Aux) V (NP)<br />
				which could generate:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can cook dinner</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had a late lunch</em><br />
				or<br />
				VP → V (Adv/PP)<br />
				which will generate, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; go frequently to the shops<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lie in the sun</em></li>
				<li>An adjective phrase consists minimally of an adjective but 
				may have optional elements like this:<br />
				AP → (Adv) A (PP/VP/S)<br />
				which could generate:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very happy in my new home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delighted you could make it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; probably happy to help</em></li>
				<li>An adverb phrase consists minimally of an adverb but may 
				have an optional extra adverb phrase like this:<br />
				AdvP → Adv (AdvP)<br />
				which could generate:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very quickly but very carefully</em></li>
				<li>A prepositional phrase must consist of the preposition plus 
				a noun phrase, like this:<br />
				PP → P NP<br />
				and that could generate:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>into the old suitcase</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>If we add all these elements into the structure of a complete 
			sentence we can generate something like:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>The young man from London could 
			buy the most expensive car in the showroom</strong></p>
			<p>which looks complicated but is actually not because we can 
			represent it this way:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="syntax 4" height="291" src="../../imagesgraphics/syntax4.png" width="930" /></p>
			<p>
			It is also possible to break down the adjective phrase (into Adv [<em>most</em>] 
			and Adj [<em>expensive</em>]) and the final noun phrase (into N [<em>car</em>], 
			P [<em>in</em>], Det [<em>the</em>] and N [<em>showroom</em>]) but 
			that is not necessary once we know how to do it.</p>
			<p>
			In theory, all sentences and clauses in any language can be 
			generated by applying the rules for what forms a sentence and what 
			forms the components of its constituent phrases.<br />
			However, what we have done here applies to English syntax and it is 
			unlikely that other languages will work in the same way although the 
			assumption made by many is that all languages contain the basic 
			building blocks.</p>
			<p>
			Now, armed with our ability to identify the functions of phrases 
			within clauses and sentences, we can disambiguate our previous 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He photographed the house by the river</em><br />
			without recourse to square brackets and so on to say what the 
			phrases are doing.&nbsp; It will work like this:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style3">
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style4">Interpretation 1<br />
					<em>[He] photographed [the house by the river]</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style5">Interpretation 2<br />
					<em>[He] photographed [the house] [by the river]</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style7">
					<img alt="syntax 7" height="206" src="../../imagesgraphics/syntax7.png" width="310" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style6">
					<img alt="syntax 8" height="196" src="../../imagesgraphics/syntax8.png" width="310" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			and it is simple to see that in interpretation 1, the noun phrase 
			includes the prepositional phrase but in interpretation 2, the verb 
			phrase includes the prepositional phrase.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<h2>Recursion</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>One of the most important features of human language which 
			distinguishes it from any other form of communication is 
			recursiveness which means we can apply the same rules for forming 
			acceptable syntax again and again.&nbsp; We saw this in the last 
			example in which a prepositional phrase was included within the 
			final noun phrase.<br />
			Now we'll consider these sentence:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>John believes Mary is going to be angry</em></li>
				<li><em>I know John believes Mary is going to be angry</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the first sentence we have a simple structure like this:<br />
			S → N + VP<br />
			and we have the verb phrase like this:<br />
			VP → V + S<br />
			so we can represent that as:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="syntax 5" height="299" src="../../imagesgraphics/syntax5.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Sentence 2. is formed by applying the same rule recursively and 
			looks like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="syntax 6" height="401" src="../../imagesgraphics/syntax6.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>and we can, of course go on with the process without end (the 
			sentence could be infinitely long) so we might have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people have guessed that you think I know 
			John believes 
			Mary is going to be angry</em><br />
			but we won't.<br />
			We can also break down the final S at the bottom right of the tree 
			into:<br />
			<img alt="mary" height="195" src="../../imagesgraphics/syntax9.png" width="310" /><br />
			and that could be appended to our diagram quite easily but exactly 
			how one analyses the verb phrase is open to some debate.&nbsp; Some 
			recognise <em>be going to</em> as a constituent auxiliary verb 
			phrase and some would append the <em>to</em> to the verb <em>be</em>.&nbsp; 
			For teaching purposes, it matters little which approach you take, 
			providing you are consistent.</p>

					<li>What elements are forbidden by the rules of English 
					syntax for each phrase type</li>
			</ol>However,
				it is somewhat unlikely that they will be able to do this in 
				every case because, as we saw above, phrases may contain a range 
				of optional and obligatory elements and, to make things worse, 
				the elements they contain may vary from language to language.<br />
				We can help a little with the process by making sure that the 
				phrases we present together contain the same elements in the 
				same order so that it makes some kind of pattern sense and we 
				can start with the easiest elements before adding in longer and 
				more complex ones.<br />
				This means, for example, presenting phrases like this:
				<ol class="auto-style8">
				<li>NP: present as<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li>N<br />such as in:<br /><em><span class="style_black">
					<strong>She</strong></span> 
					came home<br /><span class="style_black"><strong>Mary</strong></span> 
					arrived</em><br />etc.
					before</li>
					<li>Det N<br />such as in:<br /><em>
					<span class="style_black"><strong>The weather</strong></span> 
					is terrible<span class="style_black"><strong><br />A man 
					</strong></span>arrived</em><br />etc. before</li>
					<li>Det Adj N<br />such as in:<br /><em>
					<span class="style_black"><strong>That old Ford car</strong></span> 
					is cheap<br /><span class="style_black"><strong>Those beautiful, fresh 
					flowers </strong></span>are for her</em><br />etc. before</li>
					<li>Det Adj N PP<br />such as in:<br /><em>
					<span class="style_black"><strong>The wonderful pictures 
					on the walls in the gallery</strong></span> are very 
					valuable<br /><span class="style_black"><strong>Some interesting ideas 
					from the meeting about the new road</strong></span> were 
					suggested</em><br />etc.</li>
				</ul>
					</li>
					<li>VP: present as:<ul class="smallredbullet">
						<li>VP → V NP<br />such as in:<br /><em>She 
						<span class="style_black"><strong>read a book</strong></span><br />We 
						<span class="style_black"><strong>enjoyed the meal</strong></span></em><br />etc. or<br />VP → V Adv<br />such as in:<br />
						<em>I <span class="style_black"><strong>walked slowly</strong></span></em><br />
						<em>Please <span class="style_black"><strong>smoke outside</strong></span></em><br />etc. or<br />VP → V PP<br />such as in:<br />
						<em>She <span class="style_black"><strong>sat in the corner<br /></strong></span>
						<span class="style_blue">She</span><span class="style_black"><strong> went to school</strong></span></em><br />etc. before</li>
						<li>VP → Aux V NP<br />such as in:<br /><em>Mary 
						<span class="style_black"><strong>has finished her breakfast</strong></span><br />We 
						<span class="style_black"><strong>c</strong><span class="auto-style9"><strong>an 
					answer the questions</strong></span></span></em><br />etc. before</li>
						<li>VP → V NP PP<br />such as in:<br /><em>I 
						<span class="style_black"><strong>have put the old chairs in the 
					corner</strong></span><br />Mary <span class="style_black">
						<strong>must arrive before six o'clock</strong></span></em><br />etc. before</li>
						<li>VP → V NP S<br />such as in:<br />
						<em>I</em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>'ll buy 
						the book John recommended to me</em></strong></span><br /><em>Angela </em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>
						printed out the instructions we have followed to get 
						here</em></strong></span><br />
					etc.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
			</ol>and so on for other phrase types, starting with the minimal 
				obligatory elements (i.e., the Head of each phrase) and moving 
				on to adding in optional constituents as learners become more 
				confident and able to cope with additions to the structure.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Presentation</strong><br />
				<img alt="present" height="133" src="../../images/present_hand_flowers_a200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>It makes sense when the focus in a lesson is on acceptable 
				syntactic structures, to focus any presentation on just one or 
				two so that the learners are able to notice the patterns or, 
				indeed, have them pointed out.<br />
				For example, if noun phrases are presented with and without 
				adjectives or modifying prepositional phrases, with and without 
				suitable determiners and so on in the same lesson, it will not 
				be surprising if our learners fail to notice any of the patterns we have 
				analysed in this guide.<br />
				Equally, if verb phrase patterns are mixed to include those with 
				and without adverb phrases, using transitive and intransitive 
				verbs randomly (so with and without NP constituents) and some 
				with prepositional phrase modifiers and others without, then the 
				learners will not have the data from which to realise which 
				patterns are acceptable and which forbidden.<br />
				Adjective phrases, too, despite being usually quite simple can 
				contain large quantities of text functioning as a prepositional 
				phrase, a verb phrase or a whole sentence.<br />
				These are wasted opportunities which could easily lead to errors 
				such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is know about the prices</em><br />
				rather than the intended:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is sure about the prices</em><br />
				because the learner has not been led to understand how adjective 
				phrases function in English.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Unpacking complexity</strong><br />
				<img alt="unpack" height="133" src="../../images/case_unpack200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>A great strength of some syntactical analysis in classrooms 
				is that it can empower learners armed with a little knowledge to 
				unpack seemingly complex and otherwise impenetrable sentences 
				because they are alert to the fundamental constituents of 
				clauses and can strip out the optional elements to leave the 
				core.<br />
				We can, for example, take something like:<p class="auto-style10">
				<strong><em>The storm that swept in last night from the sea 
				almost completely destroyed the villagers' fragile and 
				unprotected fishing boats</em></strong></p>
				and bring some phrase analysis to bear on it, stripping out the 
				optional constituents of the two noun phrases and the verb 
				phrase so we are left with:<p class="auto-style10"><strong><em>
				The storm destroyed the boats</em></strong></p>
				which is all that is required for adequate comprehension in most 
				circumstances.<br />
				The ability to recognise clause elements and then to recognise 
				the next level down of phrase elements is a skill well worth 
				encouraging and nurturing in your learners because it can make 
				them independent readers and listeners more quickly than any 
				amount of skills work practice.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Correction</strong><br />
				<img alt="mark" height="133" src="../../images/mark_red200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>When correcting spoken or written work, it pays dividends on 
				many occasions to be alert to ill-formed or incomplete phrase 
				constituents so, for example, errors such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He proud to be here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That in the corner was broken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *My mother in the garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *In the house is decorated</em><br />
				and so on are all easily correctable, of course, but they will 
				recur unless the learners can be brought to the understanding 
				(by telling, by elicitation or by exemplification) that certain 
				types of phrases require certain elements in English.&nbsp; In 
				these cases, the focus needs to be on the syntactical 
				constituents of adjective phrases, noun phrases, verb phrases 
				and noun phrases (again) respectively.</dd>
