			<p>Before you follow this guide, you should be confident that you 
			understand the material covered in 
			<a href="phrases.html" target="_blank">the guide 
			to phrase analysis</a>.<br />
			That guide covered the structure of Noun, Verb, Adverb, 
			Prepositional and Adjective phrases and they were all exemplified by 
			reference to clauses in which they occur or to whole sentences.&nbsp; 
			Here, we take the next step up and consider clauses.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>

					<td class="auto-style7"><h2>Definition</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Traditionally, a clause is defined as a unit of language 
			consisting of a subject and its predicate.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary likes tea<br />
			</em>is a clause because it contains a subject (<em>Mary</em>) and 
			the predicate (<em>likes tea</em>).&nbsp; A clause may be a complete 
			sentence as in this case or it may be dependent on another clause as 
			in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I boiled the kettle because Mary likes tea<br />
			</em>in which the clause is still identifiable as having a subject 
			and predicate but it is dependent on the first clause for its full 
			meaning.<br />
			As a working definition, we can say that a clause as a series of 
			words which contains at least one verb phrase.<br />
			For example, the bits on the right here are clauses; those on the 
			left are phrases:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style61" style="width: 50%"><strong>Phrases</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style56" style="width: 50%"><strong>Clauses</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style57" style="width: 50%"><em>in the huge garden</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style58" style="width: 50%"><em>he arrived</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style57" style="width: 50%"><em>very, very slowly</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style58" style="width: 50%"><em>playing the piano</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style57" style="width: 50%"><em>an old dog</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style58" style="width: 50%"><em>to help with the cooking</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style57" style="width: 50%"><em>the woman on the corner</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style58" style="width: 50%"><em>she obviously left early</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style59" style="width: 50%"><em>the engineer's wife</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style60" style="width: 50%"><em>going slowly under the bridge</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>All the chunks on the right here contain a verb of some sort but 
			none on the left does.<br />
			However, if you have spotted that only <em>he arrived</em> and <em>
			she obviously left early</em> can stand alone as pieces of intelligible 
			language, you have noticed something rather important.&nbsp; Three 
			of those so-called clauses (the second, third and fifth) do not have 
			a subject so, in the traditional definition, they do not constitute 
			proper clauses.<br />
			In this guide, we will be using the term <strong>clause</strong> for any group of 
			words containing a verb phrase but will distinguish between finite 
			and non-finite clauses.<br />
			There is more to follow but the distinction between finite and 
			non-finite forms (verbs or clauses) is important to understand if 
			you want to analyse clauses well.&nbsp; The difference is that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Finite clauses contain a verb or verb phrase which is marked 
				for tense, person or number.&nbsp; So, for example, all the 
				following are finite clauses and verb forms:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John has been to London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Mary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harry will get the money</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				Unfortunately, English is defective insofar as some verbs which 
				are marked for tense, person or number take a zero marking so, 
				although the verb form in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They swim</em><br />
				does not alter in English to show person, number or tense, it is 
				still a finite form because it is actually marked for present 
				time, plural subject and third person but none of these 
				characteristics is obvious from the verb form.&nbsp; What we 
				have is called a zero marking, often represented as &Oslash;.<br />
				The verb in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You drink</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They drink</em><br />
				is identical but both are finite forms.<br />
				In other languages, such as Spanish, French or German, the form 
				of the verb will be marked to show the relationships so it is 
				somewhat easier in those languages to identify finite forms.<br />
				If we translate the last two clauses into those languages, we 
				get:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>Spanish:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tú bebes<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ellos beben</em></li>
					<li>French:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tu bois<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ils boivent</em></li>
					<li>German:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; du trinkst<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sie trinken</em></li>
				</ol>and you can see instantly that the verb form has changes to 
				show the characteristics of the subject.&nbsp; Hosts of other 
				languages will display the same phenomenon.<br />
				</li>
				<li>Non finite clauses are not so marked so there is no way of 
				knowing the tense or the number or person of the subject.&nbsp; 
				The following all contain non-finite forms (in <strong>bold</strong>):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>staying</strong> out late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>broken</strong> promises<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>to get</strong> the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beautifully <strong>done</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>to help</strong> <strong>do</strong> the work</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is a separate 
			guide to finite and non-finite verbs on this site, linked below in 
			the list of related guides, and the 
			considerations there apply to clauses just as they do to individual 
			verbs.</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>In geology, a matrix is a fine-grained rock in which other 
			minerals are embedded and the definition will hold quite well for 
			our purposes.<br />
			Consider these two sentences:</p>
			<ol class="style_brown">
				<li class="style_brown">She saw <em>the dog wanted food</em></li>
				<li>S<span class="style_brown">he saw <em>the dog wanted <strong>
				to eat something</strong></em></span></li>
			</ol>
			<dl>
				<dt>In sentence 1., we have two clauses:</dt>
				<dd>The Matrix clause: <span class="style_brown">She saw the dog 
				wanted food</span><br />The Subordinate clause embedded in the matrix:<em>
				<span class="style_brown">the dog wanted food</span><br />
				</em>Both of these clauses are finite because the verb is marked 
				for tense (and in many languages would also be marked for aspect 
				and person).&nbsp; The marking concerns the past form of <em>see</em>, 
				which happens to be irregular, and the past form of <em>want</em> 
				which is regular.&nbsp; Even if we have no marking at all 
				superficially in a clause such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put it in the post<br />
				</em>we can still recognise that the verb is finite but in this 
				case there is what is known as zero marking of the tense.&nbsp; 
				That's still marking of a sort and this is still a finite clause.</dd>
				<dt>In sentence 2., we actually have three clauses:</dt>
				<dd>The Matrix clause: <span class="style_brown">She saw the dog 
				wanted to eat something</span><br />Subordinate clause A embedded in the matrix clause: <em><span class="style_brown">the dog 
				wanted to eat something</span><br />
				</em>Subordinate clause B embedded in Subordinate clause A: <em><span class="style_brown">
				<strong>to eat something</strong></span><br />
				</em>Both the Matrix clause and Subordinate clause A are finite 
				clauses with the verb marked for tense (<em>s<strong>aw</strong></em> 
				and <em>want<strong>ed</strong></em> respectively).<br />
				Subordinate clause A is embedded in the Matrix clause.<br />
				Subordinate clause B is embedded in Subordinate clause A and is 
				non-finite (the verb, <em>to eat</em>, is unmarked for person or 
				tense).<br />
				Subordinate clause A, therefore, is the Matrix clause for 
				Subordinate B.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>This means, if you are following, that the terms Matrix and 
			Subordinate are <strong>relative</strong>.&nbsp; A subordinate 
			clause can be the matrix clause for its own subordinate clause.<br />
			In many cases (as in these examples) the Matrix clause and the 
			sentence are the same.&nbsp; That needn't be the case because we can 
			have, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Mary came home when she finished work&nbsp;and John left as soon as 
			he saw her.<br />
			</em>In which we have two Matrix clauses both with an embedded 
			Subordinate clause (of time) but only one sentence.</p>
			<p>If you prefer a graphical representation:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="clause embedding" height="92" src="../../imagesgraphics/clause_structure.png" width="400" /><br />
			</p>
			<p>
			or</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="structure" height="119" src="../../imagesgraphics/clause_structure2.png" width="400" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			Another way to represent this structuring is:</p>
			<table class="auto-style6">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="structure" height="179" src="../../imagesgraphics/clause_sub1.png" width="250" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="2" height="183" src="../../imagesgraphics/clause_sub2.png" width="250" /></td>
				</tr>

					<img alt="structure" height="181" src="../../imagesgraphics/clause_sub4.png" width="250" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			in which the subordinate clauses are shown in a kind of hierarchy.&nbsp; 
			Here, both clauses are finite and you can see that the verbs are 
			marked for tense.<br />
			That need not be the case and we do not need to confine ourselves to 
			just two clauses, of course, so we can have:</p>
			<p class="auto-style62">
			Mary came home when she finished work feeling ready for an argument 
			and John left as soon as he saw her because he wanted to avoid any 
			trouble.</p>
			<p>
			Here, we have seven clauses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Mary came home</em><br />
				the first main finite clause</li>
				<li><em>when she finished work</em><br />
				the first subordinate finite clause</li>
				<li><em>feeling ready for an argument</em><br />
				a second embedded non-finite clause</li>
				<li><em>John left</em><br />
				the second main finite clause</li>
				<li><em>as soon as he saw her</em><br />
				a third embedded subordinate finite clause</li>
				<li><em>because he wanted</em><br />
				a fourth embedded subordinate finite clause</li>
				<li><em>to avoid any trouble</em><br />
				a fifth embedded subordinate non-finite clause</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The overall structure can be visualised like this, with finite 
			clause highlighted <span class="auto-style65">in green</span> and non-finite clauses in 
			<span class="auto-style66">light blue</span>:<br />
			<img alt="structure" height="205" src="../../imagesgraphics/clause_sub5.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>
			There are two important points:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style64">
				<li><strong>All matrix clauses must be finite clauses</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Subordinate clauses can be finite or non-finite</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This leads to the identification of four different kinds of 
			sentences which can be classified according to the ways in which the 
			clauses are structured:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Simple sentences have just one clause and, of course, it 
				needs to be finite so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary came home</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John left</em><br />
				are both simple sentences.<br />
				It is not possible in English to construct a simple sentence 
				with a non-finite clause unless the finite form is understood.&nbsp; 
				So, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming?<br />
				is a simple sentence but the finite verb form (<em>Are you</em>) 
				is understood.</li>
				<li>Compound sentences which have two coordinated finite clauses 
				of equal weight so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary came home and John left</em><br />
				is a compound sentence.</li>
				<li>Complex sentences which have a main clause and a subordinate 
				clause so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary came home when she finished work<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John left as soon as he saw her<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John left to avoid an argument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog wanted to eat</em><br />
				are all complex sentences.&nbsp; The subordinate clause may be 
				finite (the first two) or non-finite (the second two).</li>
				<li>Compound-complex sentences in which there is a combination 
				of coordination and subordination so<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary came home when she finished work&nbsp; and John left 
				as soon as he saw her</em><br />
				is a compound-complex sentence.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Non-finite clauses contain one of the following verb forms:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li >the bare infinitive: <em>She let me
				<strong>leave</strong> early</em></li>
				<li >a <em>to</em>-infinitive: <em>I want <strong>to 
				leave</strong> early</em></li>
				<li >a past participle form: <em><strong>
				Left</strong> on the table were the remains of dinner</em></li>
				<li >an <em>-ing</em> form: <em><strong>
				Leaving</strong> early was a real bonus.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Finite verb forms will always be marked for tense (even if as in, 
			e.g., <em>They come late</em>, the marking for tense is the <strong>
			absence</strong> of a change to the verb or an ending) and often 
			for person, too, as in e.g., <em>He come<strong>s</strong> late</em>.</p>
			<p>In some analyses, the matrix clause is referred to as the 
			superordinate clause.&nbsp; That will do just as well if it's easier 
			to understand.</p>
			<p>If you want more about types of subordinate clauses, go to 
			the 
			guide to conjunction, linked below.</p>

					<td class="auto-style7"><h2>Verbless clauses</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>This sounds like a contradiction in terms because we have just 
			defined a clause as a unit containing a verb phrase.&nbsp; At times, 
			however, we can leave out the verb because it will be easily 
			understood.&nbsp; We also, incidentally, often have to leave out the 
			verb's subject as well.<br />
			Here are some examples:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Leaving out the finite verb phrase</dt>
				<dd><em>If possible, come before six</em> (= <em>If it is 
				possible, come before six</em>)<br />
				<em>Whether now or later, we'll get it done </em>(= <em>Whether 
				we do it now or later, we'll get it done</em>)<br />
				These clauses often contain conjunctions such as <em>whether, 
				whenever, where </em>etc.</dd>
				<dt>Leaving out a non-finite verb phrase</dt>
				<dd><em>Too tired to cook, I went straight to bed </em>(= <em>
				Being too tired to cook, I went straight to bed</em>)<br />
				<em>There are lots of interesting jobs in the sector, many 
				highly paid </em>(= <em>There are lots of interesting jobs in 
				the sector, many being highly paid</em>)</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Verbless clauses are sometimes called <strong>defective</strong> 
			clauses or even simply <strong>small</strong> clauses.</p>

					<img alt="function" height="166" src="../../images/multi-function250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><h2>The functions of clauses</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Here we are speaking of grammatical function rather than 
			communicative function.<br />
			Matrix or superordinate clauses need little such analysis because their 
			function (to represent an entire thought) is clear.<br />
			Subordinate or dependent clauses in particular can 
			perform a number of grammatical functions in English which are not 
			necessarily parallelled in other languages.<br />
			The variety of functions can confuse learners who may be unable to 
			comprehend what they see or hear and unable to deploy clauses for 
			communicative effect.<br />
			Here's a run-down of the main functions of clauses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>as nouns (nominalised clauses):<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>subject:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">What he 
					said</span> was appalling</em></li>
					<li>direct object:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know
					<span class="style_black">what to do about this</span></em></li>
					<li>indirect object:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought <span class="style_black">
					whoever asked</span> a drink</em></li>
					<li>subject complement of a copular verb:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hope is <span class="style_black">
					that she won't be late</span></em></li>
					<li>object complement of a pseudo-copular verb<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She made him
					<span class="style_black">be the 
					captain</span></em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
