			<h1>Post-modification of noun phrases</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="transform" height="207" src="../../images/modification_garage310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>There is a 
			<a href="modification_nouns.html" target="_blank">guide to noun modification</a> in general on this site which 
			you may also like to consult.&nbsp; Here we are concerned only with 
			post-modification of noun phrases.<br />
			There is also a guide to how noun phrases may be pre-modified, 
			linked in the table of related links at the end.</p>
			<p>You may, incidentally, encounter the term <strong>qualifier</strong> 
			applied to terms which post-modify an item.&nbsp; That is a 
			functional grammarian's term.&nbsp; We shall restrict ourselves to 
			the term post-modifier here but the ideas are similar.</p>
			<hr />

					<h2>Why post-modify at all?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are two ways that post-modification works in English.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Adding information:<br />
				Post-modification of noun phrases is a usually simple device to 
			add information to the noun itself.&nbsp; Although we can say, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The man is waving to me.&nbsp; The man is standing in 
				the corner.<br />
				</em>it is more elegant and natural to say, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The man <span class="style_black">in the corner</span> is waving to me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man <span class="style_black">who is standing in the corner</span> is waving to me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man <span class="style_black">standing in the corner
				</span>is waving to me.<br />
				</em>There's nothing at all wrong with the first example but the 
				second, third and fourth are 
			simply more natural and precise.</li>
				<li>Restricting the noun:<br />
				The second effect of post-modification is often (not always) to 
				be restrictive or defining.&nbsp; The terms are often used to 
				refer to the function of relative clauses, to which there is a 
				guide on this site, linked below, but it applies frequently to 
				noun modification of other sorts.<br />
				For example, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; My old computer</em><br />
				we have a simple case of noun pre-modification with an adjective 
				telling us something about the computer.&nbsp; However, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; My computer in the corner</em><br />
				we have a noun post-modified by the prepositional phrase which 
				defines it rather than describing it.<br />
				It is not invariably the case that post-modification acts in 
				this restrictive fashion but that is certainly the way to bet.<br />
				Nor is it the case that all pre-modification is non-restrictive 
				because<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My old computer</em><br />
				could be intended to distinguish the computer from others in my 
				possession and in that case it will be a restrictive use.<br />
				When post-modification is used non-restrictively in the examples 
				which follow, it will be noted.</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="problem" height="166" src="../../images/problem_man250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style9">
					<h2>Why should this be a problem?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Primarily because languages do things differently and some abjure 
			post-modification altogether preferring something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
			in-the-corner-standing-man is waving to me</em> (other Germanic languages, 
			for example)<br />
			or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man is standing in the corner and waving to 
			me </em>(many other languages including Arabic)<em>.<br />
			</em>Even when a language does use post-modification of noun phrases 
			(and most do) the structures are often very different.&nbsp; Romance 
			languages, such as French and Italian, for example, routinely position the adjective after the 
			noun.&nbsp; This is a phenomenon that can occur in English (as we 
			shall see) but is quite rare and sometimes gives an unusual sense.</p>

			<ol id="firstanswer" class="auto-style67" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li><em>I found nothing <span class="style_black"><strong>useful</strong></span> in the cupboard.</em><br />
				This is the use of a postpositioned adjective as is 
				conventional after any of the <em>no-, every-, some-, any-</em> set of 
				pronouns.<br />
				Other examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something important<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing interesting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anything extra</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everything possible</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				When the bare stems of these words are used, they are 
				determiners and the adjective functions normally as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you got any cheaper ones?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some interesting people there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has no useful ideas to add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want every dead tree removed<br />
				</em>This post-modification using an adjective is <strong>not</strong> 
				restrictive in the way that post-modification usually is.</li>
				<li><em>The man <span class="style_black"><strong>involved</strong></span> has been arrested.</em><br />
				This is another example of a postpositioned adjective but 
				this is not a conventional use in English.&nbsp; Only a few 
				adjectives can do this trick in English.&nbsp; Other examples 
				are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people concerned were asked to give a 
				statement<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President elect is going to speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The money available is inadequate<br />
				</em>Adjectives formed with the -<em>able / -ible</em> suffix 
				are also seen as post-modifiers of nouns when the adjective 
				limits the noun in some way.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The money available now </em>(i.e., only some of it)<em> 
				is inadequate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work accomplishable</em> <em>this week </em>(i.e., only 
				some of it)<em> is enough<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stars visible tonight </em>(only some of them)<em> ...<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				When the noun is not limited in this way, the normal ordering is 
				preferred so we can compare:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The available money </em>(i.e., all of it)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accomplishable work </em>(i.e., all of it)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The visible stars
				</em>(i.e., all of them)<br />etc.<br />
				There are more examples of this below.<br />
				In this case, post-positioning the adjective performs the usual 
				function of post-modification by restricting or defining the 
				noun.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concerned neighbours</em><br />
				is a case of pre-modification which simply describes how the 
				neighbours felt and does not restrict the noun but:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The neighbours concerned</em><br />
				is restrictive because it implies that there were other 
				neighbours who were not concerned.&nbsp; When we use a relative 
				clause in this way, the distinction becomes clearer so we can 
				have a non defining, non-restrictive use as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The neighbours, who were concerned, came 
				together</em><br />
				which simply adds information to the neighbours but we can also 
				restrict the noun by having:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The neighbours who were concerned came together</em><br />
				which makes it clear that other neighbours were not involved.</li>
				<li><em>The people <span class="style_black"><strong>behind me</strong></span> are making too much noise.</em><br />
				This is a prepositional phrase with the complement (or 
				object) a pronoun (<em>me</em>).&nbsp; We could also have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man opposite her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the women near me</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; the man in the corner</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Prepositional phrase post-modification is almost invariably 
				restrictive and defines the noun.</li>
				<li><em>The meeting <span class="style_black"><strong>we 
				attended</strong></span> was a good opportunity to complain.</em><br />
				This is a post-modifying finite clause.&nbsp; It is a relative 
				pronoun clause and, because the pronoun refers to the object, we 
				can omit the relative pronoun (<em>that</em> or <em>which</em> 
				in this case).&nbsp; When the relative pronoun refers to the 
				subject as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people at the meeting who complained were not 
				satisfied<br />
				</em>then the relative pronoun must be included so we cannot 
				allow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*The people at the meeting complained 
				were not satisfied.</em></li>
				<li><em>The reason <span class="style_black"><strong>why I asked for this meeting</strong></span> is to complain.</em><br />
				Here the adverbial,<em> why</em>, is included 
				(unnecessarily some would suggest) but this example is an adverb 
				relative clause not a relative pronoun clause.&nbsp; In this 
				case, the adverb may be omitted.&nbsp; However, the other three 
				adverbs (place, time and manner) used in such clauses cannot be 
				omitted so we see, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the hotel where we held the 
				reception<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was when I realised the truth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was how it should have been done<br />
				</em>and the adverbs
				<em>where, when </em>and<em> how</em> cannot be omitted.<br />
				As is almost always the case with adverb relative clauses, in 
				all these cases, their function is restrictive.</li>
				<li><em>The child <span class="style_black"><strong>playing on the swings</strong></span> has fallen off.</em><br />
				This is a post-modifying, non-finite -<em>ing</em> clause.&nbsp; 
				Other examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man playing the bagpipes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing taking up most space</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				This can also be seen as a reduced relative pronoun clause akin 
				to:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child who was playing on the swings 
				has fallen off.</em></li>
				<li><em>We need a boat <strong>t</strong><span class="style_black"><strong>o go over to the island</strong></span>.</em><br />
				This is sometimes called the infinitive of purpose although 
				it is actually a reduction of <em>in order to</em>, a 
				complex subordinator.<br />
				It is, in this case, non-restrictive because the boat is not 
				being defined, it is being described.</li>
				<li><em>The house <span class="style_black"><strong>built by the river</strong></span> is delightful.<br />
				</em>This is a post-modifying, non-finite <em>-ed / -en </em>
				clause.&nbsp; Other examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cars made here are cheap but reliable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window broken by the children has been repaired</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				This can also be seen as a reduced relative pronoun clause akin 
				to:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house which has been built by the 
				river is delightful.<br />
				</em>Again, this is a restrictive or defining clause.</li>
				<li><em>The house <span class="style_black"><strong>on the river 
				</strong> </span>is delightful.</em><br />
				This is another prepositional-phrase post-modifier and is 
				restrictive or defining.</li>

			Sentence A is an example of this.&nbsp; They are primarily the <em>any-, every-, some-, 
			no- </em>series, combining with <em>-thing, -body, -one</em> or the 
			pronoun use of <em>else</em> as in these 
			examples:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>I need something <span class="style_black"><strong>heavier</strong></span> to hold it down</em></li>
				<li><em>Have you got anything <span class="style_black"><strong>smaller</strong></span>?</em></li>
				<li><em>I have everything <span class="style_black"><strong>necessary</strong></span> for the job</em></li>
				<li><em>I have nothing <span class="style_black"><strong>useful</strong></span> to add</em></li>
				<li><em>We need someone <span class="style_black"><strong>strong</strong></span></em></li>
				<li>
				<em>What else <span class="style_black"><strong>important</strong></span> have we forgotten?</em></li>
				<li>
				<em><a name="1"></a>Who else <span class="style_black"><strong>interesting</strong></span> was there?</em></li>

				<li class="greybullet"><em>*Somebody wet came to the door.</em></li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>*Nobody satisfied left the

			</ul>
			<p id="first" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">The 
			reason is that post-modification of this set of pronouns can only be 
			done with adjectives which have a sense of a <strong>permanent</strong> 
			quality.&nbsp; In these examples, <em>frightened, wet</em> and <em>
			satisfied</em> are clearly temporary states.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somebody less self-confident would have failed.<br />
			</em>Here, 
			the sense of <em>self-confident </em>is of a permanent personality 
			trait.</p>

					It is not true to say that this series of pronouns can
			<span class="style_underline">never</span> be pre-modified but when 
			it happens it is usually done for comic effect:
			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>An unpleasant something is in the

				<li class="greybullet"><em>A vicious anything is not

					<h3>Permanent and temporary attributes</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>The distinction between permanent and temporary attributes of 
			adjectives does not only apply to pronoun modification.&nbsp; For 
			example, it is possibly to have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dinner is ready<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dinner was delicious<br />
			</em>because post-modification signals a temporary
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>or</strong></span> permanent 
			condition but it is not possible to have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The ready dinner<br />
			</em>because that refers to a temporary state although<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The delicious dinner<br />
			</em>is possible because it refers to the permanent condition of the 
			food.<br />
			There is more on this distinction in the guide to adjectives, linked 
			below.</p>

			<p>Some adjectives, often borrowed from other languages, 
			occur after the noun (i.e., post-modify routinely) because English has borrowed the word grammar 
			with the word:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>We have strawberries 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>galore</strong></span> </em>
				(from Irish)</li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>He's the president 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>elect</strong></span> </em>
				(from French)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other examples include <em>court <span class="style_black">
			<strong>martial</strong></span>, heir 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>apparent</strong></span>, chicken 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>&agrave; 
			la Provençale</strong></span></em> etc.&nbsp; A longer list is in 
			the guide to adjectives.</p>
			<p>When we have <strong>a string of adjectives</strong>, they are 
			quite often in the post-modification position:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>John, <span class="style_black">
				<strong>over-confident and arrogant</strong></span> as 
				usual, 
				strode into the room</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This sort of thing is often considered a reduced, non-defining relative clause 
			of some sort:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John, who was overconfident and arrogant as usual, strode 
			into the room.<br />
			</em>It is not, in fact, because in our 
			example, we are simply using the adjectives to describe John 
			generally, not how he was on that day.<br />
			The other issue is, of course, that non-defining relative clauses 
			cannot be reduced.&nbsp; We allow, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used the tools Mary lent me to finish the 
			job<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used the tools which Mary lent me to finish 
			the job<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used the tools, which Mary lent me, to 
			finish the job<br />
			</em>but we cannot have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I used the tools, Mary lent me, to finish 
			the job.</em></p>

			can be understood in two ways, like this:<br />
			<img alt="ambiguity" height="78" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituents_preposition.jpg" width="400" /><br />
			In the first sentence, the <strong>verb</strong> is being

			phrase is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>spoke ... behind the bar</em><br />
			In the second sentence, the <strong>noun</strong> is being 
			post-modified and the object noun phrase is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the man behind the bar</em><br />
			When the first sense is intended, speakers will insert a slight 
			pause between <em>the man</em> and <em>behind the bar</em>, making 
			two tone units each with a stressed syllable: <em>the </em><strong>
			<em>man</em></strong> and <em>behind the </em><strong><em>bar</em></strong>.<br />

			<p>We saw, above, that post-modifying adverb and pronoun relative 
			clauses are finite insofar as the verb takes inflexion for number 
			and tense.&nbsp; Many more clauses used to post-modify noun phrases 
			are non-finite.<br />
			There are three flavours.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>-<em>ing</em> participle clauses</strong></dt>
				<dd>
			usually refer to an ongoing state or a progressive action 
			(are, i.e., continuous, iterative or progressive in terms of aspect).&nbsp; 
				They can be considered reduced relative pronoun clauses with the 
				form of the verb <em>be</em> and the pronoun omitted.<br />
			For example:
			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>The house 
				<span class="style_black">being built</span> on the 
				corner will look lovely.</em></li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>The boy <span class="style_black">working</span> on his homework 
				looks a bit tired.</em></li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>The man <span class="style_black">spending</span> all the money 
				has won the lottery.</em></li>
			</ul>
			but can refer to prospective events or states as in, e.g.:<ul>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>The train
				<span class="style_black">taking </span>us to the airport will 
				be crowded</em>.</li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>The students
				<span class="style_black">sitting</span> the examination tomorrow 
				are nervous.</em></li>
			</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>past participle <em>-ed / -en</em> clauses</strong></dt>
				<dd>
			usually relate a past action or state to a present or 
			subsequent state or action (i.e., are perfect in terms of aspect).&nbsp; 
			These, too, are sometimes analysed as passive clauses or as reduced 
			relative clauses (and the latter type of analysis is the one you 
			will find on this site in the guide to relative pronoun clauses).<br />
			The most common connecting preposition is <em>by</em> but <em>with</em> 
			and <em>(out) of</em> are possible:
			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>The letter

			There some restrictions here with the <em>out of </em>expression 
			generally reserved for verbs meaning <em>made</em> in some sense 
			such as <em>built, constructed, fabricated, manufactured</em> etc.&nbsp; 
			Other verbs are generally found with the <em>of</em> or <em>with</em> 
			expressions:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an office block built
			<span class="style_black">out of </span>concrete and glass<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a roof reinforced out of steel<br />
			</em>A further restriction is that <em>out of</em> and <em>with</em> 
			imply a constituent material and <em>of</em> implies that the 
			material is the sole constituent:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cake made <span class="style_black">with</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cake made <span class="style_black">out of</span> cream,

				<dt><strong><em>to</em>-infinitive clauses</strong></dt>
				<dd>
			usually refer to a future or following action or state 
			(i.e., are prospective in terms of aspect).<ul>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>The next bus 
				<span class="style_black">to arrive </span>will be 
				the 14:30 to Manchester.</em></li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>A good restaurant 
				<span class="style_black">to visit</span> is the 
				Golden Horn.</em></li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>The instructions 
				<span class="style_black">to follow</span> are 
				written on the box.</em></li>
			</ul>
			All of these can, of course, be re-written with relative clauses 
			but that route is often the one to rather clumsy sentences like<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The instructions which you are to follow are ... </em>.<br />
			Non-finite clauses are economical and elegant.</dd>
			</dl>
			
			It is worth bearing in mind that English is slightly unusual in this 
			respect and many languages do not use non-finite clauses, even if 
			they exist, in this way.&nbsp; This is one reason why learners may 
			often select a rather clumsy formulation because they are unaware 
			that a more elegant solution is available.<br />
			All the following can be  rephrased more elegantly by the use of 
			non-finite clauses:<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>The book which he wrote while he 
				was in prison has become a best seller<br />
				</em>is better as<br /><em>The book written while he was in prison has become a best seller</em></li>
				<li><em>The vase that the child broke was 
				very valuable.<br />
				</em>is better as<br /><em>The vase broken by the child was very valuable.</em></li>
				<li><em>The 8 o'clock bus is always busy 
				and noisy with the children who are going to school</em><br />
				is better as<br />
				<em>The 8 o'clock bus is always busy and noisy with children 
				going to school</em></li>
				<li><em>The thing which we all need to 
				understand is that we don't have the resources<br />
				</em>is better as<br /><em>The thing to understand is that we don't have the resources.</em></li>
				<li><em>A place which you should visit is 
				the Guggenheim Museum<br />
				</em>is better as<br /><em>A place to visit is the Guggenheim Museum</em></li>

			<p>There are times when it is not possible at all to form 
					the parallel finite relative clause, at least, not without making 
					changes.</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><strong>Relational verbal processes</strong>.<br />
				Relational verbs, as the name implies are verbs which describe 
				the relations between items and they can take the <em>-ing</em> 
				form when acting as post-modifiers in non-finite clauses.&nbsp; They 
				are often, slightly misleadingly, referred to as stative.&nbsp; It is 
				the use of the verb which is stative, not the verb itself.<br />
				We can have, for example:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>A tie neatly matching his shirt – The tie matched</em> 
					(not <em>was matching</em>) <em>his shirt</em></li>
					<li><em>A number closely approximating to 10 – The number 
					approximates</em> (not i<em>s approximating</em>) <em>to 10</em></li>
					<li><em>A proposal clearly smacking of authoritarianism – 
					The proposal smacks </em>(not <em>is smacking</em>) <em>of 
					authoritarianism</em></li>
					<li><em>A scent recalling the Mediterranean – A scent 
					(which/that) recalls </em>(not <em>is recalling</em>) the<em> 
					Mediterranean</em></li>
					<li><em>A soup consisting mostly of beans – The soup (which 
					/ that) consists </em>(not <em>is consisting</em>)<em> 
					mostly of beans</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>We can also use <strong>verbs which express <em>in the state of</em></strong> 
				so we get non-finite modifiers such as in:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>Dave, being old, 
					knows the right answer<br />
					</em>but not</li>
					<li><em>*Dave, who is being old, knows the right answer</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The other issue is one of <strong>tense</strong>.&nbsp; If there 
				is a tense shift, the relative clause conversion will not work, 
				whatever type of verbal process is used.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>A tree falling on my car did the damage</em><br />
					from which we can’t make a relative clause easily because 
					you don’t mean:<br />
					<em>A tree which is falling on my car</em><br />
					but you do mean<br />
					<em>A tree which <strong>fell</strong> on my car</em></li>
					<li><em>You will see a woman waiting for you</em><br />
					is not the same as<br />
					<em>You will see a woman who is waiting for you<br />
					</em>because you mean<br /><em>You will see a woman who
					<strong>will be</strong> waiting for you</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To summarise:<br />
			Verbs may take the <em>-ing</em> form in post-modifying non-finite 
			clauses without having a corresponding form in the relative clause.&nbsp; 
			That is especially but not exclusively true of relational verbs.</p>

			<p>All the preceding should have alerted you to the fact that 
			post-modification is not to be taken lightly.&nbsp; It is, however, 
			important for all learners to be able to handle the devices 
			confidently.&nbsp; This is especially true in writing (and for those 
			learners for whom academic or formal writing skills are important, 
			knowledge of how to post-modify noun phrases is essential).<br />
			Here are some suggestions.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style10">
				<tr>
					<td valign="top">
					<img alt="focus" height="133" src="../../images/birds_focus200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style9">
					<h3>Focus on one at a time</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There's little point in overwhelming learners with a mishmash of 
			different types of post-modification and it makes sense, therefore, 
			to focus on one sort at a time.&nbsp; Here's a suggestion of the 
			order in which to tackle the area:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The easiest are prepositional phrases because the area is 
				already well known to many learners.<br />
				Transforming, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cupboard is under the stairs</em><br />
				to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cupboard under the stairs</em><br />
				does not require high-level analysis.<br />
				It is significant, however, that the simple post-modification 
				with an adverb is 
				often avoided by learners even at higher levels so the 
				unnatural:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results are above and indicate ...</em><br />
				instead of the preferable:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results above indicate ...</em></li>
				<li>Adverb post-modifiers concern only a few common enough 
				adverbs and are also quite easy to tackle.<br />
				The small complication in this area is that fact that only some words 
				can be adverbial and adjectival so, while we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The toilet downstairs</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The downstairs toilet</em><br />
				we cannot have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The ahead road</em><br />
				instead of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The road ahead<br />
				</em>because <em>ahead</em> is only adverbial.</li>
				<li>The <em>any-, some-, no-, every-</em> set of pronouns can be 
				taken as a discrete area because the rule is clear: all of them 
				are conventionally post-modified (and <em>else</em> may be 
				included at higher levels).<br />
				Here, the complication to make clear is that the adjective which 
				post-modifies the pronoun must describe a <strong>permanent</strong> 
				quality so, for example,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somebody strange came to the door</em><br />
				is acceptable, but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Somebody tired came to the door</em><br />
				is not.<br />
				See below for more.</li>
				<li>Clausal post-modification needs handling with relative 
				clauses and requires a staged approach.&nbsp; Again, mixing up 
				the types will just confuse and bewilder your learners.<br />
				Here, the complication is that first languages such as Korean, 
				which do not have a relative clause structure, make it difficult 
				for their speakers to learn how relative clauses are constructed 
				in English.&nbsp; Once learned, however, they may be overused so 
				learners may prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The restaurant which was destroyed in the 
				fire</em><br />
				to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The restaurant destroyed in the fire</em><br />
				because that is how they have been told English post-modifies 
				nouns.&nbsp; It is important to be clear that relative clauses 
				are not the only way to post-modify a noun phrase.<br />
				Non-finite clauses, in particular, can be a mysterious area for 
				many learners and need handling in small chunks.<br />
				The aspectual nature of non-finite post-modification is not 
				parallelled in many languages so the presentation needs to make 
				it clear that:<ol class="auto-style56">
					<li>-<em>ing</em> participles refer to continuous, iterative 
					or progressive states or events so we have, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man with the dog playing the 
					piano on Saturday nights is really talented</em> (iterative)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl singing now is terrible</em> 
					(progressive)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man living on the corner is very 
					helpful to his neighbours</em> (continuous)<br />
					and can refer to the future as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The film coming to the cinema soon is one to miss</em> 
					(prospective)</li>
					<li>past participle forms relate two events or states in 
					time, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The furniture broken in the fight was 
					replaced</em> (pre-past embedded in the past)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man hurt in the fight is in 
					hospital</em> (past embedded in the present)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work done today will be 
					appreciated</em> (present embedded in the future)</li>
					<li><em>to-</em>infinitive forms are usually prospective, 
					even when they are set in the past or the future, so we 
					have, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The place to go first is the pub on 
					the corner</em> (prospective from the present)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The place to visit was the theatre at 
					Epidaurus</em> (prospective in the past)<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The book to read will be his next novel </em>(prospective 
					in the future)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Other adjectival post-modification is comparatively rare and 
				there are a number of exceptional cases (see the references to 
				oddballs above).&nbsp; This area may be best handled on a 
				case-by-case basis, dealing with them as they occur in texts or 
				have been noticed.<br />
				The exception to this is the regularity of -<em>ible</em> and -<em>able</em> 
				adjectives used this way as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only problem discernible was the time 
				factor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The men expendable were sent out first<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the land obtainable had been bought</em><br />
				This will not work with <strong>all</strong> these adjective 
				forms and trying it with some will produce questionable or 
				malformed expression such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The work achievable was finished.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The policy discernible was mistaken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A suggestion arguable was made.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<h3><em>any-, some-, no-, every-</em></h3>
			<p>Presenting the area isn't hard; that can be done <em>via</em> a dialogue 
			or a noticing exercise such as:</p>

			<p>Three things should come out of this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbullet">The target adjective position after 
				<em>something, anything, everything</em> etc.</li>
				<li class="redbullet">That other adjectives usually precede 
				the noun.</li>
				<li class="redbullet">That most adjectives can be used 
				predicatively and attributively.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Controlled practice can involve sentence re-ordering tasks, gap 
			fill, sentence completion tasks and so on.</p>
			<p>Slightly less controlled practice can have learners making true 
			sentences about their environment from adjectives you (or they) 
			supply.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style57"><em>new + class: there's somebody <span class="style_black">new</span> in the class<br />
			edible + refrigerator: there's nothing <span class="style_black">
			edible</span> in the fridge<br />
			attractive + wall: there's something <span class="style_black">attractive</span> on the wall<br />
			</em>This can be extended to guessing games:<br /><em>I'm thinking of something <span class="style_black">beautiful</span> in the garden<br />
			There's nothing 
			<span class="style_black">useful</span> in what I'm thinking about<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<p>To raise awareness of the limitation to permanent states, 
			learners can be invited to notice why, for example, of the following 
			pairs of sentences, only one is acceptable:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><em>Nothing useful came out of the meeting<br />
				Nobody happy was there</em></li>
				<li><em>Something elastic is needed<br />
				Something closed is needed</em></li>
				<li><em>Everybody European needs a visa<br />
				Everybody puzzled wanted an answer</em></li>
			</ul>

					<td class="auto-style9">
					<h3>Prepositional phrase building</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Starting with a simple sentence, learners can build 
			post-modification with prompts from you:</p>
			<p class="auto-style57"><em>There was a vase. | </em><span class="style_red"><em>where?</em></span><br /><em>There was a vase in the corner | </em><span class="style_red"><em>
			which corner?</em></span><br /><em>There was a vase in the corner of the dining room | </em>
			<span class="style_red"><em>where exactly?</em></span><br /><em>There was a vase in the corner of the dining room by the door I </em>
			<span class="style_red"><em>when did you see it?</em></span><br /><em>There was a vase in the corner of the dining room by the door 
			yesterday evening</em></p>
			<p>and so on with a different starter sentence.</p>
			<p>The same can be done with adverb post-modifiers, of course, and 
			there's a much more limited set to choose from.</p>

			</table>
			<p>At higher levels, noticing first, some text analysis and then a 
			task to draft, write, improve and polish a text of your own can be 
			effective and constructive.&nbsp; It needn't be a long text because 
			post-modification is useful for compressing data.</p>
