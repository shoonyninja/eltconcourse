		Here's a definition from Parrott who avers that relative clauses are:</p>
		<p class="indentpara">
		complex structures which allow the speaker to express themselves 
		succinctly and fluently<br />
		<span class="auto-style65">(Parrott, 2000, p. 381)</span></p>
		<p>
		They actually do rather more than that but it's a good working 
		definition to begin with.</p>
		<p>
		Relative pronoun clauses are usually said to be clauses starting with <em>
		who(m), that, which, whose</em> defining or identifying the 
		noun they follow.<br />
		So, for example, in<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog which howled all night and kept me awake 
		belongs to my neighbour<br />
		</em>The noun, <em>dog</em>, is rendered unique among millions of dogs 
		because only this one howled and caused a sleepless night.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="two ways" height="133" src="../../images/rail_divide200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style56">
					<h3>Relative pronoun clause <em>vs.</em> adjective clause</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
			<p>
		In that sentence, the relative clause, <em>which howled all night and 
		kept me awake</em>, is acting to modify the noun, <em>dog</em>, and that 
		makes it adjectival in function.&nbsp; For this reason, some analyses 
		will refer to these structures as post-nominal adjectival modifiers (Celce-Murcia 
		&amp; Larsen-Freeman, 1999: 571) or adjective clauses (Yule, 1998: 240).<br />
		We'll stick with relative pronoun clause here because it is more 
		familiar but those two descriptors are equally valid.&nbsp; If you 
			prefer to call these structures adjectival clauses, simple replace 
			the terms mentally in what follows.<br />
		The key point is that relative pronoun clauses modify and/or identify an 
		already specified noun phrase and in that sense they are akin to 
		adjectival phrases and clauses.</p>
			<p>
			Relative pronoun clauses also vary from other types of 
			post-modifiers of nouns in the level of explicitness they bring to 
			the reference.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who waited in the queue</em><br />
			is quite specific about the man and identifies him uniquely, but:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man waiting in the queue</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man in the queue</em><br />
			are both considerably less explicit about the man and there could be 
			other men in the queue.<br />
			The other noteworthy issue is that, because relative clauses are 
			usually finite (insofar as the verb carries markers for tense and 
			person), we can identify with greater specificity when the event or 
			state occurs.&nbsp; In the three examples above, only the first, 
			with a relative pronoun clause, allows us to set the event in time.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The man waiting in the queue will make a complaint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man waiting in the queue has made a complaint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man in the queue made a complaint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man in the queue will have made a complaint</em><br />
			etc. in which the tense form is not marked in the subject of the 
			verb <em>make</em>.<br />
			However,<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who had been waiting in the queue made a 
			complaint</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			sets the waiting in time by its tense form (in this case, past 
			perfect progressive).</p>
			<p>
		The grammatical function of relative pronoun clauses is one of subordination to which there is
		a guide on this site, linked below in the list of related guides at the 
		end.<br />
			That they are subordinate is made clear by their removal from a 
			sentence.&nbsp; If, for example, we start with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the car which caused the accident</em><br />
			we cannot remove the relative pronoun and leave two well-formed 
			clauses:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's the car.&nbsp; Caused the accident.</em></p>
		<p>
		Some languages, see below, rely on using adjectival expressions alone to 
		do this task, having nothing remotely like the English relative pronoun 
		structures.&nbsp; For speakers from these language backgrounds, the 
		concepts and meaning are, initially, at least, obscure.</p>

		<p>
		If you are wondering why<em> where, why, when </em>and<em> how </em>are not 
		in the list above, the answer is that these words are analysed elsewhere 
		in the guide to relative adverbs, linked below.<br />
		Relative <span class="style_underline">pronouns</span>, as the name 
		implies, are words which stand for a noun, a gerund, a noun phrase or a 
		nominalised clause (i.e., different sorts of nouns).<br />
		If the word refers to <em>why, where</em>, <em>when</em> or <em>how</em> an action is carried out 
		or a state exists, it is an adverb, not a pronoun and does not belong 
		here.<br />
		That relative pronouns and relative adverbs appear to be structurally related is not 
		in question but relative adverbs function differently and perform 
		different grammatical tasks.&nbsp; Relative adverbs cannot, for example, appear as 
		the objects or subjects of verbs (because they aren't nouns of any 
		sort).&nbsp; One relative adverb, <em>how</em>, cannot refer to a noun 
		at all.</p>
			<p>
			One good reason for keeping the concepts of adverb and pronoun 
			relative clauses separate is that, as we saw above, relative pronoun 
			clauses act syntactically and semantically to subordinate one clause 
			to another.&nbsp; Relative adverbs clauses, on the other hand, are 
			coordinating and their removal leaves two well-formed clauses which 
			can stand alone.&nbsp; If, for example, you remove the adverb from:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the house where he got married</em><br />
			you get<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the house.&nbsp; He got married</em><br />
			and, although some sense is lost, the clauses are, nevertheless, 
			potentially independent.</p>
			<p>
		As we shall shortly see, relative pronouns are distinguished by the 
		functions they perform in sentences, technically their relationship to 
		the arguments (most commonly subject, direct object, indirect object 
		etc.).<br />
		Understanding how to use them relies on being able to untangle 
		the grammatical functions of phrases and clauses in sentences.</p>

		</table>
		
			<p>
			Before we can discuss meaning, we need to look at the usual 
			structure of relative pronoun clauses.<br />
			If we take two simple sentences such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lucky children came to the party</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The children enjoyed themselves</em><br />
			we can make a single complex sentence as:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; The lucky children who came to the party enjoyed themselves</em><br />
			The two simple sentences form what is known as the kernels of the 
			more complex sentence.</p>
			<p>
			How did this happen?<br />
			The first thing to do is identify the <strong>Head</strong> of the 
			subject noun phrase.&nbsp; In this case, in the first sentence, it 
			is the noun <em>children</em> which happens to be pre-modified by 
			the adjective <em>lucky</em>.&nbsp; In the second sentence the same noun 
			is not pre-modified by an adjective but in both cases there is a 
			pre-modifying determiner, <em>the</em>.</p>
			<p>
			Following Chomsky, we can make the rules for doing this conversion, 
			like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Place the second clause after the first noun phrase in the 
				first sentence (in other words, embed the whole clause within 
				the second clause).<br />
				That gives us:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> The lucky children the children came to the party 
				enjoyed themselves</em></li>
				<li>Now delete the second noun phrase:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lucky children <strong><span class="auto-style86">the 
				children</span> </strong>came to the party enjoyed themselves</li>
				<li>Now replace it with the appropriate relative pronoun, in 
				this case <em>who</em> because the reference is to people.<br />
				That then gives us:<br />
				&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The lucky children <span class="style_red"><strong>who
				</strong></span>came to the party enjoyed themselves</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Later, we shall see how the pronoun can be omitted, too, when we 
			are dealing with the object noun phrase.<br />
			The process above may seem quite simple to speakers of languages 
			which use relative pronouns in the way that English does.&nbsp; 
			However, for those whose first languages do not do so, or who use 
			relative clauses very differently (i.e., most non-Indo-European 
			languages) it is not a simple transformation and taking people

			They will require a good deal of practice at doing this for

			<p>Here's a final example in which it is possible to omit or include

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clothes, which she had never worn, went to the charity

			</em>vs.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clothes which she had never worn went to the charity shop<br />
			</em>In the first sentence, the subject of the verb <em>went</em> is
			<span class="style_underline"><em>the clothes</em></span> and the 
			sentence means that <em>all the clothes went to the charity shop</em>.<br />
			In the second sentence, the subject of the verb <em>went</em> is
			<span class="style_underline"><em>the clothes which she had never 
			worn</em></span> and the sentence means that <em>there were other 
			clothes which did not go to the charity shop</em>.</p>
			<p>It is worth noting here that we use defining relative clauses 
			only when the noun <strong>needs</strong> defining.&nbsp; If we take 
			the sentence:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My twin brother, who lives in France, speaks 
			excellent French</em><br />
			we know from the outset that the speaker has only one twin brother 
			and he lives in France.&nbsp; There is no need, therefore, to define 
			the noun and a non-restrictive clause is used.<br />
			However, if we take a sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who worked in the bar was his twin 
			brother</em><br />
			we are much more likely to use a defining or restrictive clause 
			because, semantically, the noun <em>man</em> is so vague (there are, 
			approximately, 3.6 billion men in the world).<br />
			This is not a grammatical issue; it is to do with the type of noun 
			in question and whether it needs defining so is semantic.<br />
			Equally, if the noun in question has already been defined, there is 
			no need to have recourse to another defining clause.&nbsp; Compare, 
			for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That book over there, which I bought in 
			Margate, contains the reference I need</em><br />
			with<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book which I bought in Margate contains 
			the reference I need</em><br />
			In the first case, we have a demonstrative determiner, <em>that</em>, 
			which defines the book.&nbsp; Moreover, we have the prepositional 
			phrase <em>over there</em> which further defines the book in 
			question.&nbsp; Accordingly, a non-restrictive, non-defining clause 
			naturally follows.<br />
			In the second case, we have no such restrictive determiner because 
			the definite article, while referring to a specific noun, does not 
			define it.&nbsp; Therefore, in the second case, a restrictive or 
			defining relative clause is more likely to be used.<br />
			In fact, a sentences such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That book over there which I bought in 
			Margate contains the reference I need</em><br />
			is very unusual and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;*That book over there with the red cover which I bought 
			in Margate contains the reference I need</em><br />
			would probably be rejected by most people.<br />
			In this case, the issue is neither semantic nor grammatical; it is 
			pragmatic.</p>

			<p>When we ask <em>wh</em>-questions, we are forced to use defining

				<li><em>The woman, who(m) you met at the party, is his sister</em></li>
				<li><em>The woman who(m) you met at the party is his sister</em></li>

			<ol class="auto-style62">

			<p>The difference between restrictive / defining and non-restrictive 
			/ non-defining relative clauses is not just a grammatical wrinkle in 
			English because the meaning the speaker / writer conveys differs 
			very significantly depending on which type of clause is used.<br />
		The key point is that defining clauses give <strong>required</strong> 
		information whereas non-defining clauses give <strong>additional</strong> 
		information.<br />
			The distinction is a familiar one concerning given and new 
			information.</p>
		<p>For example, in these two sentences, we have a clear distinction in 
		meaning:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style62">
			<li><em>The woman, who arrived at the hotel this evening, has gone 
			out</em></li>
			<li><em>The woman who arrived at the hotel this evening has gone out</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>In sentence a., both speaker and hearer are aware of the existence of 
		the woman and know to whom reference is being made.&nbsp; The 
		information about the hotel is new.<br />
		In sentence b., this is not the case and the speaker selects the grammar 
		accordingly because the necessary information to distinguish the woman 
		in question is needed for comprehension.&nbsp; The assumption in 
		sentence b. is that the hearer already knows about the woman <strong>and</strong> 
		that she arrived at the hotel.&nbsp; The only new information is that 
		she has gone out.<br />
		This is even clearer when we use names rather than common nouns.&nbsp; 
		Compare, for example:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style62" start="3">
			<li><em>Margaret, who arrived at the hotel this evening, has gone 
			out</em></li>
			<li><em>Margaret who arrived at the hotel this evening has gone out</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>In sentence c., the person referred to is known to both speaker and 
		hearer and the information about the hotel is peripheral but probably 
		new to the hearer (why else state it?).<br />
		Sentence d. is very strange and it is difficult to imagine it ever being 
		produced unless there are two Margarets to whom reference may be being 
		made and the speaker needs to disambiguate to refer only to one of them.&nbsp; 
		In this case, the speaker assumes that the hearer knows there are two 
		possible people called Margaret to whom reference is being made <strong>
		and</strong> that one of them arrived at the hotel and one did not.</p>
		<p>One way to explain this distinction to learners whose languages may 
		not make any distinction at all between the two types of clause is to 
		consider a simple attributive adjective phrase in a sentence such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The hardworking students passed the examination</em><br />
		which is ambiguous because this may mean either:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The students who worked hard passed the examination</em> 
		(and other students, less hardworking, did not)<br />
		or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The students, who worked hard, passed the examination</em> 
		(all of them)<br />
		and to make it clear what is meant, i.e., to disambiguate the sentence, 
		we have resorted to the use of a defining or non-defining relative 
		clause.<br />
		For more on how relative pronoun clauses serve to disambiguate, see the 
		guide to ambiguity, linked below.</p>
		<p>It is difficult to signal what is meant by intonation in the adjective 
		phrase, although stressing the adjective strongly might show that a 
		restrictive meaning is intended.&nbsp; In the written form, no 
		punctuation changes can be made to show what is meant, although one 
		could resort to underlining or other emphasis markers.<br />
		The two relative pronoun clauses are much more easily distinguished by 
		intonation and punctuation signals.&nbsp; See below.</p>
			<p>Non-restrictive or non-defining relative clauses are not, 
			naturally, the only way to achieve the effect of post-modifying the 
			noun phrase.&nbsp; There are two non-finite clause types that can 
			function in the same way:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>using an -<em>ing</em> form:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manager, checking the accounts, 
				noticed the missing money</em><br />which could be  rephrased as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manager, who checked the accounts, 
				noticed the missing money</em></li>
				<li>using a past participle in a passive clause:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theft, discovered by the manager, was 
				reported to the police</em><br />which could be  rephrased as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theft, which was discovered by the 
				manager, was reported to the police</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This kind of post-modification of the noun phrase is generally 
			non-restrictive so the defining or restrictive forms without commas 
			do not provide the same sense:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>The manager who checked the accounts 
				noticed the missing money<br /></em>Implies that there were other managers who did not check 
				the accounts.</li>
				<li><em>The theft which was discovered by the 
				manager was reported to the police<br /></em>Implies that there were other thefts which remained 
				undetected or that other thefts were detected by other people.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>By the same token,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theft discovered by the manager was 
			reported to the police</em><br />
			without commas or pausing, can imply that there were other thefts, 
			undiscovered by the manager, which remained unreported.<br />
			It is not possible to have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The manager checked the accounts noticed the 
			missing money</em><br />
			for reasons to which we will shortly turn.</p>

		</table>
		
			<p>The second concern in the field of meaning of relative pronoun 
			clauses is the way in which they can be used to compress information 
			and make communication more efficient.&nbsp; We could state, for 
			example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The guest complained.&nbsp; The guest was in 
			Room 310.&nbsp; The room is near the air-conditioning fans.&nbsp; 
			The fans make a noise.&nbsp; The noise was the problem.</p>
			<p>or we can compress the data with relative clauses to produce:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The guest <strong>who</strong> was in Room 
			310, <strong>which</strong> is near the air-conditioning fans, which 
			make a noise, complained about the noise <strong>that</strong> they 
			made.</p>
			<p>which is more efficient, more fluent and altogether more 
			sophisticated in terms of information packaging.&nbsp; It actually 
			contains four relative clauses, two defining and two non-defining.</p>

				<td class="auto-style56">
		
			<h3>Theme and rheme</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
			<p>The third issue concerning meaning is the way in which relative 
			clauses link themes to rhemes.</p>
			<p>If the terms theme and rheme are unfamiliar to you, you can check 
			the guide on this site, linked in the list of related guides at the 
			end.&nbsp; For now, however, it is enough to explain that the terms 
			refer to how longer pieces of discourse are made coherent and 
			cohesive by the way in which information is linked.<br />
			Here's an example, using a relative pronoun clause:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The parents eventually came to collect the 
			children who had been waiting in the rain outside the school.&nbsp; 
			By then, they were soaked through and thoroughly miserable.</p>
			<p>In that short passage, the theme is:</p>
			<p><em>The parents</em> and the rheme is all that follows it:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eventually came to collect the children</em>.<br />
			The rheme then becomes the theme of the next clause,<em> who</em>, 
			which stands for <em>the children</em> and the pronoun has its own 
			rheme:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had been waiting in the rain outside the school<br />
			</em>The next clause reiterates that theme as <em>by then, they </em>
			which has its own rheme:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were soaked through and thoroughly miserable</em>.<br />
			The fact that they were unhappy will, probably, form the next theme 
			and so on for the rest of the discourse.</p>
			<p>All that is relevant here is that one of the common ways that 
			theme-rheme connections are made is via the use of
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>defining</strong></span> 
			relative clauses.&nbsp; Non-defining relative clauses do not do this 
			as, for example, in:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>The boss, who came in early every morning, 
			took the call.&nbsp; The contact was from the customer in Canada 
			wanting to know where his consignment was.</em></p>
			<p>in which the theme is <em>The boss, who came in early every 
			morning</em> (not just <em>the boss</em>) and the theme is <em>took 
			the call</em>.&nbsp; As we would expect <em>the call </em>forms the 
			theme of the following part of the discourse with <em>the 
			consignment</em> following on as the next rheme.<br />
			The fact that the boss <em>came in early every morning</em> is 
			additional information and part of the first theme.&nbsp; It does 
			not form part of the rheme or go on to be a theme in itself.</p>

			<p>If you find this analysis hard going, it does not matter for now.&nbsp; 
			It is, however, important that you are aware of the fact that 
			relative clauses do four things concerned with meaning:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>They can act to restrict the scope of the subject of a 
				clause by defining.</li>
				<li>They can act on the subject non-restrictively by merely 
				adding information.</li>
				<li>They can make texts cohesive and coherent.</li>
				<li>They can compress information to make texts, whether spoken or

			things happen:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li class="style_brown">You insert a slight pause before the 
				relative pronoun (and often, after the relative clause itself).</li>
				<li class="style_brown">Your voice tone lowers and you may speak 
				more quickly and quietly when you say the relative clause.</li>
			</ul>
		
			<p>It looks like this:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Non-defining / non-restricted relative clause:</strong></dt>
				<dd>
			<img alt="non-defining" height="37" src="../../imagesgraphics/relative_non-define.png" width="465" /></dd>
				<dd>The voice tone falls on the relative clause and it is usually spoken 
			more quickly with small pauses before and after it.<br />
			In this case, the prepositional-phrase adverbial which pre-modifies 
			the verb <em>invited</em> is just <em>At the first meeting</em><br />
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Defining / restricted relative clause:</strong></dt>
				<dd>
			<img alt="defining" height="35" src="../../imagesgraphics/relative_define.png" width="465" /></dd>
				<dd>The voice tone rises towards the end of the relative clause and the 
			key information may be spoken more slowly and emphatically.<br />
			If the key information concerns the fact that this was the first 
			meeting among many held yesterday, the pitch across the sentence may 
			look rather different but still be distinguishable as a defining 
			relative clause:<br />
			<img alt="defining" height="34" src="../../imagesgraphics/relative_define2.png" width="465" /></dd>
				<dd>In both latter cases, the adverbial phrase pre-modifying the verb 
				<em>invited</em> is <em>At the first meeting which was held yesterday.</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The other pronunciation issue is that the relative pronouns <em>
			who</em> and <em>that</em> in particular are usually unstressed to 
			the point of inaudibility and may not be audible at all to learners.&nbsp; 
			This leads to a certain ambiguity of structure so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who bought the car is here</em><br />
			may be heard as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man bought the car is here</em><br />
			and that, in turn, could persuade learners that the subject relative 
			pronoun is omissible when it isn't.<br />
			A little attention to severely unstressed syllables in rapid speech 
			is called for to allow learners to identify the target structure 
			accurately.</p>

				<p>These are called central relative pronouns because they are

				<p>The use of the pronoun <em>what</em> as a relative pronoun 
				occurs but is 
				confined to a special kind of relative clause called a nominal 
				or fused relative clause and that is explained below.&nbsp; Here 
				is one example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I told him to do what he likes with the money.<br />
				</em>Also in fused relative clauses, the -<em>ever</em> series 
				of pronouns (<em>whoever, whatever </em>etc.) are analysable as

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave food to whoever seemed to need it.</em></p>

				<p>Although the use is rare and probably dying out, the word <em>

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people <strong>who</strong> came to

				and we have a simple relative pronoun structure with the pronoun
				<em>who</em>.&nbsp; We can also have, however:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such people <strong>as</strong> came to

				and, while there is a sense that not enough people came, the

				<h3>Case</h3></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are three cases in English grammar which can be distinguished 
			in relative clauses and in other parts of the pronoun system.&nbsp; 
			We shall see below that the case of the pronoun is important in 
			terms of structure.<br />
			Here's a quick reminder of what they are:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>subject or nominative case</strong></dt>
				<dd>The nominative case is represented by three relative 
				pronouns:<ol>
					<li><em>who</em>: is used to refer to people for the most 
					part, although animals also qualify for its use in certain 
					circumstances and so do groups of people represented by 
					collective nouns.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person who asked the question was 
					happy with the answer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't my dog who barked all night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee who considered the case were ill chosen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The family who booked the holiday cottage failed to arrive</em></li>
					<li><em>which</em>: is used to refer to objects, places and 
					animals with little personal connections even when gender is 
					clear.&nbsp; The pronoun may also represent a group of 
					people.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athens, which is the capital city, 
					contains almost half the total population of Greece<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is she the cow which attacked you?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The team which won was always favourite</em><br />Rarely, 
					<em>which</em> may refer to people unconnected to the speaker 
					so we may hear, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child which came top of the class 
					got a prize</em><br />Any personal connections forbid the use of 
					<em>which</em> so:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *My child, which came top of the 
					class, got a prize</em><br />is almost certainly not allowable.</li>
					<li><em>that</em>: is an alternative to both <em>who</em> 
					and <em>which</em> and can be used for personal and 
					non-personal reference.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person that asked the question 
					was happy with the answer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't my dog that barked all night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is she the cow that attacked you?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The team that won was always favourite</em></li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>object or accusative case</strong></dt>
				<dd>The accusative is represented by four relative pronouns:<ol>
					<li><em>who</em>: is used to refer to people for the most 
					part, although animals also qualify for its use in certain 
					circumstances and so do groups of people represented by 
					collective nouns.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The person who I asked knew immediately<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dog, who I love dearly, is getting very old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee who we asked to consider the case were useless</em></li>
					<li><em>whom</em>: can <span class="style_underline">
					<strong>only</strong></span> be used in the accusative and is 
					used to refer only to people, or collections of people.&nbsp; 
					For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter, whom I like a lot, can be a difficult person<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The policeman whom I gave the report to didn't seem interested</em><br />
					It is sometimes averred that <em>whom</em> is only formal, 
					unnecessary and disappearing but it is frequently seen in 
					academic writing and in some circumstances is unavoidable 
					so:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man to whom I gave my address is 
					over there</em><br />
					is acceptable, if formal, but<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The man to who I gave my address is 
					over there</em><br />
					is not.<br />
					The pronoun <em>whom</em> is rarer with reference to 
					collectives of people:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The committee whom we asked to 
					consider the matter is useless</em></li>
					<li><em>which</em>: is used in the same way in the 
					accusative as it appears in the nominative (for places, 
					objects and unconnected animals):<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athens, to which I flew on Thursday, 
					is my favourite European city<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The newspaper which I bought at the airport was two days old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the cow which he bought last week<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The team which I support won</em></li>
					<li><em>that</em>: is an also an alternative in the 
					accusative to <em>whom, who</em> and <em>which</em> and can 
					be used for personal and non-personal reference.&nbsp; For 
					example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person that I asked had no idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the book that I bought today</em></li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>possessive or genitive case</strong></dt>
				<dd>The genitive case is only represented by <em>whose</em>.&nbsp; This 
				pronoun may never be omitted.&nbsp; There are some issues with 
				it:<ol>
					<li>The genitive represents more than simple possession and 
					the pronoun <em>whose</em> can be used for four out of five of the 
					types of genitive.&nbsp; Like this:<br />
					Possession:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy whose case was stolen is 
					waiting outside</em><br />
					Subjective (referring to the subject):<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the man whose reaction was so 
					violent</em><br />
					Origin:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>My friend, whose email I received today, is coming to 
					visit</em><br />
					Objective (referring to the object):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The criminal whose early release caused a controversy is 
					on TV tonight</em><br />
					However, there is no relative pronoun use for the 
					descriptive genitive so:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The hour whose work it is</em><br />
					is not available to be formed from<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's an hour's work</em></li>
					<li>The pronoun <em>whose</em> need not refer to people but there is 
					an avoidance issue for most native speakers.&nbsp; Many are 
					happy to accept, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ship, whose captain was asleep, 
					hit a rock</em><br />
					but less happy with<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hotel whose rooms are most 
					comfortable is The Grand</em><br />
					and very dubious of<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The house, whose price is £200,000, 
					has been sold</em><br />
					Avoiding the pronoun in these cases, however, leads to some 
					clumsiness and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ship, of which the captain was 
					asleep, hit a rock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hotel in which the rooms are most comfortable is The 
					Grand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house, the price of which is £200,000, has been sold</em><br />
					are seen by many speakers to be clumsy and also avoided so 
					the thoughts may be rephrased as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The captain of the ship which hit a 
					rock was asleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Grand is the hotel which has the most comfortable rooms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The price of the house which has been sold is £200,000.</em></li>

				<h3>Concord</h3></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Concord refers to the agreement between the noun and the verb and 
			is usually not problematical so we have<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The house which he bought was poorly maintained<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The houses which they bought were poorly maintained</em><br />
			and so on.</p>
			<p>There is a small problem with collective nouns, however, because:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>When they are represented by <em>which</em>, the verb is 
				usually singular:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee which must decide the issue 
				meets tomorrow</em></li>
				<li>When they are perceived as human and represented by <em>who</em> 
				the preference is a plural verb form:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee who must decide the issue 
				meet tomorrow</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>We saw above that expressions such as <em>all of which,
		either of whom,
		both of which,
		the majority of whom,
		none of which</em> etc. occur in non-defining 
			relative pronoun clauses but concord is sometimes an issue.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cake, all of which was eaten, was 
			delicious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people, all of whom were asked the same question, were 
			unanimous<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children, neither of whom takes the bus to work, are 
			usually late.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The books, none of which ?was / ?were available, would have 
			been most helpful.</em></p>
			<p>Teaching issues connected to concord are discussed below and 
			there is also a link to a guide to the area at the end.</p>

				<h3>Two simple rules</h3></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
				<p>Rule #1:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>If the relative pronoun is followed 
				<span class="style_underline">directly</span> by a verb phrase, it’s the 
				subject.</strong></p>
				<p>So, in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who just bought the car<br />
				</em>the 
				relative pronoun, <em>who</em>, is followed directly by the 
				modified verb 
				phrase, <em>bought</em>.&nbsp; This means that the relative 
				pronoun stands for the subject of the verb.</p>
				<p>Rule #2:</p>
				<p class="indentpara"><strong>If the pronoun is not followed by a verb phrase (but by a noun 
				phrase or pronoun) it is the object.</strong></p>
				<p>So, in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book which she bought was a first 
				edition<br />
				</em>the relative pronoun, <em>which</em>, is followed 
				by a pronoun, <em>she</em>, so it cannot be the subject of the 
				verb.&nbsp; The relative pronoun stands for the object of the 
				verb and can be, and routinely is, omitted.</p>
				<p>Relative pronouns may also refer to indirect objects (as in 
				11. above).&nbsp; For example, we can get from:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She read the children a story.&nbsp; The 
				children were delighted.<br />
				</em>to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children to whom she read a story 
				were delighted.</em></p>
				<p>Because the indirect object can frequently be moved and 
				introduced using <em>to </em>or <em>for </em>(a process 
				called dative shifting) the usual form of such relative clauses 
				follows that of relative pronouns as objects of prepositions 
				(see below).<br />
				Other examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dinner which he ordered for us was 
				delicious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people for whom she cooked dinner were grateful</em></p>
				<p>The relative pronoun may, as it stands for an object, be 
				omitted but when this happens the preposition is often left, so 
				to speak, stranded, and we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children she read a story to were 
				delighted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dinner he ordered for us was delicious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people she cooked dinner for were grateful</em></p>
				<p>By its nature, the pronoun <em>whom</em> is usually 
				preferred to <em>who</em> in such formulations because it is an 
				object-case only pronoun.</p>

				<p>Now we have the subject-object distinction clear, we can see

				In focus here is what as known as the zero or &Oslash; relative

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man drank <strong>the water<br />

				<p>In sentence e, we have 
				commas after <em>the spider</em> and <em>killed</em>.&nbsp; We know that 
				it is a non-defining relative clause and the commas could be 
				replaced by brackets with the same meaning:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spider (which he killed) was quite harmless<br />
				</em>We cannot omit the relative pronoun because that leaves us 
				with the unacceptable:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The spider, he killed, was quite harmless<br />
				</em>Sentence 10 is a defining relative clause so it's 
				OK to leave out the relative pronoun.&nbsp; Sentence 11 is <em>
				non-defining</em> so the relative pronoun can't be left out.</p>
		
				<p>The reason for this lies in the meaning that the two sorts of 
				clauses signal.&nbsp; We saw above that non-defining or 
				non-restrictive relative clauses add new information but 
				defining or restrictive clauses rely on the speaker / writer 
				and the hearer / reader sharing the information necessary to 
				understand what the subject of the clause is.<br />
				In order to signal the new information contained in a 
				non-defining clauses, the pronoun is necessary because without 
				it the hearer / reader cannot know to what the new information 
				refers.</p>

				<p>As was touched on above under the pronunciation issues,

				are sub-audible even to native speakers we sometimes encounter 
				utterances in which the subject relative pronoun appears to be 
				omitted so we may hear:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anybody wants to come is welcome</em><br />
				but certainly in the written form most speakers would reject 
				such a sentence as malformed and even in all but the most 
				colloquial and rapid speech most would consider the sentence at 
				least an example of laziness.<br />
				It is worth alerting learners to the fact that the relative 
				pronoun may be very difficult to hear in rapid speech.<br />
				Phonemically, the very rapid pronunciation may be transcribed 
				without the /h/ on <em>who </em>or the /ɪ/ on <em>is </em>as:<br />

		<p>Originally, incidentally, the word <em>that</em> was only a singular 
		neuter pronoun with the plural form <em>those</em> and it is still used 
		in that way, of course.&nbsp; It has, however, been altered by a process 
		known as grammaticalisation into a purely functional word which, in the 
		case of relative clauses, does not carry the sense of plurality so we 
		can have, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like that hat and those gloves</em><br />
		but the word has been grammaticalised in Modern English and now 
		functions as a relative pronoun in, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The books that I gave her</em><br />
		where it is unmarked for plural or singular and we cannot allow the more 
		logical<br />

			<p>By the way, there is a structure in English using <em>that</em> which 
		looks a bit like a relative clause but isn't and it will confuse 
		learners if you introduce it alongside proper relative pronoun clauses.&nbsp; 
		It occurs in, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was because I felt ill that I had to go to bed</em><br />
		The word <em>that</em> is not, in this case a pronoun at all, arguably, 
		because there is no noun for it to represent.<br />

		this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>

				<p>Stylistically, as the rule states, relative clauses formed 
				with <em>that</em> as the pronoun are considered less formal and 
				some would avoid the use of the pronoun in formal writing and 
				speech.<br />
				There are, however, some points to make here:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style62">
				<li>The style rule holds when <em>that</em> is used to represent 
				a subject person.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guests who arrived late<br />
				</em>is more formal that the synonymous:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guests that arrived late.</em></li>
				<li>However, the pronoun<em> that</em> is often preferred to 
				represent the object of the verb, even when it refers to people 
				because some feel uncomfortable with the use of <em>whom</em> or 
				simply want to avoid having to decide whether to use it at all.&nbsp; 
				So, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guests whom he invited<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guests who he invited<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guests that he invited<br />
				</em>are all considered acceptable and the second two of equal 
				formality.<br />
				Nevertheless, in formal writing and speech, the use of<em> whom</em> 
				is still conventional.</li>
				<li>The stylistic difference is much less obvious when <em>that
				</em>is used to represent a non-personal entity, either as the 
				subject or the object of the verb, so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book which I bought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book that I bought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train that arrived<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train which arrived<br />
				</em>are more or less synonymous, even stylistically, although 
				even here some would consider the use of <em>which </em>as more 
				formally correct.</li>

				<p><strong>Rule #2:</strong></p>
				<p class="indentpara"><strong>The preposition is moved to the end in 
				informal language.</strong></p>
				<p>Oddly, some prepositions do not allow post-positioning at all 
				or produce very doubtfully correct clauses.&nbsp; None of the 
				following is clearly acceptable, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The war that she fought during<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The people that it was important according to were asked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The person that she is most unlike is her mother</em> (although <em>The person 
				that she is like is her mother</em> is acceptable)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The time that we were limited up to was 
				too short</em><br />
				and in all these cases the preferred formulation is to place the 
				preposition before the relative pronoun:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The war during which she fought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people according to whom it was important were asked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person whom she is unlike<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time up to which we were limited was too short</em><br />
				It is also often the case that, stylistically, complex 
				prepositions are often not post-positioned so most would prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issues in spite of which he carried 
				on were serious<br />
				</em>to the more questionable:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The issues he carried on in spite of 
				were serious</em></p>
				<p>By some analyses, prepositional phrases are an oddity because 
				they behave more like clauses having a preposition (the head of 
				the phrase) and an object, otherwise called the complement.&nbsp; 
				So, for example, the relative pronoun can stand for a 
				prepositional object and we can get from:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke with the woman.&nbsp; The woman 
				is my sister<br />
				</em>to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman with whom he spoke is my sister<br />

				<p>There is a serious restriction on preposition positioning

				<ol>
					<li>When a <em>wh-</em> word is the pronoun, the preposition

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car in which I came</em></li>
					<li>However, when we use <em>that</em> as the pronoun, the 
					preposition <strong>must</strong> be postpositioned so we 
					allow, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car that I came in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman that I spoke to</em><br />
					but neither:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The car in that I came</em><br />
					nor<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The woman to that I spoke</em><br />
					is acceptable.</li>
					<li>A further restriction concerns the zero (<em>Ø</em>) relative or omitted 
					pronoun.&nbsp; We do not allow, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>The woman to I spoke<br />
					</em>but:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman Ø I spoke to<br />

				<h3>Restrictions on reduced relative clauses</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
				<p>Some restrictions to what is possible with the types of 
				reduced relative clauses exemplified here apply.&nbsp; The 
				restrictions arise from the nature of the verb <em>be</em> 
				concerning whether it is functioning as a copula or as an 
				auxiliary forming a progressive or passive form.</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Prepositional and adverbial relative clauses<br />
					</strong>are nearly always defining relative clauses.&nbsp; 
					So, for example, we can allow:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman, who is at number 14, will arrive later</em><br />
					to be reduced to<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman at number 14 will arrive 
					later</em><br />
					but the sense will be that the woman is now defined by her 
					location rather than her location being additional 
					information.<br />
					By the same token, reducing:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman, who is outside, will 
					arrive later</em><br />
					to<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman outside will arrive later</em><br />
					means that it becomes a defining structure rather than 
					simply adding information concerning the woman.<br />
					Informally, the distinction may occasionally be retained so 
					we can also allow, in spoken language:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman, at number 14, will arrive 
					later</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman, outside, will arrive later</em><br />
					and in both cases, the non-defining nature of the clause is 
					maintained but the use is generally disparaged in more 
					formal language and is probably not one with which to 
					trouble learners unduly.</li>
					<li><strong>-</strong><em><strong>ing</strong></em><strong> participial relative clauses<br />
					</strong>can retain the sense of defining or non-defining 
					clauses.<br />
					We allow, therefore:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kid who is acting the fool is my 
					sister</em><br />
					to be reduced to<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kid acting the fool is my sister</em><br />
					and in both cases we have a defining relative construction.<br />
					However, we can also reduce both:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman, who is waiting outside, 
					wants to speak to you</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman who is waiting outside 
					wants to speak to you</em><br />
					to<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman, waiting outside, wants to 
					speak to you</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman waiting outside wants to 
					speak to you</em><br />
					retaining the distinction between defining and non-defining 
					clauses.<br />
					It is the case however that such reductions are usually only 
					applied to defining clauses.</li>
					<li><strong>Adjectival clauses</strong><br />
					retain the distinction between defining and non-defining 
					clauses.&nbsp; So, in our example above:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The customers, who were unhappy with the work, complained<br />
					</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The customers who were unhappy with the work complained<br />
					</em>can be reduced to:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The customers, unhappy with the work, 
					complained<br />
					</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The customers unhappy with the work complained<br />
					</em>but the sense in the first is that <strong>all</strong> 
					the customers were unhappy with the work and complained and 
					in the second case, <strong>only</strong> the customers who 
					were unhappy complained, while others, presumably, being 
					happy with the work, did not complain.</li>
					<li><strong>Reduced passive relative clauses</strong><br />
					have some exceptional characteristics because of the role 
					that is played by the verb <em>be</em> in them.<ol class="auto-style62">
						<li>Passive reduced clauses can be both defining (as in 
						example 26.) or non-defining so we allow, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house, built by his father, is still 
				his only home </em>(non-defining)<br />and<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house built by his father is 
						still his only home</em> (defining)</li>
						<li>In reduced passive clauses the tense marker is lost 
						with the ellipsis of the verb <em>be</em> so, for 
						example:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house which will have been 
						built by his father will be his only home</em><br />
						cannot be reduced to<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house built by his father 
						will be his only home</em><br />
						because the future form is lost and the reduced sentence 
						can only refer to the past with the house already 
						completed.<br />
						Equally, if we reduce:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house, which has been built 
						by his father, is his only home</em><br />
						or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The house which has been built by his father is his only 
						home</em><br />
						to<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house, built by his father, 
						is his only home</em><br />
						or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The house built by his father is his only home</em><br />
						then the sense of the present perfect is lost in both 
						cases.<br />
						We can get round this by the use of an adverbial such as
						<em>recently</em>.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Appositive relative clauses</strong><br />
					can <strong>only</strong> be non-defining 
				because we cannot define the subject twice.&nbsp;
				In formal language, the commas are often replaced with brackets 
				in such clauses.&nbsp; So, instead of:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman, an expert on gardening, is 
					helping my mother</em><br />
					we may have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman (an expert on gardening) is 
					helping my mother</em><br />
					In spoken language, these are not distinguishable.</li>
					<li><strong>Possessive relative clauses</strong><br />
					cannot be reduced, of course, because the relative pronoun, 					<em>whose</em>, may never be omitted.</li>

		</table>
		
				<p>In the analysis above, all the examples contain both the 
				relative pronoun and what is known as its antecedent (i.e., the 
				noun the relative pronoun refers to).&nbsp; So, for example, in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>That's the man who stole my bicycle<br />
				</em>it is clear that <em>the man</em> and <em>who</em> refer to 
				the same person.&nbsp; So, <em>the man</em> is the antecedent of 
				the pronoun <em>who</em>.<br />
				and in<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The tickets which we sold to my brother</em><br />
				the antecedent of the pronoun <em>which</em> is <em>the tickets</em>.</p>
				<p>Frequently, however, the antecedent is either understood or 
				simply absent.&nbsp; This is why clauses of this type are 
				sometimes called fused relative clauses (because the antecedent 
				and the pronoun are combined) or nominal relative clauses 
				(because the whole clause is acting as a noun).<br />
				Here are some examples:</p>
				<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li><em>I don't know who sold him the tickets</em><br />
					in which <em>who sold him the tickets</em> is a nominal 
					clause acting as the direct (and only) <strong>object</strong> 
					of the verb <em>know</em></li>
					<li><em>Whoever broke the window will have to pay for it</em><br />
					in which the nominalised clause <em>Whoever broke the window</em> 
					is acting as the <strong>subject</strong> of the verb phrase
					<em>will have to pay</em></li>
					<li><em>We are arguing about who to invite to the party</em><br />
					in which the nominalised clause <em>who to invite to the 
					party </em>is acting as the <strong>complement</strong> or
					<strong>object</strong> of 
					the preposition <em>about</em></li>
					<li><em>This is what he wants you to do</em><br />
					in which the nominalised clause <em>what he wants you to do</em> 
					is the <strong>subject complement</strong> of the copular verb <em>
					be</em></li>
					<li><em>He gave whoever asked the money they needed<br />
					</em>in which the nominal clause <em>whoever asked </em>is 
					acting as the <strong>indirect object </strong>of the verb
					<em>give</em></li>
				</ul>
				<p>As you see, nominalised or fused relative clauses fill the 
				same grammatical slots as noun phrases (hence the name).</p>
				<p>With nominal relative clauses certain relative pronouns are 
				used:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><em>what</em> is the most common<ol class="bluebullet">
						<li><em>She told him what he wanted to hear </em>
						(object)</li>
						<li><em>What I wanted had disappeared </em>(subject)</li>
						<li><em>Have you any idea what to do next? </em>(object 
						of the interrogative)</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><em>who</em> and <em>which</em> are also commonly used 
					as object nominalised clauses<ol class="bluebullet">
						<li><em>I explained who was going to do the work</em></li>
						<li><em>I didn't know which to use</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>the <em>-ever</em> series of pronouns are also frequent<ol class="bluebullet">
						<li><em>Whoever told you that is a liar</em></li>
						<li><em>Whatever you want is OK with me</em></li>
						<li><em>Whichever you decide on will be expensive</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p><span class="style_red"><strong>Warning</strong></span>: some sources will include formulations such as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; How(ever) you do it is your business<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever he comes is OK with me</em><br />
				but these are, in fact, relative adverbs, not relative pronouns 
				(and the subject of a different guide linked in the list of related guides at the end).<br />
				If the word refers to <em>when, how</em> or <em>why</em>, it is not a relative 
				pronoun, it's a relative adverb and they function significantly 
				differently.&nbsp; To mix them up, and hence confuse your 
				learners, is unwise.<br />
				Some <em>wh- </em>and <em>that-</em>clauses occur in what are known as cleft 
				sentences and there is guide to these on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>
		<p>Unlike other nominal clauses, nominal relative clauses can act as the 
		indirect object so we allow, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll give whoever asks a new book.</em></p>
		<p>There are also structures called free relative clauses and those, 
		too, are considered in the guide to relative adverbs because they share 
		some characteristics.&nbsp; As you will see, if you go to that guide, 
		this site takes the view that nominalisation is a better way to think 
		about such things.</p>

				<p>As we have seen in many of the examples in the guide so far, relative 
				pronoun clauses can occur in medial position in a sentence, with or 
				without the object pronoun.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man <span class="style_black">(whom) 
				you met</span> was my boss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book<span class="style_black"> (which / that) you took</span> 
				was mine.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person <span class="style_black">who sold me the car
				</span>has left the country</em><br />
				etc.</p>
		<p>Relative pronoun clauses are also frequently found in the final 
		position in sentences because they typically introduce new information 
		(and that is a common phenomenon in English called end focus).<br />
		The other reason, discussed more fully below, is that they are quite heavy 
		grammatically and English prefers heavier elements at the ends of 
		clauses.<br />
		The antecedent is commonly an indefinite pronoun such as one of the <em>
		any</em>- or <em>some</em>- series or an indefinite noun phrase such as
		<em>a person, a child, a thing, a tool</em> etc.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m looking for someone <span class="style_black">
		who can help me write a website</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need something <span class="style_black">which can act as 
		a counterbalance</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you find us a local <span class="style_black">who can 
		show us the way</span>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have the tool <span class="style_black">that will do 
		the job</span></em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that the man <span class="style_black">whose father is 
		an MP</span>?</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		This position is common with an existential <em>there is / there are</em> 
		structure.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anyone here <span class="style_black">
		who can help me</span>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is something over there <span class="style_black">that 
		looks like a snake</span></em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some things <span class="style_black">
		(that) I always forget to pack</span></em><br />
		etc.<br />
		By the nature of such sentences, the relative pronoun is often the 
		subject and cannot, therefore, be omitted.</p>

				<h3>Extrapositioning</h3></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Relative clauses are also subject to a phenomenon called 
			extra-positioning in which the clause is sent to the end of the 
			sentence, after the verb phrase.&nbsp; For example, the usual 
			sentence might be:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who wants to complain about the 
			service just came in</em><br />
			but the relative clause can also be extra-positioned to get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man just came in who wants to complain 
			about the service</em><br />
			The second form is notably rarer and more difficult for many 
			learners to unpack.&nbsp; It also marks the relative clause in 
			concordance with the principle of end focus, i.e., gives it added 
			emphasis.</p>
		<p>Non-defining relative clauses almost always occur in medial position so 
		we can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister, who lives in America, may be able to 
		help you with that</em><br />
		but not:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *My sister may be able to help you with that, who 
		lives in America</em></p>

				<p>Relative pronouns clauses can also be stacked in the final 
				position so we can have, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the book I got from the library which I like but that 
				you hate<br />
				</em>In theory, there is no limit to how many relative pronoun 
				clauses can be stacked in this way but native speakers stop at 
				two or three.</p>
		<p>This is less common in medial position because of the cognitive overload 
		produced by trying to say (and understand) something like:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you given the food which I cooked and that you hated but 
		which the guests enjoyed to the dog?</em></p>
		<p>Non-defining clauses, probably up to a maximum of two, can be 
		stacked in medial position.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; His brother, who lives in France and who speaks French, may 
		be able to translate that.<br />
		</em>It is possible to have more than two of these, providing they are 
		short enough so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>His brother, who lives in France, speaks French, can be 
		contacted by email and is usually helpful, may be able to translate that</em><br />
		is possible but that's about the limit of the cognitive load with which 
		speakers and listeners can cope.</p>

				<p>There is an odd form of relative clause in which it is not 
				possible to identify an antecedent noun phrase because the 
				reference is not to a particular person or object but to the 
				whole of a preceding sentence (or even a longer text).&nbsp; The 
				name for this varies in the literature but here we will refer to 
				them as<strong> sentence relative clauses</strong> although you 
				may find them called comment clauses and a number of other 
				things.<br />
				Only one of the five pronouns can function this way:
				<em>which</em>.<br />
				Here are some examples:</p>
		<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They fell in love and got married,
		<span class="style_black">which astonished everyone they knew</span>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the rain, the garden flourished,
		<span class="style_black">which was no surprise</span>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we had had the meeting, matters improved,
		<span class="style_black">which was welcome</span>.</em></p>
		<p>These clauses are generally separated from the antecedent text by 
		commas because they are, in fact, non-defining, in the sense that the 
		preceding text can sensibly stand alone.<br />
		They always follow the text to which they refer.<br />
		It is not possible to omit the pronoun.</p>

				<p>Relative clauses in English come after the noun to which they 
				refer.&nbsp; The reason for this has to do with how elements are 
				ordered in English in terms of what is known as heaviness.<br />
				A heavy element of a clause is more grammatically and lexically 
				complex than a light one.&nbsp; For example, modifying a noun 
				with a determiner or simple adjective as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three cars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; red car</em><br />
				is a very light way to do so and English prefers light elements 
				to precede the noun so we do not get<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *car that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *cars a<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *car the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *cars three<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *car red</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				This is not the case, incidentally, in a range of other 
				languages, including Yoruba and many African languages as well 
				as Thai and many other South-East Asian languages.</p>
			<p>However, modification with a complex prepositional phrase will 
				normally follow the noun because it is a heavier element than a 
				single determiner or adjective so we have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the car over there with the broken 
				headlight</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the over there with the broken headlight 
				car.</em><br />
				Relative clauses are just about the most complex way in which 
				noun phrases can be modified in English so it is unsurprising 
				that the clauses follow the noun they modify or refer to.&nbsp; 
				That is not a universal tendency of all languages but it is one 
				shared with most European languages.<br />
				Chinese languages, for example, do not follow the end weighting 
				rule and place the relative clause before the object or subject 
				noun (see below for a little more).</p>
		<p>The ways in which other languages form relative clauses is 
				very varied and first-language interference errors are common 
				when learners are acquiring the system in English.<br />
				Here's brief run-down of the most important differences.&nbsp; 
				It behoves you to find out how your learners' first language(s) 
				handle the area so you are prepared for the interference issues 
				and can focus on salient differences.&nbsp; If you are a native 
				or very competent speaker of your learners' first language(s), 
				this just requires a little thought.&nbsp; In other 
				circumstances, it requires a little research.</p>

					<li><strong><em>who</em> vs. <em>which</em></strong><br />
					<img alt="ferret" height="133" src="../../images/animals_ferret200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					Many languages, including but not limited to:<brr />
					Dutch, Albanian, Scandinavian languages (including Finnish, 
					this time, and Icelandic), German (in which relative 
					pronouns closely parallel the form of the definite article), Spanish, 
					French, Italian, Malay / Indonesian, Latvian, Maltese, Portuguese, Greek, Russian, Polish (and other 
					Slavic languages including Slovak, Czech and Slovene etc.), 
					Persian languages (Farsi, Dari, Tajik) and Thai
					do not distinguish between a pronoun referring to people and 
					one referring to inanimate objects and animals.&nbsp; In 
					most languages, therefore, there is no pronoun distinction 
					between<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind which came in</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who came in</em><br />
					so errors such 
					as<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's the man which I saw<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's the table who he bought in France</em><br />etc. are frequent and have to be handled by making sure that 
					the distinctions in English between <em>who</em> and <em>which</em> are very clear.<br />
					A serious problem is the fact that the pronoun <em>which</em> 
					can sometimes be used to refer to people with whom the 
					speaker is unfamiliar.&nbsp; When learners are exposed to 
					such expressions, they may, quite naturally, assume that <em>
					which</em> can be used for all human antecedents.&nbsp; This 
					is especially the case with collective nouns for groups of 
					people so, for example, we can allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee which considered the 
					matter was convinced<br />
					</em>and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee who considered the 
					matter were convinced<br />
					</em>but it is worth noticing that when <em>who</em> is the 
					preferred relative pronoun, verb-subject concord becomes an 
					issue and in BrE (but not usually in AmE) <em>who</em> may 
					be followed by a plural form of the verb but <em>which</em> 
					is invariably singular.&nbsp; There is more on concord 
					issues below.<br />Speakers of these languages, aware that English is different 
					in this respect, may be tempted to play safe and overuse <em>that</em> in grammatical environments where it is not 
					allowable (i.e., in non-defining or non-restricted clauses).&nbsp; 
					Errors such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The Eiger, that is in The Alps, is a 
					beautiful mountain</em><br />or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The bus, that I take every morning, 
					was very late today</em><br />will occur.<br />Additionally, 
					<em>that</em> is often unacceptably informal, 
					especially in writing, and that leads to stylistic error.</li>
					<li><em><strong>that</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em>
					<strong>what</strong></em><br />
					<img alt="gorilla" height="133" src="../../images/animals_gorilla200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					Some languages use <em>that</em> and
					<em>what</em> interchangeably (German, Modern Greek and 
					Dutch are commonly cited examples) and that can lead to errors like<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's the man what he said would come</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The wind what came in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The man what came to the meeting</em><br />etc.<br />
					In some non-standard varieties of English, this also happens 
					but it is almost universally considered erroneous.<br />
					The use of <em>what</em> as a relative pronoun is confined, 
					in this analysis, to its occurrence in fused or nominal 
					relative clauses as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what she wants to do<br />
					</em>Introducing such clauses too early to learners whose 
					first languages use <em>that</em> and <em>what</em> 
					interchangeably is unhelpful.</li>
					<li><strong>Non-parallel structures</strong><br />
					<img alt="non-parallel" height="133" src="../../images/non-parallel.png" width="200" /><br />
					Even languages which sometimes 
					distinguish between pronouns for people and things do so in 
					ways which do not parallel English at all.<br />
					In French, for example, different pronouns are used 
					depending on whether the object or the subject is the 
					reference (<em>que</em> and <em>qui</em> respectively) but 
					both can be used for animate and inanimate nouns.<br />
					Italian uses different pronouns depending on whether the 
					noun is followed by a preposition or not (<em>cui</em> and
					<em>che</em> respectively).<br />
					Portuguese has a single relative pronoun (<em>que</em>) 
					which can refer to people or things but this changes to <em>quem </em>
					when preceded by a preposition.&nbsp; The word <em>quem </em>is only 
					used to refer to people and means <em>who</em> or <em>whom</em>.<br />
					All of these differences can lead to interlingual errors 
					because of temptation to assume that differences like these 
					are parallelled in English.<br />
					A further non-parallel aspect is the use of <em>which</em> 
					as a sentence relative clause to refer to a preceding text 
					rather than an identifiable antecedent noun phrase.&nbsp; 
					Most languages will not use a pronoun in this way, 
					preferring something like <em>... and that</em> + the 
					comment or using an equivalent of <em>what</em>.</li>
					<li><strong>Omitting the pronoun</strong><br />
					<img alt="omit" height="133" src="../../images/jigsaw_missing200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					Most languages which use relative pronouns as subordinators 
					do not allow the pronoun to be omitted and, apart from 
					causing speakers to sound unnaturally formal with sentences 
					such as<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; The book which I read explains it well</em><br />
					instead of the much more natural<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The book I read explains it well</em><br />
					this also presents comprehension difficulties because 
					learners from these backgrounds will have problems 
					understanding<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Is she the woman you spoke to?</em><br />
					or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the program you should run<br />
					</em>because there are no obvious pronoun clues to what the object 
					of the verb really is.<br />
					Languages which do not allow the pronoun omission are in the 
					majority and include most of those listed in point 1, above.<br />
					The omission of the pronoun in English, incidentally, causes 
					serious problems for machine translations for the same 
					reason that comprehension issues arise.</li>
					<li><strong>Preferring pre-modification</strong><br />
					<img alt="modify" height="133" src="../../images/modification_fingernails200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					There are two associated issues here:<ol class="auto-style62">
						<li>Many languages, as we saw above, do not comply with 
						the rule that heavy elements need to be positioned to 
						the right in a clause and these languages usually avoid 
						post-modification <em>via</em> relative clauses.&nbsp; 
						We may get, therefore:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The agreed by the majority 
						decision</em><br />
						when most English speakers would prefer:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision which was agreed by 
						the majority</em><br />
						However, even in English, when the relative pronoun 
						clause is comparatively simple (i.e., light) such 
						pre-modification is allowed so we might prefer:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The admitted truths</em><br />
						rather than:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truths which were admitted</em><br />
						or<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respected authorities</em><br />
						rather than:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The authorities who are respected</em><br />
						Nevertheless, this is something to handle with a little 
						care in the classroom because as soon as the 
						modification becomes even slightly heavier, the 
						post-modifying rule kicks in.&nbsp; So, for example, we 
						might allow:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The middle house</em><br />
						instead of:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house which is in the middle</em><br />
						we do not allow<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The in the middle of the street 
						house</em><br />
						and can only have:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house (which is) in the 
						middle of the street</em><br />
						In fact, <strong>any</strong> additional prepositional 
						phrase usually results in the prohibition of 
						pre-modification so we cannot allow, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The end of the garden gate</em><br />
						and must insist on:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The gate (which is) at the end of the garden.<br />
						</em>in which we can reduce the relative clause or not 
						as we please because we are complying with the 
						heaviness-to-the-right rule.</li>
						<li>The secondary restriction not parallelled in many 
						languages that concerns the permanence of the attribute 
						so, while we can look at a photograph of a group of 
						people and speak of:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The end woman</em><br />
						rather than<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman who is at the end</em><br />
						because the photograph is permanent and fixed in time.&nbsp; 
						We cannot do that when the situation is fluid and 
						changing so:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The end woman</em><br />
						is not allowed if we are describing something current 
						and mobile.<br />
						To see what is meant, we can also, for example, 
						distinguish between:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The central table</em><br />
						pre-modifying the table and referring to its permanent 
						position and<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The table which is in the centre</em><br />
						post-modifying the table and implying that it can (and 
						may be) moved.<br />
						We cannot, of course, make that distinction in other 
						circumstances so, for example:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The central room</em><br />
						and<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The room which is in the centre</em><br />
						are synonymous.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Restricted and non-restricted uses</strong><br />
					<img alt="restrict" height="133" src="../../images/sign_speed_restriction200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					A range of languages, including Russian, German, Dutch and 
					Polish, do not distinguish between restricted (defining) 
					clauses and non-restricted (non-defining) clauses and that 
					can cause punctuation, pronunciation and comprehension 
					errors.&nbsp; In German, for example, all relative clauses 
					are separated by commas, not just non-defining clauses as in 
					English.<br />
					For speakers of other languages, in which the comma is used 
					to separate sense groups rather than represent pausing, 
					similar issues arise.</li>
					<li><strong>Concord</strong><br />
					<img alt="handshake" height="133" src="../../images/handshake200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					Most languages (including American varieties of English) are 
					strict about concord and will strive to make verb and 
					pronoun forms match the number and characteristics of the 
					subject.&nbsp; British English is sloppier in this respect and, 
					depending on their notion about the nature of the subject, 
					British English speakers can accept, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group who were asked to work on 
					the project</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group which was asked to work on 
					the project</em><br />
					but will not allow<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The group which were asked</em> <em>to work on the 
					project</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The group who was asked to work on 
					the project<br />
					</em>This will lead to some error because most learners will 
					assume that English has the same grammatical regard for 
					concord that their languages exhibit.<br />
					Other concord errors will occur, such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The range of students which was 
					accepted for a place at the university</em><br />
					which follows a grammatical rule (<em>range</em> is 
					non-animate and singular and so should be followed by <em>
					which</em> and a singular verb form) but is unacceptable to 
					most English speakers who would prefer:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The range of students who were 
					accepted for a place at the university</em><br />
					These are examples of issues with notional and proximity 
					concord respectively in English.&nbsp; For more on concord, 
					follow the link below.&nbsp; In this case, </li>
					<li><strong>Absence of relative pronouns and clauses</strong><br />
					<img alt="empty" height="133" src="../../images/empty200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					You will search in vain for mention of relative pronouns in 
					the grammars of many languages, including Turkish (usually), Korean, 
					Tamil and Japanese, for the simple reason that these 
					languages do not use them at all and no closely equivalent 
					structures exist.<br />
					In most, the meaning is expressed either through compound 
					adjectives, so we get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The by the river house</em><br />
					instead of<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house (which is) by the river</em><br />
					or by participle clauses so we get, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *My friend living in America invited me to visit him</em><br />
					instead of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>My friend who lives in America invited me to visit him<br />
					</em>Some of these language, Turkish being an obvious 
					example, do have a structure similar to a relative clause 
					but the language uses non-finite forms rather than the finite 
					ones which English prefers.&nbsp; So, for example, a Turkish 
					speaker will have little difficulty understanding or 
					producing:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car sitting in front of the house 
					is his</em><br />
					but will not naturally produce and may have difficulty 
					understanding<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car which broke down is in front 
					of the house<br />
					</em>and may attempt something like:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The car breaking down is in front of 
					the house</em></li>
					<li><strong>Resisting subordination</strong><br />
					<img alt="no" height="133" src="../../images/no_hand200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					South Asian languages in particular resist subordination 
					altogether, preferring other ways to express the fact that 
					one part of a sentence depends on the understanding of 
					another, and speakers of these languages (which include many 
					in the subcontinent such as Hindi and Urdu) may have 
					difficulty seeing the reason for relative clauses at all and 
					struggle with both the forms and the whole concept of 
					subordination in general.</li>
					<li><strong>Clause ordering</strong><br />
					<img alt="order" height="133" src="../../images/orderly200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					Finally, in Chinese languages, there are parallel structures 
					but in these languages, the relative clause <strong>precedes</strong> 
					rather than follows the noun phrase and that can produce 
					errors such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Who is in England my friend wrote to me</em><br />
					Additionally, the pronoun may routinely be omitted 
					regardless of the grammatical function it performs and that 
					leads to errors such<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The man gave me the money was very 
					friendly</em><br />
					This will also affect languages which use adjectival phrases 
					or participle clauses to express the concepts (see point 7) 
					because these structures also precede the noun and they may 
					produce errors such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*The parking the car woman ...<br />
					</em>instead of<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman (who is) parking the car<br />
					</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The book buying the man is very expensive<br />
					</em>instead of<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book (which) the man is buying / bought is very expensive</em><br />
					The distinction between the times when one can and cannot 
					omit the pronoun and the ordering of the clauses need 
					careful work.</li>

				<h2>Teaching relative pronoun clauses</h2>

		</table>
		
				<p>Step 1 for any teaching, especially to people whose first 
				languages do not have relative pronoun clauses or which use them 
				very differently, is to focus on getting the form right.&nbsp; We 
				saw above how the rules work for making simple subject relative 
				clauses by following three easy steps.&nbsp; This can be done 
				as a classroom exercise like this:<br />
				<img alt="example" height="450" src="../../imagesgraphics/relative_example_teaching.png" width="620" /></p>
					<p>You will probably have to come up with a few more pairs 
					of simple sentences like these, using both <em>which</em> and 
					<em>who</em>, 
					preferably, because that caters for people whose first 
					languages do not distinguish, to give people adequate 
					practice in forming relative pronoun clauses embedded in 
					sentences.&nbsp; It is not easy for many learners.<br />
					You can also, of course, use the little video (<a href="#clauses">above</a>) 
					to explain how the clauses are formed.</p>
					<p>Once the form of relative clause is mastered, you can 
					move on.</p>
					<p>If you have been following up to now, you will know that this 
				is not a simple system in English and the restrictions, as we 
				saw above, are important.&nbsp; In particular, we (and, 
				eventually, our learners) need to be aware of:</p>
		<ul class="smallgreybullet">
			<li>when the pronoun can be omitted</li>
			<li>when the 
				pronoun <em>that</em> can be used</li>
			<li>where the clause comes in the sentence</li>
			<li>which pronoun to select</li>
			<li>when the clauses can be reduced or 
				nominalised</li>
		</ul>
				<p>And these are just some of the issues you need to know about 
				and analyse before you can begin to tackle the area.<br />
				For this reason, careful selection of model texts or other 
				presentation texts is very important.<br />
				If the text you 
				select contains multiple examples of relative pronouns as 
				subjects, as objects, including <em>that</em>, reduced, with 
				omitted pronouns, in nominalised clauses and so on you are 
				asking for trouble.&nbsp; This will be compounded if you also 
				fail to distinguish between relative pronouns and relative 
				adverbs.&nbsp; For examples of the horrible, confusing mishmash 
				that doing so produces, search the web for lessons in the area.&nbsp; Alternatively, pick up any of a range of classroom coursebooks 
				whose authors have neglected to do the research.</p>
				<p>At lower levels in particular, you need to focus very 
				carefully, introducing, say, only defining relative clauses 
				using <em>who</em> and <em>which</em> as subject pronouns in 
				model sentences such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He is the student who asks lots of questions</em><br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>That is the car which sat outside my house all night</em><br />
				Getting lower-level learners to form such sentences from:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is the student<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asks lots of questions</em><br />
				or<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; That is the car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It sat outside my house all night</em><br />
				is a good beginning but it can't stop there, of course.</p>

				<td class="auto-style56">
				<h3>The window: a neglected classroom aid</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>A quickly set up exercise to practise relative pronoun clauses 
		is to get your learners to look out of the classroom window and 
		tell you what they see.&nbsp; With a bit of priming and nudging from 
		you, that can elicit comments such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see a car which is parked illegally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a traffic warden who is putting a ticket on it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people whose car it is will be really upset</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		Clearly, this can't be done until the forms have been presented and 
		practised a little but it works well.</p>
		
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="learners" height="133" src="../../images/class_students200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style56">
				<h3>The learners: another neglected classroom aid</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
				<p>Using your learners' own experiences (their internal world) can also be 
		productive and it is not hard to set up practice routines to evince 
		statements like:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went on holiday to New York last year which I 
		found fascinating.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a room in the house which we only use for guests.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember a great teacher who really inspired his students.</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		It's up to you to limit and elicit the correct pronouns.</p>
		<p>A semi-controlled practice idea is simple to get the learners to say 
		something true about three other people in the room (including you, if 
		you like) and three things they know about.&nbsp; That can evince 
		statements such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Paul is the guy who always knows the right answer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary is the person who sits near the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the coat Mary wore this morning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the pen Arthur stole from me</em><br />
		and so on.<br />
		It's a personalised and engaging exercise and that, so the theory goes, makes 
		the structures memorable.</p>
		
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="photograph" height="133" src="../../images/children_subject_object200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style56">
				<h3>The students' mementos: another neglected classroom aid</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
				<p>An associated idea is to ask the learners to bring in half a 
				dozen favourite photographs or souvenirs and get them to explain 
				what they are of or where they came from.&nbsp; That can evince 
				language such as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a bag I bought in Tunisia<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a photograph that I took in Russia<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the girl whom I met in London</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				This works particularly well for practising the omission of the 
				pronoun because, by their nature, the items are generally the 
				objects of defining relative clauses.</p>
				<p>The next step is to introduce the range (excluding <em>that</em> 
				for which special rules apply) until the learners can construct 
				acceptable subordinating clauses using <em>which, who(m)</em> 
				and <em>whose</em>.<br />
				Then it's time to focus on when the pronouns can be omitted 
				(restricted to defining clauses where the object is denoted by 
				the pronoun, and excluding <em>whose</em>).</p>
				<p>Finally, the range of reduced clauses can be tackled along 
				with nominalised or fused relative clauses.&nbsp; That can be done 
				alongside consideration of <em>wh-question</em> forms because 
				the structures are more or less parallel:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what to wear</em><br />
				is not far removed grammatically from:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Do you know what to wear?</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Do you know who arrived late?</em><br />
				because both have a nominalised <em>wh</em>-clauses as the 
				object of the verbs.</p>
