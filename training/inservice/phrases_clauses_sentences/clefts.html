				<p>Clefts function to give prominence to a particular part of a 
				clause.&nbsp; They do this by dividing the clause into two parts 
				(hence the name) and assigning a verb to each noun phrase.&nbsp; 
				This is a way, in English, of marking, i.e., distinguishing, a 
				proposition.&nbsp; For more on markedness in English, see the 
				guide linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>
		<p>We can, for example, take the simple sentence:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary took her mother to a restaurant last night</em><br />
				and emphasise whichever part of the sentence we feel is 
				important by making cleft sentences, like this:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>emphasising the <strong>subject</strong></dt>
			<dd><em>It was Mary who took her mother to a restaurant last night</em></dd>
			<dt>emphasising the <strong>direct object</strong></dt>
			<dd><em>It was her mother that Mary took to a restaurant last 
			night</em></dd>
			<dt>emphasising the <strong>adverbial of time</strong></dt>
			<dd><em>It was last night that Mary took her mother to a restaurant</em></dd>
			<dt>emphasising the <strong>adverbial of place</strong></dt>
			<dd><em>It was to a restaurant that Mary took her mother last night</em></dd>
		</dl>
		<p>All four sentences above are examples of what is called, for a fairly 
		obvious reason, an <em>it-</em>cleft.&nbsp; They all begin with a dummy, 
		anticipatory or empty <em>it</em> pronoun and use the verb <em>be</em> to make the 
		clause.&nbsp; In this way, two clauses have been produced from the 
		single-clause sentence with which we started.</p>

					</tr>
					</table>
			<p>The procedure for making a cleft sentence is closely parallel to 
			the procedure for making a relative clause (which is one reason why 
			teaching it to learners who cannot yet handle relative pronoun 
			clauses is probably a forlorn effort).&nbsp; It works like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>To mark the subject</strong><ol class="auto-style56">
					<li>Begin with a standard, unmarked, active-voice clause 
					such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eunice wrote a letter to her husband 
					last week</em></li>
					<li>Insert the <em>it </em>+ the verb <em>be</em> in the 
					correct tense at the beginning to get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleredbold">It was</span> 
					Eunice wrote a letter to her husband last week</em></li>
					<li>Insert the correct relative pronoun with the subject as 
					the antecedent between the <em>it-</em>clause and the 
					subject of the original clause to get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Eunice
					<span class="styleredbold">who/that </span>wrote a letter to 
					her husband last week</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>To mark the object</strong><ol class="auto-style56">
					<li>Begin with a standard, unmarked, active-voice clause 
					such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eunice wrote a letter to her husband 
					last week</em></li>
					<li>Insert the <em>it </em>+ the verb <em>be</em> in the 
					correct tense at the beginning to get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleredbold">It was</span> 
					Eunice wrote a letter to her husband last week</em></li>
					<li>Insert the object phrase after the <em>it-</em>clause to 
					get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was <span class="styleredbold">a letter
					</span>Eunice wrote a letter to her husband last week</em></li>
					<li>Optionally, because we are not referring to the subect, 
					insert <em>that</em> as the appropriate relative pronoun and 
					get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a letter (<span class="styleredbold">that</span>) 
					Eunice wrote a letter to her husband last week</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>To mark an adverbial phrase</strong><ol class="auto-style56">
					<li>Begin with a standard, unmarked, active-voice clause 
					such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eunice wrote a letter to her husband 
					last week</em></li>
					<li>Insert the <em>it </em>+ the verb <em>be</em> in the 
					correct tense at the beginning to get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleredbold">&nbsp;It was
					</span>Eunice wrote a letter to her husband last week</em></li>
					<li>Insert the adverbial phrase to be marked for focus after 
					the <em>it-</em>clause to get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was <span class="styleredbold">last week 
					/ to her husband</span> Eunice wrote a letter</em></li>
					<li>Optionally, because we are not referring to the subject, 
					insert insert <em>that</em> as the appropriate relative 
					pronoun and get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was last week / to her husband (<span class="styleredbold">that</span>) 
					Eunice wrote a letter</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The general rule for the patterns may be set out as:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em><strong>it-</strong></em><strong>clause + 
			marked element (+ relative pronoun) + remainder of the sentence</strong></p>
			<p>If the subject or the object of the sentence is emphasised we can use
		<em>who</em> or <em>whom</em> as the relative pronoun although <em>that</em> will often 
		be used as the pro-form for all noun phrases.&nbsp; We can, therefore 
			have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was her mother who(m) Mary took to a 
			restaurant last night</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was her mother that Mary took to a 
			restaurant last night</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Mary who took her mother to a 
			restaurant last night</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Mary that took her mother to a 
			restaurant last night</em><br />
			When the fronted item contains the object of the verb, in formal 
			English, <em>whom</em> not <em>who</em> must be used.&nbsp; 
			Informally, the distinction is disappearing.</p>
			<p>If the marked item is <strong>not</strong> the subject of the 
			sentence, the relative pronoun is often omitted.&nbsp; Informally, 
			even when the marked element is the subject, the relative pronoun 
			can be omitted but this is considered stylistically inappropriate in 
			written language or more formal speech.</p>
		<p>If you try saying those sentences aloud, you will notice that the 
		stress falls on the emphasised item quite naturally: <strong><em>Mary, 
		mother, last night, to a restaurant</em></strong>, respectively.<br />
		Part of the usefulness of cleft sentences is that they allow us to 
		emphasise a particular element in the sentences in writing as well as in 
		speech.<br />
		The hearer or reader is instantly aware that the writer or speaker has 
		marked part of the sentence for the effect that needed to be 
		communicated.</p>

						<td class="auto-style7"><h3>Focus</h3></td>
					</tr>
					</table>
			<p>Allied to the concept of markedness is the ability that cleft 
			sentences have to focus on an element in the sentence.<br />
			In this sense cleft sentences bear an obvious relationship to defining or 
			restrictive relative clauses.<br />
			In the sentences above concerning the woman and her mother, focus is 
			irrelevant because (normally) people only have one mother.&nbsp; 
			However, if we amend the example slightly to allow more than one 
			possible interpretation we can see how focus works so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was her sister that she took to the 
			restaurant<br />
			</em>focuses clearly on emphasising the sister (i.e., the object of 
			the main verb, <em>took</em>).<br />
			We can also have, however:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was her sister that she took to the 
			restaurant who complained<br />
			</em>and in this case, the clause <em>that she took to the 
			restaurant</em> defines the sister, just as a restrictive relative 
			clause should do.&nbsp; The implication is that the woman in 
			question has at least one other sister who did not complain.</p>
			<p>Cleft sentences are, in fact, more flexible than relative clauses 
			in what they can identify as the focus and define.&nbsp; We do not 
			allow, for example, either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *Because she was unhappy with the price that she 
			complained<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *In the morning that she arrived</em><br />
			because relative pronoun clauses cannot function to define 
			adverbials in this way.<br />
			Clefts can, however, pull off the trick so we allow both:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was because she was unhappy with the price 
			that she complained</em> (and not for any other reason)<br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was in the morning that she arrived</em> (and not at 
			any other time).</p>

			<p>In the example above, the adverbial of time is emphasised but 
			other adverbial expressions are also possible in this structure so 
			we can have, for example:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>emphasising the causal adverbial subordinate clause</dt>
				<dd><em>It was <span class="style_black">because I needed the money</span> that I went to the 
				bank</em></dd>
				<dt>emphasising the locational adjunct adverbial</dt>
				<dd><em>It was <span class="style_black">on the other side of 
				the river </span>that the house stood</em></dd>
				<dt>emphasising an adverbial of manner</dt>
				<dd><em>It was <span class="style_black">in confidence</span> 
				that she told you that</em></dd>
				<dt>emphasising a viewpoint adjunct adverbial</dt>
				<dd><em>It was <span class="style_black">only economically</span> 
				that this was an important issue</em></dd>
				<dt>emphasising a process adjunct</dt>
				<dd><em>It was <span class="style_black">on horseback</span> 
				that he came</em></dd>
				<dt>emphasising a limiter adjunct</dt>
				<dd><em>It was <span class="style_black">primarily</span> that I wanted an answer</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>However, some adverbial adjuncts resist inclusion in cleft 
			structures so we do <strong>not</strong> usually find:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>emphasised intensifiers</dt>
				<dd><em>*It was really that I didn't like the food</em></dd>
				<dt>emphasised focusing adverbial adjuncts</dt>
				<dd><em>*It was chiefly that she came to say hello</em></dd>
				<dt>emphasised sequencers</dt>
				<dd><em>*It was secondly that I wanted to the question</em></dd>
				<dt>emphasised subject adverbials</dt>
				<dd><em>*It was stupidly I forgot my keys</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Disjunct adverbials (either of style or attitude) and conjuncts 
			also resist inclusion in any cleft structures so we do not find:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is frankly that I'm not sure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is arguably that that is the wrong answer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is alternatively that I will do it myself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is moreover that it is too costly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is likewise that I enjoyed the play<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is otherwise that we must go to London ourselves</em></p>

				</table>
		<p>In addition to the restrictions concerning the types of adverbials 
		that can be the marked item, cleft sentences proper, like these, have important restrictions:</p>
		<ul class="bluebullet">
			<li>
			They do not allow us to emphasise the verb 
			so we cannot have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It was took that Mary her mother to a restaurant did last night<br />
			</em>To emphasise the verb, we have to resort to a pseudo-cleft with 
			a <em>wh-</em>word and make, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Mary did was take her mother to a restaurant last night.<br />
			</em>(An alternative is to replace the verb with a non-finite form, either 
			the infinitive or the gerund, so we may have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's eating in restaurants that Mary enjoys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's to go to a restaurant that Mary most wants to do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's eat out that Mary enjoys most<br />
			</em>but such formulations are quite rare and probably left until 
			learners are able to cope happily with more conventional cleft 
			sentences.)</li>
			<li>
			They do not (usually) allow us to 
			emphasise the complement of a copular verb so we don't normally find 
			sentences such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*It was an idiot that he appeared<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*It's Prime Minister that she became<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*It's foolish that he was<br />
			</em>Again, to emphasise the complement of the copular verb or the 
			attribute it links to the subject, we have to resort to a 
			pseudo-cleft with a <em>wh-</em>word and make, for example, the 
			questionable and somewhat clumsy:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What he appeared was an idiot<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			What she became was Prime Minister<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			What he was was foolish<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What she became was furious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How he appeared was exhausted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How it sounded was indescribably bad</em></li>
			<li>
			When we want to mark the indirect object, we usually resort to the 
			dative shift and use the <em>to-</em>formulation to show the dative.&nbsp; 
			So, for example, we can convert:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary told her mother the lie<br />
			</em>into:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the lie Mary told her mother</em><br />
			which marks the direct object (<em>the lie</em>) and we can also 
			produce:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was to her mother that Mary told the lie</em><br />
			which marks the indirect object (<em>her mother</em>) but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?It was her mother Mary told the lie</em><br />
			is very marginally acceptable, if it is acceptable at all.<br />
			See also below.</li>
			<li>
			A fourth restriction applies only to time adverbs of 
				indefinite (not definite) frequency.&nbsp; We can make these the focus of a cleft sentence 
				as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not often he gets angry with the 
				children</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's really quite seldom the children 
				behave well</em><br />
				but if the adverb is neither modified nor negated, we do not allow it 
				to be the focus of a cleft sentence so, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It's often he gets angry with the 
				children</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*It's seldom the children behave well</em><br />
				are not allowed.<br />
				Adverbs of definite frequency may be the focus of a cleft but 
				the result is clumsy or marginally acceptable:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; ?It's hourly the train leaves for London</em></li>

				<p>In the foregoing and what follows, we will be focused on 
				declarative cleft sentence forms for simplicity's sake but it 
				should not be forgotten that we can also form:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>negative sentences</dt>
				<dd><em>It wasn't Mary who / that took her mother to a restaurant last 
				night<br />
				It wasn't her mother who / whom / that Mary took to a restaurant last night<br />
				It wasn't last night that Mary took her mother to a restaurant<br />
				It wasn't to a restaurant that Mary took her mother last night</em></dd>
				<dt>interrogative sentences</dt>
				<dd><em>Was it Mary who took her mother to a restaurant last

				Was it her mother that Mary took to a restaurant last night?<br />
				Was it last night that Mary took her mother to a restaurant?<br />
				Was it to a restaurant that Mary took her mother last night?</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The formation of cleft questions allows the speaker / writer of 
			the language to avoid the ambiguity of some <em>yes-no</em> 
			questions, incidentally, as is explained below.</p>
			<p>Cleft sentences can also, more rarely , occur in exclamations 
			such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it only for this that we worked so hard?!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a beautiful piece of music it was that she chose for her

				</table>
				<ol>
					<li>It is possible to use modal auxiliary verbs in cleft 
					sentences so we can have, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It might have been Mary who took her mother to a 
					restaurant last night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must have been her mother that Mary took to a restaurant 
					last night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can't have been last night that Mary took her mother to a 
					restaurant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It could have been to a restaurant that Mary took her mother 
					last night</em></li>
					<li>Cleft sentences may be used to emphasise the indirect 
					object of the clause as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was John Mary gave the book</em><br />
					but in these cases, it is more common to prefer:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was John Mary gave the book to</em><br />
					or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was to John Mary gave the book</em><br />
					with <em>John</em> functioning as the complement of the 
					preposition, <em>to</em>, rather than standing alone as the 
					indirect object.&nbsp; This is an example of when the dative 
					shift is the more natural form to select.</li>
					<li>It is possible to leave out the relative pronouns in the 
					same way that they can be omitted from restricted or 
					defining relative clauses.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was her mother Mary took to a 
					restaurant last night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was last night Mary took her mother to a restaurant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was to a restaurant Mary took her mother last night</em><br />
					but, as with relative clauses, we cannot except very 
					informally omit the subject 
					pronoun:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?*It was Mary took her mother to a 
					restaurant last night.</em></li>
					<li>Although the dummy pronoun,<em> it</em>, is the most 
					frequent way to introduce cleft sentences, there are 
					alternatives using the demonstrative pronouns <em>that </em>
					and<em> those </em>(but not <em>this </em>and<em> these</em>) 
					as in, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those were my letters that the postman delivered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was her mother that she took to a restaurant</em></li>
		</ol>
			<p>There are a number of ways to make cleft sentences, pseudo- or 
		otherwise, in order to focus on a 
		particular item.&nbsp; Seven, in fact, and we'll exemplify them all.</p>

						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong><em>it-</em>cleft</strong></dt>
	<dd>In most analyses, these sorts of sentences are the only true cleft 
	sentences and the others which follow are better described as pseudo-cleft 
	sentences.&nbsp; That is probably a distinction which does not need to be 
	the subject of a great deal of teaching time.<em>&nbsp;
	</em>It is possible, as we saw above, to emphasise various parts of 
	sentences with <em>it</em>-clefts.<br />
	These are exemplified above and work like this:<ol>
		<li>Marking the noun phrase<em><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	She enjoyed the hotel most </em>
	<span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
	It was the hotel she enjoyed most<br />
	</em>It is also possible, but slightly rarer, to use <em> 
		that
	</em>or<em> 
	those
	</em>instead of<em> 
	it
	</em>as in, e.g.:<em><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enjoyed that hotel most 
	<span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span> 
	That was the hotel she enjoyed most<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enjoyed those places most
	<span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span> 
	Those were the places she enjoyed most</em></li>
		<li>A form of<em> 
	it-</em>cleft sentences is one which contains a subordinate clause rather than a subject 
				noun which the speaker / writer wants to mark.&nbsp; It appears, for example in:<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I went to the bank because he wanted his money 
		<span class="style_brown">&rArr;</span> It was because he wanted his 
				money that I went to the bank<br />
	</em>Here the reference is not to a subject 
				or object noun but to the adjunct, 
				subordinate clause
				<em> 
		because he wanted his money </em>which is nominalised to form the 
		antecedent of the pronoun
				<em> 
		that.</em></li>
		<li>Other adjunct adverbials, whether adverbs or prepositional 
				phrases, can be similarly marked as in, for example:<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I worked on it at the weekend<span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span> 
				It was at the weekend that I worked on it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat outside<span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span>  
	It was outside that I sat<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She responded enthusiastically<span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span> 
				It was enthusiastically that she responded<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left at 9<span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span>  
	It was at 9 that she left<br />
	</em>There are those who would argue, with some reason, that forming cleft 
	sentences to emphasise an adverb of manner, indefinite frequency or degree is rare or even 
	wrong so sentences such as:<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?It was hard that he was thinking<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?It was frequently that she argued<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?It was enormously that he enjoyed the party<br />
	</em>are all, at the very best, questionable.&nbsp; Many would reject them 
	out of hand.<br />They are certainly worth avoiding for teaching purposes.<br />Even adverbs of time are sometimes questionably used in cleft sentences so 
	while most would accept<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was early in the morning when he arrived<br />
	</em>which uses an adverbial prepositional phrase, the use of a simple adverb is 
	less acceptable so, many would reject:<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?It was early that he arrived<br />
	</em>We saw above that <em>it</em>-clefts can be formed in both negative and 
	interrogative sentences.</li>
	</ol>
			</dd>
			<dt><em>w</em><strong><em>h-</em>cleft</strong></dt>
			<dd>These are usually referred to as pseudo-cleft sentences.&nbsp; 
			The rule for forming them is parallel to the rule for forming <em>
			it-</em>clefts set out at the beginning.<ol>
				<li>They allow the emphasis to fall on the verb phrase and <em>it-</em>clefts, 
			as we saw, do not permit that usually.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She enjoyed the hotel most</em><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
			What she enjoyed most was the hotel</em></li>
				<li>When a <em>wh</em>-cleft is used to emphasise the verb, the 
			tense structure remains unaltered across the sentence so we can also 
			have, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She h</em><span class="auto-style57"><em>as ruined the party</em></span><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
			What she has done is ruined the party</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She i</em><span class="auto-style57"><em>s ruining the party</em></span><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
			What she is doing is ruining the party</em></li>
				<li>We can use other <em>wh-</em>words (<em>who(m), where, when, 
			why, how</em>) 
			to make these so it is possible to have, e.g.,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She liked the clowns most</em><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
			Who(m) she liked most were the clowns</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She most enjoyed </em>g<em>oing to the beach<span class="style_brown"> </span> </em><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
			Where she enjoyed going most was to the beach</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enjoyed taking a holiday in winter most</em><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
			When she enjoyed taking a holiday most was in winter<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took a holiday to get away from work<span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span> 
			Why she took a holiday was to get away from work<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paid for her holiday with a credit card
			<span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span> How she paid for her holiday 
			was with a credit card<br />
			</em>although it is certainly arguable that the use of <em> 
			why </em>and<em> 
			how </em>produces clumsy expression.<br />
				Some aver that adverbials of time as the marked elements of <em>
				wh-</em>clefts result in some clumsiness so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>England won the world cup in 1966 
			<span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span> When England won the world 
				cup was in 1966<br />
				</em>may be seen as only marginally acceptable.&nbsp; This is not a 
				hard rule, however.</li>
				<li>We cannot use <em>whose
			</em>in this kind of cleft so, for example<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Whose credit card was stolen was Mary's<br />
			</em>is not acceptable.<br />To use <em>whose</em>, we need to resort to an <em>it</em>-cleft 
			and even then the outcome is often rather clumsy but we can have, 
			for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Mary whose credit card was stolen</em></li>
				<li>It is possible to form both negative and interrogative <em>wh</em>-clefts 
			such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Mary enjoyed most wasn't the hotel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom Mary liked most weren't the clowns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the hotel what Mary enjoyed most?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were the clowns who(m) she liked most?</em><br />
			and so on.</li>
			</ol>
			</dd>
			<dt><strong>Reversed <em>wh-</em>cleft</strong></dt>
			<dd>The clue is in the name.&nbsp; To make a sentence like this we 
			reverse the position of the <em>wh-</em>word and the object of the 
			verb.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She enjoyed the hotel most</em><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
			The hotel was what she enjoyed most<br />
			</em>As we saw above, we can use other <em>wh-</em>words (<em>who(m), 
			where, when, why, how</em>) to make these sorts of clefts:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She liked the clowns most</em><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
			The clowns were who(m) she liked most</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enjoyed </em>g<em>oing to the beach<span class="style_brown"> </span> </em><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
			The beach is where she enjoyed going most</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enjoyed taking a holiday in winter most</em><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
			In winter was when she enjoyed taking a holiday most<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took a holiday to get away from work<span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span> 
			To get away from work was why she took a holiday<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paid for her holiday with a credit card
			<span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span> With a credit card was how 
			she paid for her holiday<br />
			</em>although, again, it is certainly arguable that the use of <em> 
			why, </em>and<em> 
			how </em>produces clumsy expression.<br />
			The use of <em>whose</em> in such pseudo-cleft sentences is not available and 
			an <em>it-</em>cleft is the only alternative as is the case, 
			explained above for non-reversed <em>wh-</em>clefts.<br />
			It is again possible to form both negative and interrogative 
			reversed<em> wh</em>-clefts such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hotel wasn't what Mary enjoyed most<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clowns weren't whom Mary liked most<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was what Mary enjoyed most the hotel?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were whom she liked most the clowns?</em><br />
			but, as we see with the last example, the outcome is often rather 
			clumsy.</dd>
			<dt><strong><em>all-</em>cleft</strong></dt>
			<dd>These are quite simple and exclude all other possibilities 
			connected to the verb.<em>&nbsp; All</em>-clefts emphasise the 
			object of the verb, whether that is a noun phrase or a nominalised 
			clause.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She enjoyed the hotel </em><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
			All she enjoyed was the hotel<br />
			</em>and this implies that she enjoyed nothing <em>except</em>  the 
			hotel.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she wanted to go </em><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
			All she said was that she wanted to go<br />
			</em>and this implies that she said nothing else.<br />
			It is possible to form interrogative <em>all</em>-clefts such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was all she enjoyed the hotel?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was all she said that she wanted to go?<br />
			</em>but negatives sentences are very rare:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>
			?*All she enjoyed wasn't the hotel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?*All she enjoyed wasn't the clowns<br />
			</em>even when they are theoretically allowed.</dd>

		</dl>
		<p>In any of these four types of cleft sentences, the fronted item is, 
		naturally, the subject of the verb.&nbsp; This means that the clauses 
		may be referred to as <strong>apposed subject clauses</strong> because 
		the fronted item (<em>it, wh</em>-word or <em>all</em>) is the same as 
		the item to which it refers.&nbsp; Thus, for example, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was difficult to think of a better idea</em><br />
		the words <em>it</em> and <em>to think of a better idea </em>refer to 
		the same things.&nbsp; They are, therefore, in apposition.</p>

				<p>That was quite easy to do but there are some other sorts of clefts

				<dl>

	<span class="auto-style60">(Bob Dylan, <em> Walkin' Down the Line,</em>

	Function:

			<dd><em>I'm trying to help the poor man </em><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em> 
			There's this poor man I'm trying to help<br />

			<em>it-</em>cleft.</dd>
			<dt><strong><em>if-because</em> cleft</strong></dt>
			<dd><em>I'm trying to help the poor man </em><span class="style_brown"> &rArr;</span><em>

			</em>Despite <em>if-because</em> clefts containing the conjunction <em>
			if</em> which is normally associated with conditional forms, this is 
			not a conditional form.&nbsp; It can be replaced with the 
			subordinator <em>although</em> as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it looks like I'm interfering, it's 
			because I'm trying to help the poor man<br />

			clefts, making it clear that an assumption that might be being made 
			is not valid.</dd>
		</dl>
		
				<p>Although it is in principle possible to make both negative 
				and interrogative constructions from <em>there</em>- and <em>
				if-because</em> clefts, the outcomes are almost always

						<p>An important motivation for the use of a cleft 
						sentence form, especially in questions, is the 
						opportunity to make clear what might otherwise be an 
						ambiguous interrogative.</p>
			<p>Nearly all <em>yes-no</em> questions are, by their nature 
			ambiguous in terms of what they are asking.&nbsp; Really simple 
			questions such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is John here?</em><br />
			are not ambiguous because the direction of the question can only be 
			John's presence or absence.&nbsp; There is no motivation, unless the 
			speaker / writer wants to mark particular emphasis to form the 
			question as a cleft and have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it John who is here?</em><br />
			and that form is, accordingly, quite rare.<br />
			However, a question such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you drive the car to Scotland last week?</em><br />
			could be directed as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it you who drove the car to Scotland last 
			week?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it last week you drove the car to Scotland?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it the car you drove to Scotland last week?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did you do with the car last week?</em><br />
			and only the co-text and context can disambiguate this in writing 
			although sentence stress can make the sense clear in spoken 
			language.&nbsp; In writing and frequently in speech, therefore, 
			users of the language will often form a cleft sentence to make the 
			thrust of the question clear.<br />
			As we saw above, however, the verb 
			cannot be the focus of a cleft sentence form so the last question is 
			still open to some alternative interpretations which may have 
			nothing to do with driving or Scotland.</p>

		<p>Cleft sentences (or the meanings they encode) are 
		handled very differently indeed in other languages so you need to have 
		some idea of what your learners' first language(s) do before setting out 
		to teach the forms.<br />
		In particular:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>The analysis above of cleft sentences is, obviously, confined to English 
		and it is difficult to do an analysis like this without reference to the 
		elements of English grammar involved (above, we have considered the odd 
		role of the pronoun <em>it</em> in English as a prepositioned element 
		often empty of meaning, the use of <em>wh-word</em>s as relative 
		pronouns (contrasted with <em>that</em>) and quantifiers such as <em>all</em> 
		along with the role of the conjunction <em>if</em>.</li>
				<li>Chinese languages put <em>shi</em> before the item to be 
		stressed and add a possessive <em>de</em> after it.</li>
				<li>French uses 
		the <em>C'est</em> structure to produce <em>It-</em>clefts.</li>
				<li>Germanic languages, on the other hand, have similar ways to 
				handle clefts to English structures.</li>
				<li>Not all these elements have parallels in all languages, of course, so 
		any cross linguistic comparison of structures is fraught with 
		difficulty.&nbsp; Some languages, such as
					Dutch, Albanian, Scandinavian languages (including Finnish and Icelandic), German, Spanish, 
					French, Italian, Malay / Indonesian, Latvian, Maltese, Portuguese, Greek, Russian, Polish (and other 
					Slavic languages including Slovak, Czech and Slovene etc.), 
				Persian languages (Farsi, Dari, Tajik) and Thai 
		do not distinguish between a pronoun referring to people and one 
		referring to inanimate objects and animals.&nbsp; The use of <em>who</em> vs. 
				<em>which</em> in cleft sentences poses a problem for speakers of these 
		languages.&nbsp; They are probably safer sticking to <em>that</em>.</li>
				<li>Turkish, Korean, Thai, Japanese and some other languages have no 
		structure that can sensibly be called a relative pronoun clause so cleft 
		sentences in which there is often a nominalised relative clause cause 
		problems both in comprehension and production.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In all cases, however, the basic communicative thrust of any parallel 
			structures remains the same: markedness.</p>

			<p>Comprehension comes first.&nbsp; Cleft sentences are, despite 
			their structural complexity, very common in speech and writing.&nbsp; 
			The first stage of any teaching is often, therefore, to expose 
			learners to authentic examples of clefts in action and focus them on 
			unpacking meaning and understanding the intentions of the producer 
			of the forms in terms of emphasis or marking.<br />
			Here are some authentic examples:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>All I needed was you</em> (song lyric)</li>
				<li><em>What I needed was you </em>(song lyric)</li>
				<li><em>All you need is love </em>(song lyric)</li>
				<li><em>What I needed was to be alone </em>(website: https://medium.com/@tonislavadocheva)</li>
				<li><em>What I wanted was to die among strangers, untroubled, 
				beneath a cloudless sky </em>(Yukio Mishima, Confessions of a 
				Mask)</li>
				<li><em>What I wanted was the most honest part of your soul and 
				what I received was everything I was trying to avoid </em>(RH 
				Sin)</li>
				<li><em>What I wanted was to understand certain things better by 
				understanding them psychoanalytically</em> (Peter Gay)</li>
				<li><em>It was a story that Victor Conte told me to use </em>
				(Kelly White)</li>
				<li><em>It was to the cockpit on Victory's orlop deck that 
				Nelson was brought after being shot </em>(website: https://www.hms-victory.com)</li>
				<li><em>Going out altogether for a meal was what he had in mind
				</em>(website: http://www.ninjajournalist.com/world/man-ordered-a-coffee-yh)</li>
				<li><em>They are going to say there was a party that promised to 
				deliver Brexit, we put them into Number 10 and they failed. </em>
				(Jeremy Hunt, British politician, May 28 2019)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is not difficult to find many more examples <em>via</em> an 
			internet search engine.</p>
			<p>One way to alert learners to the meaning of cleft sentences is to 
			ask them to compare the cleft and non-cleft versions of the same 
			thought and get them to see what the speaker / writer had in mind 
			when forming the cleft version.&nbsp; For example, both:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to tell him the good news</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the good news that I wanted to tell 
			him</em><br />
			appear to mean the same but the writer / speaker has deliberately 
			marked the good news as the important direct object.<br />
			We could also have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was him that I wanted to tell the good news</em><br />
			and the speaker has chosen, in this case, to mark the indirect 
			object.<br />
			It is not too difficult to make up similar pairs or groups of 
			sentences emphasising (i.e., marking) various aspects of the 
			sentence.<br />
			Like this:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style59" colspan="2">
					<span class="style_black">Which part of the sentence is 
					emphasised?</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style59"><em>John sold Mary the car</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style59">no special emphasis</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style59"><em>It was John who sold Mary the 
					car</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style59">emphasising __________</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style59"><em>It was the car that John sold 
					Mary</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style59">emphasising __________</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style59"><em>It was Mary that John sold the 
					car to</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style59">emphasising __________</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The next obvious step, focusing both on form and communicative 
			function is to ask the learners to devise such a table from a 
			different initial sentence, such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary took the children to the zoo last 
			Thursday</em><br />
			which allows for at least 4 cleft sentences to be formed marking 
			each phrase in the sentence.<br />
			A more challenging exercise is to ask learners to speak a normally 
			ordered sentence emphasising one part of it, such as, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_underline"><strong><em>John</em></strong></span> 
			decided to take Mary to the party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John decided to take <span class="style_underline"><strong>
			<em>Mary</em></strong></span> to the party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John decided to take Mary <span class="style_underline">
			<strong><em>to the party</em></strong></span><br />
			and get a partner to form the three possible <em>it</em>-cleft 
			sentences from that.</p>
			<p>The same approach may be taken with <em>wh</em>-pseudo-cleft 
			sentences starting with, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted a new overcoat for my birthday</em><br />
			and getting the learners to come up with a reason why someone might 
			prefer to say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I wanted for my birthday was a new coat</em></p>
			<p>When learners can successfully unpack the meaning of a cleft such 
			as that one, it is time to get them to do the conversion from, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wore</em> <span class="style_underline">
			<em><strong>a new dress</strong></em></span><em> to the party</em><br />
			to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What she wore to the party was a new dress</em><br />
			That's not very easy to do and learners need a bit of practice.</p>
			<p>There are some other simple issues to consider when teaching in 
			this area:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Level</strong>: these are complex sentences which 
			exhibit unusual word order in some cases and may well confuse 
			learners at lower levels.&nbsp; Handle with care.</li>
			<li><strong>Focus</strong>: This guide has described seven forms of 
			cleft and pseudo-cleft sentences which all exhibit different 
			structural characteristics.&nbsp; It would be foolhardy to focus on 
			more than one or two at a time.&nbsp; That way madness lies.</li>
			<li><strong>Structure</strong>: the structures are usually 
			quite similar: <em>What / It / Who</em> etc. + <em>to be</em> + the 
			noun phrase but it can be another type of phrase in something like<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was over the bridge that he fell<br />
			</em>It takes a 
			little practice to get the structure right.</li>
			<li><strong>Intonation and sentence stress</strong>: are 
			crucial to understanding and producing clefts.&nbsp; Make 
			sure they form part of the core of the teaching.</li>
			<li><strong>Speaker / writer i<span class="auto-style57">nten</span>tion</strong>  is also crucial.&nbsp; We 
			use the structures because we are concerned to make a message very 
			clear in terms of what we, the speakers / writers, consider important.&nbsp; 
			You need to concept check and embed the language in absolutely clear 
			contexts or the learners will just be manipulating the language 
			for no communicative purpose.</li>
