			<h1>Relative adverb clauses</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="relative adverbs" height="310" src="../../imagesgraphics/relative_adverbs310.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Relative adverbs are often considered quite simple structures in 
			English but, because of the differences between languages and their 
			stylistic complications, they are quite difficult to learn 
			to use for many learners, especially those whose first languages 
			differ from English in the use of relative adverbs (i.e., most of 
			them).<br />
			What follows assumes you have followed a guide to relative clauses 
			and/or are familiar with their structure.<br />
			The difference here is that relative <strong>adverbs</strong> modify 
			the verb whereas relative <strong>pronouns</strong> refer to the 
			noun (or whatever part of the sentence is performing a noun's 
			grammatical function).<br />
			The difference can be exemplified by considering what it is that the 
			speaker wants to highlight:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>This is the house he bought</em><br />
				in which the pronoun <em>which</em> is referenced to the
				<span class="style_underline">noun</span> phrase <em>the house</em> 
				because it is the most important element and the object.<br />
				We can re-phrase this as:<br />
				<em>He bought this house</em> (Subject – Verb – Object)</li>
				<li><em>This is the house where he lived</em><br />
				in which the adverb <em>where</em> modifies the
				<span class="style_underline">verb</span> phrase <em>lived </em>
				because the location is what we need to highlight.<br />
				We can rephrase that as:<br />
				<em>He lived here</em> (Subject – Verb – Adverbial)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>That, of course is one way <span class="style_underline">in which</span> 
			adverbs and pronouns differ / <span class="style_underline">how</span> 
			adverbs and pronouns differ.<br />
			Structurally, however, there are close parallels between adverbial 
			relative clauses and pronoun relative clause because they both have 
			the structure of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Noun phrase + Adverb / Pronoun + Verb phrase</strong>.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Simply put, they are adverbials.&nbsp; 
			They are, in fact, adjuncts.<br />
			<span class="auto-style2">(If the term <em>adjunct</em> is unfamiliar to you, 
			you need not worry about it now.&nbsp; It refers to the fact that 
			the adverbial is integral to the sentence and not being used to 
			connect two sentences or refer to the speaker's perception.&nbsp; 
			There is <a href="../lexicogrammar/adverbials.html">a guide to this kind of analysis</a> 
			on the site.)</span></p>
			<p>They act as adjuncts in four ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black">Place</span>: <em>This is the 
				restaurant where we met.<br />
				We met <span class="style_underline">here</span></em></li>
				<li><span class="style_black">Time</span>: <em>That was the 
				moment when she decided to give up.<br />
				She decided to give up <span class="style_underline">then</span></em></li>
				<li><span class="style_black">Reason</span>: <em>That was the 
				reason why he got angry.<br />
				He got angry <span class="style_underline">because of that</span></em></li>
				<li><span class="style_black">Manner</span>:<em> This was how he 
				arrived at the figure.<br />
				He arrived at the figure <span class="style_underline">thus</span></em></li>

			</table>
			<p>This is certainly an arguable point of view when the noun 
			(technically the <strong>antecedent noun</strong>) is a generalised word such as <em>
			time, reason, place, location, phase, period, moment, building, 
			house</em> etc.&nbsp; Because the adverbial refers to a place, a 
			time or a reason, it does seem unnecessary and many think it poor 
			style, to insert the noun at all.&nbsp; In fact, as we shall see, 
			the adverb <em>how</em> does not allow an antecedent noun at all.</p>
			<p>Speakers do, however, have reasons for choices and there is a 
			cline between wholly generalised nouns (such as <em>place, time, 
			period</em>) to very specific ones (such as <em>corner of the room, 
			hour, exact second</em>) with lots of more-or-less general terms in 
			between (such as <em>house, building, year, month</em> etc.).&nbsp; 
			There is, then, a stylistically acceptable range and individual 
			users of the language will draw the lines where they will.&nbsp; You 
			decide which you prefer in this list:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>That was (the moment) when I decided.</em></li>
				<li><em>This is (the building) where he died.</em></li>
				<li><em>Here is (the room) where he wrote Bleak House.</em></li>
				<li><em>That is (the day) when he was born.</em></li>
				<li><em>That was (the year) when America became independent.</em></li>
				<li><em>This is (the time) when we should stop.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>And so on.&nbsp; The rule, such as it is, is:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">If the speaker wishes, for 
			whatever reason, to emphasise the nature of the antecedent noun, 
			then it will be included in a relative clause.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style3">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="style" height="133" src="../../images/tie_bow200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style4">
					<h3>Formality</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Generally, the use of relative adverbs is considered less formal 
			than the use of an adverbial prepositional phrase.&nbsp; It is easy enough for 
			you to identify the formal and informal versions of the following.&nbsp; 
			So click on the table when you have.</p>
			<p>
			<img id="img1" alt="formal vs informal" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'../../imagesgraphics/formalrelativeadverbs2.png')" src="../../imagesgraphics/formalrelativeadverbs1.png" /></p>
			<p>The issue here for learners is that if they use the formal 
			versions, they need to select the appropriate preposition and avoid 
			errors like:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>*That is the year on which he discovered it.</em></li>
				<li><em>*This is the room at which they spoke.</em></li>
				<li><em>*That was the day in which she arrived.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Using adverbial relative clauses avoids the need for the 
			prepositions altogether because those three examples can be 
			re-phrased as:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>That is when he discovered it.</em></li>
				<li><em>This is the room where they spoke.</em></li>
				<li><em>That was when she arrived.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style3">

					<td class="auto-style4">
					<h2>Form issues</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<h3><a name="1"></a>Why</h3>
			<p>The use of <em>why</em> as a relative adverb is often considered 
			plain wrong, whatever the circumstances.<br />
			Why should that be?&nbsp;
			<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'why',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have the answer</a>.</p>
			<p id="why" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">Virtually only the word <em>reason</em> can be the antecedent noun.&nbsp; 
			We can have:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; That was the reason why he came.</em><br />
			However, we can't have other words (even those which are close synonyms).<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*<em>That was the purpose why he said it.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*That was the ground why she complained.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*That was the object why he went there.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*This was the motive why she did it.<br />
			</em>As this is the case, it seems actually unnecessary to teach <em>
			why</em> as a relative adverb at all because the antecedent<em> 
			reason </em>can always be left 
			out.<br />
			This leaves us teaching only the simple structure of <em>why</em> 
			followed by a clause.</p>
			<h3 style="visibility: hidden">How</h3>
			<p>This word can operate as a <em>wh-</em> adjunct in expressions 
			like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he told me how to do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she did it just how she wanted<br />
			</em>etc. but it cannot function with an antecedent 
			noun.&nbsp; It is not possible in English to have, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *This is the manner how she did it.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*This is the way how he told me.<br />
			</em>It <strong>is</strong> possible to use it without the 
			antecedent noun as 
			in, e.g.,<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			This is how she did it.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			This is how he told me to do it<br />
			</em>There is an argument, therefore, that <em>how</em> is not a 
			relative adverb at all.</p>
			<p><strong>Be aware that other languages are much more forgiving and
			</strong><em><strong>how</strong></em><strong> is commonly used with 
			antecedent nouns.&nbsp; That is the root of many errors.</strong></p>
			<h3>Defining vs. non-defining clauses</h3>
			<p>Both<em> where </em>and<em> when</em> as<em> </em>relative 
			adverbs can be used in defining (restrictive) clauses or in 
			non-defining (non-restrictive) clauses so the following are all 
			possible but subtly altered in meaning.</p>
			<table class="auto-style5" style="width: 60%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style7" style="width: 213px">either ... </td>
					<td class="auto-style7" style="width: 213px">... or ...</td>
					<td class="auto-style7" style="width: 213px">... but ...</td>

					where he spends most of his time is upstairs </em></td>
					<td class="auto-style8" style="width: 213px">The first gives 
					us extra, supplementary information and the second defines 
					the office.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style10" style="width: 213px"><em>That 
					January day, on 
					which she arrived, was foggy and cold</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style10" style="width: 213px"><em>That

					which she arrived was foggy and cold</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style8" rowspan="2" style="width: 213px">The

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The adverb <em>why</em> <strong>cannot</strong> be used in non-defining 
			(non-restrictive) clauses.&nbsp; It <strong>always</strong> occurs, 
			if we allow it at all, in defining (restrictive) clauses.&nbsp; We 
			can, perhaps, have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reasons why he wanted the money are unclear.<br />
			</em>but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The reasons, why he wanted the money, are unclear.<br />
			</em>is unacceptable.</p>
			<h3>The <em>-ever</em> series</h3>
			<p>For emphasis, the -<em>ever</em> suffix can be used.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know why ever he did that!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do it however you like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The office, wherever it is, is probably closed<br />
			</em>Incidentally, <em>why + ever</em> is always written as two 
			words.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>These belong neither here nor in the guide to relative pronoun 
			clauses.&nbsp; They are included here for simplicity because they 
			share some characteristics with relative adverb clauses.</p>
			<p>The reason these are called free relative clauses is that they do 
			not refer to an already specified noun or noun phrase but contain 
			within themselves the antecedent for the relative pronoun.<br />
			Here's an example of how they work with a little analysis:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know where he went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I need is a new hammer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why he came is a mystery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How you do this is difficult for me to imagine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say what you like, he's been a great help to us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever said that is not telling you the truth</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			All of these can be re-phrased using a relative pronoun or adverb 
			clause as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know to which place he went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a new hammer which I need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a mystery why he came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult to see how you do this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever you say, he has been a great help to us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person who told you that is not telling the truth.</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p>Analysing these as free or, in some analyses, headless relative 
			clauses is actually not too helpful.<br />
			What they really are, in most cases, is nominalised clauses, i.e., 
			clauses performing the function of nouns, either as subjects or 
			objects of verbs.&nbsp; For example,<br />
			The first example can be re-phrased with a simple noun phrase as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know his location now</em><br />
			and we can nominalise the <em>wh</em>-phrase or clause as the 
			subject or object of the verb:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Where he is now is a mystery </em>(subject)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>What he wants is a new car</em> (object)<br />
			All these share the characteristics of nominalised clauses, to 
			which, naturally, there is a guide on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
			They can also be, rather more usefully, analysed as cleft sentences.&nbsp; 
			See the guide linked in the list of related guides at the end, for more.</p>
			<p>There are, in some analyses, two sorts of free relative clauses 
			and we should consider them here:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Definite</strong> free relatives are introduced by
				<em>what</em>, <em>where</em>, and <em>when</em>.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He eats what he likes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went when she had heard enough<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall sleep where I can</em></li>
				<li><strong>Indefinite</strong> free relatives are introduced by
				<em>who(m)ever, whichever, whatever, wherever, </em>and <em>
				whenever</em>.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can help with whatever you need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who(m) ever you ask will know where I live<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whichever you choose will be OK<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever you go you will see him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever he arrives, he'll be welcome</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>All these can, of course, and probably should, be analysed as 
			nominalised clauses functioning grammatically as the object or 
			subject of the verb or simply as adverbial phrases.&nbsp; In some 
			cases, the issue is to do with subordination so the whole area of 
			so-called free relative clauses is fraught with peril and, most 
			probably, better left well alone.</p>

			<p>This is an area which needs handling with some care.</p>
			<p>Many languages deploy similar constructions which sometimes makes 
			comprehension of the function of relative adverbs straightforward 
			(Italian, for example, operates very similarly to English).&nbsp; 
			However, the restrictions above concerning what is possible and what 
			is not, what is stylistically informal and what is not will not be 
			readily understood because languages vary quite dramatically in this 
			respect.</p>
			<p>Grammatically, too, languages vary a good deal in this area with 
			no one-to-one overlap between structures across languages.&nbsp; 
			Some, for example, will use a different relative adverb in the past 
			and in the present.&nbsp; Others will have words which function as 
			relative adverbs but not as relative pronouns and <em>vice versa</em>.<br />
			Other languages, French and Romanian for example, use the same 
			adverb for time and place.<br />
			Many languages, such as Spanish, Dutch, Czech, Russian, Swedish and 
			other Scandinavian languages, German and Greek, abjure the use of 			<em>why</em> 
			as a relative adverb, preferring a phrase translatable as <em>for 
			that </em>or <em>therefore</em>.&nbsp; This expression differs from 
			the form of <em>why</em> used in questions.&nbsp; So, instead of:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why he came<br />
			</em>the expression will be translatable as something <em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore he came<br />
			</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For that he came<br />
			</em>Some languages, such as Greek, do not have separate adverbs for 
			all the functions and will form the clause with a relative pronoun 
			instead, translatable as something like:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the moment which he decided.<br />
			</em>Many languages, such as Japanese and Korean do not use relative 
			adverbs (or pronouns) at all, preferring to directly modify the verb 
			rather than constructing subordinate clauses.</p>
			<p>Production rather than comprehension should, therefore, be the 
			focus because the forms are simple enough to understand (usually) 
			but not at all intuitive to produce for speakers of many languages.</p>

			<p>Primarily, the issues to make sure of are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The restrictions on the use of <em>why<br />
				</em> As we saw above, why can always be used without 
				the antecedent noun (because only <em>reason(s)</em>) is the 
				possible choice.&nbsp; That's a reason not to bother people with 
				it and confine ourselves to teaching<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				That's why he came<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				This is why I'm asking<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				The fact that why cannot be used in non-defining 
				clauses rarely causes problems.</li>
				<li>The severe restrictions on the use of <em>how</em> in 
				English are not paralleled in many languages so it is worth 
				devoting a teaching sequence to its use in English or errors 
				such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *that's the way how I did it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *it is the right method 
				how we do it<br />
				</em>will occur frequently.<br />
				When they do 
				occur, the sensible approach is to tackle the error immediately.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>is more important, arguably.</p>
			<p>If the presentation of the area does not include a clear and 
			explicit focus on style, then error will occur.&nbsp; In other 
			languages, the distinctions are nothing like parallel.&nbsp; In 
			German, for example, the use of prepositional phrases such as <em>in 
			which</em> (<em>in dem, </em>for example) is standard and not considered 
			particularly formal so speakers of Germanic languages can sound 
			stilted when they use them, saying, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the classroom in which we meet</em><br />
			when a native speaker would probably prefer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the classroom where we meet</em><br />
			or just<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where we meet</em><br />
			Even in German, the alternative use of a relative 
			adverb does occur, incidentally.</p>
			<p>Leaving out generalised antecedent nouns can be handled by a 
			compare-and-contrast, awareness-raising approach using, e.g.,</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>That was when he lost his temper </em>vs. <em>That was 
				the exact time when he lost his temper.</em></li>
				<li><em>This is where we eat</em> vs. <em>This is (the 
				restaurant) where we eat</em> vs. <em>This is the </em><strong>
				<em>Chinese</em></strong><em> restaurant where we eat.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Getting learners to notice the emphasis the speaker wants to put 
			on the noun is an important first step to production.<br />
			Then you can go on to getting them to say something true about their 
			own lives using both specific and more generalised nouns 
			appropriately.&nbsp; As in, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the exact time when I was born
			</em>vs. <em>when I was born<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the village where I was born </em>vs.<em> 
			where I was born<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the reason why I am learning English </em>vs. <em> 
			the exact purpose for which I am learning English<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
