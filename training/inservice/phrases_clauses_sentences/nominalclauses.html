			<p>The second clause in the sentence above is a nominal clause.&nbsp; 
			It acts, in this case, as the object of the verb <em>know.</em>&nbsp; 
			If you are unsure about the nature of clausal analysis, there is
			<a href="clauses.html">a guide on this site</a>.</p>
			<p>The usual way to analyse this question for learners is to refer 
			to it as an indirect question (to which there is also
			<a href="../../initial/grammarl2/indirectquestions.html">a guide on 
			this site</a>) but there is an alternative view and that is what we

			</table>
			<p>Simply put, a nominal clause is <span class="style_black">a 
			clause functioning grammatically as a noun</span>.<br />
			There are a number of different sorts of these and we are concerned 
			with five of them here.</p>
			<p>As a first mini-task, spot the clause which is acting as a noun 
			in the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em><a name="1"></a>I don't think stealing in order to eat 
				is wrong.</em></li>
				<li><em>What you need to do is open the tap fully.</em></li>
				<li><em>I want to come to the wedding.</em></li>
				<li><em>I didn't see whoever did the damage.</em></li>
				<li><em>I told him he was wrong.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'answer1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have spotted the nominal clauses</a>.</p>
			<ol id="answer1" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li><em>I don't think <strong>stealing in order to eat </strong> 
				is wrong.<br />
				</em>In this case, we have a non-finite <em>-ing</em> clause 
				acting in two ways:<br />
				it is the object of the verb <em>think<br />
				</em>and<br />
				it is the complement of the adjective <em>wrong.</em></li>
				<li><em><strong>What you need to do</strong> is <strong>open the 
				tap fully</strong>.<br />
				</em>Here, we have another non-finite clause, <em>open the tap 
				fully</em>, acting as the complement of the verb <em>be</em>.&nbsp; 
				It is a bare infinitive nominal clause.<br />
				We also have a <em>wh-</em>clause, <em>what you need to do</em>, 
				acting as the subject of the verb.</li>
				<li><em>I want <strong>to come to the wedding</strong>.<br />
				</em>This is slightly simpler.&nbsp; We have a <em>to-</em>infinitive acting as the object of the verb <em>want</em>.</li>
				<li><em>I didn't see <strong>whoever did the damage</strong>.<br />
				</em>Not quite so simple.&nbsp; In this case, the clause, <em>
				whoever did the damage</em>, is a nominal <strong>relative</strong> 
				clause.&nbsp; It is still a <em>wh-</em>clause.</li>
				<li><em>I told him <strong>he was wrong</strong>.<br />
				</em>In this one, we can insert the word <em>that</em> without 
				any change in meaning.&nbsp; The way to think is to call it a 
				form of <em>that-</em>clause without the word <em>that</em>.&nbsp; 
				In other words, it's a zero-<em>that</em> clause.&nbsp; If you 
				make the clause the subject of the sentence, it is impossible to 
				omit the word <em>that</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he was wrong is what I told him.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*He was wrong is what I told him</em>.</li>

					<h2>Characteristics of nominal clauses</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>There are some general characteristics of all nominal clauses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>As we saw above with the initial examples, nominal clauses 
				can act in place of noun phrases in many circumstances.&nbsp; So 
				we have, for example:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li>nominal clauses as the subject of the copular verb:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">What you 
					asked for</span> is too expensive</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Asking for 
					more </span>will not be welcomed</em></li>
					<li>nominal clauses as the complement of a copular verb:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My argument is <span class="style_black">that we need to go 
					as soon as possible</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her reasoning was <span class="style_black">what he couldn't 
					understand</span></em></li>
					<li>nominal clauses in apposition to the subject noun 
					phrase:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your request, <span class="style_black">that the matter be 
					overlooked</span>, has been granted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem, <span class="style_black">who to invite</span>, 
					remains</em></li>
					<li>nominal clauses acting as the subject of the verb:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">That she 
					was ignored </span>angered her</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">What you did </span>appalled me</em></li>
					<li>nominal clauses operating as the direct object:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I accept <span class="style_black">
					that she has been badly treated</span></em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dislike <span class="style_black">
					what she has proposed</span></em></li>
					<li>nominal clauses as the complement of an adjective:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm glad <span class="style_black">that she arrived</span></em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure
					<span class="style_black">what you want </span></em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's unhappy
					<span class="style_black">driving so far at night</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am delighted <span class="style_black">to see you looking 
					so much better</span></em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Most nominal clauses cannot usually operate as indirect 
				objects but a nominal relative clause can do so so we allow, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give <span class="style_black">whoever 
				asks</span> the same answer</em></li>
				<li>Some nominal clauses can act as complements of prepositions:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From <span class="style_black">what he 
				told her</span>, she assumed I was coming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They talked about <span class="style_black">who to invite</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They argued over <span class="style_black">spending all that 
				money on a new garage</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was disappoint by
				<span class="style_black">what he had to say</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They travelled without
				<span class="style_black">buying a ticket</span></em><br />
				But <em>that</em>-clauses and <em>to-</em>infinitive clauses 
				cannot do this so, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We were surprised by
				<span class="style_black">that he had lived in Spain</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They travelled without
				<span class="style_black">to buy a ticket</span></em><br />
				are not allowed (but may be in other languages).</li>
			</ol>

			</table>
			<p>Traditionally, teachers have told learners that this is something 
			called a gerund and, indeed, there are times when that explanation 
			will do.&nbsp; For example, in clauses such as:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>I enjoy <strong>fishing</strong></em></li>
				<li><em><strong>Fishing</strong> is a relaxing hobby</em></li>
				<li><em>His favourite hobby is </em><strong><em>fishing</em></strong></li>
				<li><em>I'm tired of <strong>fishing</strong></em></li>
				<li><em>His hobby, <strong>fishing</strong>, takes up all his 
				time</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In sentence 1: the verb clause is acting as the <strong>object</strong> of <em>
			enjoy</em>.<br />
			In sentence 2: the verb clause is acting as the <strong>subject</strong> of the 
			copular verb <em>be</em>.<br />
			In sentence 3: the verb clause is the <strong>complement</strong> of the copular verb
			<em>be</em>.<br />
			In sentence 4: the verb clause is the <strong>complement</strong> of the preposition
			<em>of</em>.<br />
			In sentence 5: the verb clause is operating in <strong>apposition</strong> to the 
			noun phrase <em>his hobby</em>.</p>
			<p>In all five instances, the <em>-ing</em> clause can be replaced 
			by a simple noun, e.g., <em>football</em>.&nbsp; Traditionally, 
			therefore, we can call them gerunds.</p>
			<p>However, the situation is complicated by a number of factors.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The <em>-ing</em> clause can also act as the complement of 
				an adjective phrase as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She and her colleagues were extremely busy <strong>preparing 
				the presentation</strong></em>.<br />
				and it is difficult there to see how a simple noun can be 
				substituted for the <em>-ing</em> clause.&nbsp; We can't have, 
				e.g.,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She and her colleagues were extremely busy preparation 
				of the presentation.<br />
				</em>It is, therefore, a participial clause rather than a 
				gerund.</li>
				<li>The use of the genitive or the object case.&nbsp; For 
				example, we can have both:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was surprised by my getting so angry</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was surprised by me getting so angry </em>(informal)<br />
				In the first case, we can replace the verb with a simple noun:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was surprised by my anger</em><br />
				but in the second case, we can't:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She was surprised by me anger</em><br />
				so the verb is <strong>not</strong> acting purely as a noun in 
				that case.&nbsp; To call it one is misleading.<br />
				When the subject of the sentence is inanimate, the case becomes 
				even clearer:<br />
				We can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her having done the calculation, we assumed it was OK</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary's having done the calculation, we assumed it was OK</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She having done the calculation, we assumed it was OK</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary having done the calculation, we assumed it was OK</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer having done the calculation, we assumed it was 
				OK</em><br />
				but, we can't have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The computer's having done the calculation, we assumed it 
				was OK<br />
				</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Its having done the calculation, we assumed it was OK<br />
				</em>Again, in the last two examples, the <em>-ing</em> clause is clearly not acting as a 
				noun.&nbsp; It is not, in other words, a gerund at all.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The safest option is probably to call this construction a nominal 
			participle clause and leave it at that, without confusing our 
			students (or ourselves) too much.</p>

			</table>
			<p>This is a minor form of nominal clause but it is not 
			allowable in many languages and causes some difficulty in both 
			production and reception.<br />
			In the example above, there are two noun clauses connected by the 
			copular verb <em>be</em>.&nbsp; The function of the clause is to 
			provide more data about the verb <em>do.&nbsp; </em>That is how 
			these types of clause always appear.<br />
			As far as teaching the form is concerned, the first thing that needs to 
			be noticed by learners is that the <em>to-</em>infinitive can also 
			be used in the construction so we can have, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing he did was (to) have breakfast<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next thing he did was (to) drive to work</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we need to do is (to) go shopping</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			However, the second issue is that when the clause functions as the subject, we <strong>must</strong> 
			omit the <em>to</em>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have breakfast is what I'll do first</em><br />
			is acceptable, if a little unusual, but:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *To have lunch is what I'll do later</em><br />
			is not.</p>

			</table>
			<p>These are much more common and cause much more serious problems 
			for learners, especially concerning the role of the function word
			<em>for</em>.</p>
			<p>Nominal <em>to-</em>infinitive clauses can perform a number of grammatical 
			functions.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the example above, the clause is acting as a <strong>
				subject</strong> of the verb <em>be</em>.</li>
				<li>In, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want <strong>you to come early</strong></em><br />
				The clause acts as the object of <em>want</em>.</li>
				<li>In e.g.:<br />
				<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be bilingual</strong> is <strong>to have a great 
				advantage in life</strong></em><br />
				We have two <em>to-</em>infinitive clauses, one acting as the subject of 
				the verb <em>be</em> and the other as its complement.</li>
				<li>In, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hope, </em><strong><em>to come in first place</em></strong><em>, 
				was realised</em><br />
				The clause is functioning in apposition to the noun phrase <em>
				her hope</em>.</li>
				<li>In e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be happy <strong>to help with the arrangements</strong></em><br />
				The clause is acting as the complement of the adjective <em>
				happy</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>the issue with <em>for</em></h3>
			<p>When the clause acts as the <strong>subject</strong>, the 
			function word <em>for</em> frequently introduces it, as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">For</span> him to be so 
			dim</strong> surprised me<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The plan developed <strong><span class="style_underline">for</span> 
			her to drive us all to the airport</strong><br />
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">For</span> me to be asked to 
			do that</strong> is to ask too much</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			However, when the clause is the object of the verb, inserting <em>
			<strong>for</strong></em> is actually wrong so we can't have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They want for her to drive them to the airport<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*They asked for me to do that</em></p>
			<p>For speakers of many languages, even those which allow infinitive 
			clauses to act in this way, this is deeply confusing and leads to 
			consistent error.</p>

			<p>These kinds of clauses are extremely common.&nbsp; As was noted 
			at the beginning, they are commonly taught as indirect question 
			forms such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>where the stations is?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what time the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who to 
			ask for directions?</strong></em><br />
			etc.<br />
			However, they do not only occur as objects in indirect questions.&nbsp; 
			They can also be:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Objects</strong> in affirmative statement as in the

			<p>These operate in similar ways and can be seen as a sub-set of 
			<em>wh-</em>clauses.<br />They are formed in the same way as <em>wh-</em>clauses but, instead 
			of the <em>wh-</em>word, we use <em>if</em> or <em>whether</em>.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know </em><strong><em>if the train is on time</em></strong>?<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me 
			</em><strong><em>whether this is the right bus stop</em></strong>?<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't matter 
			</em><strong><em>whether we are late or not</em></strong>.<br />These clauses are almost always the objects of verbs although it is 
			possible to see them functioning in other ways, grammatically, such 
			as:<br /><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether he will be late</strong> is the 
			question</em> (subject)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am surprised <strong>if you believe that</strong></em> (adjective complement)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thought over <strong>whether she should go</strong></em> (prepositional 
			complement)<br /></p>
			<p>There are complications to consider, which cause quite 
			serious difficulties for learners:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Both <em>if</em> and <em>whether</em> can be combined with
				<em>or</em> to form alternative statements such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't see whether / if his help will make any difference 
				or not.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I matters whether / if she comes or not</em></li>
				<li>In alternative statements, <em>if </em>cannot be followed 
				directly by <em>or not </em>but <em>whether</em> can be used 
				this way so we can have:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She doesn't know whether or not she can come<br />
				</em>and we can have:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She doesn't know if she can come or not<br />
				</em>but we cannot have<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*She doesn't know if or not she can come</em></li>
				<li>In other (non-alternative) statements we can make a negative 
				with <em>if</em> but we can't do this with <em>whether</em> so 
				we can have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not important if you don't come at 6</em><br />
				but we can't have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is not important whether you don't come at 6</em></li>
				<li>We can use <em>whether </em>in a clause acting as the 
				subject but we cannot use<em> if </em>in this way so we can 
				have:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Whether she comes or not is quite important<br />
				</em>but we cannot have<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*If she comes or not is quite important</em></li>
				<li>Only <em>whether </em>can function in a prepositional 
				complement clause so we can have:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They spoke about whether they could do the work<br />
				</em>but not:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*They spoke about if they could do the work</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>If <em>wh-</em>clauses are taught following this kind of analysis 
			then indirect <em>wh-</em>questions, <em>yes-no</em> indirect questions and 
			reported questions such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you let me know when he arrives</em>?<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me if / whether he is coming</em>?<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked me where the hospital was</em><br />
			follow naturally.</p>

			<p>These are as common as <em>wh-</em>clauses and share many 
			characteristics and functions with them.<br />
			They are similar to <em>wh-</em>clauses in that they can act as:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The subject:<em><strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he will be late</strong> is certain</em></li>
				<li>The object:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She assumed <strong>that he would arrive</strong></em></li>
				<li>The complement of the copular verb:<br />
				<em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appeared <strong>that he 
				was late</strong></em></li>
				<li>In apposition to another noun:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her assumption, <strong>that he 
				would be late</strong>, proved right</em></li>
				<li>As an adjectival complement:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was certain <strong>that he 
				would be late</strong></em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>But there are some differences and complications.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>When a <em>that-</em>clause is the object, we usually omit 
				the word <em>that</em> and make it a <strong>zero-that clause</strong>.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me (that) I was too early<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He said (that) I was dead right</em><br />
				But, when the clause is the subject, we <strong>must</strong> 
				include <em>that</em> as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That she was right was recognised immediately</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She was right was recognised immediately</em></li>
				<li>These clauses <strong>cannot</strong> act as the complement 
				of a preposition so while we can have, e.g.:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He talked about having the work done<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They talked over what to do<br />
				</em>and<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He was astonished by what came next<br />
				</em>we cannot have:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*He talked about that he will have the work done<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*They talked about that they had to do<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*He was astonished by that it came next<br />
				</em>In many languages, this restriction in use does 
				not apply and that leads to a good deal of error.</li>
				<li>The longer a clause is, the more likely we are to include
				<em>that</em> or the listener / reader can get lost looking for 
				the clause.&nbsp; For example:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I hoped he would come<br />
				</em>is fully acceptable with or without<em> that </em>but<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I hoped, without much optimism based on his previous track 
				record, he would come<br />
				</em>is technically correct but difficult to follow and most 
				native speakers would insert <em>that</em> to make:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I hoped, without much optimism based on his previous track 
				record, that he would come</em></li>

			<p>You cannot plan to teach everything about nominal clauses in a 
			lesson or even a series of lessons but you can take each type at a 
			time and plan a series of lessons to cover them.<br />
			Much will depend on the level of the learners and the amount of 
			detail they can cope with.<br />
			Here are a few suggestions:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>At lower levels<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li><em>wh-</em>clauses and <em>yes-no</em> clauses can be introduced 
					via reported or indirect questions because the structural 
					issues and functions are parallel.&nbsp; See
					<a href="../../initial/grammarl2/indirectquestions.html">the 
					guide to indirect questions</a> for more in this area 
					including a link to a lesson on this site for B1 / B2 
					learners.</li>
					<li><em>that</em>-clauses usually function as the objects of verbs or 
					the complements of adjectives and the structures are 
					parallel.<br />
					A way to introduce the ideas is via adjective complements 
					and this can include all sorts of different clause types 
					(but not all at the same time, please).<br />
					For example:<br />
					<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style7">
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style9">This might serve ...</td>
							<td class="auto-style10">... to introduce</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style9">
							<img alt="happy" class="auto-style9" height="133" src="../../images/girl_happy_jump200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
							<td class="auto-style10"><em>-ing </em>clauses: <em>
							Being on holiday made her happy</em><br  />
							<em>to-</em>infinitive clauses: <em>She was happy to 
							have a holiday at last</em><br  />
							<em>that</em>-clauses: <em>She was happy that she 
							was on holiday</em><br  />
							<em>wh</em>-clauses: <em>She loved where she was / 
							what she was doing</em></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style9">
							<img alt="sorry" class="auto-style9" height="133" src="../../images/statue_sad200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
							<td class="auto-style10"><em>-ing </em>clauses: <em>
							Having so many problems made her worry</em><br  />
							<em>to-</em>infinitive clauses: <em>She was sad to 
							hear the news</em><br  />
							<em>that</em>-clauses: <em>She was sorry that she
							had to stay in the garden</em><br  />
							<em>wh</em>-clauses: <em>She hated where she was / 
							what she was doing</em></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					Given an introduction to a structure, the learners 
					themselves can respond to pictorial prompts like this to 
					make the correct structures.<br />
					From there, it's a short step to getting them to talk about 
					themselves with sentences such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It makes me angry when ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					People doing XXX make me happy<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I was happy that ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					One day,
					I would really love to ...</em><br />
					and so on.<br />
					Don't go on and consider the complications until the 
					learners have mastered these simpler structures.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>At higher levels<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li class="greybulletlist">It is possible to combine the 
					teaching of nominal clauses as above but demanding more 
					complex sentences making the clauses perform different 
					grammatical functions such as:<br />
					<img alt="father son" height="133" src="../../images/father_son200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					<em>Son, we need to talk about: </em>+ <em>wh-</em>, + <em>-ing</em><br />
					<em>They agreed </em>+ <em>that</em>, + <em>wh-</em>, + <em>to-</em>infinitive<br />
					<em>They were worried </em>+ <em>that</em>, + <em>about</em> + complement 
					nominal clause<br />
					etc.</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">It is possible to revisit areas 
					such as direct and reported speech and focus on the nominal 
					clause rather than the other structures (which will be 
					known).&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style7">
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style11">Reporting ...</td>
							<td class="auto-style10">... with a nominal clause 
							like ...</td>
							<td class="auto-style10">... rather than the dull 
							...</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style11"><em>Can you tell me where 
							the station is?</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style10"><em>She wanted ... (to know 
							where the station was)<br  />							She wondered 
							... (if / whether I knew how to get to the 
							station)<br  />							She wanted 
							... (me to direct her to the station)<br  />							She needed 
							... (directing to the station)<br  />							She asked about 
							... (getting to the station)</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style57"><em>She asked me where the 
							station was</em></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style11"><em>Are we leaving soon?</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style10"><em>She asked about ... 
							(leaving soon)<br  />							She was interested in knowing ... (whether / if we 
							were leaving soon)<br  />							She clearly wanted ... (to leave soon)<br  />							It mattered to her ... (whether or not we were 
							leaving soon)</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style57"><em>She asked if we were 
							leaving soon</em></td>
						</tr>

					and so on.</li>

			<p>Whatever you do and whatever you teach, be aware that this is a 
			complicated area that needs careful handling.<br />
			Many of your learners' languages will not have parallel nominal 
			clause structures at all and, even if they do allow the use of 
			clauses in the place of nouns, their languages will almost certainly 
			work differently.<br />
			What is forbidden in English may be allowed in their languages and
			<em>vice versa</em>.</p>
