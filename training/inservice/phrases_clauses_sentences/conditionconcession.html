			<h1>Condition and Concession</h1>

			<p>Conditional refers to an event or state being <strong>dependent 
			on</strong> another event or state.<br />
			Concession refers to an event or state being <strong>contrasted with</strong> 
			another state or event.</p>
			<p>Here are some examples, some of condition, some of concession.&nbsp; 
			In all cases, the clauses are acting as adverbial adjuncts, 
			modifying how the verb in the main clause should be understood.&nbsp; 
			The clause is <span class="style_black"><strong>highlighted</strong></span>.<br />
			Your tasks are to:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style4">
				<li>decide which is conditional and which concessive</li>
				<li>think about the meanings</li>
				<li>consider how the grammar is working</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is one rogue example which is not a 
			subordinate clause.&nbsp; Spot it if you can.<br />Click on the

			<p>It is sometimes asserted that the auxiliary verb <em>will</em> cannot 
			be used in both parts of a conditional sentences so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*They will not come if it will rain</em><br />
			is not allowed.<br />
			That is true when the verb is used to express a view of futurity.<br />
			However, if the verb is used <strong>both</strong> to express 
			willingness <strong>and</strong> futurity, then the double use is 
			allowed in for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you will promise to give up drinking, I 
			will marry you</em><br />
			where the first use of <em>will</em> refers to willingness and the 
			second to futurity.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>If you promise to give up drinking, I will marry you</em><br />
			which is a conditional sentence <em>per se</em>.</p>
			<p>The auxiliary verb <em>would</em> is also polysemous and exhibits the 
			same phenomenon so, while<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *If it would stop raining we would go for a walk</em><br />
			is not allowed (in British English),
			the verb can also refer politely or with a lack of confidence to 
			willingness, as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>If they would stop talking so loudly, I would be able to 
			hear the music</em><br />
			in which the first use of <em>would</em> refers to distant or 
			unlikely willingness and the second use of <em>would</em> refers to 
			an unlikely future.</p>

				</tr>
				</table>
			
			<p>There are a number of ways that English can express 
			conditionality without (partially at least) the complications of 
			conditional structures.&nbsp; They are:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style4">
				<li>Common, surprisingly so and especially in spoken language</li>
				<li>Often without parallels in other languages and a source of 
				misunderstanding because learners simply miss the conditional 
				nature of what has been said</li>
			</ol>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Using the coordinator <em>and</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>Instead of, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you give me a lift to work, I'll buy you a drink</em><br />
				we can express the same idea with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me a lift to work and I'll buy you a drink<br />
				</em>In the <em>if-</em>sentence, the clauses can be reversed but 
				the use of <em>and </em>forbids that (because it is a true 
				coordinator) so we can have:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll buy you a drink if you give me a lift to work<br />
				</em>but<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*I'll buy you a drink and you give me a lift to work<br />
				</em>is nonsense and so is:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *And you give me a lift to work, I'll buy 
				you a drink</em><br />
				because coordinators must appear between the clauses they 
				coordinate.<br />
				Unusually, this use of <em>and</em> to imply condition does not 
				allow the clauses to be reversed as can occur with the additive 
				use of the conjunction.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Using the coordinator <em>or</em> and the adverb <em>
				otherwise</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This works similarly and is often used for threats so, 
				instead of, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless you repay the money we'll take you to court</em><br />
				we can have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repay the money or we'll take you to court</em><br />
				It can also be used in non-threats expressing logical 
				consequences so, for example, instead of the complicated:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they had been enjoying the party, they wouldn't have left 
				early</em><br />
				we can partially simplify it to:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They hadn't been enjoying the party or they wouldn't have left 
				early</em><br />
				Again, the use of <em>or</em> in these sentences forbids the 
				reversal of the clauses because it, too, is a coordinator not a 
				subordinator.&nbsp; We can allow :<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They wouldn't have left early if they had 
				been enjoying the party</em><br />
				but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *They wouldn't have left early or they had been enjoying 
				the party</em><br />
				is nonsense.<br />
				Equally, because it coordinates rather than subordinates, the 
				word <em>or</em> cannot be placed before the first clause<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Or they hadn't been enjoying the party 
				they wouldn't have left early</em><br />
				is also nonsense.<br />
				With this coordinating conjunction, the insertion of the adverb
				<em>otherwise</em> is quite common, as in, for example, instead 
				of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;If you don't lend him the money he won't be able to go to 
				the concert</em><br />
				we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lend him the money or, otherwise, he 
				won't be able to go to the concert</em><br />
				The adverb can also function as a conjunct, with or without <em>
				or</em>, in which case it requires a new sentence as in, for 
				example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Lend him the money.&nbsp; Otherwise, he won't be able to 
				go to the concert</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Using non-finite clauses</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is often achieved with the use of an <em>-ing</em> form 
				in the non-finite clause.&nbsp; For example, instead of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you tell her the truth, you'll make her furious</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you told her the truth you'd make her furious</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you had told her the truth you'd have made her furious</em><br />
				we can simply have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Telling her the truth will make her furious<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Telling her the truth would make her furious<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Telling her the truth would have made her furious</em><br />
				respectively.<br />
				There is a guide to finite and 
				non-finite clauses on this site, linked below.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Many other languages cannot do some or all of these things and 
			that leads to error in terms of interpreting what is heard or seen 
			and reduces the variability available to learners who are unaware of 
			the possibilities.</p>

			<h3>the conditional shibboleth</h3>
			<p>For most teaching purposes, it may be adequate to focus on 'the 
			conditional' as if it were a unique grammatical structure.&nbsp; It 
			isn't, because subordinating conjunctions and the adverbial clauses 
			they accompany perform a variety of functions, only two of which 
			have been considered above.<br />
			If you have read through the guide to conjunctions, you know that 
			subordinating conjunctions come in many guises and each can 
			be successfully taught.<br />
			Here's a short list of the most common types of subordination with 
			examples of each.&nbsp; All of these can form the basis of a 
			series of lessons which build up to a fuller understanding of 
			subordination into which learners can assimilate the particular 
			characteristics of The Conditional.<br />
			Doing it that way, makes the structure far less intimidating and, 
			arguably, more comprehensible.&nbsp; In fact, one could get away 
			from teaching <em>The Conditional </em>altogether.&nbsp; It's a bit of a shibboleth.</p>

			<p> As you can see, conditional and concessive clauses are only part 
			of the whole area of subordination.&nbsp; There are six other areas 
			to consider, all of which are important, and many of which are 
			simpler to understand.<br />
			For example, the so-called first conditional is introduced with 
			trumpets and fanfares at an early stage in the learning process but 
			is actually little different from a number of subordinating 
			constructions learners may already have encountered.&nbsp; Making it 
			a unique challenge is unhelpful.&nbsp; The use of <em>will </em>in 
			the first conditional is simply to show volition (as in<em> I will 
			study medicine at university</em>).&nbsp; Here's what's meant:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style45">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 149px"><strong>
					conditional structure</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 324px"><strong>
					parallel structures</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 149px"><em>I'll go if 
					you ask</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 324px"><em>I'll go 
					only because you ask me</em> (reason)<em><br />
					I'll go when you tell me to </em>(time)<em><br />
					I'll go where you want me to</em> (place)<em><br />
					I'll go although he wants me to stay</em> (concession)<em><br />
					I'll do it how you say </em>(manner)</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The use of <em>would </em>in other conditional clauses (as in the 
			dread second and third conditionals) has a similar function, hence 
			the possibility of changing the modal meaning by using, e.g., <em>
			could</em> or <em>might</em>.&nbsp; We can get more parallels here, 
			too:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style45">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 149px"><strong>
					conditional structure</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 324px"><strong>
					parallel structures</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 149px"><em>I would / 
					might / could come to the party if he asked me</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 324px"><em>I asked 
					him to come because I thought he would / might / could enjoy 
					it</em> (reason)<em><br />
					I told him when the party would / might / could begin </em>(time)<em><br />
					I told him where the party would / might / could be </em>(place)<em><br />
					Although he said he hates parties, I thought he would / 
					might / could enjoy this one</em> (concession)<em><br />
					I explained how he would / might / could do it </em>(manner)</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Whether you decide to build on knowledge of the conditional 
			structures to help learners with other types of subordinating 
			clauses or <em>vice versa</em> is a matter of choice.&nbsp; However, 
			the key point is that conditionals are not about <em>if</em> and its 
			meanings, they are primarily about subordination.<br />
			Once learners have been led to notice the structure of 
			subordination, much else falls into place for them and the 
			conditional structures <em>per se </em>lose their menace.</p>
