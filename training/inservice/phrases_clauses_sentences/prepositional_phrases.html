				<p>A prepositional phrase, which is mostly the concern of this 
				guide consists of the preposition itself (the head) followed by 
				its complement.<br />
				Therefore, a prepositional phrase has two parts: <span class="style_black">
			the preposition</span> and <span class="style_brown">the preposition 
			complement</span>.&nbsp; Overwhelmingly, in English, the 
			prepositional head of the phrase precedes the complement (or object

				<strong>When a pronoun is the complement, it is in the object 
				(accusative) case:</strong><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please keep this between you and me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't talk to her</em></li>
				<li><strong>a </strong> <em><strong>wh-</strong></em><strong>clause

				<span class="style_brown">where to go next week<br />
				</span></em>etc.<br />
				Sometimes a <em>wh-</em>clause is severely abbreviated (a 
				phenomenon called sluicing) and the <em>wh-</em>word or phrase 
				is left alone as the complement of the preposition as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She telephoned but I don't know where 
				from<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrived but I'm not sure where at<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were afraid of something but didn't say what<br />
				</em>In some cases, the preposition itself may be ellipted, too, 
				as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was arguing with someone but I don't 
				know who</em></li>
				<li><strong>an</strong><em><strong> -ing</strong></em><strong> clause 
				complement</strong>:<em><span class="style_black"><br />

				breaking the window</span>, <span class="style_black">despite</span>
				<span class="style_brown">losing his keys<br />
				</span> </em>etc.<br />
				Arguably, this is sometimes a case simply of a verb acting as a 
				noun and a subset of the examples in point 1.</li>
				<li><strong>an adverb or adverb phrase complement</strong>:<em><span class="style_black"><br />
				from</span> here to 
				there, <span class="style_black">until</span> very recently<br />
				</em>etc<em>.<br />
				</em>Only adverbs of place and time can function as complements 
				in prepositional phrases and even then there are clear 
				restrictions.<br />The guide to adverbs, linked in the list of related guides 
				at the end, has more on how certain adverbs 
				co-occur restrictively with certain prepositions.</li>
				<li><strong>another prepositional phrase complement</strong>:<em><span class="style_black"><br />
				out from</span> <span class="style_brown">under the car</span>,
				<span class="style_black">until</span> <span class="style_brown">
				after my graduation<br />
				</span> </em>etc<em>.</em></li>
			</ol>
				<p>We <strong>cannot</strong> have a <em>that</em>-clause 
			or a <em>to-</em>infinitive clause as the complement of a preposition so we 
			can't say, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I understand from that he told me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He came in by to break open the window<br />
			</em>etc<em>.<br />
			</em>Other languages do things differently and that accounts for a good 
			deal of error.&nbsp; Simply telling learners this little fact can be 
			most helpful.</p>
				<p>In all of the above, the examples contain the standard word 
				ordering of English: preposition followed by the noun phrase.<br />
				That is, of course, why the words are labelled
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>pre</strong></span>positions.<br />
				English has, in fact, some <strong>post</strong>positions which 
				perform the same linking function but follow the noun phrase.<br />
				See below for examples of their use.</p>

				<p>Most prepositions are single words like <em>of, in, at, by,

				consist of phrases in themselves and they include <em>except

				A little care is needed to analyse these as complex prepositions 
				which are followed by a complement rather than conflating part 
				of the preposition with the complement.<br />
				These are not prepositional phrases (although they are phrases) 
				when they stand alone because the complement is missing.&nbsp; 
				They are best considered as multi-word prepositions in

				<h3>A slightly different way to analyse prepositional phrases</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Some functional approaches to grammar analysis take a slightly 
			different view of the prepositional phrase.</p>
			<p>The analysis is that most phrases can be described as an expanded 
			version of the Head of the phrase.<br />
			For example, in this sentence:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The cautious old man spoke slightly hesitantly at the 
			meeting</em><br />
			the noun phrase, <em>The cautious old man</em>, can be analysed as 
			the Head (<em>man</em>) being expanded by the pre-modifying 
			adjectives and the determiner.<br />
			In the same way, the verb + adverb phrase, <em>spoke slightly hesitantly</em>, 
			can be analysed as the Head (the verb <em>spoke</em>) expanded by 
			the post-modifying adverbs.&nbsp; Strictly, a verb phrase contains 
			only verb forms, of course, but this matters little here.<br />
			However, the prepositional phrase cannot be analysed in exactly the 
			same way because the phrase <em>at the meeting</em> is not a simple 
			expansion of the Head (<em>at</em>) but may be better considered as 
			the preposition plus its object (<em>the meeting</em>).&nbsp; 
			Calling the complement the object also makes sense in terms of case 
			because, as we saw above, any pronoun in the complement is in the 
			object, accusative, case which is why we say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked towards me<br />
			</em>not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He walked towards I.<br />
			</em>In this way, prepositional phrases function more like small clauses 
			than phrases <em>per se</em>.</p>
			<p>We do not follow that analysis here, staying with the word <em>
			complement</em> to refer to the object of the preposition but it is 
			worth explaining, albeit briefly.</p>
			<p>An argument <strong>against</strong> calling the parts which 
			follow a preposition in a phrase objects rather than complements is 
			that they need not <strong>always</strong> be nominal items although 
			they act that way in terms of grammatical function.&nbsp; A number 
			of other word and phrase-class members can act as the complement of 
			prepositions, as we saw above and they include adverbs, non-finite 
			verb forms, <em>wh-</em>clauses, adjectives (when nominalised), 
			pronouns and other prepositional phrases.</p>

				<h3>Case</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Case refers to the relationship between elements of a clause or 
			sentence.&nbsp; For example, we saw above that we say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between you and <strong>me</strong></em><br />
			not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *between you and I</em><br />
			because in English all prepositions are followed by the object case 
			and, for the first-person pronoun in English, that is the pronoun
			<em>me.<br />
			</em>Similarly, we can have a sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave <strong>me</strong> them</em><br />
			in which we have another use of <em>me</em> but this time it is 
			actually a dative case pronoun because it represents an indirect 
			object.&nbsp; The word <em>them</em> is the direct object case of 
			the pronoun <em>they.</em>&nbsp; English does not change the form of 
			the pronoun <em>me</em> to show whether it is the direct or the 
			indirect object.&nbsp; That can be done, however, with a 
			prepositional phrase so we can equally have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave them <strong>to me</strong><br />
			</em>with the indirect object shifted to the end and preceded by a 
			preposition.<br />In other languages, German for example, the pronoun is marked 
			differently for the object, accusative, case and the dative, 
			indirect object, case.&nbsp; So for example, in German:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She saw <strong>me</strong><br />
			</em>translates as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sie sah <strong>mich</strong><br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave <strong>me</strong> it<br />
			</em>as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sie gab es <strong>mir</strong><br />
			</em>with two pronouns (<em>mich</em> and <em>mir</em>) signalling 
			the cases (accusative and dative, respectively).<br />
			In other languages, life becomes considerably more complicated.</p>
			<p>English is not a highly inflected language so does not exhibit 
			many changes to words to show case.&nbsp; English overwhelmingly 
			indicates the relationships in syntax by prepositional phrases 
			rather than changes to the nouns, determiners and adjectives etc.<br />
			So, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hit it with a rock</em><br />
			we have what in some languages would be called an instrumental case 
			but English makes no change to <em>the rock</em> to indicate this, 
			preferring to use the preposition <em>with</em> to signal that <em>
			the rock </em>was the instrument I used.<br />
			We can also have what is called an ablative case as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked away from the station</em><br />
			and English signals this with the complex preposition <em>away from</em> 
			but other languages (Finnish, Gujurati, Basque and many more, 
			including Turkish) make changes to the noun to indicate the 
			relationship between <em>she</em> and <em>the station</em>.<br />
			There are many cases which can be signalled in a variety of 
			languages and for a much fuller run down of the possibilities, see 
			the guide to case, linked below.<br />
			It is enough here to understand that learners whose first languages 
			have well-developed case structures will, accordingly, have fewer 
			prepositional structures because the relationships are signalled <em>
			via</em> inflexions rather than through the use of function words.<br />
			Such languages include:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Czech, Estonian, Finnish, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, 
			Serbo-Croat, Slovak, Tamil, Turkish and Ukrainian.<br />
			Speakers of those languages will encounter quite serious problems 
			understanding and using prepositional phrases in English because, 
			failing a clear case structure, the language has developed a much 
			more complex system of prepositional structures to signal case 
			relationships.<br />
			Many other languages do not signal case through inflexion and have 
			ways akin to English to show relationships (or do it <em>via</em> 
			affixation, often suffixation).&nbsp; These include:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese languages, Romance languages, Swedish, Dutch, 
			South-East Asian languages and many African languages.<br />
			Despite having parallel systems, naturally, exactly how the 
			relationships are signalled will not be parallel and difficulties of 
			choice of the appropriate preposition remain.</p>
			<p>We saw above that English has two ways to signal the dative or 
			indirect object: by word order as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She read the children a story</em><br />
			in which the indirect object precedes the direct object, and with a 
			prepositional phrase as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She read a story <strong>to</strong> the 
			children</em><br />
			where we use the preposition <em>to</em> to show the indirect 
			object.<br />And the language also has two ways of signally the genitive: by 
			inflexion as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the company<strong>'s </strong>policy</em><br />
			where we use the<em> 's</em> inflexion, and with a prepositional 
			phrase as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the policy <strong>of</strong> the 
			company.</em><br />
			using the preposition <em>of</em>.<br />
			Most languages settle on one way or another and it is confusing for 
			learners to have to make such choices when they use English.</p>

		</table>
				<p>Other words with dual or triple class membership can be problematic.&nbsp; 
			The first group includes most prepositions not in the list above 
			because simply removing the complement results in an adverbial use.&nbsp; 
			It may be argued that the ellipsis of the complement leaves the 
			prepositional nature of the word intact.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They met outside the pub</em><br />
			which is prepositional and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We can't smoke inside</em><br />
			which is adverbial, with<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was still walking up the mountain while they were 
			already walking down</em><br />
			where the use of <em>up</em> is prepositional (with its complement / 
			object <em>the mountain</em>) but in which the use 
			of <em>down </em>is
			<span class="style_underline">either</span> prepositional (with an 
			implied complement of <em>it</em> or <em>the mountain</em>)
			<span class="style_underline">or</span> adverbial (with no

				<h3>Borderline cases</h3>

			</tr>
		</table>
				<p>Some words lie on the borderline between prepositions 
			proper and conjunctions, adjectives or adverbs and in these cases, the distinctions 
				can become blurred.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em><strong>in that</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>looks like a preposition phrase and, what's more, like an 
				exception because we have <em>in</em> followed by a <em>that</em>-clause 
				as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has an advantage, 
				<span class="style_black">in that</span> she speaks 
				both languages</em><br />
				It is, in fact, a rather unusual conjunction meaning <em>because</em> 
				or <em>for the following reason</em> and is better analysed that 
				way.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>but / bar</strong></em></dt>
				<dd><em>but</em> is usually analysed as a conjunction and that is 
				its function in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called but you were out</em><br />
				However, the word also has prepositional characteristics and can 
				be followed by an infinitive as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did nothing <span class="style_black">
				but</span> work<br />
				</em>and it can be followed by a noun phrase or pronoun quite 
				normally as a preposition in, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone came <span class="style_black">but</span> the Smiths<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody wants to go <span class="style_black">but</span> her<br />
				</em>We saw above that prepositions are followed by pronouns in 
				the object case and here the distinction becomes even more 
				blurred because<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody <span class="style_black">but</span> her knew the 
				truth</em><br />
				is acceptable and prepositional although<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody but she knew the truth</em><br />
				is also acceptable but not prepositional because the pronoun is 
				in the subject case.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody knew the truth but she did</em><br />
				The preposition <span class="style_black"> <em>bar</em></span> follows the same patterns and also 
				means <em>except for </em>as in, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's all over <span class="style_black">bar</span> the 
				shouting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the people <span class="style_black">bar</span> Mike and 
				John were satisfied</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>than</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>functions as a conjunction in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spends more than he can afford<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's more expensive than I hoped</em><br />
				but can also be prepositional as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is taller <span class="style_black">
				than</span> me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's more <span class="style_black">than</span> 5 miles from 
				here<br />
				</em>The prepositional use allows an infinitive complement, with 
				and without <em>to</em> as in, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is better to call by <span class="style_black">than</span> 
				to 'phone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd prefer to stay <span class="style_black">than</span> go</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>except</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>also functions as a conjunction in for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to come except I had no money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't hurt except when I'm very tired</em><br />
				in which case it means roughly <em>but</em>, and in common with
				<em>but</em> can also be used prepositionally in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone one came <span class="style_black">except</span> 
				Julian</em><br />
				and, like <em>but</em>, can be followed by an infinitive<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She does little <span class="style_black">
				except</span> sleep</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>as well (as)</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>is an adverb (an additive adverbial adjunct to be precise) 
				in many circumstances as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It snowed a little and rained as well</em><br />
				and can also function as what is sometimes called a 
				quasi-coordinating conjunction in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He writes novels as well as contributing 
				to the newspaper</em><br />
				but the phrase is also prepositional in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll paint the door as well as the window 
				frames</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>because</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>is a subordinating conjunction as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came home because it was raining<br />
				</em>but combined with <em>of</em> it is a complex preposition 
				as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came home because of the rain</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>instead</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>is an adverb conjunct in for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want to go swimming.&nbsp; 
				Instead, I'll stay in and read.<br />
				</em>but combined with <em>of</em>, the word is a preposition as 
				in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll have the fish i<span class="style_black">nstead 
				of</span> the meat course</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>near</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>is, of course, a preposition in something like:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The library is near the cinema</em><br />
				but it has adjectival characteristics, too, because it can be 
				made comparative and superlative as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pub is nearer your house than mine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house nearest the cinema is hers</em><br />
				and can also be used predicatively and attributively as 
				adjectives usually can as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You place is nearer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nearest pub is just over there</em><br />
				The prepositions <em>close</em> and <em>like</em> share some of 
				these characteristics.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>worth</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>this word is a predicative-only adjective but it governs the 
				noun in a preposition-like fashion in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is (well) worth visiting the museum</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not worth my time</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not worth $400</em></dd>

				<dt><em>from ... to / until</em> vs. <em>through</em></dt>
				<dd>to express the beginning and end of a period of time, AmE

				<p>Usually prepositions are required because they form the head 
				of the prepositional phrase, without which it is not possible to 
				understand what is meant.&nbsp; However, there are some verbs 
				whose meaning incorporates the meaning of the preposition.&nbsp; 
				In these cases, we can ellipt the preposition and make the 
				erstwhile complement the direct object of the verb.&nbsp; Like 
				this:</p>

				<p>Many languages do not allow the ellipsis of a preposition in 
				this way and learners may have some difficulty comprehending 
				clauses like the ones on the right.<br />
				Other languages may allow the ellipsis of an understood 
				preposition but allow verbs to be transitive which are, in 
				English, stubbornly intransitive or demand a preposition at all 
				times when they are transitive.&nbsp; This results in errors 
				such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived the hotel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They participated the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It consists two parts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That depends the weather</em><br />
				etc.</p>
			<p>We saw above that in sluiced <em>wh-</em>clauses, the preposition 
			and the whole complement other than the <em>wh-</em>word may be 
			ellipted as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was speaking to someone outside but I 
			don't know who</em></p>

			<p>This is another large category but, in fact, only three 
			prepositions are common in these phrases.&nbsp; They all express the 
			notion of having an attribute.&nbsp; Some examples:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>The woman <span class="style_black">with</span> 
				<span class="style_brown">red 
				hair</span></em></li>
				<li><em>A man <span class="style_black">of</span> 
				<span class="style_brown">honour</span></em></li>
				<li><em>A girl <span class="style_black">without</span> 
				<span class="style_brown">humour</span></em></li>
				<li><em>A complaint <span class="style_black">about</span>
				<span class="style_brown">the food</span></em></li>
				<li><em>His success <span class="style_black">in</span>
				<span class="style_brown">passing</span> the examination</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Prepositional phrases with <span class="style_black"><em>without</em></span> 
			and <span class="style_black"> <em>with</em></span> are frequently a form of relative clause.&nbsp; 
			Compare<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man <span class="style_black">with</span> a grudge<br />
			</em>with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man who has a grudge<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman
			<span class="style_black">without</span> any money<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
			woman who has no money</em>.<br />
			You can't do that with phrases with <span class="style_black"><em>of</em></span> 
			(and they are less common).&nbsp; The <span class="style_black"><em>
			of</em></span>-phrases are normally only used with abstract 
			properties so we can have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman 			<span class="style_black">of</span> great determination<br />
			</em>but not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A woman <span class="style_black">of</span> beautiful hands</em>  
			etc.</p>
			<p>Many other types of prepositional phrases can act as post-modifiers, often stating where or when something is.&nbsp; For 
			example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>The house <span class="style_black">on</span>
				<span class="style_brown">the corner</span></em></li>
				<li><em>The meeting <span class="style_black">on</span>
				<span class="style_brown">Monday</span></em></li>
				<li><em>The girl <span class="style_black">in</span>
				<span class="style_brown">the queue</span></em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are some prepositions which appear to be verbs because they 
			end in -<em>ing</em>, but aren't.&nbsp; They include:<br />
			<em>concerning, considering, excepting, excluding, failing, 
			following, including, notwithstanding, pending, regarding, 
			respecting</em> and <em>saving</em>.<br />
			They are troublesome because they occur in constructions which look 
			like reduced relative clauses but for which there is no 
			corresponding -<em>ing</em> form in the relative clause or for which 
			no relative clause at all can be constructed with a parallel 
			meaning.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>He wrote a letter concerning his complaint</em><br />
				which cannot be  rephrased as<br />
				<em>*He wrote a letter which was concerning his complaint</em></li>
				<li><em>Everyone arrived excepting only the Jones family<br />
				We will wait pending your answer<br />
				He responded following the same format<br />
				</em>for none of which can a corresponding relative clause be constructed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The confusion arises because formulations using non-finite 
			clauses to post-modify the noun such as</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>A car resembling hers</em></li>
				<li><em>A tie matching his shirt</em></li>
				<li><em>A meal consisting of beans and potatoes</em><br />
				etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>can all be  rephrased as relative clauses although the -<em>ing</em> 
			form of these verbs is not always available because the use is 
			stative not dynamic:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>A car which resembled hers</em></li>
				<li><em>A tie which matches his shirt</em></li>
				<li><em>A meal which consists of beans and potatoes</em></li>

			<p>We need to be slightly careful in deciding what exactly a 
			prepositional phrase is modifying or our hearers can misinterpret 
			what we mean.<br />
			For example, the sentence:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Jane spoke to the man behind the bar</em><br />
			can be understood in two ways, like this:<br />
			<img alt="ambiguity" height="78" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituents_preposition.jpg" width="400" /><br />
			In the first sentence, the <strong>verb</strong> is being 
			post-modified and tells us where she spoke so the modified verb 
			phrase is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>spoke ... behind the bar</em><br />
			In the second sentence, the <strong>noun</strong> is being 
			post-modified and the object noun phrase is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the man behind the bar</em><br />
			When the first sense is intended, speakers will insert a slight 
			pause between <em>the man</em> and <em>behind the bar</em>, making 
			two tone units each with a stressed syllable: <em>the </em><strong>
			<em>man</em></strong> and <em>behind the </em><strong><em>bar</em></strong>.<br />
			When the second sense is intended, <em>the man behind the </em>
			<strong><em>bar</em></strong> will constitute a single tone unit 
			with one stressed syllable.&nbsp; (For more, see
			the links at the end.)<br />
			In writing, to avoid ambiguity the sentence may be rephrased as a 
			cleft:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was behind the bar that Jane spoke to the 
			man<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the man behind the bar that Jane spoke 
			to<br />
			</em>or the prepositional phrase is moved to make the arrangement of 
			phrases clear:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the bar Jane spoke to the man.</em></p>

				<p>Prepositional phrases may act in place of a noun phrase to 
				perform various syntactical roles.&nbsp; In these cases, the 
				phrase is itself nominalised.&nbsp; Such uses are often 
				considered quite informal and some will reject them as 
				ill-formed clauses.<br />
				We find, however:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Prepositional phrase as the subject of the verb</strong></dt>
				<dd>For example in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">In the garden</span> is the best place for that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Behind that door</span> needs painting</em><br />
				the prepositional phrases are the subjects of the verbs.</dd><dt>
				<strong>Prepositional phrase as the direct object of the verb</strong></dt>
				<dd>For example, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should clean <span class="style_black">
				behind the fridge</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to heat<span class="style_black"> in the study</span></em><br />
				We should be slightly careful here, because often the phrase is 
				being used in a normal location function so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She remained <span class="style_black">in 
				her bed</span></em><br />
				is not a case of a nominalised prepositional phrase because the 
				verb is intransitive and takes no object and:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wrote <span class="style_black">in 
				the study</span></em><br />
				is also just a potentially transitive verb being used 
				intransitively with the prepositional phrase acting as a simple 
				adverbial adjunct.&nbsp; The object of that verb has to be 
				something like <em>the letter</em> of course.<br />
				The simplest way to check is to form the passive and then we see 
				that we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the fridge was cleaned</em><br />
				but no such passive clause can be constructed from<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wrote in the study.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Prepositional phrases as complements of copular 
				verbs</strong></dt>
				<dd>For example, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She seemed <span class="style_black">at 
				home</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The were <span class="style_black">in the house</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They appeared <span class="style_black">under pressure</span></em><br />
				and so on, the prepositional phrase is acting as the subject 
				complement of the verbs <em>seem, be </em>and <em>appear</em>, 
				respectively.<br />
				They can also, more rarely, form object complements of 
				quasi-copular verbs as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She appointed him
				<span class="style_black">to the job</span>.</em></dd>

				<p>Prepositional phrases can appear as the complements of verbs 
				and adjectives.&nbsp; For example:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Complementing the verb:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The table is made of mahogany<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We argued about the cost</em></li>
					<li>Complementing the adjective:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am lousy at sports<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is reliant on your help</em></li>
				</ol>
				<p>Some verbs are described as having dependent prepositions or 
				as being prepositional verbs (much the same thing) and they are 
				analysed more thoroughly in the guide to multi-word verbs, 
				linked below.</p>
			<h4>Adjectives and nouns requiring adverbial complementation</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Some adjectives, such as <em>tantamount, dependent, </em>and <em>reliant</em> <strong>require</strong> a prepositional 
				phrase complement.&nbsp; So, for example, we cannot have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is tantamount<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is dependent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is reliant</em><br />
				and we need a prepositional-phrase complement for each adjective 
				and that might be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... to a resignation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... on her parents<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... on the weather</em><br />
				There is more on this in the guide to 
				adjectives, linked below.</li>
				<li>Some verbs, notably:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>keep, lay, place, plonk, position, 
			put, rest, set, site, situate, stay, stick, stuff</em></span><br />
				also require adverbial complementation (often a prepositional 
				phrase) when they are used.&nbsp; So, for example, we cannot 
				allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I put it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I rested the torch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She stuck the suitcase</em><br />
				without saying where and that often means using a prepositional 
				phrase (or an adverb such as <em>outside</em>) to form an 
				acceptable clause with, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... under the stairs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... on the work surface<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... under the bed</em><br />
				For obvious reasons, such verbs are often referred to as PP 
				verbs.</li>

				<p>Because adjectives and nouns are often formed from

				complementation together.&nbsp; There are similarities 
				concerning which preposition will be used as a complement and 
				that is helpful to learners.</p>

				<p>In the guide to multi-word verbs, a distinction is drawn 
				between transitive uses, which usually take the prepositional 
				phrase, and intransitive uses, when the preposition is omitted.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, there are few rules or even recognisable 
				tendencies which can help learner decide which preposition is 
				appropriate in each case so the expressions are most usefully 
				treated as language chunks and learnt as single lexemes.<br />
				However:</p>
				<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li><em>about</em> and <em>on</em> frequently refer to 
					subject matter (so one can have <em>a talk about</em> and
					<em>a talk on </em>a subject).</li>
					<li><em>of / out of, from</em> and <em>with</em> frequently refer 
					to ingredients or materials (<em>cooked with, made out / out of, made 
					from, constructed from, manufactured with</em> etc.</li>
					<li><em>at</em> is frequently found in connection with 
					ability (<em>good at, bad at</em> etc.)</li>
					<li><em>from</em> often implies protection (<em>secure from, 
					sheltered from, shield from, screen from </em>etc.)</li>
					<li>with frequently collocates with emotions (<em>angry 
					with, unhappy with, delighted with, impatient with</em> 
					etc.) and can often be replaced with <em>by</em> referring 
					to the agent in passive constructions (<em>angered by, delighted by, 
					annoyed by</em> etc.)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Many adjectives do not appear in the table above because they 
				are not derived from verbs.&nbsp; They do, however, often have 
				derived nouns or are themselves derived from nouns which take 
				the same prepositional complements.&nbsp; (This is not a fully 
				reliable rule because there are rogues such as <em>be fond
				<strong>of</strong></em> vs. <em>have a fondness <strong>for</strong></em> 
				which do not conform.)<br />
				The guide to adjectives, linked below, lists nine 
				prepositions which are commonly used in the complementation of 
				adjectives.&nbsp; Briefly, these are:</p>

			<p>Prepositional phrases can themselves be modified with adverbial 
			phrases.&nbsp; The modification always precedes the phrase.<br />
			Prepositional phrases of time and place are most commonly (i.e., 
			not solely) the ones we can modify.<br />
			The modifiers are adverbials (and nearly always simple adverbs) and serve to amplify or tone down the 
			phrase.&nbsp; They are, in other words, intensifiers.<br />
			Some are colloquial (almost slang) while others, such as <em>
			directly</em> are neutral in style.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>His explanation went <strong>completely</strong>
				<span class="style_black">over</span> <span class="style_brown">my head</span></em></li>
				<li><em>His house is <strong>far</strong>

				<li><em>That's <strong>wide</strong> <span class="style_black">

			</ol>
			<p>The last example is a fixed idiom with <em><strong>wide</strong></em> 
			deriving from archery.&nbsp; In this case, it is adjectival rather 
			than adverbial but behaves a little like a prepositional phrase in 
			itself.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His estimate was wide of the real cost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The actual quantity was wide of the amount we wanted</em></p>
				<p>Semantically, there are some limitations with these modifiers

				<p>Some of the examples, such as <em>far away from the truth, 
				over the top</em> and <em>behind the times</em> are or can be 
				metaphorical in nature but that does not affect the main issues.</p>
				<p>Limiters such as <em><strong>purely, solely, only, just, 
				exclusively, merely</strong></em> can modify many abstract 
				prepositional phrases.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She may leave <strong>only</strong>
				<span class="style_brown">after the end </span>of the 
				examination time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This door is <strong>exclusively</strong>
				<span class="style_brown">for members </span>of the club<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is <strong>merely</strong> <span class="style_brown">for 
				example</span></em><br />
				They cannot modify time and place phrases so we do not find:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That is merely in the middle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They came solely at 6</em><br />
				etc.</p>
				<p>Standing alone, <em>very</em> does not modify prepositional 
				phrases in English (although an equivalent word sometimes does 
				in other languages) so we do not allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was very at the top<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				However, in combination with <em>nearly</em>, which itself can 
				modify almost any prepositional phrase, the adverb is frequently 
				an additional modifier so we can allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was <strong>(very) nearly</strong>
				<span class="style_brown">at the top</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My house is <strong>(very) nearly </strong>
				<span class="style_brown">opposite the church</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrived <strong>(very) nearly </strong>
				<span class="style_brown">at seven</span></em><br />
				When <em>very</em> is the only modifier, it is not modifying the 
				prepositional phrase but an adjective or adverb in the normal 
				way, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is very close to the park<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked very far from the village</em></p>
				<p>The adverb <em>almost</em> has two functions.&nbsp; It can 
				stand alone as a prepositional phrase modifier with few 
				restrictions so we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is <strong>almost</strong>
				<span class="style_brown">at the end</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Almost</strong> <span class="style_brown">opposite 
				the church</span> is a cinema</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He waited until <strong>almost</strong>
				<span class="style_brown">at the end of the week</span></em><br />
				etc.<br />
				and it can tone down the sense of another modifier as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stood <strong>almost directly</strong>
				<span class="style_brown">on the edge of the cliff</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hit the target <strong>almost exactly</strong>
				<span class="style_brown">in the middle</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lorry crashed <strong>almost clean</strong>
				<span class="style_brown">through the wall</span></em></p>
				<p>There is a slightly grey area here.<br />
			Prepositional phrases are, as we see above, normally only 
			pre-modified.&nbsp; However, in sentences such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The science of black holes is <span class="style_black">over</span>
			<span class="style_brown">my head</span> <strong>entirely</strong></em>.<br />
			it appears that the prepositional phrase <em>over my head</em> is being 
			post-modified by the intensifying adverb <em>entirely</em>.<br />
			The argument here is that it isn't only the prepositional phrase 
			that is being modified but the whole preceding clause that is being 
			modified by the adverb (<em>entirely</em> is, in other words, a disjunct or 
			sentence adverbial).<br />
			The same consideration applies to, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Wholly</strong>, <span class="style_black">in</span>
				<span class="style_brown">my opinion</span>, this is the wrong 
				way to proceed.</em></p>

			<p>Syntactically, where prepositional phrases come in a clause 
			depends to a large extent on the function they are performing.<br />
			They can come at the beginning, in the middle or at the end (called 
			initial, medial and final positions in the trade).<br />
			Here's how it usually works:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Prepositional phrases modifying nouns<ol class="auto-style82">
					<li>These normally post-modify and follow the noun phrase 
					immediately as in, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man<span class="style_brown"> in the corner<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					</span>The cars <span class="style_brown">on the road</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bus 
					<span class="style_brown">at ten past 
						six</span></em></li>
					<li>When there are two or more noun phrases, the 
					prepositional phrases modify them in the same way, i.e., the 
					phrase modifies the immediately preceding noun.&nbsp; 
					This means that people will understand them that way so, for 
					example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The man walking the dog
						<span class="style_brown">with red hair</span></em><br />means the dog had red hair but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The man <span class="style_brown">with red hair
						</span>walking the dog</em><br />means the man had red hair.</li>
					<li>The position of the prepositional phrase can lead, as we 
					saw, to ambiguity.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He used the computer <span class="style_brown">at his office</span></em><br />can mean either<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>While he was in his office, 
						he used the computer</em><br />or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He used the computer which was in his office<br />
					</em>Because the prepositional phrase so strictly follows the 
						noun phrase, the normally interpretation will be the 
						second one.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Prepositional phrases as adverbial adjuncts<ol class="auto-style82">
					<li>When the phrase is modifying the verb and integral to 
					the clause, it usually comes immediately after the verb 
					phrase or its object.&nbsp; That is its commonly unmarked (i.e., having no 
					special emphasis) position.&nbsp; Like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She saw him <span class="style_brown">on Saturday at the hotel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They met <span class="style_brown">outside the cinema on Monday</span></em></li>
					<li>To deal with the possible ambiguity issue, the 
					prepositional phrase is often moved to the initial or final 
					position as we saw above.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>His friends <span class="style_brown">at that time</span> were working</em><br />which could be a phrase modifying the friends (i.e., 
						they were friends then but not now) or an adjunct 
						modifying the verb phrase <em>were working </em>(i.e., telling us 
						when they were working)<br />with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">At that time</span>, 
						his friends were working</em><br />or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>His friends were working 
						<span class="style_brown">at that time</span></em><br />both of which can only be interpreted as prepositional 
						phrases modifying the verb (i.e., adverbial adjuncts) 
					and refer to the time the friends were working.</li>
					<li>When they are marked in some way, however, the phrase is 
					often elevated to the initial position.&nbsp; This is common in 
					written English because the phrase cannot be marked by 
					stress or intonation as it can in spoken texts, so word 
					ordering is the only option.&nbsp; In writing, the phrase is 
					separated from the rest of the clause by a comma and in 
					speaking, by a slight pause after the phrase.&nbsp; 
					E.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">At the hotel</span>, she saw him</em> (i.e., nowhere else)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">On Monday</span>, they met</em> (i.e., not on any other day)</li>
					<li>When the prepositional phrase is an adjunct <strong>very</strong> 
					closely connected to the verb as in, e.g., a verb of 
					movement and its destination or a prepositional verb, the 
					prepositional phrase is rarely moved to the initial 
					position unless some heavily marked meaning is intended:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Mary marked the house <span class="style_brown">on the map</span><br />
					<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the map</span> Mary marked the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They jumped <span class="style_brown">over the wall</span><br />
					<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the wall 
					</span>they jumped</em></li>
					<li>Placing a comma or a pause in spoken language, after the 
					prepositional phrase produces a slightly different meaning:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">Over the wall</span> they jumped</em><br />emphasises what was jumped over<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">Over the wall</span>, they jumped</em><br />means that they were 
					already over the wall and then jumped.</li>
					<li>The medial position is also possible for adverbial 
					adjunct prepositional phrases but there is a need to be 
					careful to avoid ambiguity and the phrases usually have to 
					be separated by commas or pauses in speaking.&nbsp; For example:<ol class="auto-style133">
						<li>After the subject:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dave, </em><span class="style_brown"><em>at the moment</em></span><em>, 
						is too busy to do it</em></li>
						<li>After the verb phrase and its complement:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dave is too busy, </em><span class="style_brown"><em>at the moment</em></span><em>, 
						to do it</em></li>
						<li>After the auxiliary verb or operator<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dave is, </em><span class="style_brown"><em>at the moment</em></span><em>, 
						too busy to do it</em></li>
						<li>Between the object and its complement:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dave did it, </em><span class="style_brown"><em>on the whole</em></span><em>, rather 
				badly</em></li>
						<li>Finally:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dave is too busy to do it </em><span class="style_brown">
						<em>at the moment</em></span></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Prepositional phrases as conjuncts<br />
				Because the function of a conjunct is to provide a 
					connection between clauses, the preferred position is the 
					initial one for the second clause or sentence.&nbsp; We get, for 
					example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He refused to come with us.&nbsp; 
						<span class="style_brown">Without him</span>, we 
						had a lot more fun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last pair played very well.&nbsp; 
						<span class="style_brown">But for that</span>, 
						we would have lost the match</em></li>
				<li>Prepositional phrases as disjuncts<br />
				Disjunct prepositional phrases, expressing the speaker / 
					writer's attitude or a viewpoint, normally come in the 
					initial position but can take the final position.&nbsp; For 
					example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">To my disappointment</span>, the weather turned cold and wet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather turned cold and wet, 
						<span class="style_brown">to my 
						disappointment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From my point of view</span>, that's a poor idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a poor idea, <span class="style_brown">from my point of view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the study of language</span>, the word 'register' is 
						used in a special sense<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word 'register' is used in a special sense, 
						<span class="style_brown">in 
						the study of language</span></em></li>
				<li>Multiple prepositional phrases<ol class="auto-style82">
					<li>When a clause contains more than one adverbial adjunct prepositional 
					phrase, they are usually ordered in relation to how closely 
					connected they are to the verb phrase and its object.&nbsp; So, for 
					example, we get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She spoke to him <span class="style_brown">in French after dinner</span></em><br />rather than<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She spoke to him </em><span class="style_brown"><em>after dinner in French</em></span><br />because the language she spoke in is more closely 
						connected to the verb than the time she did the speaking, or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He walked <span class="style_brown">across the park in the rain</span></em><br />rather than<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He walked <span class="style_brown">in the rain across the park</span></em><br />because where he walked is more closely connected to the 
						verb than the weather conditions.</li>
					<li>An alternative positioning is to use one prepositional 
					phrase initially and keep the most closely connected 
					phrase in the final position following the verb phrase and 
					its object, if any, as 
					in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">After dinner</span>, she spoke to him 
						<span class="style_brown">in 
					French</span></em><br />or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_brown">In the rain</span>, he walked 
						<span class="style_brown">across the 
					park</span></em></li>
					<li>When it is unclear which prepositional phrase is more 
					closely connected to the verb phrase, either ordering is 
					allowable so we get:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She met him <span class="style_brown">at the pub on Thursday</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She met him <span class="style_brown">on Thursday at the pub</span><br />
					</em>with very little if any change in emphasis and none in 
					meaning.</li>

				</li>

			<p>The general rule is that we use:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">

			for large time units (<em><span class="style_black">in</span> March,
				<span class="style_black">in</span> winter,

				<span class="style_black">in</span> the second decade / week,
				<span class="style_black">in</span> the 19th century</em> etc.)</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>on</em></span> for the next size down 
			(<em><span class="style_black">on</span> Monday, 
				<span class="style_black">on</span> my birthday </em>etc.)<br />(Quite logically, incidentally, AmE has 
				<em><span class="style_black">on</span> the weekend </em>but BrE 
				sticks with the illogical <em><span class="style_black">at</span> 
				the weekend.</em>)</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>at</em></span> for more 
			precise times (<em><span class="style_black">at</span> 16:15,
				<span class="style_black">at</span> 9</em> etc.)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are 
			exceptions, notably <span class="style_black"><em>at</em></span><em> 
			night</em> (reserving <span class="style_black"><em>in</em></span> 
			for other parts of the day) and <span class="style_black"><em>at
			</em></span><em>the weekend</em>.<br />However, if we use referencing (i.e., deictic) words like 
			<em>next, 
			last, this, after next, before last</em> etc., we can drop the 
			preposition.&nbsp; We get, therefore, for example</p>
			<p class="auto-style17"><em>I'm seeing her (the) Monday after next<br />We met (the) January before last<br />I'll come next week<br />I saw him last Thursday<br />We married that month / year etc.</em></p>
			<p>We also do this when we quantify the noun in some way: e.g.</p>
			<p class="auto-style17"><em>I take some Mondays off<br />I work every afternoon<br />I have a meeting most weeks etc.</em></p>
			<p>Informally, we can also drop the preposition on days of the week: 
			e.g., <em>I'll see you Monday</em>.<a name="postpositions"></a></p>

			<p>English, prefers prepositions inasmuch as the head of a phrase is 
			followed by its complement rather than preceded by it.&nbsp; That is 
			why they are called <strong><em>pre</em></strong>positions, 
			of course.<br />
			English does, in fact, have some obvious postpositions which follow rather 
			than precede the noun.&nbsp; The common five are:</p>
				<ul class="redbullet">
					<li><em>ago</em><br />
					This is sometimes referred to as an adverb but its nature is 
					prepositional because it relates to a noun phrase of time 
					not a verb.&nbsp; We get therefore, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He left two hours ago</em><br />
					not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He left ago two hours</em></li>
					<li><em>apart</em><br />
					This, too, is often an adverb as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They remained apart<br />
					</em>or it can be part of a complex preposition as in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Apart from the long flights I enjoyed my trip to the 
					States</em><br />
					but it, too, can be a postposition with the same 
					meaning as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long flights apart, I enjoyed my 
					trip to the States</em></li>
					<li><em>aside<br />
					</em>This is often an adverb as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please stand aside<br />
					</em>or can occur as part of a complex preposition as in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a good hotel aside from the poor food<br />
					</em>but it can be used as a postposition to mean <em>apart 
					from</em> (which is prepositional in English) in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument with the host 
					aside, I enjoyed the party</em></li>
					<li><em>away<br />
					</em>This is postpositional when it is not an adverb:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She lives five miles away</em></li>
					<li><em>notwithstanding<br />
					</em>This word is normally used as a preposition as in, for 
					example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall take a walk notwithstanding 
					the rain</em><br />
					but occurs as a postposition in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall take a walk, the rain 
					notwithstanding</em></li>
				</ul>
				<p>There are six more rarer or idiomatic examples:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="redbullet">The word <em>hence</em> is often used 
					postpositionally as in:<br />
					<em>That day hence, he saw her no more<br />
					</em>but is literary and very formal.</li>
					<li class="redbullet">The preposition <em>on</em> (and the 
					phrase <em>from then on</em>) are used postpositionally in 
					the sense of <em>hence</em> as in:<br />
					<em>She worked from nightfall on</em><br />
					but it is, again slightly stiff and formal although:<em><br />
					They got married ten years on</em><br />
					does not seem overly formal.</li>
					<li class="redbullet">The word <em>through</em> 
					appears idiomatically as a postposition in expressions with
					<em>the whole</em> + a period of time such as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked the whole night through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We enjoyed ourselves the whole day through</em></li>
					<li class="redbullet">The word <em>over</em> is a 
					postposition in a phrase such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the same the whole world over</em></li>
					<li class="redbullet">The now archaic and rare word <em>withal</em> meaning 
					<em>with</em> when it is a postposition occurs, better, 
					occurred, as 
				in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lived her family withal</em><br />
					It is only very slightly more common when it is used as an adverb 
					(meaning something like <em>moreover</em>).</li>
					<li class="redbullet">The word <em>short</em> is 
					postpositional in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are six hundred pounds short</em></li>
				</ul>
				<p>There are a few, quite limited, examples of what appear to be postpositions 
				in English.&nbsp; 
				These kinds of expressions are usually better analysed as either adverbs as in:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<em>from that day <span class="style_black">on</span></em>(<em>wards</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this time around</em><br />or as 
			ellipted complements as in:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<em>the church <span class="style_black">opposite</span></em> 
			(<em>me, you, us, my house</em> etc.)</p>

			<p>No analysis for teaching purposes like this one would be complete 
			without some consideration of how other languages address the issue 
			of saying where and when an event took place or a state existed.&nbsp; 
			The term to use here is <strong>adposition</strong> rather than speaking loosely of 
			prepositions as we shall discover.</p>
				<p>Overwhelmingly, however, English opts for prepositions and many 
				other languages take the same ordering.<br />
				In English we have a phrase such as 
			<span class="style_black"><em>on 
			the table</em></span>.&nbsp; This will translate into a variety of 
			languages in the same ordering so we have, e.g.:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style79">

			</table>
			<p>and so on.&nbsp; In all these languages, and hundreds more, the 
			adpositional phrase is left headed.&nbsp; That is to say that the 
			head of the phrase, what we can call in English and these languages 
			the preposition, lies to the left.<br />Most South-East Asian languages, such as Thai, Lao, Vietnamese and 
			Khmer are also left headed.</p>
			<p>That is not the only way to order the elements and many languages 
			are right headed (or head final) so the adposition lies to the right with the noun 
			phrase complement or object preceding it.&nbsp; They are 
			postpositions, in other words, like the English <em>ago.<br />
			</em>For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style79">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style135">Basque:</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>mahai gainean</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style135">Turkish:</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>masanın üstünde</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style135">Somali:</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>miiska dushiisa</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style135">Estonian:</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>laua peal</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style135">Japanese:</td>
					<td class="auto-style80">テーブルの上に</td>
					<td class="auto-style135">Finnish:</td>

					<td class="auto-style135">Kyrgyz:</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>столдун үстүндө</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>all of which translate, approximately, as <em>the table on</em>.<br />Other languages which are right headed include: Telugu, Marathi, 
			Hindi, Kannada, Gujarati (and nearly all other Indian languages), 
			many African languages, almost all Austronesian languages and many 
			North and South American languages.<br /></p>
			<p>A third way of ordering things is one used by a smaller number of 
			languages, albeit with very large numbers of speakers.&nbsp; These 
			languages use what is known as circumpositions, splitting the 
			adposition in two with one element preceding the noun phrase and one 
			following it.&nbsp; Most Chinese languages do this although 
			postpositions are also common and prepositions occur, too, so the 
			languages are often classified as having no canonical or default 
			ordering of the elements.<br />Circumfixing adpositions is also common in Pashto and other Iranian 
			languages.</p>
			<p>Here's a summary:<br />
			<img alt="summary" height="360" src="../../imagesgraphics/adposition_summary.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>A rare form of adpositioning is one used by some Austronesian 
			languages in which the particle is placed within the noun phrase 
			itself.&nbsp; These are, rather obviously, referred to as 
			inpositions.</p>
			<p>The implications for learners of non-left-headed-language 
			backgrounds are obvious.</p>
