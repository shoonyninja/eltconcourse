		<p>
		Here's a definition from Parrott who avers that relative clauses are:</p>
		<p class="indentpara">
		complex structures which allow the speaker to express themselves 
		succinctly and fluently<br />
		<span class="auto-style59">(Parrott, 2000, p. 381)</span></p>
		<p>
		They actually do rather more than that but it's a good working 
		definition to begin with.</p>
		<p>
		Relative pronoun clauses are usually said to be clauses starting with <em>
		who(m), that, which, whose</em> defining or identifying the 
		noun they follow.<br />
		Their function is one of subordination to which there is
		<a href="subordination.html">a guide on this site</a>.</p>
		<p>
		So, for example, in<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog which howled all night and kept me awake<br />
		</em>The noun, <em>dog</em>, is rendered unique among millions of dogs 
		because only this one howled and caused a sleepless night.<br />
		In this sentence, the relative clause, <em>which howled all night and 
		kept me awake</em>, is acting to modify the noun, <em>dog</em>, and that 
		makes it adjectival in function.&nbsp; For this reason, some analyses 
		will refer to these structures as post-nominal adjectival modifiers (Celce-Murcia 
		&amp; Larsen-Freeman, 1999, p 571) or adjective clauses (Yule, 1998, p 240).<br />
		We'll stick with relative pronoun clause here because it is more 
		familiar but those two descriptors are equally valid.<br />
		The key point is that relative pronoun clauses modify and/or identify an 
		already specified noun phrase and in that sense they are akin to 
		adjectival phrases.</p>
		<p>
		Some languages, see below, rely on using adjectival expressions alone to 
		do this task, having nothing remotely like the English relative pronoun 
		structures.&nbsp; For speakers from these language backgrounds, the 
		concepts and meaning are, initially, at least, obscure.</p>
		<p>
		If you are wondering<em> </em>why<em> where, when </em>and<em> how </em>are not 
		in the list above, the answer is that these words are analysed elsewhere 
		in <a href="relativeadverbs.html">the guide to relative adverbs</a>.<br />
		Relative <span class="style_underline">pronouns</span>, as the name 
		implies, are words which stand for a noun, a gerund, a noun phrase or a 
		nominalised clause (i.e., different sorts of nouns).<br />
		If the word refers to <em>why, where</em>, <em>when</em> or <em>how</em> an action is carried out 
		or a state exists, it is an adverb, not a pronoun and does not belong 
		here.<br />
		That relative pronouns and relative adverbs appear to be related is not 
		in question but relative adverbs function differently and perform 
		different grammatical tasks.&nbsp; Relative adverbs cannot, for example, appear as 
		the objects or subjects of verbs (because they aren't nouns of any 
		sort).&nbsp; One relative adverb, <em>how</em>, cannot refer to a noun 
		at all.<br />
		As we shall shortly see, relative pronouns are distinguished by the 
		functions they perform in sentences, technically their relationship to 
		the arguments (most commonly subject, direct object, indirect object 
		etc.).<br />
		Understanding how to use them relies on being able to untangle 
		the grammatical functions of phrases and clauses in sentences.</p>

		Again, the terminology varies.&nbsp; Here, we will use defining and 
		non-defining because the terms are the most familiar but the three pairs 
		of ways to describe the fundamental types are synonymous.<br />
		Here are four sentences to compare:</p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li><em>The Statue of Liberty, which stands in New York, is well known.</em></li>
			<li><em>The Statue of Liberty which stands in New York is well known.</em></li>
			<li><em>The statue of Gandhi which stands in Tavistock Square is well 
			known.</em></li>
			<li><em>The statue of Gandhi, which stands in Tavistock Square, is well 
			known.</em></li>
		</ul>
		<p>

		accept.</p>

		<p>Defining (restrictive / identifying) relative pronoun clauses are by

			<p>The difference between restrictive / defining and non-restrictive 
			/ non-defining relative clauses is not just a grammatical wrinkle in 
			English because the meaning the speaker / writer conveys differs 
			very significantly depending on which type of clause is used.<br />
		The key point is that defining clauses give <strong>required</strong> 
		information whereas non-defining clauses give <strong>additional</strong> 
		information.<br />
			The distinction is a familiar one concerning given and new 
			information.</p>
		<p>For example, in these two sentences, we have a clear distinction in 
		meaning:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style60">
			<li><em>The woman, who arrived at the hotel this evening, has gone 
			out</em></li>
			<li><em>The woman who arrived at the hotel this evening has gone out</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>In sentence a., both speaker and hearer are aware of the existence of 
		the woman and know to whom reference is being made.&nbsp; The 
		information about the hotel is new.<br />
		In sentence b., this is not the case and the speaker selects the grammar 
		accordingly because the necessary information to distinguish which woman 
		is being spoken of is needed for comprehension.&nbsp; The assumption in 
		sentence b. is that the hearer already knows about the woman <strong>and</strong> 
		that she arrived at the hotel.&nbsp; The only new information is that 
		she has gone out.<br />
		This is even clearer when we use names rather than common nouns.&nbsp; 
		Compare, for example:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style60" start="3">
			<li><em>Margaret, who arrived at the hotel this evening, has gone 
			out</em></li>
			<li><em>Margaret who arrived at the hotel this evening has gone out</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>In sentence c., the person referred to is known to both speaker and 
		hearer and the information about the hotel is peripheral but probably 
		new to the hearer (why else state it?).<br />
		Sentence d. is very strange and it is difficult to imagine it ever being 
		produced unless there are two Margarets to whom reference may be being 
		made and the speaker needs to disambiguate to refer only to one of them.&nbsp; 
		In this case, the speaker assumes that the hearer knows there are two 
		possible people called Margaret to whom reference is being made <strong>
		and</strong> that one of them arrived at the hotel and one did not.</p>
		<p>One way to explain this distinction to learners whose languages may 
		not make any distinction at all between the two types of clause is to 
		consider a simple attributive adjective phrase in a sentence such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The hardworking students passed the examination</em><br />
		which is ambiguous because this may mean either:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The students who worked hard passed the examination</em> 
		(and other students, less hardworking, did not)<br />
		or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The students, who worked hard, passed the examination</em> 
		(all of them)</p>
		<p>It is difficult to signal what is meant by intonation n the adjective 
		phrase, although stressing the adjective strongly might show that a 
		restrictive meaning is intended.&nbsp; In the written form, no 
		punctuation changes can be made to show what is meant, although one 
		could resort to underlining or other emphasis markers.<br />
		The two relative pronoun clauses are much more easily distinguished by 
		intonation and punctuation signals.&nbsp; See below.</p>

				pronoun stands for the subject of the verb.<strong><br />
				If the pronoun is not followed by a verb phrase (but by a noun 
				phrase or pronoun) it is the object.<br />
				</strong>So, in<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book which she bought was a first 
				edition<br />
				</em>the relative pronoun, <em>which</em>, is followed 
				by a pronoun, <em>she</em>, so it cannot be the subject of the

				<p><span class="auto-style8">In <strong>Sentences 9</strong> and <strong>10</strong>
				<strong><em>only</em></strong>, we can omit the relative 
				pronoun because it is the object of a defining relative clause.&nbsp; 
				We can have, therefore<br />
				</span><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man we thanked</em></span><br />
				or<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man <strong>that</strong> we

				but we can't have<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The man bought the tickets really 
				is just being generous</em></span><br />
				Why?<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Rule 1 is: Subject relative pronouns must
				always be used.</strong><span class="auto-style8"><br />
				In sentence 7, the relative pronoun is the subject so the 
				relative pronoun must be retained.<br />
				<br />
				In <strong>Sentences 7 and 8</strong> the relative pronoun is 
				the subject (followed by verb phrase) in 9, 10 
				and 11 it’s the object (followed by pronoun or noun phrase).&nbsp; 
				We can have<br />
				</span><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who bought the

				but not<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The tickets, hopefully will allow 
				us entry, are very welcome<br />
				</em></span>and<em><span class="auto-style8"><br />
				</span><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man we thanked seemed 
				genuinely surprised</span><span class="auto-style8"><br />
				</span></em>and<em><span class="auto-style8"><br />
				</span><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man we <strong>that</strong> 
				thanked seemed genuinely surprised</span><span class="auto-style8"><br />
				</span></em>and<em><span class="auto-style8"><br />
				</span></em><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tickets he bought 
				were quite expensive</em></span><br />
				and<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tickets <strong>which</strong>

				and<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the senior doorman, who we

				but not<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Only the senior doorman, we gave 
				the tickets to, noticed that they were fakes</em></span><br />
				<br />
				<strong>Rule 2 is: Object pronouns can be dropped but 
				<span class="style_underline">only</span> in defining relative 
				clauses.</strong><br />
				Sentence 10 is a defining relative clause so it's 
				OK to leave out the relative pronoun.&nbsp; Sentence 11 is <em>
				non-defining</em> so the relative can't be left out.<br />
				The reason for this lies in the meaning that the two sorts of 
				clauses signal.&nbsp; We saw above that non-defining or 
				non-restrictive relative clauses add new information but 
				defining or restrictive clauses rely on the the speaker / writer 
				and the hearer / reader sharing the information necessary to 
				understand what is the subject of the clause.<br />
				In order to signal the new information contained in a 
				non-defining clauses, the pronoun is necessary because without 
				it the hearer / reader cannot know to what the new information 
				refers.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Is it possible to omit </strong> <em><strong>whose</strong></em>?<br />
				No.<br />
				We can have:<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The man whose tickets we stole</em></span><br />
				but not<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The man tickets we stole</em></span></p>

		<p>By the way, there is a structure in English using <em>that</em> which

		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was because I felt ill that I had to go to bed</em><br />
		The word <em>that</em> is not, in this case a pronoun at all, arguably,

				<p>There are four sorts of reduced relative clauses exemplified

				<p>Sentence 22. is a <strong>prepositional</strong> reduced 
				relative clause and can be expressed as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman who is in the garden is my

				Sentence 24. is a <strong>participle</strong> reduced relative

&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The kid who is acting the fool is my sister.</em><br />
				Sentence 25. is an <strong>appositive</strong> reduced relative

				as:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman, who is an expert on gardening, is helping my

				<p>Prepositional, adverbial and participial relative clauses are 
				defining relative clauses.<em><br />

				<p>In the analysis above, all the examples contain both the 
				relative pronoun and what is known as its antecedent (i.e., the 
				noun the relative pronoun refers to).&nbsp; So, for example, in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>That's the man who stole my bicycle<br />
				</em>it is clear that <em>the man</em> and <em>who</em> refer to 
				the same person.&nbsp; So, <em>the man</em> is the antecedent of 
				the pronoun <em>who</em>.<br />
				and in<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The tickets which we sold to my brother</em><br />
				the antecedent of the pronoun <em>which</em> is <em>the tickets</em>.</p>
				<p>Frequently, however, the antecedent is either understood or 
				simply absent.&nbsp; This is why clauses of this type are 
				sometimes called fused relative clauses (because the antecedent 
				and the pronoun are combined) or nominal relative clauses 
				(because the whole clause is acting as a noun).<br />
				Here are some examples:</p>
				<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>I don't know who sold him the tickets</em><br />
					in which <em>who sold him the tickets</em> is a nominal 
					clause acting as the direct (and only) <strong>object</strong> 
					of the verb <em>know</em></li>
					<li><em>Whoever broke the window will have to pay for it</em><br />
					in which the nominalised clause <em>Whoever broke the window</em> 
					is acting as the <strong>subject</strong> of the verb phrase
					<em>will have to pay</em></li>
					<li><em>We are arguing about who to invite to the party</em><br />
					in which the nominalised clause <em>who to invite to the 
					party </em>is acting as the <strong>complement</strong> of 
					the preposition <em>about</em></li>
					<li><em>This is what he wants you to do.</em><br />
					in which the nominalised clause <em>what he wants you to do</em> 
					is the <strong>subject complement</strong> of the copular verb <em>
					be</em></li>
					<li><em>He gave whoever asked the money they needed<br />
					</em>in which the nominal clause <em>whoever asked </em>is 
					acting as the <strong>indirect object </strong>of the verb
					<em>give</em></li>
				</ul>
				<p>As you see, nominalised or fused relative clauses fill the 
				same grammatical slots as noun phrases (hence the name).</p>
				<p>With nominal relative clauses certain relative pronouns are 
				used:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><em>what</em> is the most common<ol class="bluebuttonlist">
						<li><em>She told him what he wanted to hear </em>
						(object)</li>
						<li><em>What I wanted had disappeared </em>(subject)</li>
						<li><em>Have you any idea what to do next? </em>(object 
						of the interrogative)</li>

&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; How(ever) you do it is your business<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever he comes is OK with me</em><br />
				but these are, in fact, relative adverbs, not relative pronouns 
				(and the subject of a different guide linked in the list of related guides at the end).<br />
				If the word refers to <em>when, how</em> or <em>why</em>, it is not a relative 
				pronoun, it's a relative adverb and they function significantly 
				differently.&nbsp; To mix them up, and hence confuse your 
				learners, is unwise.<br />
				Some <em>wh- </em>and<em> that-c</em>lauses occur in what are known as cleft 
				sentences and there is guide to these on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>
		<p>Unlike other nominal clauses, nominal relative clauses can act as the 
		indirect object so we allow, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll give whoever asks a new book.</em></p>
		<p>There are also structures called free relative clauses and those, 
		too, are considered in the guide to relative adverbs because they share 
		some characteristics.&nbsp; As you will see, if you go to that guide, 
		this site takes the view that nominalisation is a better way to think 
		about such things.</p>

				<p>As saw in many of the examples in the guide so far, relative 
				pronoun clauses can occur in mid-position in a sentence, with or 
				without the object pronoun.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man <span class="style_black">(whom) 
				you met</span> was my boss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book<span class="style_black"> (which / that) you took</span> 
				was mine.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person <span class="style_black">who sold me the car
				</span>has left the country</em><br />
				etc.</p>
		<p>Relative pronoun clauses are also frequently found in the final 
		position in sentences because they typically introduce new information 
		(and that is a common phenomenon in English called end focus).<br />
		The antecedent is commonly an indefinite pronoun such as one of the <em>
		any</em>- or <em>some</em>- series or an indefinite noun phrase such as
		<em>a person, a child, a thing, a tool</em> etc.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m looking for someone <span class="style_black">
		who can help me write a website</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need something <span class="style_black">which can act as 
		a counterbalance</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you find us a local <span class="style_black">who can 
		show us the way</span>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have the tool <span class="style_black">that will do 
		the job</span></em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that the man <span class="style_black">whose father is 
		an MP</span>?</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		This position is common with an existential <em>there is / there are</em> 
		structure.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anyone here <span class="style_black">
		who can help me</span>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is something over there <span class="style_black">that 
		looks like a snake</span></em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some things <span class="style_black">
		(that) I always forget to pack</span></em><br />
		etc.<br />
		By the nature of such sentences, the relative pronoun is often the 
		subject and cannot, therefore, be omitted.</p>
		<p>Non-defining relative clauses almost always occur in mid-position so 
		we can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister, who lives in America, may be able to 
		help you with that</em><br />
		but not:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *My sister may be able to help you with that, who 
		lives in America</em></p>

		</table>
		
				<p>Relative pronouns clauses can also be stacked in the final 
				position so we can have, for example:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the book I got from the library which I like but that 
				you hate<br />
				</em>In theory, there is no limit to how many relative pronoun 
				clauses can be stacked in this way but native speakers stop at 
				two or three.</p>
		<p>This is less common in mid-position because of the cognitive overload 
		produced by trying say (and understand) something like:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you given the food which I cooked and that you hated but 
		which the guests enjoyed to the dog?</em></p>
		<p>Non-defining clauses, probably up to a maximum of two, can be 
		stacked in mid-position.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; His brother, who lives in France and who speaks French, may 
		be able to translate that.<br />
		</em>It is possible to have more than two of these, providing they are 
		short enough so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>His brother, who lives in France, speaks French, can be 
		contacted by email and is usually helpful, may be able to translate that</em><br />
		is possible but that's about the limit of the cognitive load with which 
		speakers and listeners can cope.</p>

				<p>There is an odd form of relative clause in which it is not 
				possible to identify an antecedent noun phrase because the 
				reference is not to a particular person or object but to the 
				whole of a preceding sentence (or even a longer text).&nbsp; The 
				name for this varies in the literature but here we will refer to 
				them as<strong> sentence relative clauses</strong> although you 
				may find them called comment clauses and a number of other 
				things.<br />
				The only one of the five pronouns which can function this way is
				<em>which</em>.<br />
				Here are some examples:</p>
		<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They fell in love and got married,
		<span class="style_black">which astonished everyone they knew</span>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the rain, the garden flourished,
		<span class="style_black">which was no surprise</span>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we had had the meeting, matters improved,
		<span class="style_black">which was welcome</span>.</em></p>
		<p>These clauses are generally separated from the antecedent text by 
		commas because they are, in fact, non-defining, in the sense that the 
		preceding text can sensibly stand alone.<br />
		They always follow the text to which they refer.<br />
		It is not possible to omit the pronoun.</p>

				<p>Relative clauses in English come after the noun to which they 
				refer.&nbsp; The reason for this has to do with how elements are 
				ordered in English in terms of what is known as heaviness.<br />
				A heavy element of a clause is more grammatically and lexically 
				complex than a light one.&nbsp; For example, modifying a noun 
				with a determiner or simple adjective as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three cars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; red car</em><br />
				is a very light way to do so and English prefers light elements 
				to precede the noun so we do not get<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; car that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cars a<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; car the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cars three<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; car red</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				This is not the case, incidentally, in a range of other 
				languages, including Yoruba and many African languages as well 
				as Thai and many other South-East Asian languages.<br />
				However, modification with a complex prepositional phrase will 
				normally follow the noun because it is a heavier element than a 
				single determiner or adjective so we have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the car over there with the broken 
				headlight</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the over there with the broken headlight 
				car.</em><br />
				Relative clauses are just about the most complex way in which 
				noun phrases can be modified in English so it is unsurprising 
				that the clauses follow the noun they modify or refer to.&nbsp; 
				That is not a universal tendency of all languages but it is one 
				shared with most European languages.</p>
		<p>The ways in which other languages form relative clauses is 
				very varied and first-language interference errors are common 
				when learners are acquiring the system in English.<br />
				Here's brief run-down of the most important differences.&nbsp; 
				It behoves you to find out how your learners' first language(s) 
				handle the area so you are prepared for the interference issues 
				and can focus on salient differences.&nbsp; If you are a native 
				or very competent speaker of your learners' first language(s), 
				this just requires a little thought.&nbsp; In other 
				circumstances, it requires a little research.</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong><em>who</em> vs. <em>which</em></strong><br />
					Many languages, including but not limited to:<br />
					Dutch, Albanian, Scandinavian languages (including Finnish, 
					this time, and Icelandic), German (in which relative 
					pronouns closely parallel the form of the definite article), Spanish, 
					French, Italian, Malay / Indonesian, Latvian, Maltese, Portuguese, Greek, Russian, Polish (and other 
					Slavic languages including Slovak, Czech and Slovene etc.), Farsi and Thai<br />
					do not distinguish between a pronoun referring to people and 
					one referring to inanimate objects and animals.&nbsp; In 
					most languages, therefore, there is no pronoun distinction 
					between<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind which came in</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who came in</em><br />
					so errors such 
					as<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's the man which I saw<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's the table who he bought in France</em><br />etc. are frequent and have to be handled by making sure that 
					the distinctions in English between <em>who</em> and <em>which</em> are very clear.<br />
					Speakers of these languages, aware that English is different 
					in this respect, may be tempted to play safe and overuse <em>
					that</em> in grammatical environments where it is not 
					allowable (i.e., in non-defining or non-restricted clauses).&nbsp; 
					Errors such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The Eiger, that is in The Alps, is a 
					beautiful mountain</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The bus, that I take every morning, 
					was very late today</em><br />
					will occur.<br />
					Additionally, <em>that</em> is often unacceptably informal, 
					especially in writing, and that leads to stylistic error.<br />
					Finally, some of these languages use <em>that</em> and
					<em>what</em> interchangeably and that produces errors like<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's the man what he said would come</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The wind what came in <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The man what came to the meeting</em><br />etc.</li>
					<li><strong>Non-parallel structures</strong><br />
					Even languages which sometimes 
					distinguish between pronouns for people and things do so in 
					ways which do not parallel English at all.<br />
					In French, for example, different pronouns are used 
					depending on whether the object or the subject is the 
					reference (<em>que</em> and <em>qui</em> respectively) but 
					both can be used for animate and inanimate nouns.<br />
					Italian uses different pronouns depending on whether the 
					noun is followed by a preposition or not (<em>cui</em> and
					<em>che</em> respectively).<br />
					Portuguese has a single relative pronoun (<em>que</em>) 
					which can refer to people or things but this changes to <em>quem </em>
					when preceded by a preposition.&nbsp; The word <em>quem </em>is only 
					used to refer to people and means <em>who</em> or <em>whom</em>.<br />
					All of these differences can lead to interlingual errors 
					because of temptation to assume that differences like these 
					are paralleled in English.<br />
					A further non-parallel aspect is the use of <em>which</em> 
					as a sentence relative clause to refer to a preceding text 
					rather than an identifiable antecedent noun phrase.&nbsp; 
					Most languages will not use a pronoun in this way, 
					preferring something like <em>... and that</em> + the 
					comment or using an equivalent of <em>what</em>.</li>
					<li><strong>Omitting the pronoun</strong><br />
					Most languages which use relative pronouns as subordinators 
					do not allow the pronoun to be omitted and, apart from 
					causing speakers to sound unnaturally formal with sentences 
					such as<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; The book which I read explains it well</em><br />
					instead of the much more natural<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The book I read explains it well</em><br />
					this also presents comprehension difficulties because 
					learners from these backgrounds will have problems 
					understanding<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Is she the woman you spoke to?</em><br />
					or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the program you should run<br />
					</em>because there are no obvious pronoun clues to what the object 
					of the verb really is.<br />
					Languages which do not allow the pronoun omission are in the 
					majority and include most of those listed in point 1, above.<br />
					The omission of the pronoun in English, incidentally, causes 
					serious problems for machine translations for the same 
					reason that comprehension issues arise.</li>
					<li><strong>Restricted and non-restricted uses</strong><br />
					A range of languages, including Russian, German, Dutch and 
					Polish, do not distinguish between restricted (defining) 
					clauses and non-restricted (non-defining) clauses and that 
					can cause punctuation, pronunciation and comprehension 
					errors.&nbsp; In German, for example, all relative clauses 
					are separated by commas, not just non-defining clauses as in 
					English.<br />
					For speakers of other languages, in which the comma is used 
					to separate sense groups rather than represent pausing, 
					similar issues arise.</li>
					<li><strong>Concord</strong><br />
					Most languages (including American varieties of English) are 
					strict about concord and will strive to make verb and 
					pronoun forms match the number and characteristics of the 
					subject.&nbsp; English is sloppier in this respect and, 
					depending on their notion about the nature of the subject, 
					English speakers can accept, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group who were asked to work on 
					the project</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group which was asked to work on 
					the project</em><br />
					but will not allow<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The group which were asked</em> <em>to work on the 
					project</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The group who was asked to work on 
					the project<br />
					</em>This will lead to some error because most learners will 
					assume that English has the same grammatical regard for 
					concord that their languages exhibit.<br />
					Other concord errors will occur, such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The range of students which was 
					accepted for a place at the university</em><br />
					which follows a grammatical rule (<em>range</em> is 
					non-animate and singular and so should be followed by <em>
					which</em> and a singular verb form) but is unacceptable to 
					most English speakers who would prefer:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The range of students who were 
					accepted for a place at the university</em><br />
					These are examples of issues with notional and proximity 
					concord respectively in English.&nbsp; For more on concord, 
					follow the link below.</li>
					<li><strong>Absence of relative pronouns and clauses</strong><br />
					You will search in vain for mention of relative pronouns in 
					the grammars of many languages, including Turkish (usually), Korean, 
					Tamil and Japanese, for the simple reason that these 
					languages do not use them at all and no closely equivalent 
					structures exist.<br />
					In most, the meaning is expressed either through compound 
					adjectives, so we get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The by the river house</em><br />
					instead of<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house (which is) by the river</em><br />
					or by participle clauses so we get, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *My friend living in America invited me to visit him</em><br />
					instead of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>My friend who lives in America invited me to visit him<br />
					</em>Some of these language, Turkish being an obvious 
					example, do have a structure similar to a relative clause 
					but the language uses non-finite forms rather than finite 
					ones which English prefers.&nbsp; So, for example, a Turkish 
					speaker with have little difficulty understanding or 
					producing:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car sitting in front of the house 
					is his</em><br />
					but will not naturally produce and may have difficulty 
					understanding<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car which broke down is in front 
					of the house<br />
					</em>and may attempt something like:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The car breaking down is in front of 
					the house</em></li>
					<li><strong>Resisting subordination</strong><br />
					South Asian languages in particular resist subordination 
					altogether, preferring other ways to express the fact that 
					one part of a sentence depends on the understanding of 
					another, and speakers of these languages (which include many 
					in the subcontinent such as Hindi and Urdu) may have 
					difficulty seeing the reason for relative clauses at all and 
					struggle with both the forms and the whole concept of 
					subordination in general.</li>
					<li><strong>Clause ordering</strong><br />
					Finally, in Chinese languages, there are parallel structures 
					but in these languages, the relative clause <strong>precedes</strong> 
					rather than follows the noun phrase and that can produce 
					errors such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Who is in England my friend wrote to me</em><br />
					Additionally, the pronoun may routinely be omitted 
					regardless of the grammatical function it performs and that 
					leads to errors such<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The man gave me the money was very 
					friendly</em><br />
					This will also affect languages which use adjectival phrases 
					or participle clauses to express the concepts (see point 6) 
					because these structures also precede the noun and they may 
					produce errors such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*The parking the car woman ...<br />
					</em>instead of<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman (who is) parking the car<br />
					</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The book buying the man is very expensive<br />
					</em>instead of<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book (which) the man is buying / bought is very expensive</em><br />
					The distinction between the times when one can and cannot 
					omit the pronoun and the ordering of the clauses need 
					careful work.</li>

				<p>If you have been following up to now, you will know that this 
				is not a simple system in English and the restrictions, as we 
				saw above, are important.&nbsp; In particular, we (and, 
				eventually, our learners) need to be aware of:</p>
		<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
			<li>when the pronoun can be omitted</li>
			<li>when the 
				pronoun <em>that</em> can be used</li>
			<li>where the clause comes in the sentence</li>
			<li>which pronoun to select</li>
			<li>when the clauses can be reduced or 
				nominalised</li>
		</ul>
				<p>And these are just some of the issues you need to know about 
				and analyse before you can begin to tackle the area.<br />
				For this reason, careful selection of model texts or other 
				presentation texts is very important.<br />
				If the text you 
				select contains multiple examples of relative pronouns as 
				subjects, as objects, including <em>that</em>, reduced, with 
				omitted pronouns, in nominalised clauses and so on you are 
				asking for trouble.&nbsp; This will be compounded if you also 
				fail to distinguish between relative pronouns and relative 
				adverbs.&nbsp; For examples of the horrible, confusing mishmash 
				that doing so produces, search the web for lessons in the area.&nbsp; Alternatively, pick up any of a range of classroom coursebooks 
				whose authors have neglected to do the research.</p>
				<p>At lower levels in particular, you need to focus very 
				carefully, introducing, say, only defining relative clauses 
				using <em>who</em> and <em>which</em> as subject pronouns in 
				model sentences such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He is the student who asks lots of questions</em><br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>That is the car which sat outside my house all night</em><br />
				Getting lower-level learners to form such sentences from:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is the student<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asks lots of questions</em><br />
				or<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; That is the car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It sat outside my house all night</em><br />
				is a good beginning but it can't stop there, of course.</p>

		<p>A quickly set up exercise to practise relative pronoun clauses 
		is to get your learners to look out of the classroom window and 
		tell you what they see.&nbsp; With a bit of priming and nudging from 
		you, that can elicit comments such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see a car which is parked illegally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a traffic warden who is putting a ticket on it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people whose car it is will be really upset</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		Clearly, this can't be done until the forms have been presented and 
		practised a little but it works well.</p>

				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
				<p>Using your learners' own experiences (their internal world) can also be 
		productive and it is not hard to set up practice routines to evince 
		statements like:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went on holiday to New York last year which I 
		found fascinating.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a room in the house which we only use for guests.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember a great teacher who really inspired his students.</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		It's up to you to limit and elicit the correct pronouns.</p>
		<p>A semi-controlled practice idea is simple to get the learners to say 
		something true about three other people in the room (including you, if 
		you like) and three things they know about.&nbsp; That can evince 
		statements such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Paul is the guy who always knows the right answer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary is the person who sits near the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the coat Mary wore this morning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the pen Arthur stole</em><br />
		and so on.<br />
		It's a personalised and engaging exercise and, so the theory goes, makes 
		the structures memorable.</p>
		
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				<td class="auto-style11">
				<h3>The students' mementos: another neglected classroom aid</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
				<p>An associated idea is ask the learners to bring in half a 
				dozen favourite photographs or souvenirs and get them to explain 
				what they are of or where they came from. That can evince 
				language such as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a bag I bought in Tunisia<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a photograph I took in Russia<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl in the blue hat is my sister</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				This works particularly well for practising the omission of the 
				pronoun because, by their nature, the items are generally the 
				objects of defining relative clauses.</p>
				<p>The next step is to introduce the range (excluding <em>that</em> 
				for which special rules apply) until the learners can construct 
				acceptable subordinating clauses using <em>which, who(m)</em> 
				and <em>whose</em>.<br />
				Then it's time to focus on when the pronouns can be omitted 
				(restricted to defining clauses where the object is denoted by 
				the pronoun, and excluding <em>whose</em>).</p>
				<p>Finally, the range of reduced clauses can be tackled along 
				with nominalised or fused relative clauses.&nbsp; That can be done 
				alongside consideration of <em>wh- </em>question forms because 
				the structures are more or less parallel:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what to wear</em><br />
				is not far removed grammatically from:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Do you know what to wear?</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Do you know who arrived late?</em><br />
				because both have a nominalised <em>wh</em>-clauses as the 
				object of the verbs.</p>
