		<p>Analyses of causatives in English are often confined to the causative 
		verbs <em>have</em> and <em>get</em> as in, e.g.,</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>I'm having the car serviced</em></li>
			<li><em>I'll get the car serviced</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>There is, in fact quite a lot more to it than that, as we shall see.</p>
		<h2>Cause and effect</h2>
		<p>
		<img alt="canda" height="161" src="../../images2/glassbroken.jpg" width="200" /></p>
		<p>English has a number of ways to express the fact that the subject of 
		a verb causes a change to the object.&nbsp; Here are some examples and they are all ways of 
		saying something caused something to happen in English.</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="3"><em>The key opened the box</em></li>
			<li><em>They have widened the street</em></li>
			<li><em>Her antagonism irritated him</em></li>
			<li><em>The sun warmed the air</em></li>
			<li><em>The police marched the suspect in and stood him against the 
			wall for a photograph</em></li>
			<li><em>She's walking the dog</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Notice that some of the causative verbs in these examples can be used 
		both transitively (taking an object) and intransitively (with no 
		object).&nbsp; We can have <em>The box opened </em>(3)<em>, The air 
		warmed </em>(6)<em>, the suspect marched in and stood against the wall
		</em>(7)<em>, the dog is walking </em>(8)<em>.<br />
		</em>In other cases, we can't do this and have to use an alternative 
		verb to rephrase the idea intransitively: <em>the street got wider</em> 
		(4), <em>he became irritated</em> (5).</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>English and other languages</h2>
		<p>Other languages handle transitivity like this in very different ways.<br />
		In some, verbs may take what is called the ergative case when used 
		intransitively and the noun (and adjective and article, often) will be 
		marked to show it so those languages can produce <em>he irritated </em>(to mean <em>became irritated</em>), <em>the dog walked</em> (to mean
		<em>was walked</em>), <em>the door opened</em> and so on.<br />
		In other languages, such as Malay, a verb can be the same in both transitive and 
		intransitive uses but will take a suffix or other change to show whether 
		it is being used transitively or intransitively.<br />
		English does neither of these things but shows transitivity by word 
		order, structure or rephrasing with a different verb.&nbsp; For example, 		<em>I washed the car </em>vs. <em>the car was washed</em>, <em>someone 
		broke the window</em> vs. <em>the window got broken, his hand rose </em>  
		vs.<em> he raised his hand</em>  etc.&nbsp; Occasionally, English can 
		make a kind of ergative with something like <em>the glass broke, the 
		picture discoloured</em> or <em>the door opened</em>.<br />
		English can, however, like many languages make a transitive verb 
		intransitive by using a reflexive as in, e.g., <em>the problem solved 
		itself, the house shook itself to pieces, the car drives itself </em>
		etc.&nbsp; Lots of languages do that much more extensively than English.</p>
		<h4>So what?</h4>
		<p>This all matters because the idea of transitivity is fundamental to 
		understanding the verb structures of any language.&nbsp; Without knowing 
		about it, it is hardly possible to use verbs accurately at all.&nbsp; 
		Speakers of many languages which can use the same word in both 
		transitive and intransitive ways will, therefore, make errors such as:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="9"><em>*he angered </em>(for <em>became angry</em>)</li>
			<li><em>*he fell the glass </em>(for <em>dropped the glass</em>)</li>
			<li><em>*the bad weather died the flowers</em></li>
			<li><em>*he rose his hand</em></li>
			<li><em>*I reminded </em>(to mean <em>I remembered</em>)</li>
			<li><em>*I interested</em> (to mean <em>I became interested</em>)</li>
			<li><em>*we'll meet us<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Summary: causative verbs vs. causative structures</h3>
		<p>There is, therefore, an important distinction between</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em>the causative </em><strong><em>verbs</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>such as the ones in the examples above, which express the fact 
			that the subject has caused a change in the object and</dd>
			<dt><em>the causative </em><strong><em>structure</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>such as <em>I had the car washed, they made him tell the truth, 
			they had their house broken into</em> and so on, which express the 
			fact that the subject caused another to do something or something 
			was done to the subject which was unwelcome or unfortunate.</dd>
		</dl>
		<hr />
		<h2><a name="1"></a><em>have, make</em> and <em>let</em></h2>
		<p>There are three causative verbs which learners have a certain amount 
		of trouble with.&nbsp; Here are three examples of them:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="16"><em>I had him explain it to me</em></li>
			<li><em>I made him explain it to me</em></li>
			<li><em>I let him explain it to me</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Why should learners have trouble with these?&nbsp; 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'list1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click 
		here when you have an answer</a>.</p>
		<ul class="auto-style7" id="list1" style="visibility:hidden">
			<li>Form is an issue.&nbsp; These three verbs take the bare 
			infinitive only.&nbsp; Compare, e.g., <em>I asked him to come, I 
			forced him to tell me, I arranged for them to come, I intended him 
			to hear, I allowed him to speak</em> etc. which are all causative 
			verbs and, like most of them, require the infinitive with <em>to</em>.</li>
			<li>Meaning is another:<ul class="auto-style6">
				<li><em>have</em> sounds rather formal and implies that the 
				speaker is in a position of authority of some kind.&nbsp; It is 
				common in work and formal study situations.&nbsp; For example,
				<em>I had her resubmit the essay, The boss had them 
				re-write the report</em>.&nbsp; It is rare to use this verb when the 
				first person is the object: <em>?He had me resubmit the essay.<br />
				</em>There is, however, a rather informal use in things such as
				<em>He had me running around after him all day</em>.</li>
				<li><em>make</em> implies the application of psychological, 
				moral or physical force, e.g., <em>We have ways of making you 
				talk</em>.</li>
				<li><em>let</em> implies no compulsion but still carries the 
				sense that the subject is in some sort of position of authority &ndash; 
				it has the sense of <em>allow to</em> and that, too, implies 
				authority.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<hr />
		<h2>The causative structures in English</h2>
		<p>Now that we know about causative verbs, we can look at causative 
		structures.</p>
		<p><a name="2"></a>Here are six examples:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="19"><em>I'm having the house painted</em></li>
			<li><em>I'm getting the car serviced by the people who sold it to 
			me</em></li>
			<li><em>I'm having the people who sold me the car service it</em></li>
			<li><em>I'm getting John to paint the house</em></li>
			<li><em>He got his wallet stolen by someone on the train</em></li>
			<li><em>She got her hand caught in the lift doors</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>What do you notice about meaning?<br />
		What do you notice about form?<br />
		<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'fandm',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have some notes</a>.</p>
		<div id="fandm" style="visibility:hidden">
		<p><span class="style_brown">There are four things to notice about 
		meaning</span></p>
		<ul class="auto-style7">
			<li>The meaning is commonly that of arranging for someone else to do 
			something for you (examples 19, 20, 21 and 22).</li>
			<li>The other common meaning is that of suffering an unpleasant 
			experience (examples 23 and 24).</li>
			<li>A third meaning is that of arranging for an unfortunate incident 
			fraudulently.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between <em>get</em> and <em>have </em>in 
			that <em>get </em>can imply a short action or event, and <em>have
			</em>can imply a state in being (and is not causative).&nbsp; 
			Compare example 24 with <em>She had her hand caught in the lift 
			doors</em> (an unfortunate state).&nbsp; Only <em>get</em> can be 
			used in the sense of a sudden unfortunate incident.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><span class="style_brown">There are also things to notice about form</span></p>
		<ul class="auto-style7">
			<li>The form is complex because the verbs are used transitively 
			(taking an object) and ditransitively (taking two objects).<br />
			In the first case we have Subject + Object + Verb (and that's an 
			unusual word ordering in English which is normally SVO not SOV).<br />
			In the second case we have three possibilities:<ul class="auto-style6">
				<li>we can use the<em> by-</em>structure (examples 20 and 23), 
				revealing the causative to be a form of passive construction.&nbsp; 
				We can use the <em>by-</em>structure with both <em>get</em> and
				<em>have</em>.</li>
				<li>when we use <em>get, we</em> can rearrange the sentence to insert the second 
				object earlier (example 22).&nbsp; When we do this we usually 
				insert the infinitive with <em>to</em> before the second object.&nbsp; 
				Very rarely, we can use the bare infinitive (<em>I'm getting the 
				people who sold me the car service it</em>) but the <em>to-</em>infinitive 
				is always correct.&nbsp; Note that <strong>the </strong><em>
				<strong>to</strong></em>-<strong>infinitive can only be used 
				with </strong><em><strong>get</strong></em>.</li>
				<li>we can use <em>have</em> and insert the second object 
				(example 21).&nbsp; In this case <strong>the <em>
				to-</em>infinitive cannot be used</strong>.&nbsp; 
				E.g., <strong>both</strong> of these are wrong:<br />
				<em>*I'm having John to paint the house<br />
				*I'm getting John paint the house</em></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>When the meaning is of suffering a misfortune, the use of the 
			second object is not allowed <strong>unless<em> </em></strong>some 
			sort of fraudulent act is suspected&nbsp; Compare:<ul class="auto-style9">
				<li>S<em>he got someone to steal her car</em> (for the insurance 
				money).&nbsp; A fraudulent act is the only interpretation.</li>
				<li><em>She had her car stolen</em> (probably just a misfortune 
				but possible in the fraudulent sense, given a context).</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>The causative is not simple.&nbsp; Here's a summary:<br />
		<img alt="causative summary" height="332" src="../../images2/causativesummary.png" width="600" /></h4>
		<hr />
		<h2>Tense forms and modals with causative structures</h2>
		<p>Simple tenses are common with the structures.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="25"><em>I have my car serviced regularly</em></li>
			<li><em>I got the house painted</em></li>
			<li><em>I am getting the work done next week</em></li>
			<li><em>I will have to have it fixed</em></li>
			<li><em>He's going to have it done</em></li>
			<li><em>He will be having the kitchen installed all next week</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Note that because <em>have</em> is not used statively in the 
		causative, that the progressive form is common.</p>
		<p>Causative structures combine very naturally with various aspects and 
		modals to create complex tense forms.&nbsp; For example</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="31"><em>I'm sorry I'm late.&nbsp; I have been having my 
			eyes tested </em>(present perfect progressive causative)</li>
			<li><em>He must have been having his roof repaired </em>(perfect 
			progressive modal form causative)</li>
			<li><em>He had been having his old shoes repaired for years before 
			he bought a new pair </em>(past perfect progressive causative)</li>
			<li><em>He will have been having his house painted again before the 
			year's out, I expect </em>(future perfect progressive causative)</li>
		</ol>
		<hr />
		<h2>Teaching causatives</h2>
		<p>
		<img alt="teach" height="166" src="../../images/classroom.jpg" width="250" /></p>
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>There are five related difficulties for learners in this area:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The forms, especially in terms of words order, are complex and 
			difficult to remember.</li>
			<li>We saw above that other languages handle transitivity and 
			causative verbs very differently from English so there are many 
			possibilities for confusion.&nbsp; This leads to errors such as <em>*I 
			cut my hair at the salon </em>or <em>*I stolen my car</em>.</li>
			<li>There are complex issues with meaning: arrangement, misfortune 
			and fraud.&nbsp; Learners may misinterpret what they hear or produce 
			unintended meanings.</li>
			<li>There are complexities of form with ordering of two objects and 
			the use of the to-infinitive.&nbsp; This leads to errors such <em>*I am 
			getting him painted my house, *She is having him to do it</em> etc.</li>
			<li>Because of 1, 2, 3 and 4, learners often avoid the structures 
			and rely on unnatural circumlocutions such as <em>My car was repaired
			</em>(when <em>I had the car repaired</em> is intended) or <em>The hairdresser cut my 
			hair</em>.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Suggestions</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Complexity</strong></dt>
			<dd>Drill and drill again until the forms are produced adequately.</dd>
			<dd>Beware the complex tense forms until the simple forms and the 
			word ordering have been mastered.&nbsp; Forms such as<br />
			<em>He had been having his old shoes repaired for years before he 
			bought a new pair<br />
			</em>are not at all easy to unpack.<br />
			Use sentence re-ordering exercises.<br />
			Try Dictogloss techniques to get the learners to reconstruct the 
			forms.<br />
			(There are some other ideas for drilling and dictation in 
			<a href="../../../development/strand5techniques/strand5techniques.html">the 
			teacher development guide to techniques</a>.)</dd>
			<dt><strong>Transitivity issues</strong></dt>
			<dd>Make sure you have some idea of how your students' languages 
			handle the concept.&nbsp; Ask them if you aren't sure because a 
			little comparative language work often pays dividends.<br />
			Concept checking has to be done continually when teaching the area.&nbsp; Students' understanding of who is doing what to whom with what has 
			to be made <strong>overt</strong>.&nbsp; In a sentence such as <em>
			Mary is having the garage fix her moped</em>, questions such as 
			"What is being fixed?", "Who owns the moped?", "Is Mary fixing it?", 
			"Who is fixing the moped?", "What has Mary arranged?" etc. are 
			vital.<br />
			And you need to check with individuals rather than be satisfied with 
			the strongest calling out.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Meaning</strong></dt>
			<dd>Keep to one verb at a time initially because the shades of 
			meaning between <em>have</em> and <em>get</em> are very difficult to 
			grasp.<br />
			Start with <em>have</em> for arrangements only.&nbsp; Insert <em>get</em> 
			later with the same meaning (and make it clear that it is 
			stylistically slightly less formal, usually) and only later 
			introduce the idea of misfortune.<br />
			Much later, if at all, introduce the idea of fraud.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Two objects and the use of the to-infinitive</strong></dt>
			<dd>Don't introduce a second object until the form and meaning of 
			causative structures with a single object has been mastered.<br />
			Focus on one verb at a time (usually <em>have</em>) because the use 
			of the bare infinitive works fine with <em>make</em> and <em>let</em>, 
			too, the verbs are probably familiar and the concepts are allied.<br />
			Introduce the <em>get </em>+<em> to-</em>infinitive in combination 
			with <em>ask to, arrange to, want to</em> etc. because the forms are 
			familiar and parallel.&nbsp; It's a short structural and conceptual 
			jump from <em>I want him to go</em> and <em>I got him to go</em>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Avoidance</strong></dt>
			<dd>Set up a clear context in which the forms are required, not 
			optional.<br />
			Example 1<br />
			Having a street plan and the names of shops and services on it can 
			be used to exemplify and practice.&nbsp; Get the learners to follow 
			you around town on the map while you relate the events.&nbsp; E.g., <em>
			First I'm having my hair done</em> (students number the 
			hairdresser's as '1'), <em>then I'm getting my clothes cleaned</em>,
			<em>then I'm having my shoes repaired, then I'll try to get my 
			laptop sorted out</em> etc.&nbsp; When they have followed you around by 
			the prompts, they can follow each other using similar prompts.<br />
			<span class="auto-style10">(This idea is from Obee, B (1999) <em>The 
			Grammar Activity Book</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 
			p101.)</span><br />
			Example 2<br />
			Choose a topic of someone temporarily disabled and focus on what 
			that person currently must have done that they would normally do 
			themselves: <em>wash the car, do the shopping, change a lightbulb</em> 
			etc.</dd>
