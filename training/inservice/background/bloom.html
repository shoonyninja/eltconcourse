			<h1>Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="bloom" height="207" src="../../images/chess_pieces310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>If you have trained in the general education of children and 
			young adults, you will probably have encountered Bloom's taxonomy of 
			educational objectives.&nbsp; The taxonomy occurs on almost all 
			teacher-training courses.&nbsp; However, if your training and 
			current concern is solely to do with the teaching of languages to 
			adults, then the concepts may be new to you.<br />
			Briefly:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The Taxonomy of Educational Objectives is a 
			framework for classifying statements of what we expect or intend 
			students to learn as a result of instruction.<br />
			<span class="auto-style7">Krathwohl, 2002:212</span></p>
			<p>The original taxonomy was worked out over a number of years, 
			starting in 1949 and involved input from many hundreds of 
			researchers, teachers and other specialists.&nbsp; In 1956, the 
			first publication emerged with a 6-level hierarchy of educational 
			objectives classified by the level of cognitive demands placed on 
			the learners.</p>
			<p>In the words of the original authors, the motivation behind the 
			taxonomy lay in the fact that:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">We are of the opinion that although the 
			objectives and materials and techniques maybe specified in an almost 
			unlimited number of ways, the student behaviors in involved these 
			objectives can be represented by a relatively small number of 
			classes.<br />
			<span class="auto-style7">Bloom <em>et al</em>, 1956:12</span></p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="think" height="166" src="../../images/man_thinking_silhouette250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" >
					<h2>Thinking</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Bloom's taxonomy, and many other classifications of learning, is 
			grounded on a simple idea:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">... learning occurs when the mind makes 
			connections between what it already knows and new, hitherto unknown 
			items of information<br />
			<span class="auto-style7">Waters, 2006:319</span></p>
			<p>It is, therefore, a cognitive theory of how learning happens and 
			cognition of various sorts is what the taxonomy is about: thinking, 
			in other words.<br />
			There are, of course, many different sorts of thinking and there's 
			an obvious difference between trying to remember what one had for 
			breakfast and writing a PhD thesis.<br />
			Here's a little test to see if you can pair examples of types of 
			thinking together to distinguish one sort from another.&nbsp; There 
			are twelve descriptions of thinking to match into 6 pairs.&nbsp; 
			Think for a moment and then click on the table for an answer and an 
			explanation.</p>

			<div id="bloomlist1" style="visibility: hidden"><p>
			Here are some comments:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the first row, we have the lowest level of cognitive 
				challenge: remembering a birthday or knowing the chemical 
				formula for an element says nothing about what you can do with 
				the data, just that you can recall the data.</li>
				<li>In the second row we encounter the next step up at which we 
				show the ability to understand the data we have so we can use it 
				either to make assumptions about what will happen to iron if it 
				is not treated (because we remember how iron behaves) or to see 
				similarities between birds and dinosaurs (because we remember 
				what they look like, how they are constructed and how they 
				behave).<br />
				Here we are understanding the data we have remembered.</li>
				<li>In the third row, we are doing something slightly more 
				sophisticated: we are applying the data to our behaviour and 
				remembering to buy a birthday card (by recognising and 
				understanding social norms and conventions) or solving an equation by 
				applying some simple addition and division rules (by recognising 
				symbols and matching them to operations we understand).<br />
				Here, we have to remember the data and understand what it means 
				before we can use it.</li>
				<li>In the fourth row, we have a level at which we can analyse 
				the data we have, not just apply it.&nbsp; So we can break down 
				a word into its constituent morphemes or match personalities to 
				a seating plan by analysing how people react and respond from 
				the data we already know.<br />
				By this stage, we are remembering, understanding and applying 
				data as well.</li>
				<li>At level five, we are being challenged not only to remember, 
				understand, apply and analyse the data but also to evaluate it.&nbsp; 
				In the first case, we have to decide whether past form is a 
				guide to future performance, bearing in mind what may be changed 
				in terms of the track, the weather, the opposition, the jockey 
				and so on.&nbsp; In the second case, we have to hold the 
				criteria in our mind and measure the performance of the student 
				against the standards we or our team have set.</li>
				<li>Finally, we have to apply all the previous types of 
				cognition to create something original.<br />
				At this level, we have to remember the data, understand it, be 
				able to apply and analyse it as well as evaluate what is 
				relevant, what crucial and what peripheral.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>What we have just done is look at examples of types of 
			cognitive processes and categorised them in terms of a hierarchy.&nbsp; 
			That is what Bloom and his co-workers did in the early 1950s.</p></div>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The original taxonomy had six stages of cognitive challenge: 
			knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and 
			evaluation in that order.<br />
			More recently, the taxonomy has been revisited and updated, 
			making some small and other more fundamental changes to the scheme.&nbsp; 
			Here's an overview:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="bloom revision" height="412" src="../../imagesgraphics/bloom_revision.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>As you can see, a number of changes were incorporated into the 
			revised taxonomy:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the original taxonomy was expressed in terms of nouns (<em>knowledge, 
				comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation</em>) 
				but in the revised form the categories are expressed as verbs (<em>remember, 
				understand, apply, analyse, evaluate, create</em>).</li>
				<li>the two highest-level categories have had their order 
				reversed so that <em>create</em> is now at the top, above <em>
				evaluate</em>, where the original categorisation placed <em>
				evaluation</em> above <em>synthesis</em>.</li>
				<li>the revised taxonomy allows greater overlap between 
				categories (some say at the expense of precision) so the 
				hierarchy is more relaxed.</li>
			</ol>

					<img alt="knowledge" height="166" src="../../images/knowledge250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" >
					<h2>The knowledge dimension</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In the original version the Knowledge Dimension, in other words, 
			the information on which the cognitive processes work was divided 
			into three categories.&nbsp; The examples given here are for the 
			field of English Language Teaching but the principles can be 
			applied, it is claimed, to all topics of study.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>knowledge of specifics (terminology and facts)<br />
				For example: the past tense of the verb <em>go</em> is <em>went</em>, the plural 
				of <em>child</em> is <em>children</em> and so on.</li>
				<li>knowledge of ways to deal with specifics (conventions, 
				classifications, methodologies and so on)<br />
				For example, <em>out</em> is a preposition, <em>decide</em> is a regular verb, the 
				language is written from left to right and so on.</li>
				<li>knowledge of universals and abstractions (principles and 
				theories)<br />
				For example, in English the adjective usually comes before the 
				verb, adverbs modify verb phrases, we can express the notion of 
				length in a number of different ways and so on.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the revised taxonomy, there are four categories with the 
			fourth being a new one.&nbsp; Again, the examples are for ELT.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>factual knowledge (things you just have to know)<br />
				For example, <em>-er</em> at the end of a word is usually 
				pronounced /ə/, nouns ending in -<em>s </em>take their plurals 
				in -<em>es</em> and so on.</li>
				<li>conceptual knowledge (categorisations, principles, theories 
				and models)<br />
				For example, a narrative will normally be divided into 
				Orientation, Complication, Resolution and Coda, prepositional 
				phrases are constructed from a preposition and a noun-phrase 
				complement and so on.</li>
				<li>procedural knowledge (techniques and methods and when to use 
				them)<br />
				For example, the ability to infer meaning from co-text, the 
				ability to take notes when listening and so on.</li>
				<li>metacognitive knowledge (knowledge of cognition and 
				awareness of one’s own cognition)<br />
				For example, the ability to know what one is doing when 
				monitoring a heard text for specific data, the deliberate 
				application of strategies to signal the end of a turn in conversation and so on.</li>
			</ol>

			</table>
			<p>In both the original and revised versions of the scheme, the 
			categories are hierarchical so the level of cognitive challenge 
			involved in their use rises from the bottom up.&nbsp; There are, in 
			the revised version we shall be considering from here on, and in the 
			original version, 6 levels 
			(some of which overlap in the revision in particular).</p>
			<p>This is a strict hierarchical system in the views of some 
			proponents.&nbsp; In other words, each level feeds into the next so 
			learners need to remember something before they can understand it, 
			understand it before they can apply it, apply it before they can 
			analyse it and analyse it before they can evaluate it.<br />
			At the highest level of create, learners must have remembered, 
			understood, applied, analysed, and evaluated something before they 
			can create anything new.<br />
			Others are more flexible in their approach and suggest that one can, 
			for example, analyse what has been read or heard without necessarily 
			having already applied it.&nbsp; It is also possible, of course, to 
			evaluate something one has not yet applied but impossible to do so 
			with something one has not remembered or understood and very 
			difficult to do so with something one has not analysed.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Remember</strong><br />
				<img alt="postit" height="133" src="../../images/note_postit200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This concerns the ability to retrieve relevant knowledge in 
				order to be able to apply other cognitive processes.<br />
				You cannot, for example, classify nouns into sets or fields 
				unless you can recall the nouns in question.<br />
				Equally, you cannot speculate about the motives of a character 
				in a story unless you can recall what the character did.<br />
				Remembering facts and data in a foreign language is by no means 
				a simple exercise.&nbsp; Input has, at some time to become 
				intake for that to happen.&nbsp; For a guide to how that might 
				occur, see the guide to input, linked in the list of related 
				guides at the end.</li>
				<li><strong>Understand</strong><br />
				<img alt="understand" height="133" src="../../images/languages_dog200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is, of course, more demanding than remembering.<br />
				The category grew originally from the distinction teachers often 
				made between <em>knowing</em> and <em>
				<span class="style_underline">really</span> knowing</em>.&nbsp; 
				For example, when reading a narrative, knowing consists of being 
				able to recall information concerning <em>who, when, what</em> 
				etc. but understanding involves being able to answer <em>how</em> 
				and <em>why</em> questions.<br />
				A learner of English may, for example, know and be able to 
				recall that a passive-voice clause in English is formed with the 
				verb <em>be</em> in an appropriate tense but understanding 
				involves knowing how it is used and why a passive structure is 
				chosen.</li>
				<li><strong>Apply</strong><br />
				<img alt="apply" height="133" src="../../images/apply_makup200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Remembering and understanding are not enough.&nbsp; The next 
				step is to apply knowledge to the world around you.<br />
				For example:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>recognising affixes which form nouns (<em>-ness, -tion</em> 
					etc.) is part of factual 
					knowledge, understanding how nouns work to make meaning in 
					combination with verbs and other word classes involves some 
					understanding of the phenomenon but inferring meaning from a 
					text by the recognition of how noun phrases are modified and 
					act as the subjects and objects of verbs requires the 
					application of knowledge and understanding for a 
					communicative end.</li>
					<li>Recalling the modal auxiliary verb <em>could</em> to 
					mean reference to past ability is factual knowledge, 
					comprehending that it refers to ability or possibility 
					depending on context and co-text is part of understanding 
					the verb but being able to communicate the meaning of past 
					unfulfilled ability in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could have left early but I stayed 
					to see the end</em><br />
					is first remembering and understanding the verb before applying 
					it for a 
					communicative purpose.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Analyse</strong><br />
				<img alt="analyse" height="133" src="../../images/analyse_microscope200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				One may be able to remember and understand a sentence such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The man told John that the house was for sale</em><br />
				and apply it for a communicative purpose to explain 
				John's behaviour and that is a valuable ability.&nbsp; However, to extend that 
				knowledge to making a sentence such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old woman in the corner of the bar 
				deliberately told Mary and her friends that the concert had been 
				cancelled</em><br />
				requires an ability to analyse sentences in English into items 
				such as Subject noun phrase, Verb phrase, Indirect object noun 
				phrase and Direct object nominalised clause.&nbsp; Without the 
				ability to analyse the constituents of language one remains at 
				the level of remembering, understanding and being able to apply 
				disconnected utterances without the option of producing parallel 
				accurate language for other communicative purposes.</li>
				<li><strong>Evaluate</strong><br />
				<img alt="evaluate" height="133" src="../../images/evaluate200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				One may be able to remember, understand, apply and analyse a 
				sentence such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you hadn't left so early, you wouldn't 
				have missed the important part of the meeting</em><br />
				but, unless you can evaluate how such an utterance is intended 
				and what implications for future behaviours the speaker has in 
				mind, it is difficult to communicate effectively or enter a 
				discussion about causes and effects.<br />
				It may, for example, be evaluated as simply a statement of fact 
				with no overtones.&nbsp; On the other hand, it may be evaluated 
				as a criticism of a failure to stay and a warning not to be so 
				lax in future.&nbsp; Evaluation involves, therefore, an 
				understanding of roles, intentions and power relationships and how they 
				affect the application of language to a situation.</li>
				<li><strong>Create</strong><br />
				<img alt="paint" height="133" src="../../images/painter_portrait200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is the most demanding cognitive task because it requires 
				people to deploy all the lower-level skills to make something 
				new.&nbsp; In language teaching, this may involve the 
				combination of language recall, understanding of words and 
				structures, application of language patterns and communicative 
				strategies, analysis of data and the evaluation of the quality 
				and usefulness of the utterances of others.&nbsp; It often 
				requires a synthesis of all those skills.<br />
				It is not something to be taken lightly or asked of people 
				without providing a great deal of preparation.&nbsp; For example, in 
				task-based learning programmes, learners may be asked to work in 
				a group to present a complex proposal for the improvement of, 
				say, their home town or place of study and, to do that, they 
				will need to apply all five of the lower-level cognitive 
				abilities <strong>simultaneously</strong>.</li>

			<p>Adding to the list is reasonably straightforward providing you 
			keep an eye on the headings so that the verbs fall into the correct 
			categories.</p>
			<h3>Using the lists:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Planning</strong><br />
				<img alt="plan" height="133" src="../../images/write_plan200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				It is helpful when planning a lesson, a series of lessons, a 
				syllabus or even a whole curriculum to make sure that you know 
				what you are asking of the learners and act accordingly.&nbsp; 
				It is over-challenging, for example, to ask people to analyse 
				something before they have recalled its makeup and understood 
				its content.&nbsp; It is probably impossible to evaluate 
				something one does not understand or can't analyse.&nbsp; 
				Arguably, creating something new is not possible unless the five 
				lower-level skills have already been deployed.</li>
				<li><strong>Testing</strong><br />
				<img alt="test" height="133" src="../../images/test_dropper200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				When we design tests, it is helpful to keep in mind what 
				cognitive demands test items are placing on test takers.<br />
				A 
				test element which simply asks learners to match items (e.g., 
				word to definition) is likely to place fewer demands than an 
				element which asks learners to classify items into three or more 
				categories.&nbsp; The former tests remembering, the latter tests 
				understanding.<br />
				Test items which require learners to expand skeleton sentences 
				or fill gaps in texts place heavy demands on application and 
				analysis and items which ask learners to interpret motives, 
				judge success or 
				create new texts from scratch place the heaviest demands of all: 
				evaluate and create.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here's a summary of some that with a few verbs in each category 
			as an <em>aide memoire</em>.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Objectives do not all have to be addressed at once.&nbsp; That 
			may seem an obvious thing to say but it is something that is often 
			overlooked.</p>
			<p>The practical application of a taxonomy of objectives such as 
			this will, as we saw, aid planning and testing in particular but it 
			also impinges on the kinds of activities one uses in the classroom 
			and on the much bigger picture of setting objectives for whole 
			courses or, in the case of compulsory educational settings, whole 
			years of study.</p>
			<p>How the taxonomy may be used is situation specific.</p>
			<ol class="auto-style81">
				<li>If one is working in the field of compulsory education, 
				teaching children and young adults, the taxonomy may be used 
				across all disciplines to ensure that the syllabus and its 
				assessment (<em>via</em>, e.g., tests) consistently target all the 
				levels of cognition which are the objectives of an educational 
				programme.</li>
				<li>If one is working with mature people learning a language for 
				their own purposes, it may be safe to assume that they are 
				capable of applying all six levels of cognition to tasks and 
				activities.&nbsp; That is not necessarily the case for all 
				adults.&nbsp; In this case, the focus is less on training 
				cognitive abilities and more on teaching and learning the 
				language which accompanies each level on the scale.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A simple way of implementing the taxonomy suggested by Krathwohl (<em>op cit</em>.:217) is making a grid something like 
			this:</p>

			<p>A common application of the taxonomy is to devise and refine

			<p>Using the taxonomy to plan classroom procedures and activities 
			allows us to raise the level of challenge smoothly so that learners 
			are not being asked to do something for which they are unprepared.&nbsp; 
			In theory, doing this will result in more successful and confident 
			production and better achievement of the learning outcomes.<br />
			Much of this depends on recognising the Zone of Proximal 
			Development, i.e., the place in which learners are being adequately 
			challenged and can proceed with some help but avoiding the areas 
			where they are under-challenged (so get bored and learn little or 
			nothing) or over-challenged (where they become disengaged and learn 
			nothing useful).&nbsp; For more on the ZPD, see the guide to 
			scaffolding and the ZPD linked below.</p>
			<p>Here are some examples, based on and adapted from Waters, 2006, 
			which uses seven slightly differently described and ordered 
			categories (as developed by Sanders, 1966).</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="1" height="68" src="../../../gfx/1blue.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" >
					<h3>remember</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>After reading a text describing someone's day out in Berlin, the 
			learners are, for example, asked or instructed to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Put the things that Peter did in the order he did them from 
				this list.</li>
				<li>Say what Peter did at lunchtime.</li>
				<li>What did he eat?</li>
				<li>Where did he go after the zoo?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and so on.<br />
			All that is being required here is that the learners can recall the 
			events (with or without a little help).&nbsp; They do not, at this 
			stage need to understand very much except some basic verbs and 
			nouns.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="2" height="69" src="../../../gfx/2blue.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" >
					<h3>understand</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Working with the same text, the learners are, for example, asked 
			or instructed to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Why did Peter take a bus?</li>
				<li>How did he get lost on the metro system?</li>
				<li>Match his expressions in the pictures with how he felt about 
				what he saw.</li>
				<li>On the map, draw the route that Peter took when he was 
				walking in the park.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and so on.<br />
			Here the learners must not only remember the facts, they must 
			understand the language and some implications before they can answer 
			the questions or do the tasks.&nbsp; The questions here ask for an 
			understanding of cause or manner rather than what, where and when.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="3" height="65" src="../../../gfx/3blue.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" >
					<h3>apply</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Working with the same text, or without it, the learners are, for 
			example, instructed to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Student A: You are Peter and you have met Mary or John for a 
				drink the week after your day out.<br />
				Student(s) B (and C): You are hoping to have a day out in Berlin 
				soon.&nbsp; Ask Peter what he did and find out how much he 
				enjoyed things.&nbsp; Ask him for some advice about travelling 
				around and what to see and do.&nbsp; Don't forget to find out 
				about getting something to eat and having a coffee break.</li>
				<li>Write an email from Peter to his friend Mary telling her 
				about the day out and what he enjoyed most.</li>
				<li>With your partner, plan a day out in a city you know and 
				include at least 4 things that Peter did in Berlin.</li>
				<li>Look at the pictures and say:<ol class="auto-style81">
					<li>what Peter did</li>
					<li>when he did it</li>
					<li>whether he liked it</li>
					<li>what he did next.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and so on.<br />
			Now the learners have to apply the language and their understanding 
			of Peter's feelings and motivations to complete the tasks.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="4" height="67" src="../../../gfx/4blue.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" >
					<h3>analyse</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Working with the same text, but this time in spoken form rather 
			than written, the learners are, for example, instructed to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Listen and write down the phrases which Peter uses to say:<ol class="auto-style81">
					<li>where he went</li>
					<li>when he went</li>
					<li>why he went</li>
					<li>how he felt</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Listen and write down the adjectives Peter uses to describe:<ol class="auto-style81">
					<li>buildings</li>
					<li>open spaces</li>
					<li>food</li>
					<li>the weather</li>
					<li>the transport</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here, the learners are required to apply all the lower-level 
			skills and are also being asked to analyse the language that was 
			used to express the facts and the feelings.&nbsp; In 1. the focus is 
			probably on prepositional phrases and other adverbials and in 2. the 
			focus is probably on word class and collocation.<br />
			The next stage here would usefully include applying the phrases and 
			other items to, say, lists or pictures of events, places, and 
			activities in a semi-controlled manner.&nbsp; This stage also draws 
			on remembering, understanding and applying as well as analysing.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="5" height="68" src="../../../gfx/5blue.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" >
					<h3>evaluate</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Now the text can be put on one side (anything more based directly 
			on it would start to get a little dull, probably) and the learners 
			have to, for example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Think of the last time you had a day out in a city or in the 
				country and list the things you did in order of how much you 
				enjoyed them.&nbsp; Then write an email to a friend who is 
				visiting the same area with you and suggest what to do and why.</li>
				<li>In your group write a travel brochure for Berlin based on 
				the things there are to see and do and suggest an itinerary for:<ol class="auto-style81">
					<li>a group of teenagers</li>
					<li>retired couples</li>
					<li>a stag or hen party</li>
					<li>a single traveller interested in culture and the arts.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Write a description of Peter's character and interests based 
				on what he did and how he felt about things.&nbsp; Does he sound 
				like someone you could like or not.&nbsp; Why?<br />
				When you have done this, go around all your classmates and see 
				if you can find someone who feels the same as you.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All these example tasks focus on getting the learners to evaluate 
			what they can now recall, understand, apply and analyse.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="6" height="67" src="../../../gfx/6blue.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" >
					<h3>create</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>At this stage, freer practice can be introduced because the 
			learners are thoroughly prepared by what has gone before.&nbsp; They 
			might be asked to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Choose a place that you know well and research the web for 
				pictures and ideas of places to go.&nbsp; Now try to persuade 
				the other members in your group to visit this place with you.&nbsp; 
				You will need to appeal to all the people in your group, not 
				just yourself.</li>
				<li>Here is your task:<ol class="auto-style82">
					<li>Write down a description of three things that you like 
					to do when you have a day out and three things you do not 
					like.</li>
					<li>Exchange your list with a partner.</li>
					<li>Go away from your partner and prepare a short 
					presentation for him or her about a day out they could take 
					somewhere you know quite well or somewhere you can imagine.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The simulation:<ol class="auto-style83">
					<li>All Student As:<br />
					You are a representatives of a city's tourism department at 
					a trade fair.&nbsp; It is your job to persuade people to 
					include your city on their website and encourage people to 
					take short breaks there.<br />
					The city can be somewhere you know, somewhere you live or 
					completely fictional.<br />
					Prepare a 5-minute illustrated presentation of the city.</li>
					<li>All student Bs:<br />
					You are the owner of a travel website aimed at people who 
					want a short city break.<br />
					Go around the trade fair and talk to each representative, 
					making a list of what they offer and whether you think the 
					city they represent is one you want to put on your website.<br />
					Select one and make notes about how the website page should 
					look (including images) and what it should say.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>At this stage, the learners are being asked (challenged, indeed) 
			to apply all the cognitive processes they have applied before and 
			also to step outside themselves and create something new by 
			synthesizing what they have remembered, understood, applied, 
			analysed and evaluated.&nbsp; That is not an easy task but it is 
			made much simpler if attention is paid to the previous five stages 
			before learners are asked to do it.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="level" height="133" src="../../images/level_staircase200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" >
					<h3>Level</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It is a false assumption that lower-level learners are incapable 
			of operating at higher levels of cognitive challenge.&nbsp; If we 
			make that assumption, we will be denying them the opportunity to use 
			language evaluatively or creatively and that is both boring and 
			discriminatory.<br />
			Waters puts it this way:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">it is possible to combine activities which 
			involve relatively simple language with complex thinking (and that 
			activities involving complex thinking do not necessarily require 
			complex language).<br />
			<span class="auto-style7">Op cit.:326</span></p>
			<p>In the examples above, the level of language remains unchanged, 
			focusing as it does on a lexical set concerning leisure activities 
			and cities.&nbsp; The text, of course, would be radically different, 
			as would the lexis it contained, at level A2 from level C1 but that 
			is not the point.&nbsp; It would be possible to apply all six levels 
			of cognition with any language and communicative skill that is the 
			target of the lesson or series of lessons.<br />
			That requires serious attention to text design or selection but that 
			is all.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, it is not necessary at all levels to dwell on each 
			stage of cognitive challenge.&nbsp; One might assume, for example, 
			that the lexis is already known to the learners so remembering is 
			not at issue.&nbsp; Equally, the language analysis stage may be 
			judged to be redundant if the structural and collocational 
			characteristics of the language have already been mastered.</p>
