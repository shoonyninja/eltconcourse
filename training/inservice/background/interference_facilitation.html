			<h1>Language transfer: interference and facilitation</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="interference" height="207" src="../../images/ripples310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>You may recall from any physics you have studied that ripples in 
			a liquid sometime coincide to increase the height of a ripple and 
			sometimes do the opposite, flattening the wave altogether in some 
			cases.&nbsp; The first is called constructive interference and the 
			second destructive interference.&nbsp; The key is whether the phases 
			of the waves are synchronised or not.<br />
			Language interference works in analogous ways although destructive 
			interference is simply called <strong>interference</strong> and constructive 
			interference is referred to as <strong>facilitation</strong>.<br />
			When the learner's first language is in synch with the target 
			language, learning can be speeded up considerably because no new 
			concepts or systems need to be acquired.&nbsp; All that is needed is 
			to learn the ways the target language expresses a concept which is 
			already familiar.&nbsp; This facilitates the learning process 
			considerably.<br />
			However, when the learner's first language is out of synch, 
			encompassing very different concepts and ways of referring to 
			reality, then the learner is faced with a triple problem:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style4">
				<li>understanding the conceptual categories</li>
				<li>learning how these categories differ from the familiar 
				first-language categories</li>
				<li>learning how to encode these unfamiliar categories in the 
				target language</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and that means that the learning process becomes slower, harder 
			and less reliable.</p>
			<p>In this guide, we will make frequent reference to learners' first 
			languages but it should be remembered that facilitation and 
			interference also occur between the target language and any other 
			language(s) the learner may have acquired either as a joint first 
			language or as a second language.&nbsp; In many parts of the world, 
			bilingualism is the norm not the exception and a learner who has 
			more than one language to compare to the target language is in a 
			better position to identify similarities but is simultaneously 
			perhaps more susceptible to interference.&nbsp; The latter is 
			certainly the case where both or all of the learners' current 
			languages are out of synch with the target language.<br />
			We will also be considering specific examples concerning learning 
			English as the target language although in principle, of course, all 
			the considerations will apply to the learning of any language.&nbsp; 
			Only the details will differ.</p>
			<p>The following does not trespass (too much) on the philosophical 
			considerations concerning how and to what extent people's first 
			language(s) may determine how and in what way they think about the 
			world.&nbsp; Such considerations are dealt with elsewhere in
			<a href="../../common/language_thought.html" target="_blank">the guide to Language, Thought and Culture</a> (new tab) which is 
			also linked in the list at the end.<br />
			All we will say about this here is that if people's first languages 
			determine <strong>to any degree </strong>how they conceptualise the 
			world, their own thoughts and feeling and the relationships they 
			perceive between phenomena then first-language interference and 
			facilitation will play a significant role in second-language 
			learning.<br />
			It may be argued that the very existence of first-language 
			interference and facilitation is evidence that thought processes 
			are, to some extent, determined by language, not the other way 
			around.<br />
			In his preface to Linguistics Across Cultures (1957), Lado sets his 
			stall out like this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The plan of the book rests on the assumption 
			that we can predict and describe the patterns that will cause 
			difficulty in learning, and those that will not cause difficulty, by 
			comparing systematically the language and culture to be learned with 
			the native language and culture of the student.<br />
			<span class="auto-style7">(Lado, 1957: preface)</span></p>
			<p>Since then the assumed connection that Lado refers to has been 
			questioned repeatedly, not least by Pinker (2007) and others.&nbsp; 
			However, language teachers have often noted that some concepts and 
			language items are demonstrably more difficult for some learners to 
			acquire and have drawn the conclusion that first-language 
			interference plays a significant role in explaining the 
			difficulties.</p>
			<p>Less anecdotally, Ellis presents the following data concerning 
			the evidence for interference assumed in a variety of studies:</p>

			<p>The figures relate to grammatical error rather than lexical, 
			phonological or other forms of error and it seems safe to assume 
			that similar findings would be obtainable elsewhere.&nbsp; 
			Pronunciation errors, in particular, can be traced almost wholly to 
			first-language interference (although some sounds are intrinsically 
			difficult even for native speakers).</p>
			<p>There is, however, a problem with studies like the ones cited 
			above: which errors can we safely ascribe to language transfer and 
			which errors are made simply because the target structure or lexical 
			item is intrinsically difficult?&nbsp; Put another way, which errors 
			are <strong>inter</strong>lingual and which are <strong>intra</strong>lingual?</p>
			<p>There is no simple answer.&nbsp; For example, the article system in 
			English is quite complex and demands a consideration of specificity 
			along with countability to be used successfully.&nbsp; If learners 
			make errors in this area, it is unsurprising because the system is 
			complex.&nbsp; Learners whose languages have articles but deploy 
			them differently may be led into error by transfer from their first 
			language but those learners whose first languages have no articles 
			(such as Polish and Russian) make errors because the whole concept 
			is foreign to them.&nbsp; It has been argued that in the latter 
			case, the problems arise for intralingual reasons: the system is complex.&nbsp; 
			In 
			the former the reason is interlingual interference because the 
			systems are differently complex.<br />
			It may, of course, be true that both interlingual and intralingual 
			factors conspire to making a language system or item harder to learn 
			for some people.<br />
			Swan puts it this way:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">there is a mistaken view that errors have to 
			be analysed in either/or terms: they must 
			<span class="style_underline"> <em>either</em></span> be 
			attributable to the mother tongue, <span class="style_underline"> <em>or</em></span> to features of the 
			second language. ... Intrinsic difficulty and crosslinguistic 
			influence are not alternative sources of error.<br />

			1997:161, emphasis in the original)</span></p>

			<p>The more different a learner's first language is from the target 
			language, the fewer will be the opportunities for inter-language 
			language&nbsp;facilitation but the greater will be the need, usually, for 
			new concept-building activities because the languages will have very 
			different ways of representing events, states and objects combined with 
			different ways of 
			classifying them and signalling the relationships between them.<br />
			Language distance can be visualised like this for some Indo-European 
			languages:</p>

			<span class="auto-style103">From Crystal (drawing on James), 1987:371</span><br />
			As Crystal points out, however, although language distance clearly 
			can play a role in how much interference and facilitation is likely 
			to occur, it is very difficult, given the number of variables, only 
			five of which are represented here, to quantify the effects.<br />
			Differences, for example, in the collocational characteristics of 
			words or the relationships between tense forms and the times to 
			which they refer are notoriously difficult to estimate reliably.<br />
			This little illustration concerns only a small range of Indo-European 
			languages and the differences between, e.g., Mandarin and Italian 
			or Vietnamese and Farsi would probably be off the scale.<br />
			However, for languages in the same family ideas like this can be 
			revealing, showing for example, that German speakers may have less 
			difficulty than Russian speakers in acquiring the lexis they need 
			but they will still have more difficulty than Italian or French 
			speakers.&nbsp; Both pronunciation and spelling will cause French 
			speakers more difficulty than most and so on.</p>
			<p>This guide is divided in the following into two parts: influences on the 
			acquisition of second-language lexis and influences on the 
			acquisition of second-language grammar and structure.&nbsp; However, 
			we will often find that the two systems overlap and we will note 
			that where it is appropriate.</p>

			<h3>Meaning and semantic space</h3>

			</table>
			<p>Semantic space refers to the word's core or essential (in 
			Aristotle's term) meaning.&nbsp; There are too many objects in the 
			world for us to reserve a particular noun for each and too many 
			possible actions for us to do the same with verbs.&nbsp; What we do, 
			therefore, is settle on what we consider the prototypical features 
			of an entity and assign to that the name we wish to use which will 
			be understood by everyone in our speech community.<br />
			It follows that if we see, for example:<br />
			<img alt="4" height="133" src="../../images/four_bottles200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			we will instinctively ascribe all four objects to the same semantic 
			space.&nbsp; They are <em>bottles</em>, and they share certain 
			prototypical features that we associate with the term: material 
			(glass), shape (tall with a neck), purpose (liquid container) and so 
			on.&nbsp; With entities such as 
			this which relate to easily defined physical objects, there is often 
			a clear one-to-one relationship between a word in one language and a 
			word in another.&nbsp; So, for example, we can have:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder" style="width: 400px">

			<p>The words may look and sound very different and be represented by 
			completely different orthographies but the semantic space they 
			inhabit is, to all intents and purposes, identical.<br />
			What we have is an instant recognition of the function of the object 
			and its outward appearance.&nbsp; At the edges, there may be some 
			fuzziness because it is not always perfectly clear where, for 
			example, <em>bottle</em> grades into <em>jar</em> and the cut-off 
			point may be slightly different in different languages and between 
			different users of the same language.<br />
			Nevertheless, most learners will have a language close enough to any 
			other for the same semantic space to be occupied by the same term.<br />
			Words for items like these, and there are many thousands of them, require only 
			to be learned along with their pronunciation and written form 
			for them to be used with confidence and accuracy.</p>
			<p>In the same way, certain actions can be referred to slightly less easily 
			although the semantic space they occupy is familiar, simple and 
			common.&nbsp; So, when we see something like:<br />
			<img alt="speak" src="../../images/talk_silhouette200.jpg" /><br />
			and are asked what the woman is doing, we will probably suggest <em>
			speaking</em>.&nbsp; We might, however, suggest <em>pointing, 
			talking, arguing, accusing, complaining</em> and a few more verbs so 
			the situation is not quite so clear.<br />
			Nevertheless, if we keep things simple we can suggest:</p>

			<p>However, verbs are already trickier than nouns in this respect 
			because they are subject to interpretation in a way that physical 
			objects are not and grammatically variable.<br />
			We interpret actions and states in different ways depending on the 
			context in which they occur as we see above when trying to assign a 
			verb to the little graphic.<br />
			Between languages, there are also differences of word grammar lying 
			in wait to catch out the unwary.<br />
			In English, for 
			example, it not possible to say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I speak Mary</em><br />
			but in Russian we can (and it means <em>tell</em>).<br />
			In the same way, we can say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is accusing him</em><br />
			but not:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*She is complaining him<br />
			</em>Anyone who has encountered the need to teach the distinctions in 
			English between <em>say, speak, tell </em>and <em>talk</em> will 
			have noted the differences in use of the verbs across a variety of 
			languages.<br />
			In other words, although the verbs occupy similar semantic spaces, 
			they do not occupy the <strong>same</strong> semantic spaces.</p>
			<p>It is a theme much beloved of journalists and some websites to 
			identify words in some languages which are, it is averred, 
			untranslatable because the semantic space they occupy is simply not 
			one recognised in other cultures.&nbsp; They include, for example:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>Waldeinsamkeit</em> (German)<br />
				the feeling of solitude in the woods</li>
				<li><em>age-otori</em> (Japanese)<br />
				looking worse after a bad haircut</li>
				<li><em>sobremesa</em> (Spanish)<br />
				a long post-lunch socialising event</li>
				<li><em>xerosfyri</em> (Greek)<br />
				the consumption of alcohol without accompanying food</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and many more.&nbsp; They are, of course, translatable as the 
			list shows, just not in a single word.&nbsp; The semantic space they 
			occupy may be an unfamiliar one but not one that is beyond the 
			imagination of most people.</p>
			<p>Other terms are more important and much less open to easy 
			understanding because the semantic spaces they occupy really are 
			unfamiliar and difficult to conceptualise.&nbsp; The differences, 
			for example, in English between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stroll, saunter, wander, amble<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; job, profession, trade, vocation, career<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fence, railing, balustrade, bannister, rail</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>cosy, comfortable, comfy, homely, snug</em><br />
			are all difficult to conceptualise because they are unlikely to 
			occupy the same semantic spaces in other languages and because the 
			semantic space that they occupy in English is ill defined and native 
			speakers may well disagree about where the borders of the spaces 
			are.&nbsp; They are interlingually problematic but also 
			intralingually problematic.<br />
			Similar considerations apply in reverse, of course, and all 
			languages contain words which are similar in meaning but not precise synonyms 
			because they occupy slightly different spaces.<br />
			(There is a relationship here that is called troponymy, closely 
			allied to hyponymy which refers to the fact, for example, that all 
			the verbs in the first set are ways of walking and all the nouns in 
			the second set are types of occupation.)</p>
			<p>Between languages, the situation gets even muddier.&nbsp; Many 
			languages will distinguish verbs meaning <em>put on</em> for 
			clothing depending on what part of the body and what type of 
			clothing is in question (Japanese, for example).&nbsp; Some, such as 
			French, distinguish, for example, between rivers which empty into the sea and those 
			which form tributaries of other rivers.&nbsp; Most other languages 
			don't do that although some distinguish directions of travel 
			depending on whether one is going up or down stream.&nbsp; Many languages, 
			including German and Greek distinguish between <em>try</em> in the 
			sense of <em>experiment with</em> and <em>try</em> in the sense of 
			<em>attempt</em>.</p>
			<p>Even when languages have single words for the same concepts, the 
			semantic space they occupy may be somewhat different so, for 
			example, the word <em>head</em> translates into the French <em>tête</em>, 
			the German <em>Kopf</em>, the Spanish <em>cabeza</em>, the Greek 
			<em>
			κεφάλι </em> [<em>kefali</em>] and so on but the occurrence of the words in phrases 
			such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the head of the school<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the head of the stairs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the head of a match</em><br />
			and so on will not be similar because polysemy and metaphorical or 
			figurative uses do not translate.<br />
			Cultural influences play a significant role in the attribution of 
			semantic space to certain lexemes.</p>
			<p>Abstract concepts such as <em>guilt, shame, joy, delight, ire, 
			cheerfulness, contentment, disappointment</em> and so on will be 
			culturally influenced and may not have any equivalent at all in the 
			target language and its original culture.<br />
			This is not so much a difference of semantic space as a different 
			environment altogether.</p>

					<h4>An example: kinship terms</h4>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>If you are born into a culture in which kinship 
			relationships are particularly important, it will be unsurprising if 
			your first language has an elaborate and complex way of expressing 
			familial relationships.&nbsp; Kinship terms are a good example of 
			the establishment for cultural reasons of specific semantic spaces 
			for particular lexemes.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p>In English a distinction is made between siblings and 
				cousins so the children of one's mother's siblings or father's 
				siblings, 
				of either sex, are distinguished lexically from the children of 
				one's parents.&nbsp; Hence we distinguish between <em>brother, 
				sister</em> and <em>cousin</em>.<br />
			However, English does not distinguish, as many languages, such as 
			German, do, between female and male cousins.&nbsp; Some languages, 
			Hawaiian, for example, make no distinction at all between brothers, 
			sisters and cousins and some languages distinguish between cousins 
			who are the children of one's father's sister or one's mother's sister.<br />
			Other languages, including Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Turkish, 
			Sinhalese, Chinese languages, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog, 
			Hungarian, Bulgarian, Nepalese, Sudanese and more distinguish between older 
			and younger brothers or sisters, having different terms to refer to 
			each.&nbsp; (See the guide to semantic for slightly more and some 
			examples of kinship terms.)<br />
			Although all languages are capable in theory of expressing any 
			thought, the constraints produced by language in terms of kinship 
			are clear.&nbsp; Most speakers of English, for example, are 
			unconcerned whether someone's sister is older or younger than the 
			person in question but this is clearly significant information in 
			other cultures and reflected in the language forms.<br />
			Interlingual interference may lead speakers of such languages to 
			apply a term too widely in some cases or understand it too narrowly 
			in other cases.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>False friends are a well-known aspect of language interference 
			although there are, at least for speakers of European languages, many 
			more true friends with cognate words denoting much the same thing 
			than there are false friends whose meanings have drifted apart.<br />
			Loan words, too, often take on different meanings in the languages 
			in which they have been borrowed so, for example, <em>cider</em> has 
			been borrowed into Korean from English but describes a soft drink, 
			not an alcoholic drink made from apples.&nbsp; Often a loan word or 
			expressions may be a calque and translated directly into the 
			receiving language.&nbsp; Because it has been borrowed to fill a 
			perceived gap in the host language's lexicon, it will often be 
			altered in terms of the semantic space it occupies.<br />
			There are exercises on false friends on this site in the learners' 
			section where you may discover more examples.<br />
			False cognates, such as the Japanese word <em>okoru</em> meaning 
			much the same as the English word <em>occur</em>, are very rare and 
			usually not particularly helpful.</p>

					<h4>Adjectives</h4>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Adjectives are a class of words open to various interpretations 
			of the semantic space they may inhabit and the kinds of things they 
			may describe.&nbsp;
			Colour divisions, for example, where red becomes orange or blue 
			becomes green, have also been shown to be variable across languages.<br />
			Collocating nouns are a source of interlingual error in many cases 
			and expressions such as <em>*a high tree, *a big time, * a thin 
			street, *a small moment</em> and so on are commonly the result of 
			the application of the semantic spaces of the L1 adjective to 
			English.<br />
			English and many other languages, such as Swedish and German, view time 
				in terms of distance so we have expressions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a long time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a short pause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a lengthy job</em><br />
				etc., 
				all of which can be translated directly.<br />
				But other languages, such as Greek and 
				Spanish, view time in terms of size so the equivalent expressions 
				would be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a big time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a small pause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a large job</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				It demands an effort of will to begin to think of time in terms 
			of length rather than size.</p>
			<p>Shape, too, is variably described so, in English we might 
			distinguish between something which is <em>round</em> and something 
			which is <em>circular</em> but other languages may not and Yiddish, 
			Arabic, Malay, Amharic, Finnish, Vietnamese, Bulgarian and Kazakh, 
			for example, make do with one adjective for both.<br />
			Distinctions in terms of collocation are also unpredictable so while 
			English distinguishes <em>high</em> from <em>tall</em>, appending 
			the first to large masses, usually, so we have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high mountain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high building</em><br />
			and appending the second more conventionally to upright narrow 
			objects so we have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tall person<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tall tree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tall spire</em><br />
			etc., many languages, including Bosnian, Serbian, Macedonian, 
			Russian, Italian, Ukrainian, Polish, Swedish and lots more make no 
			distinction at all.<br />
			English will apply the adjective <em>small</em> differently from <em>
			little</em> because the latter adjective implies attractively small 
			and the former does not (which explains why the TV series was called
			<em>Little House on the Prairie</em>, not <em>Small house on the 
			Prairie</em>).&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, the semantic spaces occupied by 
			the two adjectives in English is not parallelled in most other 
			languages.<br />
			In English, too, the comparative form of <em>little</em> is not the 
			word <em>littler</em> which is mostly confined to children's 
			language but <em>smaller</em>.</p>

					<h4>Prepositions</h4>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Prepositions, insofar as they can be said to occupy any semantic 
			space at all, are notoriously difficult for learners of other 
			languages to use successfully in English because the idiomatic uses 
			are legion.<br />
			English is particular rich in prepositions (<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_Prepositions.pdf" target="_blank">the 
			list on this site</a> runs to around 200 of them) and the 
			distinctions in use between them are sometimes very nuanced.<br />
			Other languages, such as French and Greek, which have far fewer 
			prepositions to deal with will subsume meanings which are encoded 
			with separate words in English under one word.&nbsp; A case in point 
			is the distinction between <em>over</em> and <em>above</em> which 
			are rendered in Spanish, Russian, Catalan, German, Czech, Hungarian, 
			Danish, Malay, Japanese and a host of others by a single word.&nbsp; 
			Just as many other languages (including Swedish, Serbian, Basque, 
			Welsh and others) do make a distinction and the concept is, of 
			course, translatable in other ways in all languages.<br />
			Errors in prepositional use, often when they are dependent on verbs, 
			are very frequent and can usually be traced to the negative 
			influence of the learners' first languages.&nbsp; We get, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He hit the ball above the net</em> (when <em>
			over</em> is meant)<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He complained of the service<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She decided for the blue shirt</em><br />

			<h3>Pronunciation</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It is clear that the possession of, for example, a Japanese, 
			French, Italian or whatever accent when speaking English is a direct 
			result of first language interference.&nbsp; Adult learners in 
			particular will tend to use the phonemes of their first language(s) 
			when attempting to pronounce a foreign one.&nbsp; Children, on the 
			other hand, are less prone to this behaviour.<br />
			Less considered is the fact that many phonological aspects of 
			people's first languages are parallelled in English so the 
			pronunciation of some phonemes is for them fairly straightforward.&nbsp; 
			The learner's first language may facilitate the pronunciation of a 
			second.<br />
			There is a guide to teaching troublesome sounds on this site, linked 
			below, which considers some of the aspects of a range of languages 
			which make the pronunciation of English sounds difficult to acquire.&nbsp; 
			From that list, we can extract a few examples of interference:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>The /iː/-/ɪ/-/i/ distinction</strong></dt>
				<dd>French, Italian, Greek, Persian languages and most Chinese languages 
				only have the longest of these sounds so that is frequently 
				substituted without a distinction being made, therefore, between 
				the word <em>hit</em> and <em>heat</em>.&nbsp; <br />
				Other languages, however, do have the intermediate sound /i/ and 
				they include Swedish, Spanish and Catalan, Portuguese, Polish, 
				Turkish (which also has the short sound), Malay / Indonesian and 
				Japanese.<br />
				For speakers of these languages, the /iː/ sound is more easily 
				produced because it simply involves the slight lengthening of an 
				already familiar phoneme.&nbsp; The facilitation is one worth 
				exploiting in the classroom.<br />
				Speakers of Dutch, German, Russian, Arabic, South Asian 
				languages and Thai, for example, will have few problems with 
				these phonemes because they are shared in their languages.</dd>
				<dt><strong>The /ə/</strong></dt>
				<dd>It is often averred that speakers of Italian, Spanish, 
				Portuguese, Greek, Czech, Polish and Arabic are not familiar 
				with the schwa sound.&nbsp; This leaves a very large number of 
				languages which do have something akin to the sound for whom it 
				holds no mysteries.<br />
				However, even speakers of languages which do not regularly use 
				the sound will use it in very rapid speech because it is a 
				natural reduction to make.&nbsp; Much more important in this 
				area is the question of timing to which we shall come.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Aspiration</strong></dt>
				<dd>Whether or not a phoneme is aspirated in English is not 
				meaningful.&nbsp; It may sound odd to aspirate the /p/ in <em>
				capture</em> but leave it unaspirated in <em>pot</em> but no 
				communicative effect will be noted.<br />
				In other languages, notably the Chinese languages, Korean and 
				Thai, aspiration is meaningful so /tʰ/, /kʰ/ and /pʰ/ may all 
				be meaningfully distinguished from their unaspirated forms.<br />
				However, the fact that the languages have both forms is actually 
				a facilitation factor not granted to speakers of languages such 
				as Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian who do not have the 
				aspirated forms and will pronounce the phoneme /p/ in the 
				initial position more closely to /b/, the /t/ closer to /d/ and 
				the /k/ closer to /ɡ/.&nbsp; This is interference.</dd>
				<dt><strong>/θ/ and /ð/</strong></dt>
				<dd>These sounds are not unique to English but few languages 
				have both, so speakers of languages which have one without the 
				other (such as Catalan and Spanish) with often use only that one 
				whenever either is needed.<br />
				Speakers of languages which have neither sound will substitute 
				variably and slightly unpredictably /f/, /z/, /s/, /d/ or even /v/.<br />
				Greek speakers, by contrast, will benefit from some facilitation 
				because their language has both sounds (the symbols for which 
				are drawn from Greek).</dd>
				<dt><strong>/l/ and /r/</strong></dt>
				<dd>It is not the case that these sounds do not exist in some 
				East Asian languages but it is the case that they are not 
				phonemically distinguished.&nbsp; Speakers of most languages can

					Speakers of the languages on the left of this table are 
				often more easily able to approximate the prosodic patterns and 
				weak forms of English than those in the list on the right.<br />
				In other words, the list on the left shows potential 
				facilitation and the list on the right potential interference.<br />
				Some languages, such as Japanese use a different, mora timing 
				system and that, too, may contribute to a noticeable accent.&nbsp; 
				(In Japanese a vowel (V) takes the same time to utter as a 
				consonant (C) plus a vowel so V takes the same time as CV and 
				CVV takes twice as long as CV.&nbsp; Slovak is often considered 
				also to be a Mora-timed language.)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Consonants</strong></dt>
				<dd>While the manner and place of some consonants, notably /t/, 
				/r/ and /d/ may vary slightly and contribute to a foreign 
				accent, most learners' first languages will share many of the 
				consonant sounds of English and accurate pronunciation is, 
				therefore, facilitated.&nbsp; For example, 16 out of 24 
				consonant sounds are shared between English, Dutch and Thai, 15 
				by Scandinavian languages and Polish, 17 by French, Spanish, 
				Malay, Portuguese and Catalan, 18 by Russian and Greek and 19 by 
				Farsi.<br />
				Which consonant sounds are shared will vary, naturally.</dd>

					<h4>Word : Morpheme ratio</h4>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Here we need to consider the sorts of languages our learners 
			speak because the differences between languages such as Mandarin 
			with very low morpheme to word ratios and those such as German and 
			Turkish with very high ratios is critical to the amount of 
			conceptual understanding that is likely to occur to hinder or 
			facilitate learning English.<br />
			What this means briefly is that in a clause such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John's housemates misbehaved</em><br />
			we have three words but 8 morphemes so the ratio is approaching 3 : 
			1.<br />
			In German, to take an example of a truly agglutinating language, a 
			word such as <em>Hauptbahnhofgaststätte</em> (roughly <em>central 
			station buffet</em>) is actually made up of 5 morphemes but one word giving a 5 : 
			1 ratio.<br />
			The concept of affixation for three purposes, grammatical marking, 
			semantic difference and lexical derivation, will be familiar to any 
			speakers of languages with mid to high morpheme : word ratios but 
			mysterious to those whose first languages are at the analytic or 
			isolating end of the cline.<br />
			The picture looks like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="ratio 2" height="338" src="../../imagesgraphics/morpheme_ratio2.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>However, facilitation is also a potential with the nature of 
			English because it frequently shows quite isolating characteristics.&nbsp; 
			For example, the clause:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will see you at six</em><br />
			contains 6 words and each word is a standalone morpheme so the ratio 
			is 1 : 1.&nbsp; Speakers of isolating languages will, therefore have 
			fewer difficulties understanding and using tense markers that are 
			single words or combinations of single words (such as <em>will, 
			shall, have gone, going to</em> or <em>used to)</em>.&nbsp; Speakers of 
			synthetic languages such as French, Italian and Spanish will have 
			more difficulty because in their languages, tense is usually shown 
			by affixing an ending to a verb or altering it internally (or both).</p>

					<h4>Affixation</h4>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>On the other hand, speakers of synthetic and agglutinating 
			language may more quickly acquire a feel for how affixation occurs 
			in English and will not be fazed by the concept of adding a prefix 
			to alter the meaning or a suffix to change word class or grammatical 
			function.<br />
			Japanese, to take just one example, has a wealth of grammatical 
			agglutinative affixes to denote conditionality, temporal aspects, 
			desires and more.</p>
			<p>There is scope here for both facilitation and interference for 
			speakers of languages which use suffixation, for example, as English 
			does to form nouns from other nouns and adjectives.&nbsp; English 
			frequently does this with the suffixes <em>-tion, -sion</em> and <em>
			-ation</em> as in, e.g., <em>introduction, supervision, conversation</em> 
			etc.&nbsp; It is a fairly simple matter for speakers of some 
			languages to realise that the suffixes will usually be, e.g., -<em>zione</em> in Italian and -<em>ção</em> 
			in Portuguese.<br />
			However, English has over 30 other ways to form nouns and reserves 
			only two of them (<em>-ness</em> and <em>-ity</em>) for the trick of 
			forming a noun from an adjective, which, e.g., Spanish does with the
			<em>-idad</em> ending, French often with <em>-ité</em> and German 
			with <em>-keit</em>.<br />
			If learners are tempted to apply their first-language rules of thumb 
			to the formation of all nouns this will lead to error.<br />
			English, too, reserves a limited set of suffixes which form adverbs 
			but other languages do not make a distinction morphologically and 
			that also results in errors such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She drove too quick</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			To make matters worse, the English affixation system has developed 
			piecemeal and, for example, the <em>-ly</em> ending once used to 
			form adjectives has been confined nowadays to adverb formation.&nbsp; 
			Hence, we have adjectives masquerading as adverbs such as <em>
			kindly, fatherly, friendly </em>and many more.</p>
			<p>For speakers of languages at the isolating end of the spectrum, the 
			whole area of affixation is often mysterious.&nbsp; Even when some 
			of the system has been acquired, the problems of the selection of 
			the right noun-forming suffix (30-odd options), verb making (five 
			options), adjective making (20-odd options) and adverb making (seven 
			options) remain.</p>
			<p>Prefixation, in principle, will not be a stumbling block for 
			learners whose first languages use them in the same or similar ways 
			but English has around five different prefixes which make negatives 
			and another three used to reverse an action.&nbsp; Selecting the 
			right one for production is very difficult but comprehension is 
			facilitated for such learners.&nbsp; Interference errors such as <em>
			misarrange, disenjoy, unpolite</em> etc. may result and this is 
			evidence of both interlingual error, reflecting differences in 
			languages, and of intralingual error 
			because the system is complicated in English.</p>

					<h4>Compounding</h4>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Compounding is not a mysterious concept for speakers of a wide 
			range of languages including, for example, Chinese languages, 
			Russian, Polish, Ukrainian, Czech, Slovak, Dutch, German, Afrikaans, 
			Greek, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Malay, French, Spanish, 
			Italian, Portuguese and Romanian but Arabic, Hebrew and other 
			Semitic languages do not use compounding to form new words.<br />
			The concept of compounding may not be odd, then, to most speakers of 
			many languages and the trick of spotting word boundaries within 
			compounds will not be difficult to apply to English so, for example 
			compounds such as <em>oceangoing, gaslight, blackboard, heartbeat, 
			windmill</em> etc. will be easily unpacked and the nature of the 
			first language facilitates comprehension.<br />
			Speakers of non-compounding languages will often not recognise the 
			word boundaries at all and, accordingly, may be unable to unpack the 
			meaning and use the correct pronunciation.<br />
			Speakers of agglutinating languages such as German or Turkish may, 
			however, have difficulty spotting near compounds in English where 
			the first item is a classifying noun rather than an adjective so, 
			for example, expressions such as <em>sports car, garden shed, cellar 
			bar, tree surgeon</em> etc. may not be seen as compounds at all because the 
			learner would expect such terms to form single words.</p>
			<p>More serious is the nature of a language in terms of headedness.<br />
			English is overwhelmingly right headed (or head final) and that means that the 
			right-hand lexeme determines meaning and word class so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>taxi driver</em> is a kind of driver not a kind of taxi<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>printing paper</em> is a kind of paper not a kind of 
			printing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>doorman</em> is a kind of man not a kind of door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>postage stamp</em> is a kind of stamp not a kind of 
			postage<br />
			and so on.<br />
			However, many languages which use compounding regularly are left 
			headed so, for example, in French, a <em>postage stamp</em> is a <em>timbre-poste, </em>in Polish a
		<em>znaczek Pocztowy</em> and in Romanian a <em>timbru poștal</em> (<em>stamp 
		postage</em> in all cases).<br />
			The distinction between right- and left-headed languages is a source 
			of miscomprehension and false production.&nbsp; A term such as <em>
			window shopping </em>may be understood to be a type of window and a 
			learner with a left-headed language may settle on <em>mill of water
			</em>when<em> watermill </em>is intended.&nbsp; For information, 
			here's a little table:</p>
					<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">

						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>The situation is further complicated by the fact that 
					some languages, notably Slavic ones, put an adjective before 
					a noun, as English does, but place any classifier after the 
					noun, as English does not.&nbsp; We get, therefore, in, 
					e.g., Polish:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a loud door bell</em><br />
					as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; głośny dzwonek do drzwi</em><br />
					which is literally:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; loud bell of door</em><br />
					and in Spanish that is<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; un timbre de puerta fuerte</em><br />
					which is literally<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a bell of door loud</em><br />
					and in German, which is an agglutinating language, the 
					classifier forms part of the compound so is rendered as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; eine laute Türklingel</em><br />
					which is literally<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a loud door-ring</em><br />
					The confusion caused often, alas, by well-meaning text books 
					and websites concerning where to place an adjective and 
					where to place a classifier is compounded by the fact that 
					other people's languages do things so differently.</p>

					<h4>Conversion</h4>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>English makes a good deal of use of conversion to form 
					words in different word classes so, for example, <em>clean</em> 
					is both a verb and an adjective, <em>bank </em> 
					and<em> bottle</em> 
					can be both nouns and verbs, <em>flat</em> is an adjective 
					and a noun and so on.<br />
					Many other languages, including most of the ones cited above 
					which use compounding do not do this regularly and this 
					causes sometimes quite serious comprehension difficulties 
					when a word is used in an unfamiliar class.&nbsp; This 
					can be made even more difficult when a word is used in a 
					compound <strong>and</strong> in an unfamiliar word class as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chateau bottled<br />
			</em>While English speakers may take conversion in their stride as a 
			familiar word-forming technique, speakers of other languages which 
			have a stricter relationship between word and word classes or which 
			always use some morphological technique to signal word class will 
			encounter difficulty in comprehension and will also avoid using 
			conversion when forming derived words.&nbsp; So, for example, while<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; driveway</em><br />
			will be understandable,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They walked up the drive</em><br />
			will confuse.<br />
			Equally, a learner may inappropriately select<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smokiness</em><br />
			because it carries morphological clues identifying it as a noun 
			formed from an adjective when 
			the simple noun<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; smoke</em><br />
			is appropriate.</p>

			<p>Almost any word in English which has a close synonym will differ 
			from it in style (and often other respects).&nbsp; So, for example 
			we can get sets such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reception, party, do, knees up, bash<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work, chore, labour, toil, slog, graft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happy, contented, satisfied, content, pleased, glad, joyful, cheerful, 
			cheery</em><br />
			etc. which all differ stylistically and, therefore, by their 
			appropriacy to the context in which they are used.<br />
			Although such words may translate well enough for comprehension 
			purposes into and out of other languages and, therefore, occupy more 
			or less the same semantic space, it is rarely <strong>exactly</strong> 
			the same space.<br />
			Once learned, therefore, such items may be, and frequently are, used 
			inappropriately for the register and style of the language use as 
			in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is she content to go to university?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you joyful about the news?</em><br />
			which, while conceivable, are very doubtfully correct utterances.<br />
			Because of its history English has, almost uniquely, developed a 
			three-level synonym system where three words with similar meanings are derived 
			from three different sources (Anglo-Saxon, French and Latin or 
			Greek) so we have, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rise – 
				mount – ascend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ask – question – interrogate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goodness – virtue 
				– probity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire – flame – conflagration<br />
				</em>and many more.<br />
			The temptation for speakers of Germanic, Romance or other Latinate 
			languages is to select the form which is most familiar 
			morphologically with a consequent loss of naturalness.&nbsp; This is 
			not an example of false friends at work because the words actually 
			do mean more or less the same thing and look similar in English and 
			the learner's first language.</p>

			<h3>Multi-word verbs</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It has often been noted that speakers of languages which do not 
			make any or extensive use of multi-word verbs (such as most Romance 
			languages and Slavic languages) may often insert stylistically inappropriate single-word 
			verbs where a native speaker would probably use a phrasal or 
			prepositional verb so we get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I dressed warm clothes</em><br />
			instead of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put warm clothes on</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Even for speakers of languages which do have forms akin to 
			multi-word verbs (such as most Germanic languages, including 
			Scandinavian ones) such languages will often have forms in which the 
			adverb particle or preposition is different from the one used in 
			English and that is a source of interlingual error, although the 
			fact that such constructions exist at all in the learners' first 
			languages is, naturally, a facilitation factor.<br />
			For example, in English, the <em>turn</em> and the adverb <em>down</em> 
			combine to make a new phrasal verb meaning reject as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned down the offer</em><br />
			but, although most Germanic language will also use a verb plus a 
			particle to achieve the same effect, it will be a different verb and 
			a different particle (usually one which translates more nearly as<em> 
			from </em>or <em>away</em> than <em>down</em>).</p>
			<p>Even when the particle is the same, problems arise in 
			interpretation so, a German speaker may have little difficulty with 
			the concept of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I picked up the book</em><br />
			because the same adverb is used in German with the verb <em>take</em> 
			(<em>nehmen</em>) to mean the same thing as in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ich nahm das Buch auf</em><br />
			The same will apply to other Germanic languages, including Dutch, 
			Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and so on where the particle <em>up</em> 
			translates directly.<br />
			Nevertheless, speakers of those languages will not readily 
			understand:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I picked up the language by living there</em><br />
			because that metaphorical extension is not parallelled.</p>
			<p>Speakers of Spanish, French and hundreds of other languages which 
			do not use adverbials like this will have serious difficulty because
			<em>pick up</em> (as in the sense of <em>taking upwards</em>) 
			translates as <em>recoger</em> and <em>ramasse</em>, respectively.&nbsp; 
			In all Slavic languages, the same consideration applies and the verb 
			will not translate as a verb plus a particle but as a single form.<br />
			Indeed the adverb may be ignored altogether so there is no 
			distinction in production or reception between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I picked the book</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I picked up the book.</em></p>

			</table>
			<p>This is where we meet the interface between lexis and grammar.&nbsp; 
			In terms of lexis proper, we have differences across languages of 
			colligation and transitivity as well as countability and 
			classification by word class.<br />
			Many of these differences are not obvious and some are rarely if 
			ever considered in classrooms.&nbsp; Here we'll review some of the 
			differences which often lead to interlingual error and occasionally 
			to some facilitation.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Transitivity</strong><br />
				<img alt="object" height="133" src="../../images/object200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This is a colligational issue which affects how verbs are 
				used in the target language when it is different from the 
				learners' first languages.<br />
				For example, in English the verb <em>tell</em> is ditransitive 
				and can occur in clauses such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told the children the truth</em><br />
				It can also occur with a <em>that-</em>clause providing an indirect 
				object is present in something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me that he would be late</em><br />
				That is not the case for equivalent verbs in other languages.&nbsp; 
				Errors such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She told that he would be late</em><br />
				result.<br />
				In English, <em>that-</em>clauses can never form the indirect 
				object of a verb and that is a restriction not parallelled in 
				other languages.<br />
				Other examples include the verbs <em>hide</em> and <em>conceal</em> (the latter of 
				which is only transitive), <em>jump </em>(often intransitive in 
				English, often only transitive in other languages), <em>dress</em> 
				(usually intransitive) and <em>wear</em> (transitive) and <em>
				explain</em> which cannot in English be used with a direct 
				personal object:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>I explained him the way to do it<br />
				</em>but 
				is used that way in many languages.<br />
				A few other verbs, <em>clarify, defend, justify</em> etc. work 
				in a similar way and require the dative shift for the indirect 
				object so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She clarified the issue to us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They defending their position to the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He justified his actions to me</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She clarified us the issue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They defending the meeting their position<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He justified me his actions</em><br />
				A complete list of verbal differences would be very long indeed.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Passive and ergative uses</strong><br />
				<img alt="passive" height="133" src="../../images/animals_dog_exhausted200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>While the concept of the passive is common to many 
				languages, how it is achieved is not.<br />
				In English, certain verbs can express passive concepts but no 
				distinction is made (except with <em>get</em>) between active 
				and stative passives.&nbsp; Many other languages, including most 
				Germanic ones, distinguish between:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window was broken and the rain came 
				in</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window was broken during the game</em><br />
				by using a different verb to denote the passive.<br />
				Some verbs, such as <em>resemble, lack, contain, possess </em>
				and more resist the use of the passive at all and that can 
				result in errors such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Enough money was lacked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Two pints is contained in this bottle</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Some verbs in English are used ergatively, meaning that the 
				ostensible object is actually raised to the subject position so 
				English allows:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The shirts sold well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window opened</em><br />
				etc. and, because such uses are uncommon in other languages, 
				learners may be tempted to substitute passive constructions to 
				express these ideas and produce<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shirts are sold well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window was opened</em><br />
				which both imply the intercession of an agent when none is 
				present.<br />
				Ditransitive verbs (see above) also allow for two parallel 
				passive structures in English but not in a range of other 
				languages.&nbsp; We can allow therefore two passive structures 
				from:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They gave him the prize</em><br />
				as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was given a prize</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A prize was given to him</em><br />
				but one or the other form will often be forbidden in other 
				languages.<br />
				French and German, for example, will allow the second 
				formulation but prefer to keep to the active for the first, 
				rendering it as something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He received a prize</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Determiner use</strong><br />
				<img alt="finger" height="133" src="../../images/finger_point_left200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>English requires its speakers to consider issues of 
				countability before they can select the correct determiner or 
				decide on a plural form at all but other languages do not.&nbsp; 
				This leads to interference errors such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a milk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a little books<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *some equipments</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				Other languages require their speakers instead to consider 
				gender for determiner and pronoun use and that results in errors 
				such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The group had her photo taken</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Articles</strong><br />
				<img alt="articles" height="133" src="../../images/bricabrac_c200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>The article system in English is quite complex as was 
				considered at the outset and causes difficulty because of its 
				complexity (an intralingual issue).&nbsp; Speakers need to 
				consider the level of specificity they intend and the nature of 
				a noun or noun phrase in terms of mass<em> vs.</em> count 
				characteristics in order to select the correct form.<br />
				Clearly, for speakers of languages which have no article system, 
				the acquisition of the rules is a real challenge.&nbsp; Very 
				briefly:<ol>
					<li>Most Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, Bosnian, Czech 
					etc.) as well as Chinese languages, Indonesian, Japanese, 
					Hindi and Urdu have no article system at all.<br />
					Speakers of these languages, usually find choosing the 
					correct article in English is very challenging because they 
					do not easily conceptualise the need to mark specificity and 
					non-specificity or count vs. mass nouns.&nbsp; The fact that 
					one can almost always omit articles with no damage to the 
					communicative force of what one says is an additional 
					factor.<br />
					A further stumbling block for speakers of these languages is 
					that many of them make no distinction either between mass 
					and count nouns.</li>
					<li>Most Celtic languages, Turkish, Persian languages and Arabic do not 
					have a clear indefinite article or are languages in which 
					the article forms a prefix.<br />
					For speakers of these languages, the reasons for selection 
					of <em>the</em> or <em>a/an</em> are often obscure.</li>
					<li>Albanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Bengali, Romanian and 
					Scandinavian languages do not have a recognisably similar 
					article system as they rely on suffixation for the concepts.<br />
					Hebrew and Maltese use prefixes to denote an article system 
					akin to English.</li>
				</ol>
				If learners make errors in this area, it is unsurprising because 
				the system itself is complex.&nbsp; Learners whose languages 
				have articles but deploy them differently may be led into error 
				by transfer from their first language but those learners whose 
				first languages have no articles (such as Polish and Russian) 
				make errors because the whole concept is foreign to them.<br />
				A further, more minor complication for some speakers of some 
				languages is the existence of a dual determiner form in their 
				languages which is only vestigial in Modern English (confined to 
				the determiners / pronouns <em>both, either</em> and <em>neither</em>).<br />
				While it is true that many languages which had a dual number 
				(rather than simply singular and plural) have lost the forms, 
				the evidence is still present in the ways in which nouns and 
				adjectives are declined.&nbsp; Most Indo-European languages have 
				lost the dual form but it survives in, for example, Modern Greek 
				where the translation of <em>both</em> is <em>and the two</em> 
				and in German and most Scandinavian languages in which <em>all 
				two</em> is still heard.&nbsp; Slavic languages, too, have lost 
				the forms but the declension of nouns still shows the vestiges.<br />
				Languages which retain a dual number include Classical Arabic, 
				Gulf Arabic (in nouns), Maltese, Tagalog, Polynesian languages 
				(only the personal pronouns), Slovene, Hungarian, Finnish, 
				Estonian and Sami languages.<br />
				Speakers of those languages may find it slightly puzzling that 
				English cannot distinguish a dual number and speakers of all 
				languages may find the fact that concord with <em>both</em> 
				requires a plural verb form but a singular verb form is usually 
				selected with <em>either</em> and <em>neither</em>.</dd>

			<p>There are, naturally, a number of important areas of the grammar 
			and structure of a language which are affected negatively or 
			positively by transfer from a learner's first language(s) or by 
			whatever other language of which a learner may also have some 
			mastery.<br />
			The following is not intended to be exhaustive.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style3" >
			<h3>Adpositions</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Overwhelmingly, English selects prepositions rather than 
			postpositions in expressions such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the table<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because of the rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since the storm</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Languages which choose the same route endow their speakers with an 
			advantage when they are learning English because the left-headedness 
			of a prepositional phrase is obvious to them.&nbsp; They will expect 
			the adpositions (<em>on, by, because of, since</em>) to be followed 
			by the complement or object.<br />
			Most European languages (including, e.g., Swedish, Danish, 
			Norwegian, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Bulgarian, 
			Greek, Polish, Russian and Czech) work in the same way, although, as 
			in English, there are occasional examples of postpositions.&nbsp; 
			There are many non-Indo-European languages which also work this way 
			when they have adpositions at all.&nbsp; (Many will rely on 
			suffixation, instead).</p>
			<p>Other languages do things differently and they include: Basque, 
			Turkish, Estonian, Japanese, Finnish, and Korean.&nbsp; In these 
			languages, the adposition follows the complement or object so a 
			literal translation will be, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the table on</em><br />
			For locative phrases, Chinese languages deploy both prepositions and 
			postpositions so literally we get, for example, both:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the table on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bed under</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on top</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Germany</em><br />
			Chinese languages also double adpositions to get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in newspaper-on</em>.</p>
			<p>This may carry over to other locative and temporal expressions so 
			languages, such as Turkish, which use postpositions may also choose 
			to put the interrogative word after the noun in question so, 
			literally, we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bank where?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting when?</em><br />
			instead of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the bank?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When is the meeting?</em><br />
			Learners from such language backgrounds may, consequently encounter 
			difficulties with relative adverb and pronoun constructions and a 
			clauses such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hotel where we stayed</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hotel which was by the sea</em><br />
			may be interpreted as interrogatives.</p>
			<p>Of course, once learners are aware of how English works in this 
			respect errors of transfer are quite rare.&nbsp; However, when 
			English does use a postposition, as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two years ago<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the money aside</em><br />
			some confusion can occur for all learners and an expression such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the church opposite</em><br />
			may be misunderstood altogether.</p>

			<h3>Subject, Object and Verb ordering</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are only six ways these three elements can be ordered and 
			all can occur in English and many other languages.&nbsp; For 
			example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>SVO: <em>Mary saw the film</em></li>
				<li>SOV: <em>With this ring I thee wed</em></li>
				<li>OSV: <em>Now him I do know</em></li>
				<li>VOS: <em>Open the door you</em></li>
				<li>OVS: <em>The dragon slew she then</em></li>
				<li>VSO: <em>Eat you all that food now</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>but it can readily be seen that apart from in questions and some 
			imperatives, the ordering in English of Subject-Verb-Object is 
			overwhelmingly the norm.<br />
			In fact, the ordering of the elements is the <strong>only</strong> 
			way English users have of distinguishing between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem caused a delay</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; A delay caused the problem</em><br />
			although in many other languages the noun phrase as subject and the 
			noun phrase as object would be distinguished by inflexion or article 
			changes.</p>
			<p>Any diversion from this canonical ordering is a marked form so, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must you go?</em><br />
			is marked as a question,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That film we have to see</em><br />
			is marked for emphasis on the object and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was built</em><br />
			marks the object of the verb and so on.</p>
			<p>Of the six possibilities, however, 75% of languages in the world are either SVO (like English) 
			or SOV (like Japanese, Tamil, Dutch, Maltese, Pashto and a hundred 
			or so others).&nbsp; VSO is rare (but included in that group are 
			Celtic languages along with at least 50 others), VOS is also rare 
			but includes some large languages such as Tagalog and Malagasy, and OVS and OSV are very rare indeed with only 
			one or two attested examples (Mallinson and Blake, 1981).<br />

			<p>Heavily inflected languages, such as Greek, may exhibit much 
			freer word order because it is clear from morphological marking on 
			the nouns, determiners and pronouns which grammatical role the noun 
			phrase is taking.<br />
			English, being a very weakly inflected language relies almost solely 
			on word order (and sometimes prepositions) to signal which noun 
			constitutes the object, the subject or the indirect object.<br />
			Clearly, speakers of SVO languages in the list above will be 
			facilitated by the structures of their first languages when it comes 
			to ordering constituents of clauses in English.&nbsp; Others are not

			<h3>Ordering other elements</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Apart from the basic S, O and V ordering and adpositions, there 
			are three other clause and phrase constituents which vary in the 
			ordering which is conventional in other languages.&nbsp; All of 
			these can be sources of interference or facilitation depending on 
			whether the learners' first language(s) parallel English or not.<br />
			They are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Numeral and determiners<br />
				English usually places numerals and other determiners before the 
				noun so we get, conventionally:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two houses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some bread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a few cups<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; little time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those people</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				Occasionally and confusingly, the determiner <em>enough</em> may 
				follow the noun.<br />
				Most European languages and Chinese, Korean and Japanese 
				parallel English in this respect so that facilitates getting it 
				right.&nbsp; In fact, learners from these backgrounds will 
				almost never make a mistake.<br />
				Other languages may take a different form and, for 
				beginner-level learners especially, this can be a source of 
				error.<br />
				The majority of African languages, most South-East Asian 
				languages and Celtic languages will place the demonstrative 
				after the noun so we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cake that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people these<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; houses four</em><br />
				etc.&nbsp; Egyptian Arabic sometimes does this, too.<br />
				The same applies to most of these languages when it comes to 
				ordering the noun and its numeral but here the Celtic language 
				depart from the pattern and have the same ordering as English.</li>
				<li>Adjectives<br />
				Although a few adjectives in English (such as <em>proper</em>) 
				are conventionally placed after the noun, and all adjectives used 
				with the <em>some-, any-, every- </em>series of pronouns follow 
				the pronoun, English is, overwhelmingly an adjective-noun 
				language.<br />
				There is a range of languages which work the other way around or 
				in which the ordering is variable, including all the Romance 
				languages, Albanian and Celtic languages in Europe, most 
				varieties of Arabic, the majority of African languages and most 
				South-East Asian languages.<br />
				The Chinese languages, Japanese and Korean follow the 
				adjective-noun ordering.<br />
				Above elementary level, this is usually not problematic although 
				the exceptions in English need to be learned.</li>
				<li>The genitive<br />
				English is very unusual in allowing both genitive-noun and noun-genitive so we see both:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John's car</em> (noun-genitive)<br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the opinion of the majority </em>
				(genitive-noun).<br />
				The rules for selection of the correct form are complicated and 
				a source of some intralingual error.<br />
				Many learners will, therefore, be inclined to follow the forms 
				of their first languages when the choice is not an easy one 
				(i.e., usually).&nbsp; We get errors such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the car of my neighbours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the house's roof</em><br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *the work of an hour</em><br />
				and so on, therefore.<br />
				Here the picture is much more mixed.&nbsp; Romance languages 
				prefer genitive-noun ordering but so does German (which also has 
				both), Russian and 
				Polish but some other Slavic languages show mixed orderings.&nbsp; 
				Modern Greek is noun-genitive but Scandinavian languages 
				are usually genitive-noun.&nbsp; The Chinese languages, Korean 
				and Japanese are all noun-genitive, too, but Vietnamese and Thai 
				are genitive-noun.</li>

			<p>Aside from the truly irregular verb, <em>be</em>, English only 
			has one inflexion in the present simple to distinguish person: it 
			adds -<em>s</em> or -<em>es</em> to the verb.&nbsp; In the past 
			tense, no distinction at all is made although the -<em>ed</em> 
			ending and other irregular forms mark the verb for tense.&nbsp; A 
			number of other languages, such as Swedish, Norwegian. Malay, 
			Indonesian, Filipino, Thai, most Chinese languages and Malagasy 
			function similarly.<br />
			Many languages which are more highly inflected, such as Italian and 
			Spanish, inflect the verb more enthusiastically and signal person by 
			the verb's ending.&nbsp; In Italian, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vado<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vai<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; va<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; andiamo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; andate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vanno</em><br />
			are all marked forms of the verb <em>go</em> which vary from person 
			to person.&nbsp; The same kind of marking occurs in past and future 
			tense forms as is typical for synthetic and inflected languages.<br />
			It is not necessary, therefore, in Italian and a range of other 
			languages, to include the pronoun because that is redundant 
			information.&nbsp; Therefore, the pronoun is dropped and Italian is 
			a pro-drop language.<br />
			Pro-drop languages probably outnumber non-pro-drop languages around 
			the world and their speakers may neglect to include the pronoun when 
			speaking English (or any other non-pro-drop language).&nbsp; We get 
			errors such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Went to the cinema<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Did my homework<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Like cheese<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Not know</em><br />
			etc. and the question form in English is routinely simplified or 
			ignored.<br />
			Pro-drop languages include, most Romance languages (but not French), 
			most Slavic languages, Greek, Finno-Ugric languages, most 
			Indo-European Indian languages, many African languages, Japanese, 
			Hebrew, Arabic and more.<br />
			(In fact, the situation is slightly more complicated than it sounds 
			because languages vary in terms of the amount of pro-dropping which 
			is conventional.&nbsp; There is, in other words, a cline from fully 
			pro-drop to fully non-pro-drop (English being almost completely 
			non-pro-drop, only omitting the pronoun in the imperative)).</p>

			<h3>Time and tense</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Humans have developed ways of keeping track of time for at least 
			40,000 years and quite likely longer.&nbsp; How they have done it 
			varies from time to time and culture to culture and this may 
			influence how people perceive time and how they cut it up into 
			manageable chunks.&nbsp; That, of course, will have implications for 
			things like tense structures and other ways in which verb forms 
			express time.</p>
			<p class="auto-style59">people in different cultures or groups have 
			been shown to differ in whether they think of time as stationary or 
			moving, limited or open-ended, horizontal or vertical, oriented from 
			left to right, right to left, front to back, back to front, east to 
			west, and so on.<br />
			<span class="auto-style7">Fuhrman, <em>et al</em>, 2011:1306</span></p>
			<p>English and many other European languages views time 
				horizontally as if it were moving from behind us to in front of 
				us.&nbsp; In English, this generates expressions such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm behind time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm looking forward to seeing you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's work on until the end of the day<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've put the argument behind us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking back, I see you are right</em><br />etc.<br />Other languages, such as Mandarin, view time vertically: meaning 
				that its speakers perceive time as moving from above to below 
				us or <em>vice versa</em>.&nbsp; This generates, roughly translated, expressions such 
				as:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The up month</em> (instead of 
			<em>the next month</em>)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The down semester</em> (instead of 
			<em>the last semester</em>)<br />and so on.<br /></p>
			<p>This has obvious consequences and is rich ground for the 
			generation of interlingual error when learners transfer their own 
			languages' conceptions of time into English.<br />
			Many languages, including the Chinese languages, do not mark 
			verbs at all for time, relying on adverbials to send the temporal 
			message.<br />
			This is fine with the future, as we shall see, but causes some 
			transfer issues when learners from these language backgrounds do not 
			perceive the need to alter a verb to show tense.&nbsp; They are 
			often happy to state:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary come yesterday</em><br />
			because, rightly, they perceive that the mutation of the vowel or 
			the addition of an -<em>ed</em> ending is simply redundant when we 
			have a perfectly understandable time marker.<br />
			The same considerations apply to speakers of South-East Asian 
			languages such as Vietnamese and Thai which also lack past-time 
			markers for verbs.</p>
			<h4>The future</h4>
			<p>Many languages, including English, the Chinese languages, most 
			European languages except the Romance languages, South-East Asian 
			languages and more do not have a tense inflexion for the future form 
			of a verb.<br />
			Such languages are in the majority so English in not peculiar in 
			this respect and speakers of large numbers of languages will not 
			have difficulty coming to terms with the periphrastic forms that 
			English uses to talk about the future, particularly, the modal 
			auxiliary verb
			<em>will</em>.<br />
			Some other languages, notably the Chinese languages, rely 
			almost solely on adverbials to indicate future time so expressions 
			like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary arrives tomorrow</em><br />
			are simple for them to understand and use successfully.<br />
			Many Germanic and Scandinavian languages have ways of 
		making the future (often employing the verb <em>to go </em>or<em> to 
		become</em>) but also habitually use the present tense with an adverb 
		marker to talk about the future (e.g., <em>I go tomorrow</em>).&nbsp; 
		These languages are similar to English in having no inflected tense form 
		to denote future reference and that is a facilitating factor.<br />Romance languages, like 
		French, Spanish and Portuguese do rely on changes to the verb and 
		therefore have real future tenses so we get, for example, the French <em>aimerai</em> and the Spanish 
			<em>amaré</em> (both meaning <em>I will 
		love</em>).</p>
			<h4>Relative and absolute tenses</h4>
			<p>English has two fundamental tense types not recognised in 
				many other languages: relative and absolute tenses.<br />
			English 
				distinguishes relative or relational tense forms, such as the present perfect 
				and the past perfect which link two events in time (the present 
				to the past and the past to a time before the past, 
				respectively) from absolute tenses such as the past simple and 
				future with <em>will</em> which set events at particular times 
				independently of other events.&nbsp; Other languages may rely 
				solely on absolute tense forms and their speakers will struggle 
				to conceptualise relative aspects of tenses.<br />
			Italian does something similar but in that language, the distinction 
			is between recent and distant past events.<br />
			The results are predictable and are good examples of interference 
			errors so we get, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Did she arrive yet?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She has left yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I will speak to her by then</em></p>
			<p>The issues are not insurmountable but language transfer in this 
			respect is quite stubborn because one's understanding of time and 
			the relationships between events within it is at least partially 
			conditioned by how one's language is constructed.<br />
			It requires a real effort of will on the part of a German speaker to 
			realise that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ich habe es gemacht</em><br />
			is an absolute past-tense form in German which may have no relevance 
			at all to the present whereas the literal translation:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have done it</em><br />
			is a present tense in English which embeds the past within the 
			present.</p>
			<p>Grasping the ways in which the language you are learning divides 
			time and sets events and states in time past, present or future is 
			not easy.&nbsp; It often requires a different way to conceptualise 
			events and states.<br />
			The problems that many learners encounter with English temporal 
			concepts often arise from the ways in which aspect and relative 
			forms are used in English.&nbsp; This is especially true for 
			speakers of languages which do not focus at all on aspect and rely 
			entirely on context and co-text to signal perfect, progressive, 
			iterative and other aspects.</p>

			<h3>Relative pronoun clauses</h3>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The rules surrounding the use of relative clauses in English 
			present particular intralingual issues because they are complex and 
			concern choices of the right pronoun, when it may be omitted, when
			<em>that</em> may be used, when the clause can be reduced and much 
			more.<br />
			However, there are also inter-lingual issues because the area is 
			handled very differently in different languages:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Many languages, including but not limited to<brr />
					Dutch, Albanian, Scandinavian languages (including Finnish, 
					this time, and Icelandic), German (in which relative 
					pronouns closely parallel the form of the definite article), Spanish, 
					French, Italian, Malay / Indonesian, Latvian, Maltese, Portuguese, Greek, Russian, Polish (and other 
					Slavic languages including Slovak, Czech and Slovene etc.), 
				Persian languages and Thai
					do not distinguish between a pronoun referring to people and 
					one referring to inanimate objects and animals.&nbsp; In 
					most languages, therefore, there is no pronoun distinction 
					between<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind which came in</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who came in</em><br />
					so errors such 
					as<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's the man which I saw<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's the table who he bought in France</em><br />
				etc. are frequent.</li>
				<li>Some languages use <em>that</em> and
					<em>what</em> interchangeably (German, Modern Greek and 
					Dutch are commonly cited examples) and that can lead to errors like<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's the man what he said would come</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The wind what came in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The man what came to the meeting</em><br />etc.</li>
				<li>Most languages which use relative pronouns as subordinators 
					do not allow the pronoun to be omitted and, apart from 
					causing speakers to sound unnaturally formal with sentences 
					such as<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; The book which I read explains it well</em><br />
					instead of the much more natural<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The book I read explains it well</em><br />
					this also presents comprehension difficulties because 
					learners from these backgrounds will have problems 
					understanding<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Is she the woman you spoke to?</em></li>
				<li>A range of languages, including Russian, German, Dutch and 
					Polish, do not distinguish between restricted (defining) 
					clauses and non-restricted (non-defining) clauses and that 
					can cause punctuation, pronunciation and comprehension 
					errors.&nbsp; In German, for example, all relative clauses 
					are separated by commas, not just non-defining clauses as in 
					English.<br />
					For speakers of other languages, in which the comma is used 
					to separate sense groups rather than represent pausing, 
					similar issues arise.</li>
				<li>Many languages, including Turkish (usually), Korean, 
					Tamil and Japanese do not have a structure at all parallel 
				to a relative clause.<br />
					In most, the meaning is expressed either through compound 
					adjectives, so we get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The by the river house</em><br />
					instead of<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house (which is) by the river</em><br />
					or by participle clauses so we get, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *My friend living in America invited me to visit him</em><br />
					instead of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>My friend who lives in America invited me to visit him</em></li>
				<li>In Chinese languages, there are parallel structures but in 
				these languages, the relative clause <strong>precedes</strong> 
					rather than follows the noun phrase and that can produce 
					errors such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Who is in England my friend wrote to me</em><br />
					Additionally, the pronoun may routinely be omitted 
					regardless of the grammatical function it performs and that 
					leads to errors such<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The man gave me the money was very 
					friendly</em></li>

			<h3>Periphrastic forms</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are two main periphrastic forms in English which may cause 
			difficulties for learners whose languages rely more heavily on 
			morpheme changes for the same concepts such as the Germanic 
			languages and Japanese.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Comparative and superlative forms<br />
				English uses both morphological change as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the larger house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the smallest idea</em><br />
				and periphrastic forms such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the more decisive person<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the most impressive answer</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Learners with some first languages, such as the Romance European 
				ones, and most isolating languages such as Chinese will have 
				little difficulty with the periphrastic forms because that 
				parallels their own languages so, in other languages we get:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; la casa mas grande</em> (Spanish)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; la plus grande maison</em> (French)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; la casa più grande</em> (Italian)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; casa mai mare</em> (Romanian)<br />
				However, language crossover may result in the form being 
				over-selected so errors such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the more large house</em><br />
				etc. may occur.<br />
				On the other hand, languages such as German, which rely on 
				morphological changes may result in their users selecting:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the decisiver person<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *an impressiver answer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *an admirabler film</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Some languages, such as Greek, can use both forms 
				interchangeably but the rules of use differ.<br />
				The rules for the use of the two ways to make comparative and 
				superlative forms are by no means simple in English and that 
				results in intralingual difficulties for almost all learners.&nbsp; 
				We get errors, therefore, such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was boreder by the second lecture</em><br />
				because there are rules for the formation which are not 
				parallelled in other languages in which the participle form is 
				not adjectival.</li>
				<li>Question forms<br />
				English is variable in this respect so intralingual error will 
				occur with nearly all learners.&nbsp; We get the familiar:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Do you can see it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Did he could get the train?</em><br />
				etc. because English adopts a different type of question form 
				for auxiliary and main or lexical verbs.<br />
				Languages vary in how questions are formed.&nbsp; Notably, 
				Chinese languages use <em>ne</em> and <em>ma</em> particles at 
				the end of declarative forms to make questions and Thai also has 
				a particle, <em>mai</em>, used in a similar way as well as a 
				range of forms somewhat akin to a question tag, which may result 
				in the overuse of the <em>do/did </em>operator or tags, some 
				(such as most European languages) reverse the subject and verb 
				which may result in underuse of the operator and some (such as 
				Greek) rely solely on intonation which may result in underuse of 
				any question forms at all resulting in errors such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *When you can come?</em><br />
				Arabic varies across dialects and relies heavily on intonation 
				but also has a range of question words which closely parallel 
				the English set.<br />
				All these language backgrounds also have the potential for 
				facilitation, of course, in the use of question tags, using the 
				operator or reversing the subject and verb when it is 
				appropriate to do so.<br />
				However, another way in which English grammar causes substantial 
				difficulty is in the selection of the appropriate tag which is 
				subject to complex rules and some idiomaticity.&nbsp; The fact 
				that English apparently applies the wrong tag when the negation 
				is transferred to the first clause does not help so the correct 
				form is<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think he's coming now, is he?</em><br />
				rather than the logical form present in many other languages of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he's not coming now </em>+ tag 
				form</li>

			<h3>Moving the deictical centre</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>When you call a telephone number in English and get the dreaded 
			answering service, the message you will hear is often something 
			like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not here to answer your call at the 
			moment but I'll get back to you if ...</em><br />
			However, in other languages, the message may well be:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary is not there but she'll call you back if 
			...</em><br />
			The reason for the difference is that English often moves what is 
			known as the deictic centre from the speaker to the hearer but other 
			languages do not.<br />
			It is logical enough for the second message to be phrases the way it 
			is because Mary is, in fact, not <strong>there</strong> rather than
			<strong>here</strong>.&nbsp; It also logical to use the third person 
			to refer to Mary because she is not actually doing the speaking.</p>
			<p>Apart from errors with recording telephone messages, which are 
			probably not serious other errors of a more serious nature arise 
			when the deictic centre is not moved as it so often is in English.</p>
			<p>Shifting the centre accounts for a great deal of 
			confusion with related verbs such as <em>bring-fetch-take</em> and
			<em>come-go</em> in English because other languages conceptualise 
			spatial and temporal relationships differently.&nbsp; Japanese, for 
			example, always uses the equivalents of <em>come</em> and <em>go</em> 
			from the point of view of the speaker.&nbsp; German and many 
			European languages also tend to be 
			speaker centred in this respect.<br />It results in 
			errors such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'll bring you to the station<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I'll go to you now<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you coming to the cinema with us?&nbsp; *Yes, I'm going.<br />
			</em>Diagrammatically representing the deictic centre to learners 
			is often helpful.&nbsp; Like this:<br />
			<img alt="bring fetch take" height="227" src="../../imagesgraphics/bring_fetch_take.png" width="465" /><br />
			In the last example with <em>bring</em> the speaker remains on 
			the left but has moved the centre to the hearer on the right, hence 
			the use of <em>bring</em> rather than <em>take</em> and <em>come</em> 
			rather than <em>go</em> which would be 
			the preferred forms in many languages.</p>
			<p>Some languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Georgian, 
			Basque, Korean and Japanese, have a threefold 
			distinction for demonstratives and can refer to objects near the speaker, objects 
			near the hearer and objects far from both the speaker and the 
			hearer, like this:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><strong>proximal</strong> (near me but far from you)</li>
				<li><strong>medial</strong> (near you but far from me)</li>
				<li><strong>distal</strong> (far from both of us)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Speakers of these languages will often have difficulty deciding which 
			form is appropriate in English.&nbsp; It results in some covert, and 
			not so covert, 
			error such as saying<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want that </em>(when <em>this</em> is meant)<br />
			<em >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went here</em> (when <em>came</em> is meant)<br />and so on.<br />
			(Old English, by the way, also had the threefold distinction and 
			traces remain in dialect words such as <em>yonder</em> and <em>yon</em>.)</p>
			<p>There is also the use of forms in what is called discourse deixis 
			to consider.<br />
			At the end of a presentation or proposal, for example, it is 
			perfectly acceptable to respond with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is an interesting idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an interesting idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are interesting ideas</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are interesting ideas</em><br />
			and all the references are anaphoric, referring to the ideas 
			presented beforehand.<br />
			However, in English we cannot refer cataphorically to what is to follow with <em>that</em> or
			<em>those</em> so something like<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I won't be able to come and those are my reasons: firstly, ...<br />
			</em>is unacceptable but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't be able to come and this is the reason ...</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't be able to come and these are the reasons</em> 
			...<br />
			are both acceptable.<br />
			Other languages, needless to say, do not suffer from this 
			restriction and that results in transfer errors.</p>
