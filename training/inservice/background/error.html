		</table>
						<p>We are focused here on the errors made by learners of 
						the language.<br />
						The example above is not one of those.&nbsp; It is 
						somewhat akin to the kind of error made by native 
						speakers of a language which is normally referred to as 
						a slip of the tongue, although, in this case, it is a 
						slip of the paint sprayer.<br />
						We are also not concerned with the sorts of errors made 
						by children acquiring their first language(s).&nbsp; 
						Such errors do happen frequently, of course, and we 
						often hear children selecting the wrong past-tense form 
						or failing to produce the auxiliary verb or the 
						determiner in something like:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going to park</em><br />
						(where <em>I want to go to the park</em> is intended).<br />
						Errors of that kind are often referred to as 
						transitional forms.</p>
			<p>In what follows we will make a distinction between 
						three sorts of mistakes in learner production or 
						reception:</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Slips</strong><br />
							<img alt="banana" height="133" src="../../images/banana_skin_a200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
							If, during a lesson on producing oral recounts of 
							past events, a learner at B2 level says or writes 
							something like:<br />
							<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go yesterday</em><br />
							then you may be safe in assuming that if you stop 
							the learner and say:<br />
							<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go?!</em><br />
							you will probably elicit something like:<br />
							<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry:
							<span class="style_black">went</span>, of course.</em><br />
							The fact that the learner is able immediately to 
							self correct shows that this wasn't a real error at 
							all.&nbsp; It was a slip caused by inattention, 
							tiredness, cognitive overload or simple 
							carelessness.<br />
							In a lesson in which correct use of past verb forms 
							is the target (or one of them), some corrective 
							action probably needs to be taken.&nbsp; In other 
							circumstances, the slip can be safely ignored.</li>
							<li><strong>Attempts</strong><br />
							<img alt="try" height="133" src="../../images/effort_stone200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
							If during the same kind of lesson, a learner at A1 
							level produces something like:<br />
							<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I was go to the party 
							yesterday I saw him</em><br />
							then we have a very malformed sentence indeed and it 
							is vanishingly unlikely that the learner could self 
							correct without a great deal of external input 
							concerning how to make a conditional sentence that 
							refers to a past unfulfilled contingency.&nbsp; In 
							fact, such is the gap between the learner's current 
							knowledge and the target conditional form that you 
							would probably be unwise to treat the attempt at 
							all.&nbsp; It would be possible to say something 
							like:<br />
							<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, that should be: "<span class="style_black">If 
							I had gone to the party yesterday, I would have seen 
							him</span>"</em><br />
							but the likelihood of the learner being able to 
							absorb the data and put it into practice is not 
							strong.<br />
							An attempt, therefore, is a mistake which is caused 
							by simply not having the data to make a well-formed 
							utterance.</li>
							<li><strong>Errors</strong><br />
							<img alt="error" height="133" src="../../images/error_nail200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
							If, during the same lesson, a learner produces:<br />
							<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun shone when we were 
							walking in the park</em><br />
							we have some evidence that the learner is attempting 
							to refer to a background continuous state and a 
							progressive action.&nbsp; We know that a better 
							sentence would be:<br />
							<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun was shining when / 
							while we were walking in the park</em><br />
							but it is unlikely that the learner could 
							self-correct except by guesswork and assuming that 
							the alternative tense form is required.&nbsp; The 
							error is not wholly unacceptable because we do often 
							use a simple form of the verb to refer to a 
							continuous state as in, for example:<br />
							<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary appeared upset while we 
							were talking in the pub</em><br />
							in which the first verb form is simple past but the 
							reference is to a continuous state.&nbsp; It would 
							be wrong to say:<br />
							<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary was appearing upset 
							while we were talking in the pub</em><br />
							because of the semantic nature of the verb and that 
							is not to do with the grammar point.<br />
							What is happening here is describable as a real 
							error.&nbsp; The learner is in the process of 
							acquiring the system but has not yet fully mastered 
							it in terms of the aspectual nature of the verbs 
							which can be used to talk about past states or 
							events.<br />
							This is the kind of mistake one would expect if a 
							cognitive view of language learning is to be 
							believed.&nbsp; A grammar rule has been encountered 
							and the learner has hypothesised that because <em>
							Mary appeared</em> can be seen as a continuous 
							background state, so, too, can <em>The sun shone</em>.&nbsp; 
							This is a semantic issue, not a grammatical one.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>In what follows, we are concerned with errors, not 
						slips or attempts.</p>

		<p>If you feel disappointed, angry, frustrated, irritated etc., then it 
		seems that you believe that error is somehow dysfunctional: a failure of 
		the learning process.&nbsp; In other words, you view an error as an 
		unwanted form.<br />
		If, on the other hand, you feel encouraged, interested or even happy, it 
		could mean that you feel that making error is just part of the 
		learning process, and a positive one at that.</p>
		<p><strong>View 1<br />
		</strong>Error is to be avoided at all costs in the classroom because 
		language learning is essentially about making good habits and 
		automatising language output.&nbsp; People learn by repetition of 
		correct models, not by making mistakes or testing hypotheses.&nbsp; 
		There has been insufficient training in this case of model sentences 
		such as <em>I caught a bus, I caught a train, I caught a tram </em>etc.</p>
		<p><strong>View 2<br />
		</strong>Errors of this sort, in which the student has correctly 
		inserted the <em>-ed</em> ending for the simple past tense in English 
		show that a rule is being acquired.&nbsp; He or she has hypothesised 
		that the correct past tense ending for the verb <em>catch</em> is the 
		same as for a large number of other verbs in English.&nbsp; The 
		hypothesis was incorrect in this case but all that needs to be done now 
		is to lead the learner to understand that the rule doesn't work for all 
		verbs in English.&nbsp; Learners need to understand the limitations and 
		restrictions but acquiring the past tense ending is a positive step on 
		the road to fluency and accuracy.<br />
		In other words, you see error as an opportunity to shape the learner's 
		language production positively and you view error as a developmental 
		form.</p>

		<p> The point of this is to show that children make hypotheses as they 
		go along and test them to see the reaction.&nbsp; In this example, the 
		child is making three hypotheses (indicated above).&nbsp; What are they?&nbsp;

			<span class="auto-style7">Hypothesis 1:</span> the past tense of <em>show</em> 
			might be <em>showeds</em>.&nbsp; This is scotched by the mother's '<em>You 
			what?'</em> so the child retries (correctly?) with <em>I showed him.<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style7">Hypothesis 2: </span>the verb <em>
			show</em> means <em>observe</em>.<em>&nbsp; </em>Both verbs involve sight and 
			looking so it's not unreasonable.&nbsp; The child is alerted to the 
			problem by the mother's repetition (with rising intonation, 
			probably).<br />
			<span class="auto-style7">Hypothesis 3:</span> the past tense of <em>see</em> is regular (as it is 
			with <em>show</em>).&nbsp; Here the mother corrects rather than 
			questions.</p></div>
			<p>It is something of a leap to assert that adult learners of a 
			foreign language also consistently make hypotheses like these but it 
			would explain the <em>I catched</em> example, above, wouldn't it?</p>
		<p>According to Pit Corder, whose example this is, foreign language 
		learners have to make similar hypotheses all the time.&nbsp; In 
		particular, humans ask questions like:</p>
		<ul class="redbullet">
			<li>Are the systems in the language I'm learning the same as they are in the 
		language(s) I know?</li>
			<li>If they are different, how do they work?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The guide to the similarities and differences between
		first and second language acquisition, and that to interference and 
		facilitation, linked in the list of related 
		guides at the end, has more 
		on this.</p>

		<p>This is a key concept and describes where the learners' current 
		language mastery stands on a scale from knowing nothing of the target 
		language to complete mastery.&nbsp; Diagrammatically, it can be pictured 
		like this:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="interlanguage" height="175" src="../../imagesgraphics/interlanguage350.png" width="350" /></p>
		
		<p> The diagram oversimplifies and hides some interesting ideas 
			concerning the sources of error and the current state of the 
			learners' knowledge.<br />
			What studies showed was that although <strong>some</strong> errors 
			were the result of applying first-language rules to the target 
			language (which would indicate the transfer of language habits), 
			some errors indicated that learners were 
			<span class="style_underline">creatively</span> constructing 
			rules and hypotheses to explain the data to which they were exposed.<br />
			If this is the case, then teaching needs to address the positive 
			role of error, the concept of noticing the difference between one's 
			own output and native-speaker models and the supply of adequately 
			rich linguistic data for the learners' cognitive processes to work 
			on.</p>

		<p> <strong>Pre-systematic errors</strong> are those made with language the 
		learner has not encountered.&nbsp; For example, a student guessing that 
		a word is similar in meaning to something which looks the same in her 
		language or trying to form a complex sentence with relative clauses that 
		she hasn't yet learned how to do.&nbsp; This is the kind of mistake that 
		was classified at the outset as an attempt.<br />
		<strong>Systematic errors</strong> are those made while learning or 
		acquiring items in the language.&nbsp; If, for example, you are teaching 
		that the negative of <em>must have</em> is <em>can't have / couldn't have</em> 
		then you can expect error with the forms because it's non-intuitive that 
		the negative of <em>must have </em>is not<em>&nbsp;mustn't have</em> 
		(as it is in many languages).<br />
		<strong>Post systematic errors</strong> are sometimes called 'slips' 
		(see above) because they happen with language the learners have already mastered but 
		are due to carelessness, tiredness or cognitive overload (they have too 
		much else to think about).</p>

			<p>It isn't enough to know what sort of error we are dealing with.&nbsp; 
			We also need to be able to suggest why the error occurred in the 
			first place.<br />
			There are three obvious sources.</p>
		<dl >
			<dt><strong>Ignorance</strong></dt>
			<dd>the learner may simply have never learnt the form or the meaning 
			and is just stabbing in the dark.&nbsp; This is most common at lower 
			levels because that's where learners' needs often outstrip their 
			abilities to produce language.&nbsp; For example, if a lower-level 
			learner produces a syntactical error like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *If he didn't came to my party I was sad</em><br />
			or a lexical error such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I did not have informations from that</em><br />
			then the cause may often be an ignorance of how unreal events are 
			expressed in English in the first example or a lack of lexical 
			knowledge concerning countability and the meaning of prepositions in 
			the second case.<br />
			We are dealing with attempts, here, not errors proper.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Overgeneralising the rule</strong></dt>
			<dd>sometimes, when a rule has been learned, learners will 
			over-extend it.<br />
			For example, if you have learned the rule to 
			add <em>-ed</em> to make a past tense, it seems logical to form <em>
			catched</em>.&nbsp; Equally, over-extending a rule might lead to the 
			production of <em>wonderfuller.<br />
			</em>This source of error is also known as <strong>ignorance 
			of rule restriction</strong> (i.e., not knowing the limits of the 
			rule's applicability) or <strong>analogy</strong> (i.e., assuming 
			that a rule which works perfectly well in one utterance will be 
			applicable to a similar one).</dd>
			<dt><strong>First language interference</strong></dt>
			<dd>all learners, especially adult ones, will draw on language(s) 
			they know to try to figure out a new one.&nbsp; This is most obvious 
			in the area of pronunciation, of course, but occurs frequently in 
			other areas:<br />
			Structure: the learner's first language may have a structure that 
			looks similar but means different things.<br />
			For example, the 
			German structure of <em>ich habe gesehen</em> [<em>I have seen</em>, 
			literally] often is better translated into English as <em>I saw</em> 
			rather than <em>I have seen</em>.&nbsp; That's only one reason for 
			finding out a bit about our learners' first languages.<br />
			Lexis: many languages, and not only European ones, have words which 
			look the same but have different meanings.<br />
			For example, <em>
			simpatico</em> in Italian means <em>nice</em> or <em>friendly</em>,
			<em>sensibel</em> in German means <em>sensitive</em> and <em>un 
			smoking </em>in French is <em>a dinner jacket</em>.<br />
			There are 
			many hundreds of these so-called false friends.&nbsp; There's
			a set of exercises on this site focused on false friends and it is 
			linked below.&nbsp; There are, it should be remembered, even more 
			true friends, i.e., words which look the same in the learners' first 
			languages and mean pretty much the same.<br />
			Appropriacy: in many languages, such as Greek, it is perfectly 
			acceptable, for example, to go into a shop and state<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want ...<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Give me ...<br />
			</em>with no <em>please</em> to soften the demand or instruction although the 
			form of the verb in the second case will signal that it is marked 
			for politeness.&nbsp; 
			That will not work well in most English-speaking cultures.<br />
			Languages differ in a huge variety of ways and some of the 
			differences are not immediately obvious because interference can 
			result in unnatural rather than patently wrong production.&nbsp; For 
			example, selecting:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; A bank is on the corner</em><br />
			instead of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a bank on the corner</em><br />
			may not be obviously flawed but is unnatural in English which 
			deploys the anticipatory <em>there</em>-construction much more 
			widely than many languages do.<br />
			There is a guide to language interference and facilitation, linked 
			below.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Teacher-induced error</strong></dt>
			<dd>regrettably, many errors are caused or allowed to persist 
			because of the teacher's behaviour, and materials.&nbsp; This 
			includes giving learners ambiguous, incomplete or false information.&nbsp; 
			There is a separate 
			guide to teacher-induced error on this site, linked below.</dd>
