		<p>Learning-style research originated in the 1970s and has become quite 
		an industry.&nbsp; Considerations of learning style are now routinely 
		incorporated into all education fields and ours is no exception.&nbsp; 
		The problem, of course is twofold:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>There are many ways to classify learning style and a 
			range of procedures (mostly questionnaires but including some quite 
			innovative and imaginative tests) used to discover them in 
			people.</li>
			<li>There is almost no solid empirical evidence to support any of the 
			theories.&nbsp; Most appear intuitively sound but that's not 
			evidence.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Given the wide range of possible learning-style classifications (at 
		least 70), it 
		is not possible here to cover them all.&nbsp; This guide will focus on 
		five:</p>

		<h3>Multiple-intelligence theory</h3>
				Howard Gardner originally posited 7 types of intelligence (and has 
				since suggested some more).&nbsp; He is quite clear that if 
				another researcher were to look at the same data, he/she might 
				identify a rather different set of intelligences.&nbsp; His 
				original list is:<br />
				<ol>
					<li>
					<span class="auto-style3">Linguistic</span>: capabilities in 
					words and language</li>
					<li>
					<span class="auto-style3">Logical-Mathematical</span>: 
					capabilities in logic and numbers</li>
					<li>
					<span class="auto-style3">Musical</span>: capabilities in 
					music, sound, rhythm</li>
					<li>
					<span class="auto-style3">Bodily-Kinaesthetic</span>: 
					capabilities in body movement control</li>
					<li>
					<span class="auto-style3">Spatial-Visual</span>: 
					capabilities in images and space</li>
					<li>
					<span class="auto-style3">Interpersonal</span>: capabilities 
					in other people's feelings</li>
					<li>
					<span class="auto-style3">Intrapersonal</span>: capabilities 
					in self-awareness</li>
				</ol>

		<p>Gardner's Multiple Intelligence Theory is, first and foremost, a 
		theory of the mind rather than a learning-style theory.&nbsp; Many 
		feel that it has a little more academic credibility than some of the 
		other theories discussed on this page.<br />
		The theory is one of many that see the mind running a set of 
		specific 'programs' to deal with specific issues (the usual analogy is 
		to a Swiss-army penknife).&nbsp; It is in 
		opposition to theories of the mind that see intelligence as a single, 
		all-purpose learning program.<br />
		Gardner also stresses the fact that the intelligences are not 
		independently used but function in concert:</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>in the normal course of events, the 
		intelligences actually interact with, and build upon, one another</em></span><span class="auto-style11"><br />
		<span class="auto-style15">(Gardner, 1983: 279)</span></span></p>
		<p>In a bit more detail, these various intelligences can be described as 
		follows (based on data at https://www.businessballs.com/self-awareness/howard-gardner-s-multiple-intelligences/).<br />

		<p>The VARK model is an adapted version of the original VAK and 
		is copyrighted by Neil Fleming (so don't expect a free version on this 
		site).<br />
		An on-line questionnaire to determine your mix of preferred learning 
		styles is available on the 
		<a href="https://vark-learn.com" target="_blank">VARK homepage</a> 
		which will 
		also lead you to much more about VARK.<br />
		</p>
		<p>Briefly, the theory is as follows:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Visual learners</strong></dt>
			<dd>learn best by seeing things.&nbsp; They take in visual 
			information more effectively than other forms of information so they 
			respond well to visual aids, charts, diagrams and so on.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Auditory learners</strong></dt>
			<dd>take in information through their ears and respond well to 
			lectures, discussion, recorded material and so on.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Reading-writing learners</strong></dt>
			<dd>will respond well to written exercises and presentations and to 
			procedures which reinforce the language through getting them to 
			write.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Kinaesthetic learners</strong></dt>
			<dd>will respond well to activities and procedures which allow them 
			to manipulate objects (such as Cuisenaire rods and cut-ups of texts 
			or physical-object matching exercises such as matching a word to a 
			visual image printed on cards).</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>Again, don't be tempted to pigeon-hole your learners, or yourself.&nbsp; 
		We all demonstrate mixtures of these preferred learning styles &ndash; 
		it is the <strong>proportions</strong> in the mix that matter.&nbsp; Or 
		so the theory goes.</p>

			<p>NLP bases its assumptions on what is known as people's primary 
			representation systems which are determined by the individual's 
			reliance on sensory data: visual, kinaesthetic, auditory, olfactory 
			and even gustatory.<br />
			Claims made for NLP range from the effective treatment of 
			psychological disorders to more outlandish assertions that the 
			practice can cure nearsightedness, dyslexia, cancer and the common 
			cold.</p>
			<p>NLP theory is mired in controversy, obscure terminology and 
			distortion but certain characteristics can be discerned.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Subjectivity<br />
				People create a map of reality personal to themselves through 
				what they perceive with their senses.&nbsp; This 
				representational system determines their behaviour and that 
				behaviour can be altered and manipulated by a trained 
				programmer.&nbsp; That is what is meant above by saying the map 
				is not the territory: all our representations are subjective 
				understandings of reality.</li>
				<li>Consciousness<br />
				is seen as split in to what we are aware of and what we are not 
				aware of (the conscious and the unconscious mind).</li>
				<li>Learning<br />
				can be achieved by gaining rapport (through mirroring non-verbal 
				behaviour) and by requiring imitation of other people's 
				behaviour.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A central concern of NLP from its inception is that of analysing 
			eye movements with for example, the following suggested:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upward eye movements indicate visual thinking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; side-to-side movements indicate auditory thinking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; downwards movements indicate kinaesthetic thinking</p>
			<p>In terms of language teaching, the following procedures have been 
			recommended (Dahn, n.d.):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>creating rapport through mingling and communication gap 
				activities</li>
				<li>mirroring the behaviour of those we wish to influence or 
				manipulate such as people seen on TV, the teacher and each other</li>
				<li>creating positive states and anchoring by story telling, 
				guided fantasy exercises and so no.</li>
				<li>maintaining flow though balancing activity types and skills 
				work so that learners feel in control of their own learning</li>
				<li>pacing and leading through initially accepting the views of 
				others (pacing) before suggesting alternatives to move people on 
				(leading).</li>
				<li>perceptual positioning by presenting alternative points of 
				view.</li>
				<li>modelling good practice involving learner training and the 
				acquisition of new study skills</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There's a good deal more in the same vein to be had by 
			investigating what is claimed for NLP by various proponents on the 
			web and elsewhere.</p>

			The evidence</h4>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Unfortunately for proponents of NLP, what evidence there is for 
			its usefulness or theoretical credibility is almost wholly negative 
			or neutral.&nbsp; Some proponents of the hypothesis are actively 
			disparaging of any attempt to investigate the claims scientifically, 
			averring that it is an art not a science and so beyond the reach of 
			serious empirical research.<br />
			Notwithstanding that claim, many researchers over the decades have 
			attempted to measure the effectiveness of NLP in particular and 
			claims about learning styles in general.<br />
			The general consensus, not unchallenged, is that NLP is 
			pseudo-science and has no theoretical credibility and no evidence to 
			support it.&nbsp; NLP has been variously described as a 
			quasi-religion, psycho-shamanism and a new-age psycho-religion.<br />
			That does not, of course, prevent people from trying to introduce it 
			into language classrooms for, as Dahn, <em>op cit</em>., points out:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">... what is clear is that NLP and ELT are 
			complementary in that NLP learns by observing communication 
			patterns, and ELT learns from what NLP suggests as best practice in 
			improving interpersonal communication and therefore learning.&nbsp; 
			There is nothing in NLP that is contrary to current ELT methodology 
			in terms of communicative language learning and humanistic 
			approaches, while NLP has much to contribute to the already vast 
			repertoire of the informed eclectic.</p>
			<p>which implies that because NLP is not actively opposed to the 
			current methodological paradigm, we may as well use it because it 
			might do some good.&nbsp; Many find that sort of argumentation 
			inadequately illuminating.</p>
			<p>Witowski, 2010, having undertaken a comprehensive review of the 
			evidence from 63 studies (the reading of which, in his words, '<span class="style_black"><em>left 
			me close to tears</em></span>') concluded his study with:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Today, after 35 years of research devoted to 
			the concept, NLP reminds one more of an unstable house built on the 
			sand rather than an edifice founded on the empirical rock.</p>
			<p>Others have been more trenchant:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">VAK’s theoretical framework, as far as we can 
			establish, often lies entangled within neurolinguistic programming, 
			accelerated learning and brain-based learning, sometimes all three 
			at once, all highly controversial fields at times strongly 
			challenged by the mainstream academic and scientific communities.<br />
			VAK, as it appears to us, is, in many instances, shrouded in 
			pseudoscience, psychobabble and neurononsense. VAK’s 
			instrumentation, as far we have encountered it, is seriously flawed, 
			never establishing any sense of validity or reliability. As such, it 
			can lay no claim to any diagnostic, predictive or pedagogical power 
			whatsoever.<br />

			<dt><strong>Activists</strong></dt>
			<dd>are flexible and willing to try new ideas and challenges (in

			They are willing to take risks with language.<br />
			However, they also often fail to consider the consequences of their 
			actions (and that makes them poor monitors of their own production).&nbsp; 
			They are usually highly sociable but may want to be the centre of 
			attention.<br />
			Such learners also share many of the characteristics of 
			predominately visual learners (see VARK, above).</dd>
			<dt><strong>Pragmatists</strong></dt>
			<dd>are down-to-earth problem solvers.&nbsp; They want to try things 
			out to see if they work in practice and are open to applying 
			language learnt immediately in the real world.&nbsp; They are not 
			particularly interested in 'theory' so will be resistant to studying 
			grammar rules etc.<br />
			They can become impatient with discussion and want to get on with 
			things now so a task which requires careful planning can prove 
			challenging<br />
			They learn most readily by doing things so a task-based approach 
			appeals to them despite their tendency to jump in without thinking 
			things through.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Reflectors</strong></dt>
			<dd>like to stand back to think about things.&nbsp; They like to 
			consider their options, gather data and look at things from 
			different angles before acting.&nbsp; They are fundamentally 
			cautious and unlikely to respond to situations in which they are 
			required to take risks with language they have not thoroughly 
			learned.<br />
			In group work, they will often take a back seat and do more 
			listening and thinking than contributing.<br />
			They also share characteristics with dominantly reading-writing 
			learners (see VARK, above).</dd>
			<dt><strong>Theorists</strong></dt>
			<dd>try to integrate what they see into theories.&nbsp; They are thus open 
			to inductive learning approaches which require them to draw 
			inferences from examples of the language.<br />
			They are sometimes seen as perfectionists and won't be happy until 
			everything fits into an overall scheme that makes sense to them.<br />
			They are keen to acquire rules and systems so respond well to

			<p>Briefly:<br />

				Field independent people perceive things as discrete entities

			The tests for field (in)dependence involve the ability to locate

				<li>The GEFT test is actually a measure of cognitive ability,

				<li>GEFT test outcomes appear to be culturally influenced with 
				people from urban societies which have free social structures 
				and are more individualistic scoring as field independent and 
				people from collectivist societies with rigid social structures 
				scoring more as field dependent.&nbsp; Children, too, seem to be 
				more field dependent than adults, as do people in people-oriented work as 
				opposed to object-oriented jobs.</li>

		<ul class="redbullet">
			<li>Neuroscientists, in particular those working in the field of

		<p>
			No consideration of learning styles is complete without some 
			attention to cultural issues.&nbsp; In fact, given the above 
			criticisms, this may be a more fruitful way of looking at learning 
			style.<br />
			In this we must be careful to avoid crude cultural stereotyping 
			along the lines of "All English people are reserved and 
			cold-blooded.", of course, but some approaches to learning and 
			studying are obviously culturally produced.<br />
			A major body of work in this area has been done by Geert and Gert 
			Jan Hofstede and a good deal of information is available on their 
			website at http://www.geerthofstede.nl.</p>
		<p>
			For our purposes, the most obviously useful data concerns the 
			relationships across various cultures between two sets of two variables: 
			<span class="auto-style3">Power 
			distance</span> and <span class="auto-style3">Uncertainty avoidance </span>
			on the one hand and <span class="auto-style3">Collectivism <em>vs</em>. 
			Individualism</span> on the other.<br />
			<span class="auto-style3">Power distance</span> refers to the amount of authority some people in 
			society have and the concomitant amount of deference they are shown.<br />
			<span class="auto-style3">Uncertainty avoidance</span> refers to people's willingness to take risks 
			and tolerate ambiguity.<br />
			<span class="style_black">Collectivism</span> and
			<span class="style_black">Individualism</span> concern how much 
			people are prepared or inclined (or not) to subordinate the 
			individual to the society.</p>
		<p>
			Here's a table of the relationship 
			between <span class="style_black">Uncertainty Avoidance</span> and
			<span class="style_black">Power distance</span> for some major cultures rather freely adapted from the Hofstede site.</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="power distance and uncertainty avoidance" height="409" src="../../imagesgraphics/power_distance.png" width="465" /><br />
			Note, for example, that Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Ireland 
			exhibit small power distances and weak uncertainty avoidance.&nbsp; 
			You would anticipate that learners from these cultures will expect a 
			large measure of equality between students and teachers and be 
			willing to take risks.<br />
			At the other end of the spectrum (bottom right) lie cultures such as 
			Japan, Portugal and Greece which have both large power distances and 
			low tolerance of uncertainty.&nbsp; We should expect learners from 
			these backgrounds to be unwilling to take risks in the classroom and 
			expect the teacher to be very much in charge and fronting the 
			learning process.&nbsp; They may even become anxious if they find 
			that they are expected to experiment with language and work in pairs 
			or groups without the supervision of the teacher.</p>
		<p>
			Here's another considering the second pair of characteristics.</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="collectivism vs. individualism" height="407" src="../../imagesgraphics/collective_individual_grid.png" width="465" /></p>
		<p>
			Note, for example, that individualistic societies often 
			exhibit small power distances and that collectivist societies 
			usually show large power distances.<br />
			This may well affect many facets of classroom dynamics, the way 
			tasks are approached and much else, potentially.<br />
			Learners from the cultures in the top-right of the grid may prefer 
			to work together on issues, sublimating their individual views to 
			those of the majority and working on a group outcome to which they 
			will all adhere.&nbsp; They will, however, expect the teacher to 
			lead the task and to do the evaluation of its success.<br />
			Learners from cultures in the bottom left of the grid may become 
			frustrated with a group approach and prefer to reach their own 
			conclusions.&nbsp; They may feel in the best position to judge how 
			successful they have been and may not rely on or agree with the 
			teacher's views.<br />
			Those from cultures in the bottom right of the grid will be happy to 
			work alone but may depend on the teacher for evaluation, task 
			setting and assessment.</p>
