	<dt><strong>Instrumental motivation</strong></dt>
	<dd>refers to learning a language in order to gain another goal.&nbsp; For some, e.g.,

	opportunities.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Integrative motivation</strong></dt>
			<dd>refers to the motivation to learn a language stemming from a 
			desire to integrate into an English-speaking culture.&nbsp; This 
			doesn't just apply to people moving into an English-speaking 
			society; it may apply to anyone who has an affinity with 
			English-speaking cultures of one sort or another.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Intrinsic motivation</strong></dt>
			<dd>springs from within the learner.&nbsp; Some people actually 
			enjoy the process of acquiring and using a new language.&nbsp;

			powerful than ...</dd>
			<dt><strong>Extrinsic motivation</strong></dt>
			<dd>comes from outside the learner and may be the promise of a

			less powerful factor.</dd>

			<p>
			Acculturation theory is associated with the work of Schumann (1986) 
			and is mostly concerned with non-instructional settings, those in 
			which the learner is acquiring rather than learning the language in 
			Krashen's dichotomy.<br />
			It has a good deal in common with theories of integrative motivation 
			which we have seen above so it does not get a major section to 
			itself.<br />
			It is asserted that success in learning depends on a variety of 
			factors:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style57">
				<li>How much the learner wants to communicate with speakers of 
				the target language</li>
				<li>The availability of opportunities to do so</li>
				<li>The degree to which the learner wishes to integrate with the 
				target language community</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In turn, these factors are influenced by other, mostly social, 
			factors which include:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>the perceived status of the target language culture.&nbsp; 
				The higher the perceived status, it is argued, the higher will 
				be the motivation to integrate.</li>
				<li>shared cultural institutions such as schools, workplaces, 
				clubs and so on in which the learner will gain opportunities to 
				interact with native speakers.</li>
				<li>the similarity or otherwise of the cultures of the target 
				language group and the learner.&nbsp; The more similar they are, 
				the easier it will be.</li>
				<li>how long the learner intends or is forced to remain in the 
				target culture nation.&nbsp; The longer one stays, the greater 
				is the need and motivation to learn the language.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			As you can see, most of acculturation theory concerns integrative 
			and instrumental motivation and should be seen in that light.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Back in 1943, Abraham Maslow proposed his 'Hierarchy of Needs' and 
		asserted that until needs at lower levels are satisfied, those at the 
		next highest level can't be addressed.&nbsp; Levels 1 to 4 are described 
		as 'deficit needs'.&nbsp; So, e.g., if you are hungry and in need of 
		sleep, you can't focus on desires for self esteem and so on.&nbsp; The 
		hierarchy can be represented like this.</p>
		<table style="width: 80%">

				<td rowspan="6" style="width: 301px">
				<img alt="maslow" height="326" src="../../imagesgraphics/maslow.png" width="465" /></td>
				<td style="width: 100%" valign="middle">Self-actualisation 
				needs are described as: Truth, individuality, realising one’s 
				own unique capabilities, ‘being who I really am’, achieving 
				goals related to a sense of purpose, becoming fully human, 
				everything that a person can become.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="auto-style9">
				<td class="auto-style7" style="width: 100%" valign="top">Esteem

		</table>
		<p>This has obvious classroom implications.&nbsp; If learners are 
		feeling threatened (a safety need) and excluded (a belonging and love 
		need) then they are unlikely to be able to focus on realizing their own 
		potential.</p>

				<h2>Expectancy Theory</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>A different understanding of motivation has been put forward by 
		Victor Vroom.&nbsp; Vroom's work was focused primarily on a workplace 
		environment and concerned with how people are best managed in order to 
		get the most positive outcomes.&nbsp; Whether it is relevant to 
		language-learning settings is in some dispute but many believe it offers 
		a simple and satisfying explanation for how people reach decisions and 
		what will encourage them to work better.<br />
		Essentially, Vroom identifies a relationship 
		between:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Valence: the value attached to an outcome.&nbsp; In our case,<br />
			<em><span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much do you value learning English?</span></em></li>
			<li>Expectancy: the individual's ability to achieve the goals set.&nbsp; 
			In our case,<br />
			<em><span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you believe you can 
			successfully learn English this way?</span></em></li>
			<li>Instrumentality: the likelihood that the effort will be rewarded 
			with a successful outcome.&nbsp; In our case,<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you believe the learning you are 
			doing will help you to use English successfully?</em></span></li>
		</ol>
		<p>The theory can be represented like this:</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="expectancy" height="285" src="../../imagesgraphics/expectancy.png" width="465" /></p>
		<p>These are, according to the theory, measurable.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Valence can be measured on a scale of -1 (highly undesirable) to 
			+1 (highly desirable).</li>
			<li>Expectancy can be measured on a scale of 0 (the effort will NOT 
			lead to the performance) to 1 (the effort will certainly lead to the 
			performance).</li>
			<li>Instrumentality can be measured on a scale of –1 (the 
			performance will certainly not lead to the outcomes) to +1 (the 
			performance will certainly lead to the outcomes).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Behaviour is then determined by the subjective evaluation of the 
		strength of the correlation between: EFFORT, PERFORMANCE and OUTCOME.<br />
		Motivational Force = Expectancy x Instrumentality x Valence</p>

		<p>
		It is often averred that neither the teacher nor the institution can 
		influence global motivation to any great degree.&nbsp; After all, the 
		idea of global motivation is the motivation that the learners bring from 
		outside.<br />
		That's not always the case.</p>
		<ul class="redbullet">
			<li>People's motivation can be made more intrinsic by realising that

			gain some desire to access it</li>
			<li>Extrinsic motivation can be enhanced by programmes which focus

				<h2>Institutional motivation</h2>

			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>This is the name often given to the fact that learners can also be 
		motivated by their surroundings.</p>
		<p>Teachers often conclude that there really is nothing they can do 
		about how their learners feel about where they are studying and the 
		facilities which are available to them.&nbsp; Of course, if you are an 
		academic or school manager, there most certainly are things that you can 
		do.</p>
		Boring, dark or uncomfortable classrooms do not help people to 
				learn.&nbsp; There are a number of things we can all do to increase
				institutional motivation.&nbsp; 
				For example:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>Make the classroom bright and welcoming.<ol class="greybullet">
						<li>If the walls are bare and dun-coloured, disguise 
						them with posters, pictures and examples of the 
						learners' work (having that put on the wall is often a 
						motivating factor in itself).</li>
						<li>Don't ask people to work in the gloom.&nbsp; If you 
						have lights, use them.</li>
						<li>Make sure that the seating arrangements suit the 
						type of lesson.&nbsp; For more on this, see
						<a href="../../initial/teaching/classroom_organisation.html" target="_blank">the guide to classroom organisation</a> 
						(new tab).&nbsp; Are the 
						sight lines right?&nbsp; Can everyone see what they need 
						to see?&nbsp; Can everyone hear clearly? and so on.<br />
						It is very frustrating and demotivating to be asked to 
						do things in an environment that hinders you.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>maintain a positive attitude yourself and don't complain 
				about your school in front of your learners (complain to the 
				boss, instead!)<ol class="greybullet">
						<li>Which would motivate you?<br />
						<em>The photocopier isn't working too well so I'm sorry 
						about the streaks.&nbsp; We are working on it and it 
						will be OK tomorrow.</em><br />
						or<br />
						<em>The photocopier isn't working too well and they 
						haven't done anything about it yet so I'm sorry about 
						the streaks.&nbsp; What can we do?</em></li>
						<li>If you are an academic or school manager, what 
						sources of complaint have the teachers got?&nbsp; Do 
						they transmit these to the learners or are there other, 
						more positive, ways of bringing it to your attention?</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>make handouts and materials colourful and attractive<ol class="greybullet">
						<li>It is not very motivating to be handed a 
						hand-written text which you can barely read.&nbsp; It is 
						motivating and reassuring to receive well-written, 
						attractive handouts which can form the basis of a record 
						of what you have learned.&nbsp; This also increases task 
						motivation (see below).</li>
						<li>If you are a teacher, make sure that what you give 
						people is attractive, accurate and fit for purpose.</li>
						<li>If you are a school manager or academic manager, 
						establish an in-house style which ensures that what 
						people receive in class and work on at home looks 
						professional and well prepared.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Remember Maslow's third level in the Hierarchy of Needs 
					and make sure<ol class="bluebullet">
						<li class="greybullet">that your learners know 
						about each other's lives</li>
						<li class="greybullet">that the learners respect (or 
						at least tolerate) each other's opinions 
						and feelings</li>
						<li class="greybullet">that all participants feel part of a group not part 
						of a group of individuals</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
		<p>There is, in fact, a good deal that teachers can do to influence 
		institutional motivation, isn't there?</p>

		</table>
		<p>This is the area over which the teacher has the most control, of 
		course.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Making tasks and exercises enjoyable and challenging can 
				increase people's motivation to do them.&nbsp; The theory is 
			that the more they 
				commit to the task, the better they will learn.<ol class="greybullet">
				<li>reading a letter from someone you don't know addressed to 
				someone you don't know is not very interesting but reading a 
				letter from your teacher addressed to you is immediately more 
				interesting for you because it is personal</li>
				<li>using tasks which are either too easy or too difficult 
				demotivates.&nbsp; The first because it leads to boredom, the 
				second because it leads to anxiety and frustration</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Personalising tasks of all kinds can help people to get engaged 
				and learn more: personalisation &rarr; engagement<ol class="greybullet">
				<li>writing a description of a person in a picture practises 
				some language skills but writing a description of a classmate, a 
				friend or member of your own family practises the same skill in 
				a more personal and interesting way</li>
				<li>using the target language or skill in a role play in which 
				you pretend to someone you are not can be reassuring and safe 
				but being yourself in that situation can be involving and 
				memorable</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Responding to learners' contributions is a key teaching skill.<ol class="greybullet">
				<li>Which do you want to hear?<br /><em>No, that's wrong.&nbsp; The right answer is ...<br />Well, that's not quite right.&nbsp; Let's see if we can improve 
				it.<br />Yes.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Next?<br />Yes that's right!&nbsp; What an interesting idea!<br />
				</em>It is not difficult to choose, is it?</li>
				<li>Which do you want to see?<br /><em>I have underlined all your mistakes in red and put
					<img alt="cross" class="auto-style44" height="16" src="../../../gfx/cross16.png" width="16" /> 
				by them.&nbsp; 4/10 overall.<br />I have put a&nbsp;<img alt="tick" height="14" src="../../../gfx/tick_green16.png" width="16" /> 
				by all the good things you write but there are some quite 
				important mistakes and 
				we'll go through them in class tomorrow.&nbsp; Well done!</em><br />Again, it's not difficult to choose.</li>
				<li>Don't ask impossible questions such as "Do you think hunting 
				is right?&nbsp; Why?"&nbsp; With no time for preparation and no 
				warning or context, all of us would struggle to answer questions 
				like that.<br />
				See 
				<a href="../../initial/teaching/asking_questions.html" target="_blank">the 
				guide to asking questions</a> (new tab) for more.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Setting the level of cognitive challenge.&nbsp; This is not the 
			same as selecting materials which are at the right level for the 
			learners.&nbsp; It involves knowing what is being required of them 
			in terms of thinking skills.&nbsp; Set this level too low and a task 
			becomes dull and predictable, set it too high and the learners may 
			be frustrated and fail to make connections between new data and data 
			they already control.&nbsp; Either will reduce the level of task motivation.&nbsp; 
			There is a guide, linked below, to an influential approach to 
			cognitive challenge initiated by Bloom and others in the middle of 
			the 20th century.&nbsp; Very briefly,  
			<ol>
				<li>Level 1: <strong>remembering</strong><br />
				This involves simply the ability to recall a fact.</li>
				<li>Level 2: <strong>understanding</strong><br />
				This involves some deeper thought to get to grips with a fact.</li>
				<li>Level 3: <strong>applying</strong><br />
				This involves using knowledge and understanding to make a 
				decision about action.</li>
				<li>Level 4: <strong>analysing</strong><br />
				This requires the application of levels 1 to 3 and then going on 
				to breaking things down into constituents to understand fully 
				what is happening.</li>
				<li>Level 5: <strong>evaluating</strong><br />
				This involves using all the processes in levels 1 to 4 and 
				judging how well, for example, one's use of language measures up 
				to the models with which one has been presented.</li>
				<li>Level 6: <strong>creating</strong><br />
				This is the most demanding level of all because it requires the 
				use of the previous 5 levels in order to synthesise data into a 
				new and original work.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style56">For a more detailed consideration of Bloom's taxonomy and its 
			various revisions, see
			the guide, linked below.</p>
			</li>
			<li>It is especially important for younger learners that task 
				motivation is kept high because young learners often do not 
				respond to very long-term goals.<ol class="greybullet">
				<li>Telling a young learner that English will help them get a better 
				job in 5 years' time is not very motivating for them so they 
				need to be challenged by and enjoy what they are doing <strong>right now</strong>.</li>
				<li>Focusing on topics beyond the learners' experiences is often 
				a demotivating and off-putting exercise.&nbsp; Topics in coursebooks try to avoid this kind of thing, of course, which is why 
				they are so bland and uninteresting</li>
				<li>Choosing topics about which you know your learners have 
				views, is, however, a motivating and intriguing experience.&nbsp; 
				Don't shy away from the controversial or important.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
