			<p>People have been learning and acquiring second (or third, fourth 
			etc.) languages for thousands of years.&nbsp; There's nothing new in 
			that.<br />
			In many parts of the world, the ability to speak multiple languages 
			is the norm not the exception.<br />
			In India, for example, Hindi, English, Bengali, Gujarati, Kashmiri, 
			Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, Kannada, 
			Assamese, Sanskrit and Sindhi are all official languages and it is 
			not uncommon to find people proficient in more than two of them.<br />
			In South Africa, IsiZulu, IsiXhosa, Afrikaans, Sepedi, English, 
			Setswana, Sesotho and Xitsonga are widely spoken and even in the USA 
			(a country often assumed to be more or less monoglot) over 400 
			languages are spoken, some very widely, 170-odd of which are 
			indigenous to the area.&nbsp; A fifth of the US population uses a 
			language other than English in the home.&nbsp; In California, you 
			can take your driving test in any of 32 languages.<br />
			Within Europe, a number of countries have more than one official 
			language.&nbsp; Switzerland is an obvious example but there are also four 
			official languages in Austria, Germany and Spain, two in The 
			Netherlands, two in Finland and so on.&nbsp; 100 languages are spoken across 
			the UK and one in five of London's population does not have English 
			as a first language.&nbsp; The UK, oddly, does not even have an 
			official language although 98% of the population speak English.<br />
			We should not, therefore, see the acquisition of an additional 
			language as in any way exceptional.</p>

					<h2>Four important concepts</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>What is newer is the study of <span class="style_underline">how</span> 
			second languages are learned or acquired.&nbsp; To understand the 
			underlying theories, it is useful to have a set of thinking tools to 
			hand and that means understanding four elemental concepts.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Competence <em>vs</em>. Performance</strong></dt>
				<dd>Ferdinand de Saussure, in his Course in General Linguistics 
				(1915) distinguished between langue (roughly the internal rules 
				and arrangements of a language) and parole (roughly the spoken 
				and written forms of language seen in everyday settings).<br />
				Chomsky, much later (1965 / 2002), made a similar distinction 
				between Competence and Performance.<br />
				Competence is the speaker's general, implicit and rarely 
				articulated, knowledge of the grammar of a language and 
				Performance is the speaker's actual use of the language in 
				speaking and understanding it.<br />
				Chomsky was not concerned so much with what is actually said but 
				with what can be said.<br />
				The difference between the two divisions is that de Saussure was 
				concerned with language in society but Chomsky was more 
				concerned to explain individuals' use of and knowledge about the 
				form of language.<br />
				For more on Chomsky's theories see the 
				guide to Chomsky, linked in the list of related guides at the 
				end.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Use <em>vs</em>. Usage</strong></dt>
				<dd>This distinction was first proposed by Widdowson (1978) and 
				refers to the difference between the formal structures of the 
				language and the language as it is used in real communication 
				for authentic purposes.<br />
				Briefly, the distinction rests on the difference between <em>
				signification</em> (what, on the face of it, an utterance means) 
				and <em>value</em> (what it means in communication).&nbsp; So 
				for example, if someone says<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a terrible headache</em></span><br />
				and the reply is:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's nearly 6 o'clock in New York</em></span><br />
				while we know what the words mean (the significance), they carry 
				no communicative value.<br />
				If, on the other hand, the reply is:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll get you something for it</em></span><br />
				then the response carries both significance and communicative 
				value.<br />
				Much research into second-language acquisition is concerned with 
				usage (how people acquire the formal systems of the language) 
				and less effort has been devoted to how learners acquire the 
				ability to use the language to get things done.<br />
				English language teachers are concerned with both 
				significance and value, of course.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Acquisition <em>vs</em>. Learning</strong></dt>
				<dd>This distinction is attributed to Krashen (to whom there is
				a separate 
				guide on this site, linked below).<br />
			Acquisition is a process similar to the way in which children 
			acquire their first language(s).&nbsp; It requires meaningful and 
			frequent interaction in the language in which the speakers are not 
			focused on form but on meaning.<br />
			Learning is, in contrast, a formal procedure which focuses on the 
			explanation of rules and correction of language form.<br />
				It should be noted that Krashen was not explicitly stating that 
				one is necessarily <strong>better</strong> than the other.<br />
				The distinction can be extended to the difference between 
				naturalistic acquisition and instructed acquisition.&nbsp; The 
				former refers to the almost unconscious picking up of a language 
				and the latter to the deliberate choice to study and be formally 
				taught.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Deductive <em>vs</em>. Inductive processing</strong></dt>
				<dd>Deductive processing involves the application of given rules 
				to the data.<br />
				For example, once you have been made aware that 
				putting the right ending on a 
				German verb in the second person singular (familiar) is to 
				substitute <em>-st</em> for <em>-en</em> then 
				you can transform any number of infinitive forms in the correct 
				way to get, e.g.,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rauchen &ndash; rauchst<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bringen&nbsp;&ndash; bringst</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				Inductive processing works the other way around.<br />
				Given the examples of the transformation above and some more 
				examples, such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reisen&nbsp;&ndash; reist<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				denken&nbsp;– denkst</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				You can figure out for yourself what the rule is.<br />
				(You will not, by the way, be right for all the verbs in the 
				language and this won't help you much with meaning but you will, 
				one way or another, have learned a useful rule.)<br />
				Much nonsense is spoken about taking <strong>either</strong> an 
				inductive <strong>or</strong> a deductive approach to learning.&nbsp; 
				This is not an either-or distinction.&nbsp; Even if one starts 
				with a purely inductive approach in the classroom, the aim has 
				to be for the learners to hypothesise a rule (preferably the 
				right one) and then apply it to further examples of the target 
				language.&nbsp; The second procedure is, of course, purely 
				deductive.&nbsp; There is little point in putting learners to 
				the trouble of constructing a rule from exemplification if they 
				are not then encouraged to apply it.<br />
				On the other hand, starting with a deductive approach and 
				supplying a rule from the outset nearly always results in the 
				need to refine the rule later to take account of more complex 
				forms.&nbsp; Even if we knew what they are, it would not be possible 
				to supply all the rules for using, say, verb tenses in English 
				so any rule which is presented to learners has to be no more 
				than an approximation.<br />
				The situation is a bit like this:<br />
				<img alt="rules" height="349" src="../../imagesgraphics/rules.png" width="465" /><br />
				and nobody yet knows the TRUTH, however sure of themselves they 
				sound.</dd>

			<p>At the heart of all theories of SLA lie considerations of what

					<h3>Behaviourism</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It is well attested that one can teach rats (and all sorts of 
			other creatures) by a process of stimulus and reward.&nbsp; Rats, 
			famously, can be taught complex sequences of behaviour such as 
			finding their way through a maze based purely on rewarding, i.e., 
			positively reinforcing, certain behaviours and punishing, i.e., 
			negatively reinforcing, unwanted behaviour.<br />
			The theory relies heavily on work by, <em>inter alia</em>, Skinner 
			(1957: 10) who is often quoted as saying:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">
					<span class="auto-style8"><em>We have no reason to assume 
					... that verbal behaviour differs in any fundamental respect 
					from non-verbal behaviour, or that any new principles must 
					be invoked to account for it.</em></span><span class="auto-style7"><br />
					<span class="auto-style34">(Skinner 
					1957: 10)</span></span></p>
		<p>Behaviourism is the theory of learning that still underlies how you 
		train your dog or drill your learners' pronunciation.&nbsp; It can be 
		visualised like this:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="behaviourism" height="164" src="../../imagesgraphics/behaviourism465.png" width="465" /></p>
		<p>Briefly, and somewhat unscientifically:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The process starts with a stimulus, say, a question from the 
			teacher such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did you go yesterday?<br />
			</em>put to the 
			organism (in this case, a learner of English).&nbsp; The stimulus 
			can elicit a variety of responses but only the 'right' one will be 
			reinforced.</li>
			<li>So, for example, if the organism responds with<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I go to the 
			cinema<br />
			</em>the teacher will negatively reinforce it with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, 
			that's wrong<br />
			</em>or simply not reinforce it by saying nothing.</li>
			<li>If, on the other hand, the organism produces the preferred 
			response:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the cinema<br />
			</em>the teacher will reinforce 
			it with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that's right!<br />
			</em>(preferably in a loud and 
			enthusiastic voice because the strength of the reinforcement is 
			critical in instilling the correct habit).&nbsp; In this case, the 
			reward is the teacher's approval but it could just as well be a 
			chocolate biscuit.&nbsp; The response does not have to be truthful, 
			just well formed.</li>
			<li>Enough Stimulus &gt; Response &gt; Reinforcement cycles will see the 
			habit instilled and the language acquired.</li>
		</ol>
			<p>These are factors internal to the learner but they have 
			significant implications for external factors such as the approach 
			to teaching.&nbsp; It underlies drilling language in the classroom, 
			setting mechanical (and not so mechanical) exercises, exposing 
			learners to patterns of language, repetition of language, the 
			avoidance of error and much else.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Much research in the 1970s and later was focused on a 
			determination to refute a behaviourist view of language learning and 
			acquisition.&nbsp; Three main lines of attack emerged.</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Language use is unpredictable.<br />
				Although it may be the case that turning left and right in a maze in a 
				complex sequence of turns will inevitably lead to a reward, the 
				same cannot be said of language.<br />
				Even a response to something as straightforward as<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Good afternoon!</em></span><br />
				could be a similar greeting or it could be a sheepish 
				acknowledgement that one is very late for a morning lesson.</li>
				<li>Reinforcement is unreliable and variable.<br />
				The people we speak to may respond more positively to the 
				interesting content of an ill-formed sentence than to irrelevant 
				or dull data presented in well-formed language.</li>
				<li>Innovation.&nbsp; Learners, even at early stages, are 
				capable of producing utterances that they have never heard 
				before.&nbsp; If language is a habit structure, acquired by 
				repetition and drilling, they should not be able to do that.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The triumph of a more cognitivist view of language learning led 
			to a number of competing hypotheses concerning how SLA occurs.&nbsp; 
			The initial attempt was to focus on internal factors but they all 
			have significant external implications to do with presumptions 
			concerning how language learning should take place to which we shall 
			come.</p>
			<p>In addition to these basic distinctions, it is now necessary to 
			add several other theories and ideas.&nbsp; Most of these concern 
			theories of first language acquisition and are dealt with in 			
			a little more detail in 			the guide to first- and second-language 
			acquisition, linked below.</p>

					<h3><a name="interlanguage"></a>Error analysis</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The analysis of learners' errors starts with seminal work by Pit 
			Corder (1981) who set out to investigate how the errors that learners make 
			reflect their internal mental processes.<br />
			The key concept is interlanguage.</p>
			<p>Interlanguage can be visualised like this where the learner's 
			current knowledge lies somewhere on a continuum from knowing nothing 
			about the target language to full mastery:</p>
			<p>
		<img alt="interlanguage" height="175" src="../../imagesgraphics/interlanguage350.png" width="350" /></p>
			<p>The diagram oversimplifies and hides some interesting ideas 
			concerning the sources of error and the current state of the 
			learners' knowledge.<br />
			What studies showed was that although <strong>some</strong> errors 
			were the result of applying first-language rules to the target 
			language (which would indicate the transfer of language habits), 
			some errors indicated that learners were 
			<strong>creatively</strong> constructing 
			rules and hypotheses to explain the data to which they were exposed.<br />
			If this is the case, then teaching needs to address the positive 
			role of error, the concept of noticing the difference between one's 
			own output and native-speaker models and the supply of adequately 
			rich linguistic data for the learners' cognitive processes to work 
			on.<br />

			<p>Claims have been made that structural elements of a language are 
			learned or acquired in a sequence which is remarkably stable across learners 
			with a wide range of language and learning backgrounds.&nbsp; Of 
			late, enthusiasm for the idea of a fixed acquisition order has 
			waned although there are some who still hold to 
			it.<br />
			The jury is still out but there is undeniably some evidence that the 
			phenomenon is real.&nbsp; What has become clear is that teaching 
			the target structures for which the learners are ready will be 
			more effective than trying to impose a syllabus to beat the system.</p>

					<h3>Universal Grammar and the Language Acquisition Device</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The essentials of these two ideas are covered in the guide to 
			Chomsky so, in brief:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><strong>Universal Grammar</strong> refers to the idea that all languages 
				exhibit common features which result, some say, from the 
				structure of the human mind.&nbsp; For example, it is averred 
				that all languages have phrase structures in common (i.e., a 
				head and a complement) and that all languages share other 
				characteristics including major word and phrase classes.&nbsp; 
				It is, indeed, difficult to imagine a language which did not use 
				noun phrases, subjects, prepositional phrases (or at least some 
				way of connecting verbs to nouns) and so on.<br />
				Unfortunately, there is evidence that there are languages which 
				manage to do without what are considered major word and phrase 
				types in English and many language have word classes unknown in 
				Indo-European languages.</li>
				<li>The concept of a <strong>Language Acquisition Device</strong> springs from 
				the observation that children acquire language very efficiently 
				and very quickly even in circumstances in which there is quite 
				poor information for them to work on.&nbsp; The assumption 
				follows that the human brain is hard-wired to learn language and 
				that the process starts at birth or, some say, even before 
				birth.&nbsp; What this means in practice is that, before we even leave the womb, our 
			brains are prepared for the kinds of phrase structures and 
				grammatical rules we will need to process the language we hear.<br />
				Some have compared this to a kind of internal switchboard with 
				which we can categorise input making guesses and assumptions.<br />
				The key question for language teachers is whether, after a 
				certain age, we retain any access to the device which helped us 
				learn our first language.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For more on these twin concepts, see the guide to Chomsky, linked 
			below.</p>

					<td class="auto-style21"><h3><a name="active"></a>Active Construction of Grammar 
					and Connectionist Theory</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Because it may be the case that both these mechanisms are 
			functioning 
			simultaneously, we'll consider them together.</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><strong>Active Construction of Grammar</strong> is a 
				cognitive theory of language acquisition which rests on the 
				assertion that learners of both first and second languages are 
				actively hypothesising what its rules are and refining their 
				hypotheses as more data become available.&nbsp; It explains, among 
				much else, the fact that both first and second language learners 
				may apply a newly-acquired rule indiscriminately and, for 
				example, put an <em>-ed</em> ending on all verbs to show past tenses 
				before they refine the hypothesis and link the phenomenon only 
				to regular verbs in English.&nbsp; It will also explain errors 
				such as <br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Do you can come?</em></span><br />
				as evidence that the learner has made a hypothesis that all 
				verbs form questions in this way in English.<br />
				Only later will the learner reconstruct the hypothesis to 
				exclude modal auxiliary verbs from the scheme.<br />
				The phenomenon exemplified here is known as the <strong>U-shaped 
				learning curve</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Connectionist Theory</strong> is not dissimilar but 
				it explains a problem that has been identified with the theory 
				of Active Construction of Grammar.<br />
				The problem is this:<br />
				When children are asked to make past tenses or plurals from 
				nonsense words which resemble real but irregular forms, they do 
				not apply the grammar rules but respond in terms of statistical 
				likelihood.<br />
				For example (from Bergman <em>et al </em>(2007)), when asked to form 
			the past tense of <em>fring</em>, many children will suggest <em>

			It has been suggested that humans make neural connections in

			<p>It is clear as far as teaching the language is concerned that for

			</table>
			<p>It has sometimes been a criticism levelled at a communicative 
			approaches to language teaching that while the approach has a well 
			worked out theory of language, it is less certain about a theory of 
			learning.&nbsp; Enter social constructivism to the rescue.</p>
			<p>Briefly, the theory states that learning is constructed by the 
			learners.&nbsp; This is usually contrasted in educational theory 
			with what is labelled as a transmission model in which knowledge is 
			handed down from above.<br />
			The criticism of that is, naturally, that social constructivists are 
			setting up an unrealistic 'traditional' model in order to suggest 
			how social constructivism is superior.<br />
			It is, moreover, asserted that learning is primarily a social 
			activity.&nbsp; This means that knowledge and skills are not 
			acquired by individuals operating alone but only through interaction 
			with others.<br />
			This makes the theory a good fit with communicative classroom 
			approaches which forefront real communicative tasks and emphasise 
			interaction with peers and others.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, the theory is somewhat silent concerning the 
			mechanisms through which learning takes place (unlike, e.g., 
			connectionist and active construction theories).&nbsp; It may, 
			therefore, be wise to reserve judgement or, at least, to take the 
			view that while social interaction is undoubtedly a useful and 
			motivating factor in second-language acquisition, it cannot be the 
			whole truth or individual silent learning would be impossible.&nbsp; 
			If you are reading this page alone, is it the case that you are 
			unable to learn from it because you are not interacting with others?</p>
			<p>Such considerations have not stopped some from asserting that 
			social constructivism is <strong>the</strong> way in which learning 
			happens.<br />
			Here's an example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">We believe that learning is best 
			conceptualised through a social constructivist theory of learning.&nbsp; A key tenet of this is the view that learning 
			is constructed by the learner, as opposed to the traditional, 
			“transmission” model of teaching and learning in which knowledge is 
			passed on to students fully formed, ready to be assimilated.&nbsp; 
			Furthermore, learning is primarily a social activity – knowledge and 
			skills are constructed through interaction with others.<br />
			<span class="auto-style41">Harrison, 2019 (Senior Education Manager, 
			Cambridge Assessment English)</span></p>
			<p>We need, however, to maintain a certain objectivity in this 
			regard, too.&nbsp; Constructivism is not a proven fact or even as 
			yet elevated to the status of a theory.&nbsp; It is one of many 
			hypotheses about how language is learned.</p>
			<hr />
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Here's an incomplete summary of four major hypotheses concerning 
			second-language acquisition.&nbsp; It is not meant to show that 
			learners use only one approach.&nbsp; Some may use all four.</p>

			<p>Much of Communicative Language Teaching lays great 
			stress on natural and appropriate language as the target of 
			instruction.<br />
			It follows that in order to be able to acquire pragmatic as well as 
			formal competence in a language, learners need to be exposed to 
			appropriately complex social situations in which the target language 
			is set.<br />
			Similar connectionist and active construction mechanisms may also be 
			at work here as the learners refine their hypotheses about what 
			is socially appropriate to realise a particular language function 
			and what is statistically the most frequent way of doing so.<br />
			Also in play here are motivational issues.&nbsp; Gardner (1985), for 
			example, emphasises the role of learners' attitudes to the culture 
			in which the second language is set.&nbsp; Those who perceive it as 
			high status and desirable will have greater integrative motivation 
			and be more successful in acquiring the language whereas those who 
			remain isolated from the target-language culture, or even 
			indifferent or antagonistic to it, tend to develop 
			only a very basic competence.<br />

			motivation, linked below.</p>

					<img alt="input" height="133" src="../../images/pour_glass_input200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21"><h3>Input</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The behaviourist view of input in the language learning process 
			was that the input had to be very carefully tailored to the 
			learners' current competence and, by a process of repeatedly 
			encountering the data and repeating language in bite-sized doses, learning 
			and competence would follow.&nbsp; This is the underlying theory 
			that gives rise to drilling and very controlled oral and written 
			language practice.<br />
			The approach has been challenged in two ways:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>One of Krashen's 5 famous hypotheses is the Input 
				hypothesis: for optimum effect, the input a learner receives 
				should be<ol >
					<li>comprehensible and</li>
					<li>just above the level of the learner.</li>
				</ol>
				This is sometimes abbreviated to INPUT + 1 or just 
				i + 1.<br />Such input allows the acquisition and learning devices (whatever 
				they are) to operate on sufficiently comprehensible and 
				challenging data.</li>
				<li>Vygotsky and later writers assert the importance of <strong>
				scaffolding</strong>&nbsp; the input to allow learners to achieve more 
				than they could if left to process the data independently.&nbsp; 
				(Vygotsky never used the term scaffolding; it was coined by 
				Bruner in the 1960s.)&nbsp; 
				Vygotsky's contribution concerns the Zone of Proximal 
				Development or ZPD which can be visualised like this:<br />
				<img alt="zpd" height="240" src="../../imagesgraphics/zpd_red_zone310.png" width="310" /><br />
				To the top left, a task is over-challenging and learners will 
				become anxious and be overwhelmed by the data.<br />
				To the bottom right, a task is under-challenging and learners will learn 
				nothing and may become bored and uninterested.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The underlying assumption here is summarised by Waters as:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">... learning occurs when the mind makes 
			connections between what it already knows and new, hitherto unknown 
			items of information<br />
			<span class="auto-style35">(Waters, 2006:319)</span></p>
			<p>In other words, if the level of challenge is correctly set, 
			learning will occur by extension and connection.&nbsp; Stretched too 
			far, learners will fail to see the connections.&nbsp; Challenged too 
			little and learners will not make new connections at all.<br />
			Linked below is a guide to a key set of concepts in this regard: 
			Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives which is an attempt to 
			categorise cognitive challenge on a six-point scale from simple 
			remembering to creating new syntheses.<br />
			There is a guide on this site to scaffolding, the ZPD and 
			Vygotsky, linked below.<br />
			Motivation is also a significant factor and there is a link to a 
			guide to that, in the table below.</p>

			<p>This guide has been a brief one and only covered the salient 
			features of a range of popular answers to the question<br />
			
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do people 
			learn a language?</em></span><br />
			You will have noticed that some theories are presented as 
			take-it-or-leave-it choices but reality is probably a little more 
			complicated.&nbsp; Humans are complex animals with the capacity for 
			complex behaviour and ways of thinking about the world.&nbsp; To 
			aver that all of them learn all facets of all languages in the same 
			way is much more likely to be wrong than right.<br />
			It may turn out to be the case, for example, that we learn grammar 
			in one way, pronunciation in another and lexis in a third way and 
			that has, in fact been suggested.&nbsp; The suggestion, again 
			briefly, is that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We learn grammar by a process of actively constructing and 
				amending hypotheses about the way the language we have 
				encountered works.</li>
				<li>We learn lexis through a process of making connections from 
				the known to the unknown and taking the trouble to see how 
				meaning is used in the language we encounter.</li>
				<li>We learn to pronounce the target phonemes in a language by a 
				process of habituating ourselves to making certain (to us) 
				unusual sounds and imitating what we hear.</li>
				<li>We learn to communicate using appropriate styles and 
				registers in a process of constructing meaning socially with 
				other humans.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If this is the case or even part of it is true, looking for a 
			theory which explains all learning is a doomed undertaking.&nbsp; 
			Worse, it will constrain teachers' behaviours and planning to a 
			degree which will not be helpful to the learners.</p>
