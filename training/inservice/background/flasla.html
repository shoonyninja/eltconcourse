			<h2>What's the relevance of First Language Acquisition to teaching an 
			additional or 
			second language?</h2>
			<p>Good question.&nbsp; There are a number of reasons we should know 
			a little about First Language Acquisition (FLA, in the trade):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It provides a kind of benchmark for theories of Second 
				Language Acquisition (SLA).&nbsp; The theories are parallel in 
				many ways.</li>
				<li>A good deal of methodology in SLA has been premised on the 
				theory that we will acquire a second or additional language in 
				the same way we acquired our first language(s).</li>
				<li>The way the human brain operates in language learning is not 
				radically different (so some theories assert) whether we are 
				learning our first or additional language(s).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>At each stage in what follows, we'll be considering how theories 
			of first language acquisition are relevant to teachers of additional 
			languages.</p>

			<p>You were not born with the ability to speak, ride a bicycle, play 
			the piano, type, play chess, walk or dive for pearls.&nbsp; What 
			concerns us here are the abilities you <strong>naturally develop
			</strong>as opposed to those which you are <strong>taught</strong>.</p>
			<p>Some of this is quite easy.&nbsp; Divide this list into learned 
			(i.e., taught or self-taught) abilities and those which naturally 
			develop in <strong>all</strong> normal children:<br />
			Click on the table when you have done that.</p>

			<p>It is clear that some behaviours, such as the ability to grasp 
			objects or walk are biologically determined because all children, 
			regardless of their culture, learn to do it pretty much at the same 
			stage in their development.&nbsp; For example, most babies learn to 
			sit, then roll over, then crawl and finally walk between the first 9 
			to 12 months of life (some take a bit longer and some skip the 
			crawling bit, preferring a bottom shuffle).&nbsp; None, however, has 
			to be taught the skill.<br />
			Babies in all cultures learn to talk between 18 and 28 months of 
			life.<br />
			Some behaviours are never naturally acquired so if you never learn 
			to ride a bicycle or play a decent game of chess, you will not 
			magically develop the ability to do so, no matter how long you live.</p>
			<p><strong>The question for this guide is whether using language to 
			communicate is in the same category as walking or the same category 
			as playing the piano.<br />
			</strong>This has fairly profound implications but don't expect the 
			definitive answer here.</p>
			<h3>biologically controlled behaviours</h3>
			<p>Aitchison (1989:67 <em>et seq.</em>), drawing on Lenneberg, suggest there are 6 
			characteristics of biologically determined behaviour.&nbsp; As you 
			look through the list, ask yourself whether speaking meets each of the 
			criteria.<br />

			<h3>the evolution of the ability to process language</h3>
					<p>There is, unsurprisingly, some debate among evolutionary 
					biologists concerning how such a mechanism may have evolved.&nbsp; 
					Recent genetical research is pointing to a set of genes 
					including one called FOXP2 (pictured).</p>
					<p>It would be a gross oversimplification to 
			dub this 'the language gene' as much else, including the 
			interactions between this gene and a range of others, is involved in 
			the ability to process language.&nbsp; However, the gene appears to 
			be central to our ability to process and produce language and people 
			who lack it or in whom it is mutated or inactive cannot handle 
			language.<br />
					Incidentally, this gene has been identified in the 
			DNA extracted from Neanderthal bones (and it also occurs in echolocating bats and songbirds).</p>
					</td>

			</table>
			
			<h3>the U-shaped learning curve</h3>
			<p>This refers to a phenomenon which has been frequently observed 
			and researched.<br />
			English exhibits a number of irregularities in inflexions, notably 
			the changing of the middle vowel or consonant to make a past tense form (as in
			<em>make-made, buy-bought </em>rather than <em>*maked, buyed</em> 
			etc.) and in irregular 
			plurals (such as <em>child-children, mouse-mice </em>etc.)<em><br />
			</em>Children often acquire the irregular form and then revert to an 
			inaccurate regular form before once more acquiring the irregular 
			form.&nbsp; So, for example, a child may produce <em>The mice ran up 
			the clock</em>, then begin to say <em>The mouses runned up the clock</em> 
			before settling on the correct version later.<br />
			If this is true, the importance is obvious: it means that language 
			cannot be being acquired by simple imitation and practice.&nbsp; If 
			it were, children would never produce something like *<em>comed</em> 
			instead of <em>came</em> for the simple reason that they would never 
			hear it.&nbsp; In other words:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>There is not a shred of evidence 
			supporting a view that progress towards adult norms of grammar 
			arises merely from practice in overt imitation of adult sentences.</em></span><br />
			<span class="auto-style56">Ervin, (1964:172) cited in Aitchison 
			(1989:74)</span></p>
			<h3>issues</h3>
				<p>Firstly, while there is strong evidence that some 
				language-learning ability is innate, a good deal of the theory 
				has been based on just one language, English.&nbsp; From that, 
				theorists of universal grammar have averred that the essential 
				building blocks of language structure are common across all 
				languages and that these items are what the language acquisition 
				device is aimed at: noun phrases, verb phrases, adjective 
				phrases and so on.<br />
				This ignores the enormous diversity of structural phenomena 
				across the range of some 6000 to 7000 languages on earth, many 
				of which are poorly if at all described.&nbsp; Some, it has been 
				persuasively demonstrated, get along quite happily without 
				adjective or adverb phrases at all, for example, choosing to 
				inflect the noun phrases or verb phrases instead.</p>
				<p>Secondly, innateness theories fail, it has been argued, to 
				explain the great differences between spoken and written 
				language.&nbsp; If we are genetically programmed to learn 
				language, whence come these differences?</p>
				<p>Thirdly, innateness theories have been criticised as greatly 
				underestimating the effects of culture and community on the 
				language-learning process.&nbsp; In many languages, males and 
				females speak differently and employ different grammatical 
				structures and in some children's language is substantially 
				different from the language of adults.&nbsp; It is difficult to 
				account for these differences on the basis of inheritance of 
				language-learning abilities or pre-programming for language at 
				all.</p>
				<h3>relevance to (English) language teaching</h3>
			<p>There are a number of implications for ELT professionals, of 
			course.&nbsp; They come down to the assertion that we should not 
			assume that a second or subsequent language can be acquired using 
			wholly different mental processes from the ones used to acquire 
			one's first language.&nbsp; It is not, after all, as if human mental 
			processes are fundamentally altered in any way as we grow up.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>teaching children</strong></dt>
				<dd>If the innateness theories are right, then what is required 
				is simple exposure at the right time to a rich linguistic 
				environment rather than explicit instruction.&nbsp; Instruction 
				may, in fact, be counterproductive.<br />
				Teachers of children should also bear the acquisition order in 
				mind and not expect or try to demand production of certain forms 
				before the child is 'ready' to learn them.<br />
				Practice and correction, too, are pointless.</dd>
				<dt><strong>teaching older children and adults</strong></dt>
				<dd>Again, if the theories are right, especially concerning the 
				critical period hypotheses, then we should not expect adults to 
				acquire language simply by exposure.<br />
				We should also expect them never to acquire wholly native-like 
				production if instruction is carried out after the critical 
				period.&nbsp; There is, indeed, some evidence to suggest that in 
				pronunciation especially, older learners <strong>never</strong> 
				acquire native-like production skills.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The influence of innateness theories is readily seen in some 
			methodological approaches which rely on rich input and exposure to 
			language alongside the abjuring of formal practice and instruction.<br />
			For more in this area, see the guides to
			Krashen and the 
			Natural Approach and Chomsky, both linked below.</p>

				<li>Children's speech is different from adults' speech<br />
				Children do not produce fully formed sentences.&nbsp; The 
				evidence is that they progress from 1-word utterances (acquired 
				around 12 months) to 2-word utterances (around 18 months) and 
				then go on to more complex utterances with longer sentences 
				until they start to make rare or complex constructions around 5 
				years of age.<br />
				Indeed, children will often reduce an adult's statement to comply 
				with their current productive capacity.&nbsp; On hearing, for 
				example, something like <em>The train goes through the tunnel</em> 
				an 18-month-old child might reduce it to <em>Tunnel train</em> 
				and an even younger child might reduce it to one imperfectly 
				formed word such as <em>trai'.</em>&nbsp; Children routinely 
				reduce what they hear to conform to their current Mean Length of 
				Utterance or MLU.</li>
				<li>The U-shaped learning curve<br />
				If imitation were all there was to acquiring language, then the 
				U-shaped curve, going from correct production of irregular forms 
				to overgeneralisation of the rule to recognition of the 
				irregularity (e.g., from <em>went</em> via <em>goed</em> and 
				then back to <em>went</em>) simply would not occur because a 
				child would very rarely, if ever, hear the incorrect form in 
				order to imitate it.&nbsp; Children must, therefore, be actively 
				forming hypotheses about language structure.</li>
				<li>Innovation<br />
				Both children and adults are capable of forming utterances 
				they have never heard.&nbsp; In fact, the number of possible 
				utterances in a language is infinite.&nbsp; A child might, for 
				example, say <em>Cow river fall</em> even though no adult has 
				ever said it to her.&nbsp; Adults, too, produce language never 
				before heard.&nbsp; For more, see the 
				guide to Chomsky, linked below.</li>

			<h3>relevance to (English) language teaching</h3>
			<p>A number of approaches to and techniques in teaching languages 
			appear to be based on the assumption that people learn language by a 
			process of imitation of a model.<br />
			Behaviourist-based approaches in particular, such as Total Physical 
			Response, Situational Language Teaching and audiolingualism 
			emphasise the need for learners to repeat (and be rewarded for) 
			correct models set in a clear context.<br />
			Why do you drill in a classroom if you don't believe imitation and 
			repetition are 
			effective?<br />
			If the aim is to reflect how a person's first language is acquired 
			and Imitation Theory is so flawed, then any methodology based on it 
			will be similarly imperfect.</p>

			<p>The theory claims that children learn to produce correct language

			It has, of course, close connections with Imitation Theory (because

			learning takes place by the alteration of habitual behaviour.&nbsp; Here's a

		<img alt="behaviourism" height="212" src="../../imagesgraphics/behaviourism599.png" width="599" /></p>
		<ol>
			<li>The process starts with a stimulus, say, a question from a carer such as <em>Who 
			did you see?</em> put to the 
			organism (in this case, a child).&nbsp; The stimulus 
			can elicit a variety of responses but only the 'right' one will be 
			reinforced.</li>
			<li>So, for example, if the child responds with <em>I seed Tom</em> the 
			carer will negatively reinforce it with <em>No, 
			say I saw Tom</em>.</li>
			<li>If, eventually, the carer can persuade the child to produce a 
			correct utterance, the response will be rewarded (i.e., reinforced) 
			with something like<em> Oh! That's lovely! </em>and the child will learn the form.</li>
			<li>Enough Stimulus &gt; Response &gt; Reinforcement cycles will see the

				<li>Carers do not focus on form; they focus on content<br />
				For example, if a child produces a well formed but untrue

				statement may receive praise and a correctly formed but untrue 
				statement will receive censure of some kind.</li>

			correct language habits.<br />
			In other words, a teacher wedded to a cognitivist view of learning 
			may be using the praise to motivate while one coming from a 
			behaviourist direction will be using praise to reinforce a response.&nbsp;

			<p>This theory "<span class="style_black"><em>holds that children 
			actually invent the rules of grammar themselves</em></span>"<br />
			<span class="auto-style16">Bergman <em>et al </em>(<em>op cit</em>.:316)</span></p>
			<p>The theory is allied to Innateness theory insofar as the ability to 
			develop rules is presumed innate but the rules themselves will 
			depend on the structure of the language which children hear around 
			them.<br />
			It has been compared to a kind of switchboard effect which operates 
			on the data the child hears.&nbsp; So, for example, a French child 
			will notice that in the language it hears, the adjective normally 
			follows the noun (<em>un évènement fantastique</em>)
			and the switch for noun–adjective ordering will be thrown.&nbsp; A 
			child in an English-speaking environment will hear, by contrast,<em> 
			a fantastic event</em> and throw the switch the other way (for an 
			adjective–noun language).&nbsp; Enough exposure will result in the 
			switch becoming permanently fixed but French and English children 
			will still have to be aware of the restriction to the rule in order 
			to be able to produce <em>un petit problème</em> and <em>the people 
			responsible</em> correctly.<br />
			Such hypothesising about language form neatly explains the U-shaped 
			learning curve described in this guide.&nbsp; When first acquired, 
			the rule is applied indiscriminately and then it is later amended to 
			account for exceptions.</p>
				<h3>issues</h3>
				<p>The theory, of course, depends on the assumption that small 
				children have well developed cognitive abilities and that is by 
				no means demonstrated by a number of studies.&nbsp; For example, 
				the ability to recognise that the length of an object is not 
				dependent on its position or that the volume of a container is 
				unaffected by its shape are not shown by very young children 
				(and indeed by all adults).<br />
				The fact, too, that all children seem to develop language in 
				more or less the same stages at the same ages would lead one to 
				believe that all children everywhere and in all environments 
				have <strong>exactly</strong> the same cognitive ability to form 
				and amend hypotheses about language as they hear it spoken 
				around them.&nbsp; That is not borne out by the data.</p>
			<h3>relevance to (English) language teaching</h3>
			<p>If learners (of whatever age) of a second or subsequent language 
			are applying this kind of cognitive rule-forming behaviour to the 
			language they encounter then concepts such as noticing and the 
			positive role of error in the refinement of language theory in the 
			minds of learners become even more important.&nbsp; See the guides to
			noticing and to
			error, both linked below in the table of related guides, for more.</p>

			<p>We'll take a problem for the Active Construction of Grammar 
			Theory as the starting point.&nbsp; That theory explains the 
			production of false items such as <em>feets,</em> <em>He showeds me</em> 
			or <em>mouses</em> as evidence that learner is making 
			overgeneralisations from rules imperfectly acquired in terms of 
			their restrictions.<br />
			Anecdotally, you may be able to think of the same phenomenon 
			occurring with learners of English as an additional or second 
			language.<br />
			However, when children are asked to make past tenses or plurals from 
			nonsense words which resemble real but irregular forms, they do not, 
			apparently, apply the grammar rules but respond in terms of 
			statistical likelihood!<br />
			For example (again, from Bergman <em>et al</em>), when asked to form 
			the past tense of <em>fring</em>, many children will suggest <em>
			frang </em>or<em> frought</em> (by analogy with <em>ring</em> and
			<em>bring</em> etc. respectively) rather than the structurally 
			predictable <em>fringed</em>.<br />
			Hence, too, one might encounter a suggestion that the plural of <em>
			frouse</em> would (or might well) be <em>frice</em> not <em>frouses
			</em>and it is true 
			that many native speakers of English will prefer <em>handkerchieves</em> 
			as the plural of <em>handkerchief</em> by analogy with <em>
			wolf-wolves</em> etc. and the status of <em>roof-roofs/rooves</em> 
			is unclear.<br />
			It has been suggested here that humans make neural connections in 
			the brain based on the <strong>frequency</strong> of what they hear rather than 
			making rules based on the <strong>structure</strong> of what they hear.</p>
			<h3>statistical reasoning<br />
			<img alt="horses" height="133" src="../../images/six_horses200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>Another way to explain this process is to rely on inferencing (to 
			which there is a dedicated guide on this site, linked below).&nbsp; 
			It works like this:</p>
			<p>If you are presented with the names of six horses in a race and 
			no other data at all, you would be correct in thinking that your 
			chances of backing the winner are 6:1 against, i.e., a roughly 
			16.67% chance that you would win.<br />
			However, if you are also told that of the six horses only number 5 
			has ever won a race before against similar opposition and that all 
			the others have finished last or second to last in their previous 3 
			races, you might adjust your expectation of which horse will win 
			based not on intuition or guesswork but on the statistical 
			probabilities the new data have supplied.<br />
			The theory is that human learning happens like that.</p>
			<p>Now take the situation in which you are faced with trying to 
			decide what form of a verb will follow the verb <em>arrange</em> in 
			a sentence such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arranged __________ tomorrow</em><br />
			and the choices are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; went</em><br />
			All things being equal, you might think that you have a one-in-six 
			chance of hitting on the right form.&nbsp; However, all things are 
			not equal because you already know that the following sentences are 
			correctly formed:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agreed to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember going<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall going<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoyed going</em><br />
			The reasoning (which is mostly unconscious) goes like this:</p>
			<ol class="style_black">
				<li>In all the correct forms I know, none takes the bare 
				infinitive, the present with -<em>s, </em>the<em> will </em>+ 
				infinitive structure or the past tense so I can dismiss all 
				those for the moment.</li>
				<li>I now have a choice between <em>to go</em> or <em>going</em> 
				as the correct form.&nbsp; Shall I toss a coin to decide?</li>
				<li>No.&nbsp; I also know that all the forms with -<em>ing</em> 
				that I know are correct are concerned with the past so <em>going</em> 
				comes <strong>before</strong> the <em>remembering, recalling</em> 
				and <em>enjoying</em>.</li>
				<li>However, I can also see that the forms I know that are 
				correctly formed with a <em>to-</em>infinitive work the opposite 
				way around so the <em>hoping, agreeing, asking</em> and <em>
				deciding</em> all come <strong>before</strong> the next action.</li>
				<li>Statistically, therefore, I will select:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arranged to go tomorrow</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>and you'll be right, of course.<br />
			What you have done is apply probabilistic reasoning based on 
			your other knowledge of the language and assumed that, statistically 
			speaking, you'll be right to bet on the favourite.<br />
			Just as in horse races, of course, this will not always result in a 
			win (or bookmakers would all be out of business).&nbsp; If you apply 
			the same process to a sentences such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look forward ____________ tomorrow</em><br />
			you will not get the right answer.&nbsp; An outsider has won the 
			race, in this case.</p>
			<p>Dennett, 2017:269, puts it this way:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">... the brain's strategy is continuously to create "forward 
			models," or probabilistic anticipations, and use the incoming 
			signals to to prune them for accuracy &ndash; if needed.&nbsp; When 
			the organism is on a roll, in deeply familiar territory, the inbound 
			corrections diminish to a trickle and the brain's guesses, 
			unchallenged, give it a head start on what to do next.</p>
			<p>What we do next, of course, is understand and, if necessary, act 
			on the linguistic data we are receiving.</p>
			<p>It may also be the case that both Connectionist and Active 
			Construction of Grammar strategies are being deployed 
			simultaneously.</p>
				<h3>issues</h3>
				<p>There are those who consider that the connectionist view of 
				language acquisition adds nothing substantial to the theory of 
				active construction of grammar.&nbsp; What it does is add 
				another layer of cognitive processing and there is nothing 
				within active construction theory that denies that.<br />
				The fact that all languages contain many examples of 
				non-intuitive and exceptional structures also presents problems 
				for the theory.&nbsp; We might assume, following the statistical 
				analogy approach, that all of the following are, for example, 
				allowable but children rarely, if ever, produce such forms.&nbsp; 
				If the brain is indeed forward modelling from data it already 
				has, why is that?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>unsage</em> (by analogy with <em>unwise</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I look forward to see you</em> (by analogy with <em>I 
				want to see you</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I concealed behind the door</em> (by analogy with <em>I 
				hid behind the door</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I suggested to go out</em> (by analogy with <em>I 
				expected to go out)</em><br />
				However, the fact that adult learners do produce such forms 
				consistently provides some evidence that the connectionist view 
				has more relevance to the teaching of languages to adults and 
				the existence of analogy errors has long been accepted.</p>
			<h3>relevance to (English) language teaching</h3>
			<p>If the two approaches are being combined, in fact, by mature 
			learners as well as children, there are some implications especially 
			for how language is presented and which language is selected for 
			presentation.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Connectionist theories clearly have a good fit with 
				approaches such as The Lexical Approach and focuses on 
				collocation and colligation.&nbsp; If it is true that learners 
				(of whatever age) are applying some kind of statistical analysis 
				to the language data they are exposed to, then it makes sense to 
				design materials which contain statistically likely rather than 
				unlikely combinations of words and structures.</li>
				<li>Chunking of language, too, is important because chunks such 
				as <em>air conditioning + unit, steering + committee / wheel</em> 
				etc. lend themselves to the formation of neural pathways in the 
				brain.</li>
				<li>Getting learners to notice connections in terms of 
				colligation will also be effective if connectionist theories 
				hold water.&nbsp; The acquisition of, e.g., <em>I allowed him to go,
				Mary permitted him to come,
				I forbade him to speak</em> etc. will be facilitated if they are 
				presented together and frequently encountered but presenting 
				them alongside <em>I made him go, I let him speak</em> etc. will 
				be positively counterproductive.&nbsp; The same consideration 
				would apply to all compare-and-contrast rather than 
				notice-the-similarity approaches.</li>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This theory places great emphasis on the kinds of social 
			interaction in which people encounter language.&nbsp; The argument 
			is that it may be combined with both Connectionist and Active 
			Construction of Grammar theories to explain how the richness, or 
			otherwise, of the data the learners encounter will be exploited.<br />
			It seeks also to explain how it is that children slowly develop the 
			ability not only to use language accurately but also appropriately.<br />
			Theoreticians in this area focus a good deal of attention on what is 
			called child-directed speech.&nbsp; Such speech tends to be 
			delivered with excessive intonation range and pitch and to be 
			simplified and repeated for comprehension.&nbsp; From it, the child 
			learns to de-code its meaning before going on to be able to 
			comprehend and produce more complex and appropriate adult-to-adult 
			language.</p>
				<h3>issues</h3>
				<p>While interesting, there is little actual evidence that the 
				theory is sustainable.&nbsp; Intuitively, one might consider 
				that social interaction is vital for the development of 
				appropriate language use but that can also be explained by the 
				direct correction of children by adults when they produce 
				inappropriate language and by imitation theory.<br />
				That exposure to language in use is required for language 
				acquisition has never been in doubt.&nbsp; What role the nature 
				of the interactions between children and carers plays in the 
				acquisition of language is.</p>
			<h3>relevance to (English) language teaching</h3>
				<p>In terms of second-language acquisition, the theory states 
				that learning is constructed by the learners.&nbsp; This is 
				usually contrasted in educational theory with what is labelled 
				as a transmission model in which knowledge is handed down from 
				above.<br />
				The criticism of that is, naturally, that social constructivists 
				are setting up an unrealistic 'traditional' model in order to 
				suggest how social constructivism is superior.<br />
				It is, moreover, asserted that learning is primarily a social 
				activity.&nbsp; This means that knowledge and skills are not 
				acquired by individuals operating alone but only through 
				interaction with others.<br />
				This makes the theory a good fit with communicative classroom 
				approaches which forefront real communicative tasks and 
				emphasise interaction with peers and others.</p>
			<p>Clearly, much of Communicative Language Teaching lays great 
			stress on natural and appropriate language as the target of 
			instruction and this theory sits well with such an approach.&nbsp; 
			The procedure of introducing simplified language and then refining 
			it for appropriate and accurate communicative effect lies at the 
			heart of such an approach.</p>
				<p>It has sometimes been a criticism levelled at a communicative 
				approaches to language teaching that while the approach has a 
				well worked out theory of language, it is less certain about a 
				theory of learning.&nbsp; Enter social constructivism to the 
				rescue.<br />
				Unfortunately, the theory is somewhat silent concerning the 
				mechanisms through which learning takes place (unlike, e.g., 
				connectionist and active construction theories).&nbsp; It may, 
				therefore, be wise to reserve judgement or, at least, to take 
				the view that while social interaction is undoubtedly a useful 
				and motivating factor in second-language acquisition, it cannot 
				be the whole truth or individual silent learning would be 
				impossible.&nbsp; If you are reading this page alone, is it the 
				case that you are unable to learn from it because you are not 
				interacting with others?</p>

			</table>
			<p>Well, it depends on the theory you accept, doesn't it?</p>
			<p>It seems clear that concepts such as critical period only apply 
			to children (and the evidence is there to suggest that adult 
			learners have far more trouble learning an additional language than 
			children do).&nbsp; Methodologies which purport, therefore, to be 
			based on how a child learns and that such an approach is applicable 
			to adults and more mature children should be handled with care and 
			some scepticism because there is evidence that children and adults 
			learn differently, not least because of their very different 
			experiential backgrounds and because all normal adults have already 
			acquired a perfect knowledge of their own language.</p>
			<p>Other theories, such as Imitation and Reinforcement theories (the 
			basis of drilling and repetition and much else) as well as Active 
			Construction of Grammar, Connectionism and Social Interaction theory 
			may be just as applicable to mature learners of an additional 
			language as they are to immature learners of first languages.<br />
			The argument here is that we do not abandon or lose access to our 
			cognitive abilities as we mature.&nbsp; We may use the abilities 
			differently, some might argue more effectively, as adults.<br />
			If so, there are obvious consequences for the design of materials,
