				The history of English Language Teaching is often presented from

				more recent approaches to teaching the language were or are 
				somehow superior to what had or has gone before.<br />
				A more sensible approach is to try to see the development of ELT

				development 
				from methodology to methodology with a good deal of overlap when 
				one compares, in particular, the design of teaching materials.</p>

			</table>
			<p>There are two common ways to define methodology in English 
			Language Teaching and, graphically, this is how they look:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="methodologies" src="../../imagesgraphics/methodologies.png" height="294" width="310" /></p>
			<p>The left-hand set was developed by Anthony in 1963.&nbsp; The 
			right-hand set was developed from Anthony's definition later and 
			appears in Richards and Rogers, 2001.&nbsp; Briefly:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Approach</strong></dt>
				<dd>For Anthony, an approach was simply a 
				set of principles or ideas about the nature of language learning<br />
				For Richards and Rogers it was similar but explicitly divided 
				into theories of what language is and theories of how learning a 
				foreign language happens.<br />
				The second of these definitions has the advantage of being quite 
				explicit.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Method or Design</strong></dt>
				<dd>For Anthony, method described the plan for the presentation 
				of language which is consistent with the approach.<br />
				Richards and Rogers' concept of design is somewhat broader and 
				covers the practical implications in the classroom: syllabus 
				design, activities and the roles of teachers and students<br />
				These are not all that different but again, the latter one is 
				more explicit.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Technique or Procedure</strong></dt>
				<dd>Technique, for Anthony, was simple any teaching trick or way 
				of doing something in the classroom such as eliciting, 
				approaching a reading text, encouraging authentic speaking, 
				drilling and so on.<br />
				For Richards and Rogers, too, the term procedure refers to what 
				we see happening in the classroom when a particular approach and 
				design are implemented, day to day.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>It actually doesn't matter all that much which breakdown you 
			accept.&nbsp; Both are fairly arbitrary and subjective ways of 
			breaking down a complex area.</p>

		<p>The authority in this area is Howatt (1984, revised 2nd edition with 
		Widdowson, 2004 and with Smith, 2014) and he traces the 
		development of English Language Teaching far further back than most 
		people realise it goes.&nbsp; He records the use of dialogues, often parallel 
		translation ones, to <em>demonstrate</em> rather than <em>inform</em>.&nbsp; 
		Here's an example, taken from a set of materials enabling French 
		speakers (probably Huguenots who fled to England from France in the late 17th and 
		early 18th centuries) to compare the English way of expressing things 
		with their own language.<br />
		It is from Guy Miège (1685), <em>Nouvelle méthode pour apprendre 
		l'Anglais</em>.&nbsp; It could just as well be used by an English 
		speaker to learn French.</p>

		<p>And so on.&nbsp; This is not too far removed from many modern course 
		materials which, without the translation in many cases, set a 
		conversation in a common environment to allow the language to be 
		demonstrated in action.&nbsp; Truly, 'tis a mighty convenient way to 
		present language for analysis.<br />
		There were, of course, many other attempts to help people learn foreign 
		languages but they have little in common and do not consistently draw on 
		any theories of learning or of language itself.</p>

			<p>The 19th century saw the first fundamental change.&nbsp; The 
			importance given to the study of Latin and Greek as a way of 
			accessing ancient literature bled over into the teaching of modern 
			languages, too.&nbsp; The approach had (and, indeed, still has) five main 
			strains:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>Conscious memorising of grammatical rules</li>
				<li>Focus on the sentence as the unit of study</li>
				<li>Conscious memorising of lists of lexis with their 
				mother-tongue translations</li>
				<li>Translating in and out of the target language as practice</li>
				<li>Reading the literature of the target language</li>
			</ul>
				<p>Additionally, there was a focus on memorising tedious lists 
				of exceptions to the rules.</p>
			<p>We should be careful not to ascribe the approach only to the 
			teaching of English.&nbsp; It was the way in which the teaching of 
			any language was intended to be implemented and English was, at the 
			time, not particularly widely taught or used as a <em>lingua franca</em> 
			as it was in later centuries.<br />
			It is worth noting that in the early 19th century, the population of 
			France exceeded that of the USA and Britain combined and it was 
			French that dominated as the natural language of communication 
			between people with different first languages.&nbsp; (The term <em>
			lingua franca</em> translates from Latin as <em>the language of the 
			French</em>, of course.)</p>
			<p>The aim 
					of the approach was primarily to allow the student 
					access to the literature of the target language.&nbsp; Few 
					except portions of the elite travelled widely and there was little need or 
					opportunity to encounter native speakers or to communicate 
					in the way that, e.g., Huguenot immigrants needed to find 
					the cheapest coffee shops with free tobacco.<br />
			Increasingly, however, with the rise of an affluent class of people 
			able to travel to foreign parts the realisation was dawning that 
			some learners did indeed need language to communicate and within a 
			grammar-translation approach innovative teachers were supplying some 
			communicative practice, albeit in an unstructured and inconsistent 
			way.<br />
			The custom for the elite and wealthy of taking The Grand Tour (a 
			kind of travelling finishing school for the sons of the 
			aristocracy) added somewhat to the pressure for an education in 
			modern languages which would allow for a modicum of oral 
			communicative competence, taking in, as it usually did, a journey 
			across France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and often to Greece and 
			even Turkey.</p>
			<p>The term Grammar Translation to describe the approach was not, in 
			fact, coined until the 20th century although the method itself was 
			recognised and sometimes described as The Classical Method implying 
			that it sought to treat the teaching of any modern language in the 
			same way that the teaching of Ancient Greek and Latin was conducted.&nbsp; 
			In Palmer's words, cited in Howatt and Smith (2014: 81):</p>
			<p class="indentpara">'The Classical Method' treats all languages as 
			if they were dead</p>
				
				<p>Grammar translation is not, as some fondly imagine, itself 
				dead.&nbsp; Its influence is widely felt.&nbsp; Many 
				self-help teaching manuals (such as the earlier versions of the 
				popular <em>Teach Yourself ...</em> series of books) involve the setting 
				out of grammar rules, followed by a list of translated lexis to 
				learn and then exercises (including translation) to practise 
				what has been studied.&nbsp; Secondary (and even primary) 
				schools around the world adopt the approach consistently and it 
				may have been part of your learning experience.<br />
				(Since 2012 the Teach Yourself series has abandoned 
				the presentation of rules in favour of a so-called 'discovery 
				method' which encourages the learner to figure out the rules 
				from the examples.&nbsp; More later on the difference in these 
				approaches to rule-learning.)</p>
			<p>Taking an historical rather than methodological perspective, we 
			can refer to this era in ELT as <em>The Classical Period</em> which 
			Howatt and Smith (2014:78) date from 1750 to around 1880.</p>

			<p>Historically rather than methodologically, The Reform Period 
			dates from around 1880 to 1920.</p>
			<p>Starting in the 19th century and continuing to the present, the 
		grammar-translation approach has been criticised primarily because it 
		focuses on form at the expense of meaning and communicative ability.&nbsp; 
		Many early critics and reformers drew on analogies with how we learn our first 
		language.&nbsp; By the end of the century, the Reform Movement's 
		fundamental principles had been established by Henry Sweet (1845-1912) as:<span class="auto-style8"></span></p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>the primacy of speech, the centrality of 
		the connected text as the kernel of the teaching-learning process, and 
		the absolute priority of an oral methodology in the classroom<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style32">In Howatt, op cit.: 171</span></p>
			<p>The central concern, then, of the reformers was to focus on the 
			spoken language rather than on the literature of the target language 
			culture.&nbsp; Pronunciation was also forefronted: Sweet was an 
			accomplished phonetician.</p>
			<p>Methods arising from the Reform Movement include a very wide 
			range of inventions (some patented), the 
			first two of which are still 
		influential:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The Natural Method which sought to emulate the ways in which 
			children learn their first language.&nbsp; Unfortunately, at the 
			time there was very little knowledge about how children acquire 
			their first languages so much was based on simple intuitions and on 
			the assumption that children learn by imitation of adults.</li>
			<li>The Direct Method which arose from it and was popularised by 
			Maximilian Berlitz (1852-1921) and still in use in many schools.&nbsp; The 
			Berlitz Method is now a registered trade mark.&nbsp; The Direct 
			Method was so called because it insists that only the target 
			language is used from day one of the course and meaning is conveyed 
			by pointing, gestures, tone of voice etc.&nbsp; Of course, today, 
			many methods take a similar approach, denigrating or forbidding the 
			use of translation.</li>
			<li>The Gouin Series teaching, developed by François Gouin 
			(1831-1896), is one in which language is presented as a series of 
			logically sequential steps in undertaking everyday activities.&nbsp; 
			Gouin theorised that his failure to learn German by memorising lists 
			of vocabulary and grammatical rules stemmed from the fact that the 
			language items he was attempting to learn were unconnected.&nbsp; In 
			this approach, the teacher presents a series of actions accompanied 
			by mime and images if necessary and the learners repeat the actions.&nbsp; 
			For example, at the end of a lesson:<p class="auto-style34"><em>I gather up my books and 
			papers, I put them in my bag, I stand up and walk to the door, I 
			open the door, I turn to say goodbye to my classmates, I go through 
			the door, I go down the stairs, I leave the building.</em></p>
			The method has a good deal in common with later approaches such 
			as Situational Language Teaching and Total Physical Response (the 
			latter because in some versions of the Gouin Series approach, 
			learners are encouraged to mime the actions, too).<br />
			The key principles of the Series Method as it came to be known are:<ol class="auto-style15">
				<li>We learn language by turning perceptions in conceptions.&nbsp; 
				When we see an object or observe and action, we can associate 
				the language for it with the perception of it (anticipating a 
				situational approach to language teaching).</li>
				<li>We do not acquire language by learning isolated elements of 
				it but in whole, meaningful chunks (anticipating, to some 
				extent, a lexical approach).</li>
				<li>The verb is the most meaningful language item (anticipating 
				Halliday and functional linguistics).</li>
				<li>It is easier to learn language if it is placed in a logical 
				order of events (anticipating Total Physical Response).</li>
				<li>Grammar is important but need not be explicitly taught 
				(anticipating Krashen's learning-acquisition hypothesis).</li>

				from around 1920 to 1970) as The Scientific Period because the 
				approach to teaching sought to utilise insights from linguistics 
				and psychology in particular.&nbsp; Both the content of teaching 
				and the approach taken in the classroom were, it was often 
				claimed, based on science rather than intuition.<br />
				In 1924, Palmer (1924: 2) published an important work which 
				sought to place</p>
			<p class="indentpara">linguistic pedagogy once and for all on a 
			truly scientific basis</p>
			<p>Early in the 20th century, there arose 
				in the UK an approach to teaching which relied on two 
				principles:</p>
				<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>
					<p class="auto-style13">That language should be taught and 
					presented in a social context: a situation.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p class="auto-style12">That the focus of the syllabus 
					should be on word order, inflexion and the distinction between 
					structural words and content words.&nbsp; (For more on this 
					distinction, see
					the 
					guide to function words on this site, linked below.)</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The outcome of this, which came to be called The Situational 
				Approach, was productive and 
				many teaching materials still rely heavily on 
				presenting language, often via dialogues, in settings such as 
				<em>at 
				the coffee shop</em> or <em>in the station</em> etc.&nbsp; You are probably 
				familiar with some of them.<br />
				As two of the founders of the approach state:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em><span class="style_black">The language a person originates ... is always expressed for a 
				purpose.</span><br />
				</em><span class="auto-style32">Frisby and Halliday in Richards and 
				Rogers (2014: 48)</span></p>
			<p>From this approach, incidentally, arose the prescription of a 
			Presentation&ndash;Practice&ndash;Production structure to a language 
			lesson and that is one which is frequently followed by teachers who 
			would not fall into the camp of Situational Language Learning but 
			who nevertheless find the procedure a helpful and accessible 
			approach to lesson design.</p>
			<p>The Situational Approach's view about how languages are learned rested on 
				the same basis as the audio-lingual approach (see below).</p>
			<p>There were other scientific methods developed in the same period 
			including The Multiple Line of Approach (Palmer in Japan) and The Oral 
			Approach (Fries in the USA) which had similar ambitions in terms of science and similar 
			prescriptions for teaching.</p>

		<p>In 1942, the USA found itself in urgent need of a large number of

		<p class="auto-style14">In order for a methodology to be truly recognisable 
		as such, it is arguable that it needs to have a consistent theoretical 
		basis.&nbsp; Audio-lingualism's claim to have these rests on:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>A theory of language</strong>: structural 
					linguistics<br />
					Simply put, this is the theory that language is primarily 
					spoken and understandable in terms of increasing level of 
					complexity: from phonemes, up through morphemes to words, 
					phrases, clauses and sentences.&nbsp; The theory is 
					sometimes referred to as Immediate Constituent analysis by 
					which is meant, for example, that the immediate constituents 
					of morphemes are phonemes, of lexemes, morphemes, of 
					phrases, lexemes, of clauses, phrases and so on.<br />
					To this day, the 
					theory underlies most structural syllabuses.&nbsp; (For 
					more, see the guide to 
					syllabus design, linked below, and for an overview of how it works, see
					the guide to Chomsky 
					in which it is explained in order to be criticised.)</li>
					<li>
					<strong>A theory of learning</strong>: behavioural 
					psychology<br />
					Behaviourism rests on the belief, reinforced by laboratory 
					experiments on animals, that learning constitutes the 
					acquisition of new habits.&nbsp; This theory was made 
					explicitly relevant to language learning in Skinner's famous 
					statement that:<br />
					<p class="auto-style46"><span class="auto-style8"><em>We have no reason to assume 
					... that verbal behaviour differs in any fundamental respect 
					from non-verbal behaviour, or that any new principles must 
					be invoked to account for it.<br />
					</em></span><span class="auto-style32">Skinner 
					(1957: 10)</span></p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Behaviourism is the theory of learning that still underlies how you 
		train your dog or drill your learners' pronunciation.&nbsp; It can be 
		visualised like this:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="behaviourism" height="164" src="../../imagesgraphics/behaviourism465.png" width="465" /></p>
		<p>Briefly, and somewhat unscientifically:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The process starts with a stimulus, say, a question from the 
			teacher such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did you go yesterday?<br />
			</em>put to the 
			organism (in this case, a learner of English).&nbsp; The stimulus 
			can elicit a variety of responses but only the 'right' one will be 
			reinforced.</li>
			<li>So, for example, if the organism responds with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go to the 
			cinema<br />
			</em>the teacher will negatively reinforce it with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, 
			that's wrong<br />
			</em>or simply not reinforce it by saying nothing.<br />
			A negative reinforcement is not, of course, necessarily a 
			punishment.&nbsp; It can consist of no response at all or of the 
			removal of something unpleasant.&nbsp; The reason your car forces you to 
			wear a seatbelt by producing an irritating noise if you don't, is 
			that the 
			manufacturers of the system were relying on the removal of something 
			unpleasant to inculcate good habits in the user.</li>
			<li>If, on the other hand, the organism produces the preferred 
			response:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the cinema<br />
			</em>the teacher will reinforce 
			it with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that's right!<br />
			</em>(preferably in a loud and 
			enthusiastic voice because the strength of the reinforcement is 
			critical in instilling the correct habit).&nbsp; In this case, the 
			reward is the teacher's approval but it could just as well be a 
			chocolate biscuit.</li>
			<li>Enough Stimulus &gt; Response &gt; Reinforcement cycles will see the 
			habit instilled and the language acquired.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Here is an example of what is meant by verbal behaviour being 
		conditioned by stimulus-response cycles, taken from Skinner (<em>op cit</em>.) and 
		used by Koestler (1964 and elsewhere) in a cogent and entertaining 
		demolition of operant conditioning in humans:</p>
			<p class="auto-style40">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HE: What time is it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SHE: Twelve o'clock.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HE: Thank you.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SHE: Don't mention it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HE: What about lunch?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SHE: Fine.<br />
			Now, this conversation can be analysed into separate S-R units.</p>
			<ul class="auto-style39">
				<li>
				HE makes the first response which is 
				emitted probably to the stimulus of the sight of SHE.
				</li>
				<li>
				When HE emits the operant, What time is it?, the muscular 
				activity, of course, produces the sound, which also acts as a 
				stimulus for SHE.</li>
				<li>
				On the receipt of this stimulus, SHE emits an operant herself: 
				Twelve o'clock., which in turn produces a stimulant to HE. And 
				so on.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>What happens when SHE responds to HE the first time with:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Oh dear, we're going to be late</em><br />
			is not considered.</p>
			<p>Audio-lingualism is still a very influential approach.&nbsp; It 
		underlies drilling language in the classroom, setting mechanical (and 
		not so mechanical) exercises, exposing learners to patterns of language, 
		repetition of language and much else.&nbsp; The concept that good 
		language habits are born of repeated practice and exposure is by no 
		means unknown in almost all classrooms.<br />
		The idea that learners can figure out rules unconsciously for 
		themselves, given enough data to work on and exposure to language 
		samples that exemplify the rule we would like them to acquire, underlies 
		much of modern inductive learning approaches in the classroom.&nbsp; 
		More on the meaning of 'inductive' follows.</p>
			<p>At the same time, in France, a method for teaching French arose 
			called the Audio-Visual Method which incorporated film strips into 
			language laboratory exercises.<br />
			The language laboratory itself was the outcome of enhanced interest 
			in scientific approaches to language teaching and its very name 
			epitomises the new focus on science and technology to overcome the 
			difficulties of learning a foreign language.</p>
			<p>We now need to 
		consider the criticisms which have been levelled at structuralism and behaviourism.&nbsp; 
			Unsurprisingly, this approach to language learning (or any 
			understanding of behaviour in humans) has not been without its 
			critics.<br />
		The most serious critic of behaviourist approaches to language learning 
		remains Chomsky and it is to him we turn next.</p>

				<p>There is a guide concerned only with Chomsky's theories which 
				is linked in the list at the end.<br />
				Noam Chomsky, an American linguist, is probably most famous 
				in language teaching for his work on transformational generative 
				grammar but it is his aversion to behaviourist learning theories 
				and structural linguistics which concerns us here.<br />
				He is famously cited as asserting:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="auto-style8"><em>Language is not a habit structure.&nbsp; 
				Ordinary linguistic behaviour characteristically involves 
				innovation, formation of new sentences and patterns in 
				accordance with rules of great abstractness and intricacy.<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style32">Chomsky, 2003:349</span></span></p>
			<p>What this means is:</p>
				<ol class="auto-style15">
					<li>structural linguistics is inadequate to describe 
					language and</li>
					<li>behaviourist learning theories are inadequate to 
					describe how language is learned.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>In other words: it's all wrong.</p>
		
		<p>The key <strong>criticisms of behaviourism</strong> are fourfold (and they aren't all Chomsky's 
		alone):</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Unpredictability</strong></dt>
	<dd>How do you know what someone will say when presented with a stimulus?&nbsp; 
	In our example, above, of the teacher eliciting the past tense of the verb 
	<em>go</em>, what happens if the learner (or the organism) produces the perfectly 
	correct:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere I've never been before<br />
	</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What time last night?<br />
	</em>or any 
	other of many thousands of possible responses.</dd>
	
			<dt><strong>Reinforcement</strong></dt>
			<dd>Reinforcement does not occur regularly.&nbsp; Parents and others 
			regularly approve statements that are true (or cute) rather than 
			grammatically accurate.&nbsp; For example, in response to seeing a 
			horse if a child produces<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the big doggy!<br />
			</em>many 
			adults might respond positively because it's a cute and endearing 
			thing to say, albeit wrong.&nbsp; How, then, do children learn to 
			see where the meanings of words start and stop?<br />
			Equally, if a child says<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It a horse!<br />
			</em>in response to a 
			follow-up question, adults might well be tempted to approve because it's right rather than correct the grammar.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Response strength</strong></dt>
			<dd>is variable.&nbsp; We don’t always shout our approval.&nbsp; In 
			fact, it's sometimes more effective to reply in hushed, awe-struck 
			tones.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Innovation</strong></dt>
			<dd>Speakers of all languages consistently produce novel and unique 
			utterances.&nbsp; For example, I may say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a green dodo in 
			my cantaloupe juice</em>.<br />
			Whatever you may think of my state 
			of mind, you will understand what I am saying although you and I 
			have never heard or said it before.&nbsp; If language is a habit 
			structure, how did I do that?<br />
			By the way, Chomsky's famous 
			example of this was<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<span class="auto-style8"> Green ideas sleep furiously</span></em>.</dd>
	
</dl>
			<p>The <strong>criticisms of structural linguistics</strong> are quite technical and 
		complex.&nbsp; Here we will take just two:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Ambiguity</strong></dt>
	<dd>Take this famous example: <span class="auto-style8"><em>Visiting aunts 
	can be boring</em></span><br />
	It could mean:<br />
	<span class="auto-style8"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aunts who visit can be boring</em></span><br /><span class="auto-style8"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visiting your aunts can be boring</em><br />
	</span>If we want to understand the sentence we need to go beyond the rules 
	of structural linguistics and consider what is called <strong>deep structure</strong>.&nbsp; 
	We do this by considering whether the word <em>visiting</em> is a participle 
	adjective describing <em>aunts</em> or a gerund of the verb <em>visit</em>.<br />
	The problem that ambiguity poses for structural linguistics is serious 
	because it relies on a tree diagram to parse a sentence.&nbsp; In the case 
	of this example, however, we cannot identify whether the subject noun phrase 
	is a plural noun modified by the adjective <em>visiting</em> or a singular 
	verbal noun referring to the activity of visiting aunts.<br />
	There is a slight cheat here, of course, insofar as the English modal 
	auxiliary verb <em>can</em> does not inflect for number or person.&nbsp; It 
	would not be possible to set this ambiguity up at all in, say, German, 
	because the modal auxiliary verb differs depending on whether the subject is 
	plural (<em>aunts</em>) or singular (<em>visiting</em>).&nbsp; Remove the 
	verb altogether in English and we arrive at the unambiguous pair:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style8"><em>Visiting aunts 
	are boring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visiting aunts is boring</em></span></dd>
			<dt><strong>Rules of use</strong></dt>
			<dd>This is a famous citation from Hymes (1971:278):<span class="auto-style8"><br />
			</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style8"><em>There are rules of use without which 
			the rules of grammar would be useless.<br />
			</em></span>
			For example, if I say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's cold in here<br />
			</em>I may 
			be asking you to shut the window, telling you to put the heating on, 
			advising you to get dressed or any number of other things and we 
			don't know what it means solely by applying grammatical rules.&nbsp; 
			We use rules of use.&nbsp; See the
			initial
			guide to form 
			and function, linked below, for more.</dd>

				<h2>Cognitivism: 1950s onward</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Theories of cognitivism (as opposed to 
				behaviourism) underlie much of post-behaviourist language 
				teaching.<br />
				Cognitivism is concerned with the investigation of how people 
				think &ndash; their internal mental states.&nbsp; In our field, 
				this means thinking about how people process language and 
				information to construct dependable rules for its use.&nbsp; 
			There are two ways to process information according to the theory 
			(although many have pointed out that the approaches are not mutually 
			exclusive).</p>
			<ol>
				<li>If you are given a rule and then told to apply it by
				<span class="style_underline">deducing</span> what the correct 
				form should be, you are using your brain to extrapolate from a 
				rule to a single example of language.<br />
				For example, if you are told the rules to form regular past 
				tenses in English and then asked for the past tense of s<em>moke, 
				live, pack</em> etc., you should be able to come up with the 
				correct forms.<br />
				That's deductive learning.</li>
				<li>If, on the other hand, you are 
				given the examples first (<em>pack-packed, live-lived, 
				smoke-smoked, type-typed, garden-gardened</em> etc.) and then 
				asked to state the rule you could use your brain to generalise 
				that verbs ending in <em>-e</em> take <em>-d </em>and those not 
				doing so take <em>-ed</em>.<br />
				That's inductive learning.</li>
			</ol>
		<p>This is a fundamental distinction.<br />
				There are those who will aver that one or the other is 'better' 
				but that's an oversimplification.&nbsp; It may be that some of 
				us are better at one form of thinking than the other or that 
				some forms of problem are more susceptible to being solved by 
				one way of thinking than the other.&nbsp; It may also be a 
				combination of the two.<br />
		Additionally, the dichotomy is false because even if one acquires a rule 
		inductively, one applies it deductively.&nbsp; It would be perverse to 
		put our learners to the trouble of figuring out a rule from the data and 
		then not ask them to apply it.<br />
				Either way, looking at learning through this lens focuses on the 
				fact that humans make sense of the data they are given by making 
				hypotheses about the truth.&nbsp; That's a cognitive view of 
				behaviour and learning.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Jacques Bellot (unknown dates)</dt>
				<dd>Bellot was a French refugee resident in Britain in the 
				latter part of the 16th century who wrote the first attested 
				book specifically aimed at teaching the English language.&nbsp; 
				The book, <em>The English Schoolmaster</em>, appeared in 1580.</dd>
				<dt>William Bullokar (c.1530-1609)</dt>
				<dd>apart from devising a 40-character phonemic script (based on 
				the Gothic alphabet), Bullokar also wrote the first ever grammar 
				of English (<em>Pamphlet for Grammar, </em>1586) modelled on 
				Lily's grammar of Latin.</dd>
				<dt>John Amos Comenius (1592-1670)</dt>
				<dd>was a hugely influential educational thinker and 
				philosopher.&nbsp; He believed that languages should be learned 
				pleasantly, in small steps, respecting the pupil's imagination 
				and personality.&nbsp; He is often quoted thus:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Clearly lay down the end at which 
				you aim, and neglect all that does not bear on that end: keep to 
				one example and one explanation of it, relying on practice for 
				all else: advance by gradual steps, remember that steady, 
				continuous progress is notable progress; therefore, no day 
				without a line, no hour without its task: leave nothing undone 
				when once begun.</em></span><br />In 1648 he wrote and published a long work 
				entitled <em>Linguarum Methodus Novissima </em>(Newest Method of 
				Languages).</dd>
				<dt>Guy Miège (1644-?1718)</dt>
				<dd>The excerpt above from his <em>Nouvelle méthode pour apprendre 
		l'Anglais</em> is one example of the growth of interest in learning 
				languages as people in Europe began to travel more (often driven 
				by persecution) and the dominance of Latin as a <em>lingua 
				franca</em> was being challenged.<br />
				Miège also published <em>The Great French Dictionary</em> in 
				1688.</dd>
				<dt>Dr Samuel Johnson (1709-1784)</dt>
				<dd>published his 2-volume Dictionary of the English Language in 
				1755, arguably the most influential dictionary of all time.</dd>
				<dt>Robert Lowth (1710-1787)</dt>
				<dd>is famous for having declined the offer of the Archbishopric 
				of Canterbury but even more so for his anonymously published <em>
				Short Introduction to English Grammar</em> (1783) which was immensely 
				influential on later grammars of English.</dd>
				<dt>Lindley Murray (1745-1826)</dt>
				<dd>published <em>English Grammar, adapted to the different 
				classes of learners</em> in 1795 which was the most widely used 
				grammar of its time.</dd>
				<dt>William Cobbett (1763-1835)</dt>
				<dd>is best known as a political polemicist, less known for his 
				very influential <em>Grammar of the English Language</em> (1819) 
				which was and remained for many years the most influential of 
				grammars of English.</dd>
				<dt>Johann Fick (1763-1821)</dt>
				<dd>wrote the first grammar translation course in English 
				entitled <em>Praktische englishe Sprachlehrer</em> in 1793.</dd>
				<dt>Fran&ccedil;ois Gouin (1831-1896)</dt>
				<dd>invented the series method of language learning and teaching 
				after a disastrous attempt to learn German.&nbsp; His book 
				entitled <em>The Art of Teaching and Studying Language</em> was 
				published in Britain in 1892.&nbsp; He established a chain of 
				schools and introduced Daniel Jones to the study of language.&nbsp; 
				His influence, never strong, has waned.</dd>
				<dt>Henry Sweet (1845-1912)</dt>
				<dd>Sweet's 1899 book, <em>The Practical Study of Languages</em>, 
				was, until that time, the greatest contribution to language 
				teaching methodology.&nbsp; As a phonetician, he is reputed to 
				be the model for George Bernard Shaw's character of Henry 
				Higgins in Pygmalion.</dd>
				<dt>Maximilian Berlitz (1852-1921)</dt>
				<dd>opened his first school in 1878 and others quickly followed 
				in the USA and Europe.&nbsp; He was impressed by the progress 
				his students made with a teacher of French who spoke no English in class 
				(because he could not) and conversed only in French with the 
				learners.<br />
				He is often called the originator of Direct Method teaching in 
				which the use of anything other than the target language is 
				deprecated.</dd>
				<dt>Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913)</dt>
				<dd>is sometimes referred to as the father of modern 
				linguistics.&nbsp; His influence is felt in every branch of 
				linguistics, including language teaching.&nbsp; His distinction 
				between langue (the speakers' knowledge of a language system) 
				and parole (what is actually said) is akin to (but not identical 
				to) Chomsky's concepts 
				of competence and performance.</dd>
				<dt>Otto Jesperson (1860-1943)</dt>
				<dd>was a Danish linguist specialising in English.&nbsp; In 
				1904, he published <em>How to teach a foreign language</em> 
				which remains influential and readable.&nbsp; He emphasised 
				engagement and immersion in the language as well as preparing 
				the ground for a lexical approach, claiming, for example that<p class="auto-style49">
				<span class="style_black"><em>the most indispensable expressions 
				often are those irrational groups which cannot be constructed 
				merely of words and grammatical rules</em></span></p>
				He also supported a discovery approach to learning, stating:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never tell the children anything 
				that they can find out for themselves.</em></span><br />
				His focus was also on the communicative nature of language:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is a sensible meaning in all 
				that is read or said or done</em></span><br />
				His book is freely available online.</dd>
				<dt>Franz Boas (1858-1942)</dt>
				<dd>is not known for his influence on language teaching as much 
				as for his influence on linguistics in general.&nbsp; One of his 
				students was Edward Sapir.&nbsp; He helped to found the 
				International Journal of American Linguistics and almost single 
				handedly established a school of linguistic descriptivism which 
				did not rely on the study of European languages.</dd>
				<dt>Edward Sapir (1884-1939)</dt>
				<dd>Sapir was a pupil of Boas and spent years working on 
				descriptions of North American languages.&nbsp; He became 
				convinced that each language reflects its culture and the ways 
				of thinking of its speakers.&nbsp; With his pupil, Benjamin 
				Whorf, the view that language determines thought is known as the 
				Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.</dd>
				<dt>Leonard Bloomfield (1887-1949)</dt>
				<dd>was an American linguist who developed (among others) 
				structural linguistics during the 1930s.&nbsp; Structural 
				linguistics remains the theory of language underpinning 
				audio-lingualism, Total Physical Response and many other 
				structure-based approaches to teaching languages.&nbsp; He 
				published his major work, <em>Language</em>, in 1933.<br />
				Originally a professor of German in Ohio and later of 
				Linguistics at Yale, Bloomfield was influential in linking 
				British and American approaches to language teaching and, in 1942, he published an <em>Outline Guide for the Practical 
				Study of Foreign Languages</em> which became the basis of the 
				Army Specialised Training Program (ASTP) during WWII.</dd>
				<dt>Harold E Palmer (1877-1949)</dt>
				<dd>published widely, particularly on phonetics and approaches 
				to teaching languages, and is credited as the father of British 
				Applied Linguistics.&nbsp; An influential publication (1917) was
				the catchily entitled
				<em>The scientific study and teaching of languages; a review of 
				the factors and problems connected with the learning and

				</em>He suggested that language is best learned through a 
				process of Auditory Observation (listening), Oral Imitation 
				(repetition), Catenizing (pronouncing successions of sounds 
				rapidly), Semanticizing (forming rules), Composition by Analogy 
				(producing new language based on the models learned).&nbsp; 
				Taken together, they constitute The Multiple Line of Approach.</dd>
				<dt>Daniel Jones (1881-1967)</dt>
				<dd>is mostly famous for the development of the concept of 
				cardinal vowels and he is revered as a practical phonetician.&nbsp; 
				Gimson said of him:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wherever 
				English is taught, his name is mentioned with respect and 
				gratitude</em></span><br />
				He published the classic <em>English Pronouncing Dictionary</em> 
				in 1917.</dd>
				<dt>Charles Fries (1887-1967)</dt>
				<dd>In 1945, Fries published the highly influential <em>Teaching 
				and Learning English as a Foreign Language</em> and he is 
				credited with inventing the Oral Approach.&nbsp; He helped to 
				found and worked at the prestigious English Language Institute 
				at Michigan University where language laboratory techniques were 
				pioneered.</dd>
				<dt>Michael West (1888-1973)</dt>
				<dd>is mostly remembered for a large range of teaching materials 
				based on his New Method.&nbsp; He is also the author of <em>The 
				General Service List of English Words</em> which is still in 
				use.</dd>
				<dt>John Rupert Firth (1890-1960)</dt>
				<dd>Firth's influence is very widespread, especially among 
				British applied (and pure) linguists.&nbsp; He designed a 
				programme for teaching Japanese to Royal Air Force personnel 
				during WWII.&nbsp; He was the first holder in Britain of a Chair 
				of General Linguistics.&nbsp; His publications were collected in 
				1959 as <em>Papers in Linguistics, 1934-1951.</em></dd>
				<dt>Albert Sydney (AS) Hornby (1898-1978)</dt>
				<dd>worked with Palmer in Japan and was instrumental in 
				developing Situational Language Teaching as well as producing 
				the first monolingual dictionary for learners of English.&nbsp; 
				He edited the English Language Teaching Journal after its launch 
				in 1946.<br />
				In 1954 Hornby published his <em>Guide to Patterns and Usage in 
				English</em> which was and remains influential.</dd>
				<dt>Charles Ogden (1889-1957)</dt>
				<dd>developed Basic English, an 850-word list designed to allow 
				the communication of any day-to-day purpose.&nbsp; It came with 
				5 combinatory rules to assist in the production of adequately 
				accurate language.</dd>
				<dt>The Colman Report (1929)</dt>
				<dd>was commissioned by the United States government and 
				concluded that reading fluency should be the aim of foreign 
				language teaching.&nbsp; It led to the Reading Method.</dd>
				<dt>Burrhus Frederic (BF) Skinner (1904-1990)</dt>
				<dd>was an American psychologist and founder of a behaviourist 
				theory of learning through operant conditioning (better known as 
				stimulus-response-reinforcement theory).&nbsp; The theory of 
				learning remains the underpinning of a range of structural 
				approaches to language learning and to techniques such as 
				repetition and written and spoken language drills.<br />
				In 1957 Skinner published <em>Verbal Behaviour</em> which sought 
				to show that verbal behaviour is no different from any other 
				form of behaviour.&nbsp; His views were famously and mostly 
				successfully attacked by Noam Chomsky.</dd>
				<dt>WWII (1939-1945)</dt>
				<dd>The USA's entry into the war in 1941 exposed the fact that 
				they had too few people able to communicate in a foreign 
				language.&nbsp; So was born The Army Specialized Training 
				Program based on Bloomfield's structural linguistics theories 
				and Skinner's behaviourist theories of learning.</dd>
				<dt>Post 1945</dt>
				<dd>The influence of the Army Specialised Training Program was still 
				felt and audio-lingual methods (including the use of language 
				laboratories) were developed to bring language learning within 
				the reach of millions.&nbsp; Schools of foreign languages, 
				especially English, sprang up in most developed countries.&nbsp; 
				The origins of the British English as a Foreign Language 
				industry can be traced to this time.</dd>
				<dt>The 1950s</dt>
				<dd>was a time of growth and development in Britain of 
				linguistic theories associated with John Firth (1890-1950) who 
				focused on the communicative nature of language and issues of 
				context and collocation.</dd>
				<dt>Noam Chomsky (b. 1928)</dt>
				<dd>published <em>Syntactic Structures</em> in 1957 (see 
				Skinner) which argued that a behaviourist theory of learning and 
				structural linguistics were unable to explain either the 
				acquisition of language or its nature.<br />
				His theory rested and rests on a proposed Language Acquisition 
				Device, Universal Grammar and Transformational Generative 
				Grammar.&nbsp; See the guide to Chomsky for more.</dd>
				<dt>Dell Hymes (1927-2009)</dt>
				<dd>an American linguist and coiner of the term <strong>
				communicative competence</strong>.&nbsp; His work underpins much 
				of Communicative Language Teaching and functional approaches and 
				was influential in the design and publication of the Council of 
				Europe's <em>Waystage</em> (1990) and <em>Threshold</em> (1995) 
				descriptors of language competence.<br />
				Hymes developed his theory of speaking with the convenient 
				acronym SPEAKING:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S for Setting (the time and place of the language)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P for Participants (who is addressing whom)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E for Ends (the purposes and intentions of the participants)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A for Act sequence (which speech acts follow and precede 
				others)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; K for Key (the manner and tone of the speech act)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I for Instrumentalities (style, dialect, register etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N for Norms (the social rules governing speech act 
				appropriacy)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G for Genre (the social conventions concerning how speech 
				acts are sequenced and staged)</dd>
				<dt>The 1970s</dt>
				<dd>saw an explosion in alternative methodologies including 
				Total Physical Response (Asher), Silent Way (Gattegno) and 
				Community Language Learning (Curran).<br />
				It was also a period of great interest in Communicative Language 
				Teaching and testing.&nbsp; 1970 saw the publication of Wilkins' 
				influential work on Notional Syllabuses.</dd>
				<dt>The CEFR (Common European Framework for Languages) 2001</dt>
				<dd>has become the benchmark for most course materials design 
				and a range of examinations setting a syllabus for both.&nbsp; 
				It continues to be developed.</dd>
				<dt>Since then</dt>
				<dd>CLT has become the standard model of language teaching and 
				has been retro-fitted with a theory of learning based on social 
				interaction theory.<br />
				Task-based Language teaching / learning (Prabhu) is an approach 
				within the discipline as is The Lexical Approach (Lewis <em>et 
				al</em>), Dogme (Thornbury <em>et al</em>), Content and Language 
				Integrated Learning (CLIL) and more.<br />
				Post-method methodology which seeks to deny the existence of a 
				single 'best' way to teach and learn a language has also become 
				influential.</dd>

			We started this guide with the comment that:</p>
			<p class="auto-style34">
				The history of English Language Teaching is often presented from 
				a methodological perspective with the implication that newer or 
				more recent approaches to teaching the language were or are 
				somehow superior to what had or has gone before.</p>
			<p class="nomargintop">
			This is an understandable tendency not confined to English Language 
			Teaching, which views the history and development of any field of 
			study as if it were a slow (or even quite rapid) advance from the 
			dark age of ignorance and superstition into the light of modern 
			science and understanding.&nbsp; The corollary is to see the history 
			of the profession as one punctuated by insights and paradigm shifts 
			sparked by the works of a few great thinkers and authorities.&nbsp; 
			We get a view that looks a bit like a jagged but ever-rising line 
			with sudden insights and new directions at each bend in the graph.<br />
			It is a tendency and a view which we will do well to guard against.&nbsp; 
			No academic domain progresses in this way.</p>
			<p>
			A better way to visualise the development of English language 
			teaching is to view it as a series of overlapping threads which 
			entwine at times and then separate again.<br />
			So for example, in the 16th and 17th centuries much of the focus was 
			on functional language but, with the rise of interest in setting out 
			prescriptions for grammatical language the focus shifted to form and 
			the teaching of vocabulary alongside a series of translations.<br />
			In other words, the field has not progressed in a smooth curve, 
			leaving behind discarded theories and moving onwards and upwards to 
			the light but rather by emphasising different aspects of language 
			and learning at different times driven by the culture of the epochs 
			in which people were working.<br />
			It is an interlocking entwined system, not a linear progression which we can 
			visualise as:<br />
			<img alt="intertwined" height="323" src="../../imagesgraphics/intertwined_theory.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>
			None of this should be taken to imply that no progress at all has 
			been made in 400 years of endeavour.&nbsp; Huge advances in 
			understanding the psychology of learning and in analysing language, 
			thought and consciousness have been made.&nbsp; Theories of 
			learning, in particular, have become more sophisticated and some, 
			even, empirically based.&nbsp; Theories of language, likewise, have 
			been developed which describe and analyse language with 
			ever-increasing rigour and range.&nbsp; Phonological studies, in 
			particular, have been placed on a much more scientific footing 
			helped in great part by technological advances in the processing of 
			auditory data.</p>
			<p>
			Academic disciplines do not, however, develop in a vacuum.&nbsp; For major 
			changes in focus and direction in any field of study, the cultural milieu in which a discipline operates 
			must be congenial to the development of ideas and new ways of 
			looking at the world.<br />
			It is, therefore, not a coincidence that Sweet, de Saussure and 
			Jesperson were active at a time (around last decades of the 19th and 
			the first two of the 20th centuries) when scientific study in all 
			fields, even those which had previously been the domain of armchair 
			philosophising, was becoming fashionable and new ideas of the 
			structure of matter and the natural world were beginning to question the Newtonian 
			universe.&nbsp; Einstein published his four ground-breaking papers in 
			1905 and the development of quantum mechanics was taking off.&nbsp; 
			Darwin published <em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural 
			Selection</em> in 1859.&nbsp; The period from the mid-18th to the 
			mid-20th centuries was one in which an empirical, science-based 
			methodology was developed across many fields of academia.&nbsp; 
			Sweet, de Saussure and Jesperson were leading lights in the search 
			for a rule-based understanding of language and a scientific approach 
			to teaching it but they were not at all alone.<br />
			After and during the second world war science and a scientific 
			approach to solving major problems were even more prominent and, 
			again, it is no surprise to find within linguistics, psychology and 
			the teaching of languages that scientific answers were sought and, 
			allegedly, found to explain how languages work and how learning 
			happens.&nbsp; Skinner, Bloomfield, Fries and Palmer (whose major 
			work had a title containing
				<em>The scientific study and teaching of languages</em>) were all 
			actively seeking a scientific basis for the teaching and 
			understanding of language.</p>

			<p>
			Mechanistic and determinist views of nature began, soon after the 
			second world war, to be 
			called into question and again, ELT, was no laggard with the 1970s 
			seeing major developments in more communicative views of language 
			and language learning and the rejection by Chomsky (1957) of a behaviourist 
			view of language and by others, including Hymes (1971), of a purely structural 
			view of language.<br />
			Humanist approaches (e.g., in Stevick, 1980 and Moskowitz, 1978) 
			aimed at the whole person rather than operant conditioning and habit 
			formation became fashionable.&nbsp; Comenius (1592-1670) would not 
			have felt out of step with such approaches.<br />
			The pendulum had swung back again to language in use rather than 
			language as a system.&nbsp; It had also swung from treating learners 
			as empty vessels to be filled or organisms to be trained to treating 
			them as thinking, feeling people.</p>
			<p>
			Lately, the pendulum has begun to swing back with a greater 
			recognition of the need to teach structure and pattern.&nbsp; Hence 
			a focus on noticing, functional linguistics, genre theories, lexical 
			approaches and so on, allied to a more inclusive approach which 
			recognises that formal linguistic ability is <strong>part of</strong> 
			communicative competence.<br />
			It probably has further to swing yet.<br />
			English language teaching is, naturally, not alone in exhibiting the 
			swinging pendulum and over the centuries we have seen it oscillate between 
			all is material and all is in the mind and back again, from substance 
			to form and back again, from structure to function and back and even 
			from waves to corpuscles and back to waves.</p>
			<p>
			We should not, accordingly, be surprised to find that the pendulum 
			will swing again.</p>

		<p>Taken together, the following led to a rise in the 1960s and 1970s of 
		what many hailed as a new approach to language teaching, although, as we 
		have seen, it wasn't really new, just relabelled:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>criticisms of structural linguistics (and the growth of 
			descriptive rather than prescriptive grammars)</li>
			<li>criticisms of behaviourist theories of learning (and an emphasis 
			on cognition)</li>
			<li>a recognition that language is primarily a means to communicate 
			(and not only a set of grammatical rules and lexis)</li>
			<li>a recognition that learners need to know how to deploy the 
			language they are learning in order to communicate</li>
		</ul>
		<p>That approach is usually called <strong>Communicative Language 
		Teaching</strong> or CLT.&nbsp; It has become so dominant that there is a&nbsp;guide devoted to it 
		linked first in the list of related guides below.<br />
		It is not, and never has been, without its critics.</p>
