			<h1>First and Second Language Acquisition Theories</h1>

			<img alt="fla" height="207" src="../../images/baby_laptop310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<h2>What's the relevance of First Language Acquisition to teaching an 
			additional or 
			second language?</h2>
			<p>Good question.&nbsp; There are a number of reasons we should know 
			a little about First Language Acquisition (FLA, in the trade):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It provides a kind of benchmark for theories of Second 
				Language Acquisition (SLA).&nbsp; The theories are parallel in 
				many ways.</li>
				<li>A good deal of methodology in SLA has been premised on the 
				theory that we will acquire a second or additional language in 
				the same way we acquired our first language(s).</li>
				<li>The way the human brain operates in language learning is not 
				radically different (so some theories assert) whether we are 
				learning our first or additional language(s).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>At each stage in what follows, we'll be considering how theories 
			of first language acquisition are relevant to teachers of additional 
			languages.<br />
			Here, then is a run-down of some major theories and hypotheses 
			concerning how people acquire their first language(s).</p>

			<p>You were not born with the ability to speak, ride a bicycle, play 
			the piano, type, play chess, walk or dive for pearls.&nbsp; What 
			concerns us here are the abilities you <strong>naturally develop
			</strong>as opposed to those which you are <strong>taught</strong>.</p>
			<p>Some of this is quite easy.&nbsp; Divide this list into learned 
			(i.e., taught or self-taught) abilities and those which naturally 
			develop in <strong>all</strong> normal children:<br />
			Click on the table when you have done that.</p>

			<p>It is clear that some behaviours, such as the ability to grasp 
			objects or walk are biologically determined because all children, 
			regardless of their culture, learn to do it pretty much at the same 
			stage in their development.&nbsp; For example, most babies learn to 
			sit, then roll over, then crawl and finally walk between the first 9 
			to 12 months of life (some take a bit longer and some skip the 
			crawling bit, preferring a bottom shuffle).&nbsp; None, however, has 
			to be taught the skill.<br />
			Babies in all cultures learn to talk between 18 and 28 months of 
			life.<br />
			Some behaviours are never naturally acquired so if you never learn 
			to ride a bicycle or play a decent game of chess, you will not 
			magically develop the ability to do so, no matter how long you live.</p>
			<p><strong>The question for this guide is whether using language to 
			communicate is in the same category as walking or the same category 
			as playing the piano.<br />
			</strong>This has fairly profound implications but don't expect the 
			definitive answer here.</p>

			<h3>The evolution of the ability to process language</h3>
					<p>There is, unsurprisingly, some debate among evolutionary 
					biologists concerning how such a mechanism may have evolved.&nbsp; 
					Recent genetical research is pointing to a set of genes 
					including one called FOXP2 (pictured).</p>
					<p>It would be a gross oversimplification to 
			dub this 'the language gene' as much else, including the 
			interactions between this gene and a range of others, is involved in 
			the ability to process language.&nbsp; However, the gene appears to 
			be central to our ability to process and produce language and people 
			who lack it or in whom it is mutated or inactive cannot handle 
			language.<br />

				<p>Firstly, while there is strong evidence that some 
				language-learning ability is innate, a good deal of the theory 
				has been based on just one language, English.&nbsp; From that, 
				theorists of universal grammar have averred that the essential 
				building blocks of language structure are common across all 
				languages and that these items are what the language acquisition 
				device is aimed at: noun phrases, verb phrases, adjective 
				phrases and so on.<br />
				This ignores the enormous diversity of structural phenomena 
				across the range of some 6000 to 7000 languages on earth, many 
				of which are poorly if at all described.&nbsp; Some, it has been 
				persuasively demonstrated, get along quite happily without 
				adjective or adverb phrases at all, for example, choosing to 
				inflect the noun phrases or verb phrases instead.</p>
				<p>Secondly, innateness theories fail, it has been argued, to 
				explain the great differences between spoken and written 
				language.&nbsp; If we are genetically programmed to learn 
				language, whence come these differences?</p>
				<p>Thirdly, innateness theories have been criticised as greatly 
				underestimating the effects of culture and community on the 
				language-learning process.&nbsp; In many languages, males and 
				females speak differently and employ different grammatical 
				structures and in some, children's language is substantially 
				different from the language of adults.&nbsp; It is difficult to 
				account for these differences on the basis of inheritance of 
				language-learning abilities or pre-programming for language at 
				all.</p>
			<p>Fourthly, we need to ask how this innate program arose.&nbsp; If 
			there is indeed a language learning module hard-wired into the brain 
			of humans, how did it evolve?&nbsp; The genetic changes which would 
			have had to occur are dramatic and it is difficult to see how they 
			could have arisen gradually in the usual piecemeal fashion which 
			evolution favours.</p>
			<p>Finally, there seems to be some evidence that different language 
			modules are acquired at different times and in different ways.&nbsp; 
			Critics of the critical period hypothesis point to the fact that 
			some language-deprived children well past the assumed critical 
			period actually do manage to learn the lexicon and syntax of a 
			language (although others don't) and it has often been noted that 
			second-language learners can often acquire native-like vocabulary 
			and syntactical abilities but may never acquire the phonological 
			system of a foreign language.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, the conclusion that many have reached, based on the 
			evidence, is that the ability to acquire language is, indeed, innate 
			to humans (and only humans).<br />
			For a little more on that debate, see the guide to language 
			evolution, linked below.</p>

			<p>There are a number of implications for ELT professionals, of 
			course.&nbsp; They come down to the assertion that we should not 
			assume that a second or subsequent language can be acquired using 
			wholly different mental processes from the ones used to acquire 
			one's first language.&nbsp; It is not, after all, as if human mental 
			processes are fundamentally altered in any way as we grow up.</p>

				<dt><strong>teaching children</strong></dt>
				<dd>If the innateness theories are right, then what is required 
				is simple exposure at the right time to a rich linguistic 
				environment rather than explicit instruction.&nbsp; Instruction 
				may, in fact, be counterproductive or, at least, pointless.<br />
				Teachers of children should also bear the acquisition order in 
				mind and not expect or try to demand production of certain forms 
				before the child is 'ready' to learn them.<br />
				Practice and correction, too, are pointless.</dd>
				<dt><strong>teaching older children and adults</strong></dt>
				<dd>Again, if the theories are right, especially concerning the 
				critical period hypotheses, then we should not expect adults to 
				acquire language simply by exposure.<br />
				We should also expect them never to acquire wholly native-like 
				production if instruction is carried out after the critical 
				period.&nbsp; There is, indeed, some evidence to suggest that in 
				pronunciation especially, older learners <strong>never</strong> 
				acquire native-like production skills.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The influence of innateness theories is readily seen in some 
			methodological approaches which rely on rich input and exposure to 
			language alongside the abjuring of formal practice and instruction.<br />

				<li>Children's speech is different from adults' speech<br />
				Children do not produce fully formed sentences.&nbsp; The 
				evidence is that they progress from 1-word utterances (acquired 
				around 12 months) to 2-word utterances (around 18 months) and 
				then go on to more complex utterances with longer sentences 
				until they start to make rare or complex constructions around 5 
				years of age.<br />
				Indeed, children will often reduce an adult's statement to comply 
				with their current productive capacity.&nbsp; On hearing, for 
				example, something like <em>The train goes through the tunnel</em> 
				an 18-month-old child might reduce it to <em>Tunnel train</em> 
				and an even younger child might reduce it to one imperfectly 
				formed word such as <em>trai'.</em>&nbsp; Children routinely 
				reduce what they hear to conform to their current Mean Length of 
				Utterance or MLU.</li>
				<li>The U-shaped learning curve (see below)<br />
				If imitation were all there was to acquiring language, then the 
				U-shaped curve, going from correct production of irregular forms 
				to overgeneralisation of the rule to recognition of the 
				irregularity (e.g., from <em>went</em> via <em>goed</em> and 
				then back to <em>went</em>) simply would not occur because a 
				child would very rarely, if ever, hear the incorrect form in 
				order to imitate it.&nbsp; Children must, therefore, be actively 
				forming hypotheses about language structure.</li>
				<li>Innovation<br />
				Both children and adults are capable of forming utterances 
				they have never heard.&nbsp; In fact, the number of possible 
				utterances in a language approaches infinity.&nbsp; A child might, for 
				example, say <em>Cow river fall</em> even though no adult has 
				ever said it to her.&nbsp; Adults, too, produce language never 
				before heard.&nbsp; For more, see the 
				guide to Chomsky, linked below.</li>

			<p>This refers to a phenomenon which has been frequently observed 
			and researched.<br />
			English exhibits a number of irregularities in inflexions, notably 
			the changing of the middle vowel or consonant to make a past tense form (as in
			<em>make-made, buy-bought </em>rather than <em>*maked, buyed</em> 
			etc.) and in irregular 
			plurals (such as <em>child-children, mouse-mice </em>etc.)<br />Children often acquire the irregular form and then revert to an 
			inaccurate regular form before once more acquiring the irregular 
			form.&nbsp; So, for example, a child may produce <em>The mice ran up 
			the clock</em>, then begin to say <em>The mouses runned up the clock</em> 
			before settling on the correct version later.<br />
			If this is true, the importance is obvious: it means that language 
			cannot be being acquired by simple imitation and practice.&nbsp; If 
			it were, children would never produce something like *<em>comed</em> 
			instead of <em>came</em> for the simple reason that they would never 
			hear it.&nbsp; In other words:</p>

			<p>The theory claims that children learn to produce correct language

			It has, of course, close connections with Imitation Theory (because

		<p>
		<img alt="behaviourism" height="164" src="../../imagesgraphics/behaviourism465.png" width="465" /></p>
		<ol>
			<li>The process starts with a stimulus, say, a question from a carer such as <em>Who 
			did you see?</em> put to the 
			organism (in this case, a child).&nbsp; The stimulus 
			can elicit a variety of responses but only the 'right' one will be 
			reinforced.</li>
			<li>So, for example, if the child responds with <em>I seed Tom</em> the 
			carer will negatively reinforce it with <em>No, 
			say I saw Tom</em>.</li>
			<li>If, eventually, the carer can persuade the child to produce a 
			correct utterance, the response will be rewarded (i.e., reinforced) 
			with something like<em> Oh! That's lovely! </em>and the child will learn the form.</li>
			<li>Enough Stimulus &gt; Response &gt; Reinforcement cycles will see the

			<p>Connectionist theory is based on the assumption that as we learn, 
			we create neural connections in the brain which reinforce the 
			learned behaviour.<br />
			For example, if a child encounters the word<em> mouse</em> in 
			relation to operating a computer frequently, the connection between 
			computer control and a mouse will be formed and the more often the 
			word is met in this context, the stronger the connection will 
			become.&nbsp; If, later, the child encounters the same word as 
			descriptive a <em>small, furry rodent,</em> then a<span class="auto-style105"> 
			different network connection will be made to accommodate the newly 
			discovered use of the word.</span></p>
			<p>A problem for the Active Construction of Grammar 
			Theory is the starting point.&nbsp; That theory explains the 
			production of false items such as <em>feets,</em> <em>He showeds me</em> 
			or <em>mouses</em> as evidence that learner is making 
			overgeneralisations from rules imperfectly acquired in terms of 
			their restrictions.<br />
			Anecdotally, you may be able to think of the same phenomenon 
			occurring with learners of English as an additional or second 
			language.<br />
			However, when children are asked to make past tenses or plurals from 
			nonsense words which resemble real but irregular forms, they do not, 
			apparently, apply the grammar rules but respond in terms of 
			statistical likelihood.&nbsp; It is conceivable that, having learned 
			that the plural of <em>mouse</em> is <em>mice</em> that children 
			will assume that the plural of the nonsense word <em>flouse</em> 
			will not be <em>flouses</em> as active construction theories would 
			suggest but may opt instead for <em>frice</em> by analogy with <em>
			mouse-mice</em>.<br />
			Another example (again, from Bergman <em>et al</em>), is that when asked to form 
			the past tense of <em>fring</em>, many children will suggest <em>
			frang </em>or<em> frought</em> (by analogy with <em>ring</em> and
			<em>bring</em> etc. respectively) rather than the structurally 
			predictable <em>fringed</em>.&nbsp; In some varieties of English, we 
			do indeed find, for example, the use of <em>brung</em> as the past 
			forms of the verb <em>bring</em>.<br />
			Hence, too, one might encounter a suggestion that the plural of <em>
			noot</em> would (or might well) be <em>neet</em> not <em>noots
			</em>and it is true 
			that many native speakers of English will prefer <em>handkerchieves</em> 
			as the plural of <em>handkerchief</em> by analogy with <em>
			wolf-wolves</em> etc. and the status of <em>roof-roofs/rooves</em> 
			is unclear.<br />
			It has been suggested here that humans make neural connections in 
			the brain based on the <strong>frequency</strong> of what they hear rather than 
			making rules based on the <strong>structure</strong> of what they hear.</p>

			<p>Another way to explain this process is to rely on inferencing (to 
			which there is a dedicated guide on this site, linked below).&nbsp; 
			It works like this:</p>
			<p>If you are presented with the names of six horses in a race and 
			no other data at all, you would be correct in thinking that your 
			chances of backing the winner are 6:1 against, i.e., a roughly 
			16.67% chance that you would win.<br />
			However, if you are also told that of the six horses only number 5 
			has ever won a race before against similar opposition and that all 
			the others have finished last or second to last in their previous 3 
			races, you might adjust your expectation of which horse will win 
			based not on intuition or guesswork but on the statistical 
			probabilities the new data have supplied.<br />
			The theory is that human learning happens like that.</p>
			<p>Now take the situation in which you are faced with trying to 
			decide what form of a verb will follow the verb <em>arrange</em> in 
			a sentence such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arranged __________ tomorrow</em><br />
			and the choices are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>going</em></li>
				<li><em>go</em></li>
				<li><em>will go</em></li>
				<li><em>to go</em></li>
				<li><em>goes</em></li>
				<li><em>went</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>All things being equal, you might think that you have a one-in-six 
			chance of hitting on the right form.&nbsp; However, all things are 
			not equal because you already know that the following sentences are 
			correctly formed:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope to go<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agreed to go<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked to go<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to go<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember going<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall going<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoyed going</em><br />The reasoning (which is mostly unconscious) goes like this:</p>
			<ol class="style_black">
				<li>In all the correct forms I know, none takes the bare 
				infinitive, the present with -<em>s, </em>the<em> will </em>+ 
				infinitive structure or the past tense so I can dismiss choices 
				2, 3, 5 and 6 for the moment.</li>
				<li>I now have a choice between alternative 4, <em>to go,</em> or 
				alternative 1, <em>going,</em> 
				as the correct form.&nbsp; Shall I toss a coin to decide?</li>
				<li>No.&nbsp; I also know that all the forms with -<em>ing</em> 
				that I know are correct are concerned with the past.&nbsp; I 
				already know, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered meeting her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finished painting the doors<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They admitted breaking the window</em><br />
				etc. are correct uses and I can see that the <em>remembering, 
				finishing</em> and <em>admitting</em> all come <strong>after</strong> 
				the actions of <em>meeting, painting</em> and <em>breaking</em>.</li>
				<li>However, I can also see that the forms I know that are 
				correctly formed with a <em>to-</em>infinitive work the opposite 
				way around.&nbsp; I know, for example, that:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope to see her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I promise to come early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect to talk to her</em><br />
				are all correct forms and that the <em>hoping, promising</em> 
				and <em>expecting</em> all come <strong>before</strong> the <em>
				seeing, coming </em>and <em>talking</em>.</li>
				<li>Statistically, therefore, I will select:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arranged to go tomorrow<br />
				</em>because the <em>arranging</em> must <strong>precede</strong> 
				the <em>going</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and you'll be right, of course.<br />
			What you have done is apply probabilistic reasoning based on 
			your other knowledge of the language and assumed that, statistically 
			speaking, you'll be right to bet on the favourite.<br />
			Just as in horse races, of course, this will not always result in a 
			win (or bookmakers would all be out of business).&nbsp; If you apply 
			the same process to a sentences such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look forward ____________ tomorrow</em><br />
			you will not get the right answer.&nbsp; An outsider has won the 
			race, in this case.</p>
			<p>Dennett, 2017:269, puts it this way:</p>

				<p>There are those who consider that the connectionist view of 
				language acquisition adds nothing substantial to the theory of 
				active construction of grammar.&nbsp; What it does is add 
				another layer of cognitive processing and there is nothing 
				within active construction theory that denies that.<br />
				The fact that all languages contain many examples of 
				non-intuitive and exceptional structures also presents problems 
				for the theory.&nbsp; We might assume, following the statistical 
				analogy approach, that all of the following are, for example, 
				allowable but children rarely, if ever, produce such forms.&nbsp; 
				If the brain is indeed forward modelling from data it already 
				has, why is that?<br />

				hid behind the door</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I suggested to go out</em> (by analogy with <em>I 
				expected to go out)</em><br />
				However, the fact that adult learners do produce such forms 
				consistently provides some evidence that the connectionist view 
				has more relevance to the teaching of languages to adults and 
				the existence of analogy errors has long been accepted.</p>

			<p>If the two approaches are being combined, in fact, by mature

			for how language is presented and which language is selected for 
			presentation.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Connectionist theories clearly have a good fit with 
				approaches such as The Lexical Approach and focuses on 
				collocation and colligation.&nbsp; If it is true that learners 
				(of whatever age) are applying some kind of statistical analysis 
				to the language data they are exposed to, then it makes sense to 
				design materials which contain statistically likely rather than 
				unlikely combinations of words and structures.</li>
				<li>Chunking of language, too, is important because chunks such 
				as <em>air conditioning + unit, steering + committee / wheel</em> 
				etc. lend themselves to the formation of neural pathways in the 
				brain.</li>
				<li>Getting learners to notice connections in terms of 
				colligation will also be effective if connectionist theories 
				hold water.&nbsp; The acquisition of, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I allowed him to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Mary permitted him to come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I forbade him to speak<br />
				</em>etc. will be facilitated if they are 
				presented together and frequently encountered but presenting 
				them alongside<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made him go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I let him speak<br />
				</em>etc. will 
				be positively counterproductive.<br />
				The same consideration 
				would apply to all compare-and-contrast rather than

			<p>This theory places great emphasis on the kinds of social 
			interaction in which people encounter language.&nbsp; The argument 
			is that it may be combined with both Connectionist and Active 
			Construction of Grammar theories to explain how the richness, or 
			otherwise, of the data the learners encounter will be exploited.<br />
			It seeks also to explain how it is that children slowly develop the 
			ability not only to use language accurately but also appropriately.<br />
			Theoreticians in this area focus a good deal of attention on what is 
			called child-directed speech.&nbsp; Such speech tends to be 
			delivered with excessive intonation range and pitch and to be 
			simplified and repeated for comprehension.&nbsp; From it, the child 
			learns to decode its meaning before going on to be able to 
			comprehend and produce more complex and appropriate adult-to-adult 
			language.</p>
			<p>Bergman <em>et al</em> (op. cit.: 318) draw on Gleason and Ratner (1998) 
			for the following example of child directed <em>vs</em>. adult 
			speech:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>See the birdie?&nbsp; Look at the birdie!&nbsp; What a 
				pretty birdie!</em><br />
				(accompanied by high voice pitch and gesture)<br />
				<em>vs</em>.:</li>
				<li><em>Has it come to your attention that one of our 
				better-looking feathered friends is perched upon the windowsill?</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The problem which immediately arises, of course, is that children 
			do acquire the ability to produce and comprehend the second example, 
			and they do it effortlessly and very quickly.</p>

				<p>While interesting, there is little actual evidence that the

				direct correction of children by adults when they produce 
				inappropriate language and by imitation theory.<br />
				That exposure to language in use is required for language

				<p>In terms of second-language acquisition, the theory states 
				that learning is constructed by the learners.&nbsp; This is 
				usually contrasted in educational theory with what is labelled 
				as a transmission model in which knowledge is handed down from 
				above.<br />
				The criticism of that is, naturally, that social constructivists 
				are setting up an unrealistic 'traditional' model in order to 
				suggest how social constructivism is superior.<br />
				It is, moreover, asserted that learning is primarily a social 
				activity.&nbsp; This means that knowledge and skills are not 
				acquired by individuals operating alone but only through 
				interaction with others.<br />
				This makes the theory a good fit with communicative classroom 
				approaches which forefront real communicative tasks and 
				emphasise interaction with peers and others.</p>
			<p>Clearly, much of Communicative Language Teaching lays great 
			stress on natural and appropriate language as the target of 
			instruction and this theory sits well with such an approach.&nbsp; 
			The procedure of introducing simplified language and then refining 
			it for appropriate and accurate communicative effect lies at the 
			heart of such an approach.<br />
			Teachers, while not exactly producing typical child-directed 
			language often are observed to use unnaturally emphasised intonation 
			patterns and stress as well as a good deal of gesture.</p>
				<p>It has sometimes been a criticism levelled at a communicative 
				approaches to language teaching that while the approach has a 
				well worked out theory of language, it is less certain about a 
				theory of learning.&nbsp; Enter social constructivism to the 
				rescue.<br />
				Unfortunately, the theory is somewhat silent concerning the 
				mechanisms through which learning takes place (unlike, e.g., 
				connectionist and active construction theories).&nbsp; It may, 
				therefore, be wise to reserve judgement or, at least, to take 
				the view that while social interaction is undoubtedly a useful 
				and motivating factor in second-language acquisition, it cannot 
				be the whole truth or individual silent learning would be 
				impossible.&nbsp; If you are reading this page alone, is it the 
				case that you are unable to learn from it because you are not 
				interacting with others?</p>
			<p>Such considerations have not stopped some from asserting that 
			social constructivism is <strong>the</strong> way in which learning 
			happens.<br />
			Here's an example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">We believe that learning is best 
			conceptualised through a social constructivist theory of learning.&nbsp; A key tenet of this is the view that learning 
			is constructed by the learner, as opposed to the traditional, 
			“transmission” model of teaching and learning in which knowledge is 
			passed on to students fully formed, ready to be assimilated.&nbsp; 
			Furthermore, learning is primarily a social activity – knowledge and 
			skills are constructed through interaction with others.<br />

			<p>Well, it depends on the theory you accept, doesn't it?</p>
			<p>It seems clear that concepts such as critical period only apply 
			to children (and the evidence is there to suggest that adult 
			learners have far more trouble learning an additional language than 
			children do).&nbsp; Methodologies which purport, therefore, to be 
			based on how a child learns and that such an approach is applicable 
			to adults and more mature children should be handled with care and 
			some scepticism because there is evidence that children and adults 
			learn differently, not least because of their very different 
			experiential backgrounds and because all normal adults have already 
			acquired a perfect knowledge of their own language.</p>
			<p>Other theories, such as Imitation and Reinforcement theories (the 
			basis of drilling and repetition and much else) as well as Active 
			Construction of Grammar, Connectionism and Social Interaction theory 
			may be just as applicable to mature learners of an additional 
			language as they are to immature learners of first languages.<br />
			The argument here is that we do not abandon or lose access to our 
			cognitive abilities as we mature.&nbsp; We may use the abilities 
			differently, some might argue more effectively, as adults.<br />
			If so, there are obvious consequences for the design of materials, 
			classroom procedures, error correction techniques and much else.</p>

					<li>How do people learn a language?</li>
					<li>Is the way that we learn / acquire our first language

				</ol>
				<p>Reality may be more complex than theorists will have us 
				believe.&nbsp; The ways that learning happens are still obscure 
				and work goes on with, occasionally, flashes of insight and new 
				evidence to support one theory or another.&nbsp; This does not 
				mean that the various ways in which learning may or may not 
				happen are mutually exclusive.&nbsp; Some theories are presented 
				as take-it-or-leave-it choices but humans are complex animals 
				with the capacity for complex behaviour and ways of thinking 
				about the world.&nbsp; To aver that all of them learn all facets 
				of all languages in the same way is much more likely to be wrong 
				than right.</p>
			<p>It may turn out to be the case, for example, that we learn the 
				grammar of our first language in one way and the grammar of a 
				second or subsequent language very differently.&nbsp; We may 
				learn to pronounce our first language by a process of imitation 
				and repetition but learn the pronunciation of a foreign language 
				by combining a deliberate cognitive process with some hard 
				listening to spot the gap between what we produce and the 
				native-speaker models we encounter.&nbsp; It has been suggested 
				that we approach the acquisition of our first language very 
				differently from the way we approach learning a new language and 
				we may learn different facets of the new language in different 
				ways.&nbsp; The suggestion, again briefly, is that:</p>
