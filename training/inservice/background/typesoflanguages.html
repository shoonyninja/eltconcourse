			This guide is an overview and a condensed one at that.<br />
			Before we get to classifying languages by their structure and so on, 
			it is worth taking a little time to look at the number, range, 
			origin and 
			distribution of languages in the world.</p>

			<p>
			Well, it depends a little on how you count.&nbsp; There are some 
			issues with counting the world's languages and estimates vary from 
			around 6000 to over 7000.&nbsp; The issues are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The border between a language proper and a dialect is fuzzy.&nbsp; 
				At exactly what point a variety of a language becomes a separate 
				language in its own right is often a decision made on political 
				or social grounds rather than on a purely linguistic basis.&nbsp; 
				Examples, often cited, are Czech and Slovak or Danish and 
				Norwegian.&nbsp; In both cases the language pairs are almost 
				entirely mutually comprehensible but political and national 
				boundaries contrive to classify them as separate languages.</li>
				<li>On the other hand, within large languages such as English, 
				Arabic or 
				German there often exist varieties which are not mutually 
				comprehensible but, because of other social and political 
				considerations, these varieties are rarely classified as 
				separate languages.&nbsp; Politics and the need to maintain 
				cultural or national identity often play a significant role 
				here.</li>
				<li>Also for national and political reasons, the numbers of 
				people speaking a minority language may be deliberately 
				underestimated or the very existence of the language may not be 
				recognised.</li>
				<li>In some cases a better definition of a language is as a 
				macrolanguage which encompasses a range of mutually 
				unintelligible (or variably intelligible) varieties.&nbsp; 
				Macrolanguages are often spoken across large areas which are 
				culturally connected.&nbsp; The Ethnologue (at https://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/size) 
				lists 14 varieties of Chinese as separate languages and 
				distinguishes 20 varieties of Arabic which in both cases vary in 
				the amount of inter-intelligibility with other varieties.&nbsp; 
				Malay and the main languages of Pakistan are also sometimes 
				considered as examples of macrolanguages.</li>
				<li>Languages die, populations move and people change.&nbsp; In 
				some cases census data are unreliable and in some, no reliable 
				data at all exist.&nbsp; Some estimates are that a language is 
				lost forever every 10 or so days.&nbsp; Half the world's 
				languages have fewer than 5000 speakers and that puts them in a 
				precarious position.&nbsp; UNESCO estimates that over 2500 of 
				the world's languages are currently endangered.</li>

			For the reasons listed above, all statistics in this area are 
			questionable.<br />
			*The status of Arabic in this list is disputed because of the mutual 
			unintelligibility of its various forms.&nbsp; It is probably better 
			considered as a language group rather than a single language because 
			differences between varieties are comparable to the differences 
			between, e.g., French and Spanish or German and Dutch.<br />
			&dagger;For around 75% of speakers Hindi and Urdu are mutually 
			comprehensible.</p>
			<p>
			Other estimates will vary and these figures are not precise.&nbsp; 
			French and German appear in many lists of the top 10 and are 
			certainly in the top 20.</p>

			Languages are not equally distributed around the world in terms of 
			their numbers of speakers.&nbsp; The figures cited here are for 
			indigenous languages rather than those brought in by modern 
			immigration.&nbsp; In the UK, for example, there are, apart from 
			English, at least 8 other languages spoken by indigenous 
			populations.&nbsp; If one adds in languages imported by migrant 
			communities, that number rises to over 300.<br />
			Here are two charts based on data from the Ethnologue site:</p>

					<h2>Families of languages</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The most obvious way to classify languages is to consider where 
			they are spoken and how they relate to each other.<br />
			The results of such research are often interesting and colourful 
			maps of the world or regions with languages shown in terms of their 
			affinities and where they are spoken.&nbsp; Here's one, for example:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="language family map" height="311" src="../../images/language_map650.png" width="650" /></p>
			<p>We can, in fact, take a broader brush and locate some major 
			groups.&nbsp; The jury is still out concerning how languages are 
			classified in detail but the principle is that languages which are 
			related descend from a common ancestor, so, it follows, languages 
			within the same family should diverge over time rather than converge 
			due to borrowing and geographical proximity.&nbsp; The difference is 
			often explained as languages which have a genetic relationship as 
			opposed to languages which have what is called an areal 
			relationship.&nbsp; The former share a common proto-language 
			ancestor, the latter are not genetically related so any similarities 
			are caused by cultural influences on each other or by their 
			geographical proximity which has led to conquest or trade and 
			cultural mixing.<br />
			A good example is English which is a West Germanic languages, 
			closely related to Dutch and German but which has many borrowings 
			from French (to which it is less closely related) that can be 
			traced to the centuries following the Norman invasion in which 
			French rather than English was the language of the ruling elite.</p>
			<p>Here's a list:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Amerindian languages</dt>
				<dd>are indigenous to North and South America.<br />
				This is no longer considered a family of related languages but 
				is the term used to describe all American languages, north and 
				south, and includes, therefore, enormous variety.&nbsp; Examples 
				are Na-Dene, Chinook, Totonac and Yamana.</dd>
				<dt>Afro-Asian languages</dt>
				<dd>are indigenous to North and North-East Africa and the Middle 
				East and this group is sometimes called Hamito-Semitic.&nbsp; 
				There are some 350 languages in this group, spoken by around 350 
				million people.&nbsp; Examples are Hausa, Amharic, Berber, Arabic, Hebrew, Somali and 
				Cushitic.</dd>
				<dt>Niger-Congo languages</dt>
				<dd>are indigenous to sub-Saharan and Central Africa.&nbsp; 
				There are around 1500 languages in this group, spoken by about 
				350 million people.&nbsp; Examples are Igbo, Ewe, Swahili, Wolof and Ashuku.</dd>
				<dt>Bantu languages</dt>
				<dd>are indigenous to Southern Africa and this group is often 
				considered a sub-group of the Niger-Congo languages (above) from 
				which, arguably, they diverged when the Bantu migrations to the 
				East and South took place.&nbsp; 
				Estimates of the number of Bantu languages and native speakers 
				of them vary widely (between 200 and over 500 languages, spoken 
				by around 50 million people).&nbsp; Examples are Zulu, 
				Xhosa, Ndebele and Makhuwa.</dd>
				<dt>Indo-European languages</dt>
				<dd>are indigenous to Europe, Northern Asia and Southern Asia.&nbsp; 
				Although there are only 420 or so languages in this group, 
				Indo-European languages are spoken by around 3 billion people 
				making it the largest group of all – 6 out of 10 of the top 10 
				languages listed above are Indo-European.&nbsp; Examples are 
				English, Hindi, Russian, Greek and Spanish.&nbsp; Not all 
				European languages are Indo-European.</dd>
				<dt>Ural-Altaic languages</dt>
				<dd>are indigenous to Central Asia.&nbsp; This is a contested 
				grouping but, if the group exists at all as a separate family, examples 
				would include Finno-Ugric, Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic and Caucasian.&nbsp; 
				The designation of languages as Altaic is now largely 
				discredited (because of evidence of convergence caused by 
				borrowing and geographical proximity rather than divergence).&nbsp; 
				It still appears on many maps, including the one above.<br />
				One preferred designation is to split these languages into 
				separate independent families: Turkic 
				languages (of which there are around 30, stretching from 
				Istanbul to China and north to Siberia), Tungusic languages 
				(spoken in northern Russia and scattered across China), Mongolic 
				languages 
				(a group of languages centred on Mongolia), Caucasian languages 
				(spoken between the Black and Caspian seas) and Finno-Ugric 
				(Finnish, Estonian, Sami and Hungarian as well as some languages of 
				central Russia).</dd>
				<dt>Sino-Thai languages</dt>
				<dd>are indigenous to China and South-East Asia.&nbsp; This 
				group is frequently referred to as Sino-Tibetan.&nbsp; There are 
				around 420 languages in this group, spoken by 1.2 billion 
				people.&nbsp; Examples 
				include the Chinese languages, Vietnamese and Thai.</dd>
				<dt>Dravidian languages</dt>
				<dd>are indigenous to the southern tip of India and Sri Lanka 
				but widely spoken further north.&nbsp; There are only about 30 
				languages in this group but they are spoken by 200 or so million 
				people.&nbsp; Examples include Telugu, 
				Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam.</dd>
				<dt>Austronesian languages</dt>
				<dd>are indigenous to the Pacific Islands, the archipelagoes 
				between Asia and Australia and Madagascar.&nbsp; There are 
				around 1200 languages in this group, spoken by about 350 million 
				people.&nbsp; Examples 
				include Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Javanese, and Filipino 
				(Tagalog).</dd>
				<dt>Papuan and Australian languages</dt>
				<dd>are indigenous to Australia and Papua New Guinea and this 
				group is sometimes called Trans-New Guinea.&nbsp; 
				There's a huge range here with 500 languages spoken by 3 million 
				people.&nbsp; Examples include Warlpiri, Melpa, Enga, Ekari and Tiwi.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Hidden in the categories above is an enormous range of language 
			types and language groupings.&nbsp; As a piece of information it may 
			be interesting and, as a sign that you can identify your learners' 
			first languages, it may be impressive but as an aid to teaching languages, it is less useful.<br />
			A better guide is, in fact, a map of where languages are now spoken 
			rather than the indigenous languages categorised here.&nbsp; If you 
			take that approach, it is clear that in most of both North and South 
			America, Indo-European languages are prevalent (English, French, 
			Spanish and Portuguese).<br />
			You can, however, use language family information to make some 
			guesses about possible learner difficulties.&nbsp; If you know the 
			problems faced by speakers of one language, then you can be fairly 
			sure that speakers of closely related languages will have similar 
			issues.<br />
			Sub-families (such as Slavic, Germanic, Turkic, Semitic and so on) 
			are more helpful in this respect.</p>
			<h3>Isolates<br />
			<img alt="isolates" height="133" src="../../images/birds_penguin200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>There are a number of languages which belong to no recognisable 
			family and these are often presumed to be relic language which 
			escaped extinction by invading people who absorbed local languages 
			or wiped them out.<br />
			Well known examples include Basque, spoken in North-Western Spain 
			and South-Western France and Ainu, spoken in Japan and (previously) Eastern 
			Russia.&nbsp; There are many more around the world, some vibrant, 
			some dying, like Ainu, and some already extinct.&nbsp; Korean, too, may be 
			classified this way as the language has, so far, resisted scholars' 
			attempts to relate it to other languages 'genetically', so to speak.</p>
			<h3>Endangered languages<br />
			<img alt="tiger" height="133" src="../../images/animals_tiger200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>A few facts about language loss:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>In less than 100 years, half of the world's languages will 
				have become extinct.&nbsp; The last speakers of these languages 
				are probably alive today.</li>
				<li>Over 3500 languages in the world have, on average, fewer 
				than 2500 speakers.</li>
				<li>One tenth of the world's languages have fewer than 99 
				speakers and will be lost when those speakers die because they 
				are not being passed on.</li>
				<li>At current rates, we lose a language every 10 days or so and 
				the speed of extinction is accelerating.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When they are lost, languages are gone forever.&nbsp; Languages 
			(some of them at least) may be preserved in libraries, in recordings 
			and dictionaries but a stuffed dodo is no substitute for the living 
			animal.&nbsp; This kind of cultural damage has been compared to 
			dropping a bomb on The Louvre.<br />
			With the loss of a language, we lose forever ways of classifying and 
			thinking about the world, cultural attitudes and artefacts as well 
			as a resource for language students of the future.&nbsp; We do not 
			know what we are losing and, in the cases of many small languages, 
			we will never know because the language will cease to exist before 
			it can be studied.</p>

			</table>
			<p>A subset of mapping languages is a family tree approach akin to 
			biological taxonomy.<br />
			In this approach, an early source language is identified (often 
			called a proto-language) and the descent of a variety of languages 
			from it is mapped onto a family tree.&nbsp; It can be helpful and 
			informative for teaching purposes because it clearly shows which 
			languages are most closely related and will share similar structures 
			and lexicons.<br />
			Here's an example of a frequent family tree for <strong>some</strong> Indo-European 
			languages and similar diagrams can be drawn for other language 
			groups.&nbsp; Languages <span class="auto-style57"><strong>in black</strong></span> 
			are extinct and other extinct languages such as Anatolian, Cornish, 
			Prussian and other West Baltic languages and Tocharian are excluded 
			although modern, extant languages are often descended from them.&nbsp; 
			All the modern Italic languages, for example, are descended from 
			Latin but only Ecclesiastical Latin remains and other forms, 
			Classical and Vulgar Latin, are no longer spoken.&nbsp; Four extinct 
			languages can be identified as ancestors of modern Spanish.<br />
			Goidelic and 
			Brythonic refer to <strong>branches</strong> of 
			Celtic, not actual languages.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="ie" height="836" src="../../imagesgraphics/indoeuropean.jpg" width="700" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="auto-style56">
			There is a much more complete diagram in Wikipedia (go to
			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages for more).</p>
			<p>This diagram is not complete.&nbsp; West Baltic languages are all 
			extinct so not included here.&nbsp; There's another, slightly 
			simpler 
			tree in the guide to the roots of English, linked below in the list 
			of related guides, which is only concerned with setting English in 
			its geographical context.<br />
			It's fairly easy to draw some inferences from charts like this 
			concerning language kinship and similarities.<br />
			The further to the right you go in the diagram, the more akin the 
			languages will be.</p>
			<p>Indo-European languages are not confined to Europe and extend 
			eastwards and south-eastwards to include many in the Indian 
			subcontinent and central Asia group of languages known as 
			Indo-Iranian (a group which can be further subdivided): Persian, Balochi, Hindi, Sanskrit, Marathi, Punjabi, Gujurati, Nepali etc.&nbsp; 
			Approximately 1.5 billion people speak these languages.<br />
			On the other hand, not all European languages are Indo-European.&nbsp; 
			Maltese is a Semitic (i.e., Afro-Asian language), the equally 
			unrelated Finno-Ugric group includes Finnish, Hungarian, varieties 
			of Sami and Estonian and Basque, as we saw, is a relic isolate.<br />
			There are also speakers of Turkic languages within the usual 
			geographical borders of Europe and these include Turkish, Oghuz 
			languages and Oghur languages (most of which are extinct).</p>

			<p>If the diagram above is turned anticlockwise so that Proto-Indo-European lies 
			at the bottom and the rest of data form branches above it like a 
			tree, it resembles the familiar representation of the evolution of 
			species in the natural world.&nbsp; This is not entirely 
			coincidental, as Darwin and others have noted, because producing such a tree is often quite 
			informative in terms of seeing which languages evolved from which 
			and which went extinct or had no daughter languages.&nbsp;
			Darwin was not fully correct in calling this the same process but it 
			is strikingly similar.</p>
			<h3>Three conditions<br />
			<img alt="3" height="133" src="../../images/three_apples_a200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>For evolution to occur, three 
			pre-conditions must be met:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>There must be variation in the population of languages</li>
				<li>The variations must cause differential rates of 
				reproduction, survival and extinction</li>
				<li>The variation must be hereditable</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is not difficult to see how these three criteria are met in 
			the case of languages:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Individual languages vary and the variations are what is 
				needed for evolution to take place.&nbsp; The selection, by 
				whatever means, of one variety over another leads to language 
				change and development.&nbsp; This variation occurs in two ways:<ol class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li>synchronically:<br />
					individual speakers use slightly different varieties and may 
					select certain structures over others which are parallel.&nbsp; 
					They may use different sorts of language depending on the 
					setting (professional or personal, for example).<br />
					regional variations abound in all large and some small 
					languages so, in Britain for example, depending on the level 
					of detail investigated many hundreds of local varieties are 
					discernible.&nbsp; Worldwide, there are thousands of 
					varieties of English distinguished by accent and dialect.&nbsp; 
					From time to time, certain regions may become more powerful 
					or highly regarded than others and the variety spoken in 
					that region often becomes a new standard to which speakers 
					of other varieties may aspire or simulate.<br />
					within regions and countries, social class may determine 
					which variety of a language is spoken by its members.<br />
					register, the field in which the language is used, will also 
					lead to the development of various argots confined to a 
					profession or interest group such as IT-speak, 
					management-ese and so on<br />
					the ages of speakers is also a source of variety and 
					references to teenage slang or whatever are common across a 
					range of languages</li>
					<li>diachronically:<br />
					languages we know, change quite rapidly over time and 
					changes are discernible in single generations.&nbsp; English 
					spoken 1000 years ago would, for example, be barely 
					comprehensible to someone living today and the process shows 
					little sign of stopping.&nbsp; All languages do this.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Some languages and some variations may be perceived as 
				having higher status or utility and be preferentially selected 
				by speakers as their dialect or language of choice.&nbsp; Some 
				may be rejected.&nbsp; This will result in a differential with 
				some varieties succeeding and going on to reproduce and vary 
				down the generations and some being discarded and going extinct.<br />
				Within languages certain lexical choices and structural elements 
				may be lost and others may be selected and flourish.&nbsp; For 
				example, in English, the once almost obligatory use of <em>shall</em> 
				instead of <em>will</em> for first-person subjects is fast dying 
				out and the use of <em>Have you</em> as the question form is 
				going the same way as <em>Have you got</em> or <em>Do you have</em> 
				become more frequent.&nbsp; The word <em>incredibly</em>, once 
				confined to mean <em>not believably</em> has quite rapidly come 
				to mean <em>very</em> and one almost never encounters people 
				describing something as <em>awfully interesting </em>or <em>
				terribly nice</em> as was once, not so very long ago, common.&nbsp; 
				The word <em>wireless</em> is now rarely used, except by seniors 
				to mean <em>radio</em>.&nbsp; The list of quite recent changes 
				in English could be made very much longer and similar effects 
				are observable in other languages, especially large ones with 
				very variable populations of speakers.&nbsp; In German, for 
				example, the use of the genitive case with certain prepositions 
				is declining and the dative case is often chosen (i.e., 
				selected) preferentially.<br />
				At the level of whole languages, similar processes are at work.&nbsp;
				How this happens is complex but a number of the world's 
				indigenous languages are in danger of extinction because<ol class="auto-style51">
					<li>they co-exist geographically with a more dominant 
					language which may be perceived as being of higher status 
					and utility in terms of employment and progression.<br />
					For example many languages spoken in Russia are endangered 
					(or already extinct) because their speakers have been lured 
					by the attractions of speaking the language of the dominant 
					power centres.&nbsp; The same applies to the influence of 
					Spanish in South America and the extinction of indigenous 
					language and in the influence of English in North America.&nbsp; 
					In other words, the dominant language has survived because 
					it has been selected and the small language will go or has 
					gone extinct.</li>
					<li>they have been deliberately targeted for extinction by 
					government policy.&nbsp; For nearly three centuries, for 
					example, speaking Welsh was forbidden in schools and 
					children were beaten on a regular basis for doing so.&nbsp; 
					In the late 18th century the suppression of all languages 
					except French in France became government policy.&nbsp; The 
					suppression of non-French languages, including Breton and 
					many others continued until the middle of the 20th century.&nbsp; 
					In this century efforts continue to be made by the 
					government of Singapore to suppress Singlish.<br />
					To some degree this kind of deliberate intervention is akin 
					to artificially selecting plants for the cropping 
					characteristics or domestic animals for their meat or milk 
					producing abilities.&nbsp; Dogs and cats, as well as 
					pigeons, have also been artificially selected for utility, 
					appearance or disposition.</li>
					<li>they offer more utility than other languages.&nbsp; 
					Smaller languages tend to fare poorly in competition with 
					widely spoken and economically major languages.&nbsp; While 
					there is growing resistance to this effect, it is still the 
					case that people in many parts of the world prefer to adopt 
					(i.e., select) an international language rather than stick with their own 
					for economic, educational and social reasons.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Languages are not inherited biologically but they are 
				certainly inherited culturally.&nbsp; A baby taken from one 
				culture and raised in another will speak the language of the 
				culture in which it has been raised, not where it was born.&nbsp; 
				That language changes as it passes down the generations of 
				speakers is not in doubt and beneficial changes will be passed 
				on while neutral or detrimental innovations (or those perceived 
				as such by large sections of the speech community) may flourish 
				for a time and then die out.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are other ways in which the evolution of species in the 
			natural world and the evolution of languages are parallel:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The amount of variation between related languages is 
				proportional to the amount of time the languages have had to 
				develop their peculiar characteristics.&nbsp; The same is true 
				of species and, although humans are related to fish (and 
				bacteria for that matter), we are more closely related to other 
				primates because the amount of time since our lineage separated 
				from that of fish is relatively much greater than the 7 or so 
				million years that have elapsed since humans and apes went their 
				separate ways.<br />
				In terms of language, some 6000 years ago, the first speakers of 
				Proto-Indo-European began to immigrate into Europe.&nbsp; Since 
				then, the original language has split into at least six 
				different branches each containing a range of mutually 
				incomprehensible but related languages.&nbsp; English may be 
				related to Greek but no-one would consider the two languages to 
				be dialects of a common tongue.&nbsp; The language of Chaucer, 
				who died in 1400, causes speakers of Modern English serious 
				comprehension difficulties.&nbsp; By contrast, Shakespeare 
				died in 1616 but the language in which he wrote is recognisable 
				and almost entirely comprehensible to a speaker of Modern 
				English.&nbsp; It is a reasonable bet that it won't be in 
				another 400 years.</li>
				<li style="height: 289px">Separation of populations leads to 
				speciation in the natural world and so it is for languages.&nbsp; 
				When populations speaking a common language become separated, by 
				emigration, natural events or whatever, language differences may 
				increase between the populations until the point at which a 
				wholly separate and mutually incomprehensible language has been 
				established.<br />
				A commonly cited example is the diversion in usages between the 
				standard dialect of English spoken in the USA and that spoken in the UK.&nbsp; 
				Although the differences rarely degrade comprehension there are 
				some obvious lexical and structural differences which have 
				emerged as the populations remained separate.&nbsp; There is a 
				countervailing force, which includes the influences of cinema, TV and other media, 
				which may be acting to force the varieties to converge &ndash; 
				hence the common complaints about the Americanizing of British 
				English – and the outcome, a common dialect or two separate and 
				increasing mutually incomprehensible languages, is still in 
				doubt.<br />
				As another example, Bantu languages originated in the area of Africa 
				around Cameroon between 300 and 5000 years ago (estimates vary), 
				and today, thanks to major shifts in populations, which 
				subsequently became isolated and separated from the mother 
				language, there are over 
				500 separate Bantu languages which are related but mutually 
				incomprehensible spoken by around 30% of the population of the 
				African continent.<br />
				Icelandic spoken today has much in common with the languages 
				spoken in Scandinavia hundreds of years ago because the 
				populations became separated.&nbsp; That is not to say that 
				Modern Icelandic has not developed and evolved from earlier 
				sources but that it has done so differently and, perhaps, more 
				slowly.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Two differences<br />
			<img alt="2" height="133" src="../../images/two_doors200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>That said, there are also two very significant differences 
			between the evolutionary history of languages and that of species in 
			the natural world.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It is misleading to imagine that earlier languages which 
				have later split and evolved into a range of mutually 
				incomprehensible but related languages are somehow less well 
				formed, advanced or sophisticated.&nbsp; Old English, for 
				example, was in many respects more sophisticated and complex 
				with markings for gender, tense and case which have been erased 
				in the intervening 1500 years or so.&nbsp; Ancient Greek, too, 
				was more complex in this regard than is Modern Greek but neither 
				can sensibly be described as more or less advanced than the 
				other.<br />
				It is true, too, incidentally, that single-celled organisms 
				appear less advanced than walking, thinking multicellular 
				animals such as humans but investigation has shown staggering 
				levels of complexity in their biochemical makeup.&nbsp; Bacteria 
				may be less sophisticated in certain ways than higher animals 
				but they are arguably much more successful and resilient.</li>
				<li>In general, natural organisms acquire their characteristics 
				(the phenotype) by the transfer of genetic material down the generations although what is known as horizontal gene 
				transfer occurs quite frequently, especially among bacteria.&nbsp; 
				Thus it is that, as a general rule, species evolve by taking 
				advantage of variations within themselves rather than by 
				importing variation from other species.<br />
				Languages, on the other hand are carried by people and people 
				move and interact so it is more than fairly common for languages 
				to borrow words and structures from other languages.&nbsp; 
				English, for example, has interacted with Norse languages and 
				with Norman French due to successive invasions and trading 
				relationships.&nbsp; It is not surprising, therefore, that there 
				has been considerable horizontal transfer and that English 
				exhibits both lexical and structural aspects resulting from 
				borrowings.&nbsp; Vietnamese, too, as another example, has 
				imported reflexive and passive markers from Chinese languages 
				along with a good deal of its lexicon.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So, in summary, languages evolve and change over time and through space, 
			with the common result of the rise of a wholly new language, by a process is uncannily similar to the working 
			of natural selection in evolutionary terms.<br />
			There is some debate whether the influence of global culture through 
			the media, the internet and as yet unknown forces will accelerate or 
			hinder the development of languages and language differences.&nbsp; 
			It may do both.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>Having summarised language variation and evolution, we are now 
			ready to go and see how languages differ.</p>

			</table>
			<p>By far the most useful way to classify language for teaching 
			purposes is by their structures.&nbsp; To do this we need to look 
			briefly at the concept of the morpheme.</p>
			<p>A morpheme is a meaningful unit of a language which cannot be 
			further broken down.<br />
			For example, in the word <em>washing</em> there are two morphemes:
			<em>wash</em> and <em>ing</em>.&nbsp; The first can stand alone 
			and retain its meaning so is an <strong>unbound or free morpheme</strong>.&nbsp; 
			The second can only function as part of a word (here denoting the 
			action of washing or the progressive nature of washing) so it is a
			<strong>bound morpheme</strong>.<br />
			Bound morphemes come in two sorts:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>those that make things like past tenses, possessives and 
				plurals are called inflexional morphemes.&nbsp; An example is 
				the<em> -ed</em> ending on a verb in the past tense in English.</li>
				<li>those that concern deriving one word from another are called 
				derivational morphemes.&nbsp; Examples are deriving <em>impolite</em> 
				from <em>polite</em> with the <em>im</em> morpheme or deriving
				<em>hopeful</em> from <em>hope</em> with the <em>ful</em> 
				morpheme.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As a simple test, break the following down into its morphemes and
			<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'morpheme',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			then click here.</a></p>
			<p class="auto-style66"><em>John's closeness to his brothers appeared obvious.</em></p>
			<p id="morpheme" class="auto-style49" style="visibility: hidden">
			<strong><em>John</em></strong>: a free morpheme as a proper noun<br />
			<strong><em>'s</em></strong>: a bound inflexional morpheme denoting 
			possession or a characteristic<br />
			<strong><em>close</em></strong>: a free morpheme (adjective in this case)<br />
			<strong><em>ness</em></strong>: a bound derivational morpheme denoting a noun<br />
			<strong><em>to</em></strong>: a free morpheme (preposition)<br />
			<strong><em>his</em>:</strong> a free morpheme denoting genitive case<br />
			<strong><em>brother</em></strong>: a free morpheme as a common noun<br />
			<strong><em>s</em></strong>: a bound inflexional morpheme denoting plural<br />
			<strong><em>appear</em></strong>: a free morpheme (a verb)<br />
			<strong><em>ed</em></strong>: a bound inflexional morpheme denoting past 
			tense<br />
			<strong><em>obvious</em></strong>: a free morpheme</p>
			<p>Although there are a number of problems with morphemic analysis, 
			it is central to the science of language typology, as we shall 
			shortly see.</p>
			<p>Because no languages fall neatly into any particular category, it 
			makes some sense to arrange them on a cline from language which use 
			lots of morphemes to signal grammatical and derivational relationships and those 
			which use none or very few.</p>
			<p>To do this we can look at the number of morphemes per word.&nbsp; 
			In, for example, the English word <em>house</em>, we have a single 
			stand-alone, free morpheme.&nbsp; The ratio of morphemes to words is 1:1.<br />
			In the word <em>housemates</em> by contrast, we have three morphemes in one 
			word (<em>house, mate</em> and <em>s</em>).&nbsp; That makes the 
			morpheme to word ratio 3:1.</p>
			<p>In our example above (chosen to illustrate what morphemes are) we 
			have 11 morphemes and 7 words, a ratio close to 2:1.</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>Languages which have a generally low ratio of morphemes to words 
			tend to the <strong>isolating</strong> end of the spectrum.</li>
				<li>Languages which have high numbers of morphemes per word tend to the
				<strong>synthetic</strong> end.</li>
				<li>Languages which lie somewhere in the middle using, as English does, 
			a low number of inflexions but having a rich variety of derivational 
			morphemes are usually described as <strong>analytic</strong>.</li>
			</ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will see you tomorrow<br />
				</em>in which all the words are single free morphemes.&nbsp; In 
				French on the other hand, that would be<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; je te verrai demain.<br />
				</em>in which the verb form 
				includes the signal for 1st person singular and the sense of future, not signalled by 
				another free morpheme such as <em>will</em>.&nbsp; French is not 
				a very analytical language and certainly not isolating.<br />
				Some languages will not use grammatical, inflexional morphemes 
				but are replete with derivational morphemes.&nbsp; In Mandarin 
				there are no morphemes to signal plurals, for example, but 
				compounding of words is frequent.</li>
				<li><strong>synthetic languages</strong><br />
				use affixation and inflexion to a great extent and have a high 
				morpheme to word ratio.&nbsp; To make this clear, a short 
				language lesson may help.<br />
				For example, in Greek a verb 
				ending may signal person, gender and tense <strong>at the same 
				time </strong>and in French the 
				verb system exhibits similar characteristics.<br />
				For example, the past tense of <em>we arrive</em> in English is 
				simply <em>we arrived</em> with a single -<em>d </em>morpheme 
				attached to show tense.&nbsp; In French and Greek, the situation 
				is different:<em><br />
				</em>French: one translation is <em>nous arrivons </em>where the 
				verb form shows both tense and person.<em><br />
				</em>Greek: The pronoun marker will not usually be present 
				because the verb form<em> φτάσαμε [ftasamay] </em>shows tense, 
				person and number by its form.<em><br />
				</em>In German, Russian and other related 
				languages noun and adjective endings as well as articles will 
				signal case and number consistently.<br />
				For example, in English, there is no change to the articles, 
				verbs, nouns and adjectives in<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</em>A: <em>The teacher gave the children the red book<br />
				</em>and<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</em>B: <em>The children gave the teacher the red book</em><br />
				We can also say<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				C: <em>The red book is now on the shelf</em><br />
				and the nouns, the adjective and the articles remain unchanged.<br />
				However, in German, the sentences show changes to word forms to 
				signal what was given by whom to whom and where things are:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A: <em>Die Kinder gab<span class="orangeitalic">en</span> d<span class="orangeitalic">em</span> 
				Lehrer das rot<span class="orangeitalic">e</span> Buch<br />
				</em>in 
				which the plural form of the verb shows number and person, the article 
				forms show case [nominative <em>children</em>, accusative <em>
				book</em> and dative <em>teacher</em>]<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				B: <em>D<span class="orangeitalic">er</span> Lehrer gab d<span class="orangeitalic">en</span> 
				Kinder<span class="orangeitalic">n</span> das rot<span class="orangeitalic">e</span> 
				Buch<br />
				</em>where the article, <em>der</em>, shows a singular 
				person who did the giving, the article, <em>den</em>, shows who 
				received the book and that the recipients are plural and the <em>-e</em> ending on the adjective shows the singular nature of 
				book [plural would be <em>d<span class="orangeitalic">ie</span> 
				rot<span class="orangeitalic">en</span> B<span class="orangeitalic">ü</span>ch<span class="orangeitalic">er</span></em> 
				with a change to the article, the adjective ending and two 
				changes to the noun to show number].<br />The third sentence appears as 
				<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				C: <em>D<span class="orangeitalic">as</span> rot<span class="orangeitalic">e</span> 
				Buch ist jetzt auf d<span class="orangeitalic">em</span> Regal<br />
				</em>where the articles and the adjective are all inflected to 
				show case.<br />Incidentally, if the article is absent, its neuter 
				<em>-s</em> 
				ending is transferred to the adjective and we get <em>rot<span class="orangeitalic">es</span> 
				Buch</em>.<br />As with everything in this area, however, there are degrees of 
				synthetic tendencies.<ol class="auto-style51">
					<li>Some languages also have <strong>agglutinative</strong> 
					characteristics which means that ideas are joined together 
					within words to make new meanings.<br />For example, in German, we can have 
					<em>Hauptbahnhofgastst&auml;tte
					</em>which breaks down roughly as <em>main + line + yard + 
					guest + place</em> and means the <em>main railway station 
					restaurant</em>.&nbsp; Recently, an initiative was referred 
					to in Germany as<br /><em>Das 
					Bundeswehrattraktivitätsteigerungsgesetz<br /></em>which is
					<em>federal + army + attractiveness + increase + law</em> 
					and means an attempt to increase the attractiveness of the 
					armed forces after the ending of compulsory military 
					service.&nbsp; Turkish, Japanese and many other language 
					exhibit agglutination and it is arguable that English does, 
					too, with concepts such as <em>child protection agency</em>
					being treated as single words for the purposes of stress (on 
					the first element) and pluralisation (on the last).&nbsp; It 
					is merely a convention to write this as three words and 
					German wouldn't.</li>
					<li>At the extreme end of the synthetic spectrum we have 
					languages described as <strong>polysynthetic</strong> in 
					which long strings of morphemes occur, each signifying a 
					single meaning with a mix of derivational and grammatical 
					morphemes.&nbsp; Few languages exhibit this to any extent 
					but there are some, such as Mohawk where it is possible to 
					produce a single word which can only be rendered as a 
					sentence in an analytical language like English.&nbsp; E.g.,<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; washakotya'tawitsherahetkvhta'se<br />
					</em>means<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
					ruined her dress<br />
					</em>strictly<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made 
					the-thing-that-one-puts-on-one's body ugly for her</em>).<br />

			<ul class="redbulletlist">

			<p>There are three areas to consider here and they all have 
			immediate and obvious consequences for language teachers.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Tonal languages</strong></dt>
				<dd>All Chinese languages along with related languages in the Sino-Thai 
			family (Burmese, Thai, Vietnamese etc.) exhibit tonal distinctions 
			between words.<br />
				Many Chinese languages have four tones:<br />
			Rising<br />
			Falling<br />
			Level<br />
			Fall-rise<br />
			A word may change its meaning completely when pronounced with these 
			four tones.<br />
				For example, the sound [ta] in Szechuanese pronounced with a falling 
			tone means <em>to answer</em> but when it is pronounced with a level tone, it 
				means <em>to beat</em> and when it is produced with a fall-rise 
				tone, it means <em>big</em>.<br />
				A few African languages and some North American ones are 
			also tonal and some European ones such as Swedish and Norwegian also
			make use of tone to distinguish meaning.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Pitch-accent languages</strong></dt>
				<dd>Japanese is often referred to as a pitch-accent language 
				where one class of words consistently has a high pitch on the 
				stressed syllable followed by a low pitch.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Stress distinctions</strong></dt>
				<dd>In some languages, the stress always falls on the same 
				syllable (Hungarian and French for example).&nbsp; Others, such 
				as Greek and Russian make use of stress changes to distinguish 
				words.&nbsp; For example, in Greek πότε [p<span class="style_underline"><strong>o</strong></span>tay] 
			means <em>when</em> (as in a question) but when the stress moves to the end 
			as in ποτέ [pot<span class="style_underline"><strong>ay</strong></span>] it means 
				<em>never</em>.&nbsp; In Russian, and some other Slavic 
			languages, similar things happen.<br />
				In English, too, stress changes 
			sometimes denote changes in word class (<em>ex<span class="style_underline"><strong>port</strong></span></em> 
				[verb] vs. <span class="style_underline"><strong><em>ex</em></strong></span><em>port</em> 
				[noun] and 
			<em>inc<span class="style_underline"><strong>rease</strong></span></em> 
				[verb] vs. <em><span class="style_underline"><strong>in</strong></span>crease</em> 
				[noun], for example).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Stress and syllable timing</strong></dt>
			<dd>The following is the theory.<br />
			There are, it is claimed, two fundamental forms of stressing.<br />
			In some languages, such as French, Italian, Spanish, Cantonese and 
			Mandarin, every syllable is <em>perceived</em> as taking up the same 
			amount of time.&nbsp; This is the so-called 'machine gun' sound of 
			these languages.&nbsp; So we get:<em><br />
			<span class="auto-style4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ... went ... to ... Lon ... don ... with 
			... my ... bro ... ther</span></em><br />
			That's <strong>syllable timing</strong>.<br />
			In other languages, notably English, Dutch, Farsi and Scandinavian 
			languages, some syllables take longer to utter than others and this 
			results in a reduction of the syllables in between.&nbsp; So we get<em><br />
			<span class="auto-style4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iwentto ... <strong>L o n </strong>d'n ... 
			withmy ... <strong>b r o</strong> the(r)</span><br />
			</em>That's <strong>stress timing</strong>.<em><br />
			</em>For this reason, the preposition <em>to</em> is not pronounced 
			in its full form as /tuː/ (rhyming with 'two' and 'too') but with a 
			weak form of the vowel /tə/.<br />
			Be aware that even if this distinction exists, it is not an 
			either-or one.&nbsp; Languages will vary along a cline from 
			syllable- to stress-timing tendencies.<br />
			There is, in fact, a third form of timing: Mora timing.&nbsp; In 
			Japanese, e.g., a vowel (V) takes the same time to utter as a consonant 
			(C) plus a vowel so V takes the same time as CV and CVV takes twice 
			as long as CV.<br />
			Because English is a stress-timed language (allegedly), many 
			vowels are reduced in rapid, connected speech so, e.g., <em>for</em> 
			is pronounced /fə/ (not /fɔː/), <em>been </em>is heard as /bɪn/<em>
			</em>(not /biːn/, <em>we</em> is heard as /wɪ/ and so on.<br />
			Here's a list but there is a cline from stress- 
			to syllable-timed languages.&nbsp; It is not an either-or 
			distinction.<br />

			<p>It is rather too obvious that languages differ in the words that 
			they use.&nbsp; In fact, one of the ways to decide whether a variety 
			is a language and a dialect is to look at the differences in the 
			lexicons.<br />
			A lexicon, for our purposes my be defined as
			<span class="style_black"><em>the complete set of meaningful units 
			in a language</em></span> and the focus on <span class="style_black">
			<em>meaningful units</em></span> rather than simply <em>words</em> 
			is important.&nbsp; In many languages, meaningful units may signal 
			grammatical or other features rather than individual concepts.&nbsp; 
			For example, in Thai a particle is used to signal that what follows 
			is in the past tense and other languages employ similar conventions 
			for other grammatical categories.&nbsp; These items are meaningful 
			but not the equivalent of words in the commonly accepted meaning.<br />
			The term <span class="style_black"><em>meaningful</em></span>, too, 
			is quite difficult to define.&nbsp; For example, a word such as <em>
			about</em>, standing alone, may signify no meaning at all but in a 
			phrase such as <em>about the money</em> it clearly does have a 
			meaning.<br />
			The term <span class="style_black"><em>unit</em></span> in the 
			definition may apply to items which are not words in the commonly 
			accepted sense.&nbsp; For example, the item <em>ish</em> in English 
			would not be recognised by most people as a word but it certainly 
			carries meaning when combined with other items so <em>cheapish</em> 
			can be distinguished in meaning from <em>cheap</em>.&nbsp; The item 
			is, therefore, part of the English lexicon.<br />
			It will come as no surprise that languages differ in the ways that 
			meaningful units work.</p>
			<h3>How we see the world<br />
			<img alt="earth" height="133" src="../../images/earth_a200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>Words and other meaningful units in a language do not come ready 
			made.&nbsp; They are used to describe and comment on the world 
			around us and what words mean is wholly arbitrary.&nbsp; We cannot, 
			for example, understand the meaning of <em>pasaulyje</em> by looking 
			at it but it is clear to any Lithuanian speaker that it means <em>
			world</em> in English.&nbsp; The meanings of words are decided by 
			the speech community of the language.<br />
			It is, however, reasonably clear to the words <em>mundo, monde, 
			mondu</em> which come from six different languages, being identical 
			in at least two, are closely connected and all mean <em>world</em>.<br />
			It is a truism that closely related languages, Italic ones in this 
			case, will often share lexical items which are either identical or 
			so closely related as to be easily guessable.&nbsp; These are not 
			loan words transmitted between languages, they are real cognates and 
			all derive from the Latin <em>mundus</em> (which, in turn, may 
			derive from the Etruscan, an extinct non-Indo-European language).<br />
			Languages which have recognisably similar lexicons, will usually 
			have derived from the same roots.</p>
			<p>Terms such as <em>world</em> are more or less readily 
			translatable into many languages and will often mean exactly the 
			same thing in all of them but that is not the case for lots of other 
			words, some of which are confined to cultures which had need of them 
			and are absent in cultures that had none.<br />
			For example, most languages around the world will have a single term 
			for the animal <em>reindeer</em>.&nbsp; It is rendered that way in English 
			and as <em>rendier</em> in Dutch and Afrikaans, as <em>Rentier</em> in German, 
			<em>renna</em> in Italian, <em>ceirw</em> in Welsh and so on.&nbsp; 
			However, in languages whose people rely or relied extensively on 
			reindeer for food, milk, clothing, traction and so on there are as 
			many as 12 different words for the animal classified by age, sex, 
			usefulness, readiness for breeding and so on.&nbsp; These words 
			exist because the culture needed them and do not exist in languages 
			whose cultures had no need to express such fine details.<br />
			(It is not, incidentally true that Eskimo languages have 40 words 
			for snow; only two are substantiated, one meaning snow on the ground 
			and the other snow in the air.)<br />
			If you live in a culture in which it is important to distinguish 
			between an uncle who is your father's brother and an uncle that is 
			your mother's brother, it is a fair bet that your language will 
			distinguish the relationships in words.&nbsp; In other cultures with 
			other priorities, the language will reflect the different importance 
			of various relationships.<br />
			Culturally specific names for things that are crucial to speakers of 
			a particular language will often parallel names in other languages 
			which may not share the same roots linguistically but do share 
			cultural characteristics.<br />
			This is root of much borrowing, of course, so words such as <em>
			computer</em> and <em>goal</em> are English but appear in hundreds 
			of languages worldwide because they were taken on when the language 
			had need of the concept but no word to represent it.</p>
			<p>Within separate languages words may, however, drift in meaning 
			and when that happens the cognate words may become false friends: 
			looking the same and deriving from the same root but meaning 
			different things.<br />
			There is a separate guide on this site to cognates and false 
			friends, linked below, which also considers what a false cognate is.</p>

			<p>You are right.&nbsp; Some of the more abstruse and theoretical 
			areas of language typology research and analysis are very

			teachers.&nbsp; We certainly don't need all the technical

				<li>An insight into our learners' languages so we can anticipate
