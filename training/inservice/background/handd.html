				<h2>Definitions of methodology</h2>

			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are two common ways to define methodology in English 
			Language Teaching and, graphically, this is how they look:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="methodologies" src="../../imagesgraphics/methodologies.png" /></p>
			<p>The left-hand set was developed by Anthony in 1963.&nbsp; The 
			right-hand set was developed from Anthony's definition later and 
			appears in Richards and Rogers, 2001.&nbsp; Briefly:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Approach</strong></dt>
				<dd>For Anthony, an approach was simply a 
				set of principles or ideas about the nature of language learning<br />
				For Richards and Rogers it was similar but explicitly divided 
				into theories of what language is and theories of how learning a 
				foreign language happens.<br />
				The second of these definitions has the advantage of being quite 
				explicit.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Method or Design</strong></dt>
				<dd>For Anthony, method described the plan for the presentation 
				of language which is consistent with the approach.<br />
				Richards and Rogers' concept of design is somewhat broader and 
				covered the practical implications in the classroom: syllabus 
				design, activities and the roles of teachers and students<br />
				These are not all that different but again, the latter one is 
				more explicit.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Technique or Procedure</strong></dt>
				<dd>Technique, for Anthony, was simple any teaching trick or way 
				of doing something in the classroom such as eliciting, 
				approaching a reading text, encouraging authentic speaking, 
				drill and so on.<br />
				For Richards and Rogers, too, the term procedure refers to what 
				we see happening in the classroom when a particular approach and 
				design are implemented, day to day.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>It actually doesn't matter all that much which breakdown you 
			accept.&nbsp; Both are fairly arbitrary and subjective ways of 
			breaking down a complex area.</p>

		<p>The authority in this area is Howatt (1984) and he traces the 
		development of English Language Teaching far further back than most 
		people realise it goes.&nbsp; He records the use of dialogues, often parallel 
		translation ones, to <em>demonstrate</em> rather than <em>inform</em>.&nbsp; 
		Here's an example, taken from a set of materials enabling French 
		speakers (probably Huguenots who fled to England from France in the late 17th and 
		early 18th centuries) to compare the English way of expressing things 
		with their own language.<br />
		It is from Guy Miège (1685), <em>Nouvelle méthode pour apprendre 
		l'Anglais</em>.&nbsp; It could just as well be used by an English 
		speaker to learn French.</p>

		<p>And so on.&nbsp; This is not too far removed from many modern course

		<h2>Grammar-translation approaches</h2>
				<p class="auto-style10">The 19th century saw the first fundamental change.&nbsp; The 
				importance given to the study of Latin and Greek as a way of 
				accessing ancient literature bled over into the teaching of 
				modern languages, too.&nbsp; The approach had (and, indeed, 
				still has) five main strains:</p>
				<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>Conscious memorising of grammatical rules</li>
					<li>Focusing on the sentence as the unit of study</li>
					<li>Conscious memorising of lists of lexis with their 
					mother-tongue translations</li>
					<li>Translating in and out of the target language as 
					practice</li>
					<li>Reading the literature of the target language</li>
				</ul>
				
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="2" class="auto-style17">
				<p>The aim 
					of the approach was primarily to allow the student 
					access to the literature of the target language.&nbsp; Few 
					people travelled widely and there was little need or 
					opportunity to encounter native speakers or to communicate 
					in the way that, e.g., Huguenot immigrants needed to find 
					the cheapest coffee shops with free tobacco.</p>
				
				Grammar translation is not, as some fondly imagine, a thing of 
				the past.&nbsp; Its influence is widely felt.&nbsp; Many 
				self-help teaching manuals (such as the earlier versions of the 
				popular Teach Yourself ... series of books) involve the setting 
				out of grammar rules, followed by a list of translated lexis to 
				learn and then exercises (including translation) to practise 
				what has been studied.&nbsp; Secondary (and even primary) 
				schools around the world adopt the approach consistently and it 
				may have been part of your learning experience.<br class="auto-style18" />
				(Since 2012 the Teach Yourself series has abandoned 
				the presentation of rules in favour of a so-called 'discovery 
				method' which encourages the learner to figure out the rules 
				from the examples.&nbsp; More later on the difference in these 
				approaches to rule-learning.)<br />

				<h2>Reactions to grammar-translation approaches and the Reform Movement</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br />
		Starting in the 19th century and continuing to the present, the 
		grammar-translation approach has been criticised primarily because it 
		focuses on form at the expense of meaning and communicative ability.&nbsp; 
		Many early critics drew on analogies with how we learn our first 
		language.&nbsp; By the end of the century, the Reform Movement's 
		fundamental principles had been established by Henry Sweet as:<br />
		<span class="auto-style8"><em>the primacy of speech, the centrality of 
		the connected text as the kernel of the teaching-learning process, and 
		the absolute priority of an oral methodology in the classroom </em>
		(in Howatt, op cit.: 171)</span><p>Methods arising from the Reform Movement include two which are still 
		significantly influential:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The Natural Method which sought to emulate the ways in which 
			children learn their first language and</li>
			<li>The Direct Method which arose from it and was popularised by 
			Maximilian Berlitz and still in use in many schools.&nbsp; The 
			Berlitz Method is now a registered trade mark.&nbsp; The Direct 
			Method was so called because it insists that only the target 
			language is used from day one of the course and meaning is conveyed 
			by pointing, gestures, tone of voice etc.&nbsp; Of course, today, 
			many methods take a similar approach, denigrating or forbidding the 
			use of translation.</li>

				<h2>The Oral Approach or Situational Language Teaching</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
				<p>Early in the 20th century, there arose 
				in the UK an approach to teaching which relied on two 
				principles:</p>
				<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>
					<p class="auto-style13">That language should be taught and 
					presented in a social context: a situation.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p class="auto-style12">That the focus of the syllabus 
					should be on word order, inflexion and the distinction between 
					structural words and content words.&nbsp; (For more on this 
					distinction, see
					<a href="../../initial/lexis/functionwords.html" target="_blank">the 
					guide to function words</a> on this site.)</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The outcome of this was productive and 
				many teaching materials still rely heavily on 
				presenting language, often via dialogues, in settings such as 'at 
				the coffee shop' or 'in the station' etc.&nbsp; You are probably 
				familiar with some of them.<br />
				As two of the founders of the approach state<em><br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The language a person originates ... is always expressed for a 
				purpose.</span><br />
				</em><span class="auto-style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Frisby and Halliday in Richards and 
				Rogers (2014: 48).</span><br />
				The approach's view about how languages are learned rested on 
				the same basis as the audio-lingual approach (see below).</p>

		<p class="auto-style14">In order for a methodology to be truly recognisable 
		as such, it is arguable that it needs to have a consistent theoretical 
		basis.&nbsp; Audio-lingualism's claim to have these rests on:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>A theory of language</strong>: structural 
					linguistics<br />
					Simply put, this is the theory that language is primarily 
					spoken and understandable in terms of increasing level of 
					complexity: from phonemes, up through morphemes to words, 
					phrases, clauses and sentences.&nbsp; To this day, the 
					theory underlies most structural syllabuses.&nbsp; (For 
					more, see <a href="syllabusdesign.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
					syllabus design</a>.)</li>
					<li>
					<p><strong>A theory of learning</strong>: behavioural 
					psychology<br />
					Behaviourism rest on the belief, reinforced by laboratory 
					experiments on animals, that learning constitutes the 
					acquisition of new habits.&nbsp; This theory was made 
					explicitly relevant to language learning in Skinner's famous 
					statement that:<br />
					<span class="auto-style8"><em>We have no reason to assume 
					... that verbal behaviour differs in any fundamental respect 
					from non-verbal behaviour, or that any new principles must

					</li>
				</ol>
				</td>

		<p>Behaviourism is the theory of learning that still underlies how you 
		train your dog or drill your learners' pronunciation.&nbsp; It can be 
		visualised like this:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="behaviourism" height="212" src="../../imagesgraphics/behaviourism599.png" width="599" /></p>
		<p>Briefly, and somewhat unscientifically:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The process starts with a stimulus, say, a question from the 
			teacher such as <em>Where did you go yesterday?</em> put to the 
			organism (in this case, a learner of English).&nbsp; The stimulus 
			can elicit a variety of responses but only the 'right' one will be 
			reinforced.</li>
			<li>So, for example, if the organism responds with <em>I go to the 
			cinema </em>the teacher will negatively reinforce it with <em>No, 
			that's wrong</em> or simply not reinforce it by saying nothing.</li>
			<li>If, on the other hand, the organism produces the preferred 
			response, <em>I went to the cinema</em> the teacher will reinforce 
			it with <em>Yes, that's right!</em> (preferably in a loud and 
			enthusiastic voice because the strength of the reinforcement is 
			critical in instilling the correct habit).&nbsp; In this case, the 
			reward is the teacher's approval but it could just as well be a 
			chocolate biscuit.</li>
			<li>Enough Stimulus &gt; Response &gt; Reinforcement cycles will see the 
			habit instilled and the language acquired.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Audio-lingualism is still a very influential approach.&nbsp; It 
		underlies drilling language in the classroom, setting mechanical (and 
		not so mechanical) exercises, exposing learners to patterns of language, 
		repetition of language and much else.&nbsp; The concept that good 
		language habits are born of repeated practice and exposure is by no 
		means unknown in almost all classrooms.<br />
		The idea that learners can figure out rules unconsciously for 
		themselves, given enough data to work on and exposure to language 
		samples that exemplify the rule we would like them to acquire, underlies 
		much of modern inductive learning approaches in the classroom.&nbsp; 
		More on the meaning of 'inductive' follows.&nbsp; But first, we need to 
		consider the criticisms which have been levelled at behaviourism.</p>
		<p>Unsurprisingly, this approach to language learning (or any 
		understanding of behaviour in humans) has not been without its critics.&nbsp; 
		For a cogent and compelling one, see Koestler (1964).<br />
		The most serious critic of behaviourist approaches to language learning 
		remains Chomsky and it is to him we turn next.</p>

		</table>
				<p>Noam Chomsky, an American linguist, is probably most famous 
				in language teaching for his work on transformational generative 
				grammar but it is his aversion to behaviourist learning theories 
				and structural linguistics which concerns us here.<br />
				He is famously cited as asserting (2003:349):<br />
				<span class="auto-style8"><em>Language is not a habit structure.&nbsp; 
				Ordinary linguistic behaviour characteristically involves 
				innovation, formation of new sentences and patterns in 
				accordance with rules of great abstractness and intricacy.</em></span><br />
				What this means is:</p>
				<ol class="auto-style15">
					<li>structural linguistics is inadequate to describe 
					language and</li>
					<li>behaviourist learning theories are inadequate to 
					describe how language is learned.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>In other words: it's all wrong.</p>
		
		<p>The key <strong>criticisms of behaviourism</strong> are fourfold (and they aren't all Chomsky's 
		alone):</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Unpredictability</strong></dt>
	<dd>How do you know what someone will say when presented with a stimulus?&nbsp; 
	In our example, above, of the teacher eliciting the past tense of the verb 
	<em>go</em>, what happens if the learner (or the organism) produces the perfectly 
	correct <em>Somewhere I've never been before</em> or <em>What time last night?
	</em>or any 
	other of many thousands of possible responses.</dd>
	
			<dt><strong>Reinforcement</strong></dt>
			<dd>Reinforcement does not occur regularly.&nbsp; Parents and others 
			regularly approve statements that are true (or cute) rather than 
			grammatically accurate.&nbsp; For example, in response to seeing a 
			horse if a child produces <em>Look at the big doggy!</em>, many 
			adults might respond positively because it's a cute and endearing 
			thing to say, albeit wrong.&nbsp; How, then, do children learn to 
			see where the meanings of words start and stop?<br />
			Equally, if a child says <em>It a horse!</em> in response to a 
			follow-up question, adults might well be tempted to approve because it's right rather than correct the grammar.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Response strength</strong></dt>
			<dd>is variable.&nbsp; We don’t always shout our approval.&nbsp; In 
			fact, it's sometimes more effective to reply in hushed, awe-struck 
			tones.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Innovation</strong></dt>
			<dd>Speakers of all languages consistently produce novel and unique 
			utterances.&nbsp; For example, I may say <em>There's a green dodo in 
			my cantaloupe juice</em>.&nbsp; Whatever you may think of my state 
			of mind, you will understand what I am saying although you and I 
			have never heard or said it before.&nbsp; If language is a habit 
			structure, how did I do that?&nbsp; By the way, Chomsky's famous 
			example of this was <span class="auto-style8"> <em>Green ideas sleep furiously</em></span>.</dd>
	
</dl>
		
		<p>The <strong>criticisms of structural linguistics</strong> are quite technical and 
		complex.&nbsp; Here we will take just two:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Ambiguity</strong></dt>
	<dd>Take this famous example: <span class="auto-style8"><em>Visiting aunts 
	can be boring</em></span><br />
	It could mean:<br />
	<span class="auto-style8"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aunts who visit can be boring</em></span><em><br />
	</em>
	<span class="auto-style8"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visiting your aunts can be boring</em><br />
	</span>If we want to understand the sentence we need to go beyond the rules 
	of structural linguistics and consider what is called 'deep structure'.&nbsp; 
	We do this by considering whether the word <em>visiting</em> is a participle 
	adjective describing <em>aunts</em> or a gerund of the verb <em>visit</em>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Rules of use</strong></dt>
			<dd>This is a famous citation from Hymes (1971:278):<span class="auto-style8"><br />
			</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style8"><em>There are rules of use without which 
			the rules of grammar would be useless.<br />
			</em></span>
			For example, if I say <em>It's cold in here</em>  I may 
			be asking you to shut the window, telling you to put the heating on, 
			advising you to get dressed or any number of other things and we 
			don't know what it means solely by applying grammatical rules.&nbsp; 
			We use rules of use.&nbsp; See the
			<a href="../../initial/functions/formfunction.html" target="_blank">guide to form 
			and function </a>for more.</dd>

		<br />
		Theories of cognitivism (as opposed to 
				behaviourism) underlie much of post-behaviourist language 
				teaching.<br />
				Cognitivism is concerned with the investigation of how people 
				think &ndash; their internal mental states.&nbsp; In our field, 
				this means thinking about how people process language and 
				information to construct dependable rules for its use.<br />
				<br />
				If you are given a rule and then told to apply it by
				<span class="style_underline">deducing</span> what the correct 
				form should be, you are using your brain to extrapolate from a 
				rule to a single example of language.<br />
				For example, if you are told the rules to form regular past 
				tenses in English and then asked for the past tense of s<em>moke, 
				live, pack</em> etc., you should be able to come up with the 
				correct forms.<br />
				That's deductive learning.<p>If, on the other hand, you are 
				given the examples first (<em>pack-packed, live-lived, 
				smoke-smoked, type-typed, garden-gardened</em> etc.) and then 
				asked to state the rule you could use your brain to generalise 
				that verbs ending in <em>-e</em> take <em>-d </em>and those not 
				doing so take <em>-ed</em>.<br />
				That's inductive learning.</p>
		<p>This is a fundamental distinction.<br />
				There are those who will aver that one or the other is 'better' 
				but that's an oversimplification.&nbsp; It may be that some of 
				us are better at one form of thinking than the other or that 
				some forms of problem are more susceptible to being solved by 
				one way of thinking than the other.&nbsp; It may also be a 
				combination of the two.<br />
				Either way, looking at learning through this lens focuses on the 
				fact that humans make sense of the data they are given by making 
				hypotheses about the truth.&nbsp; That's a cognitive view of 
				behaviour and learning.</p>

		<p>Taken together, the following led to a rise in the 1960s and 1970s of 
		a new approach to language teaching:</p>
		<ul class="greybulletlist">
			<li>criticisms of structural linguistics (and the growth of 
			descriptive rather than prescriptive grammars)</li>
			<li>criticisms of behaviourist theories of learning (and an emphasis 
			on cognition)</li>
			<li>a recognition that language is primarily a means to communicate 
			(and not only a set of grammatical rules and lexis)</li>
			<li>a recognition that learners need to know how to deploy the 
			language they are learning in order to communicate</li>
		</ul>
		<p>That approach is usually called <strong>Communicative Language 
		Teaching</strong> or CLT.&nbsp; It has become so dominant that there is a&nbsp;guide devoted to it 
		linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>
