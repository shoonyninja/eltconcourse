			In all of what follows, the key premise is that learners do not 
			acquire a second language by a process of repetition practice or 
			drilling.&nbsp; The assumption here is that learners take an active 
			part in learning by:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>developing hypotheses based on the language they hear 
				and read</em></li>
				<li><em>testing these hypotheses against the reality of new

				<li><em>refining the hypotheses to match the new reality</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In other words, second-language learning is a cognitive process.&nbsp; 
			Nearly all second-language acquisition theorists would concur with 
			that, incidentally (but many do not).</p>

					<h2>Input and Intake</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There is a key distinction between these two terms:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>input refers to all the target language that the learner 
				reads and hears</li>
				<li>intake refers to the part of input which the learner <strong>
				comprehends</strong> and <strong>acts on</strong> to develop his 
				or her internal grammar of the target language 
				and its rules of use</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It has been assumed by some that input alone is sufficient to 
			develop second-language ability and those who have picked up a 
			language simply by listening and reading what is around them in its 
			native-speaking setting may well concur.&nbsp; The key distinction 
			for our purposes, however, is whether input becomes intake 
			unconsciously or whether a conscious process of noticing and acting 
			on the input is required for it to become intake.<br />
			Here we have to follow a small theoretical diversion.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Input becomes intake unconsciously</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="unconscious" height="133" src="../../images/reading_blindfold200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is one of the central tenets of Krashen's distinction 
				between learning and acquisition.&nbsp; As he puts it:</dd>
				<dd class="indentpara">
				<span class="style_black"><em>Language acquisition is a 
				subconscious process; language acquirers are not usually aware 
				of the fact that they are acquiring language, but are only aware 
				of the fact that they are using the language for communication. 
				The result of language acquisition, acquired competence, is also 
				subconscious. We are generally not consciously aware of the 
				rules of the languages we have acquired. Instead, we have a 
				"feel" for correctness. Grammatical sentences "sound" right, or 
				"feel" right, and errors feel wrong, even if we do not 
				consciously know what rule was violated.</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style31">(Krashen 2009:10)</span></dd>
				<dd>
				There is a separate guide on this site to 
				Krashen and the 
				Natural Approach, linked in the list of related guides at the 
				end.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Input + active noticing becomes intake</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="notice" height="133" src="../../images/man_notice200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Noticing is discussed in an article by Schmidt (1990:138) in 
				which he identifies three issues:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>(1) the process through which 
				input becomes intake, related to the issues of noticing and 
				subliminal perception</em></span></dd>
				<dd class="style_black" ><em>(2) the degree to which the learner consciously controls 
				the process of intake, the incidental learning question</em></dd>
				<dd><em><span class="style_black">(3) the role of conscious understanding in hypothesis 
				formation, the issue of implicit learning.</span></em><br />
				Schmidt doubts, in fact, whether learning can happen at all 
				without conscious noticing and intent.&nbsp; He concludes:</dd>
				<dd>
				<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>subliminal language learning is 
				impossible, and that intake is what learners consciously 
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>notice</strong></span></em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style31">Op. cit.:149 (emphasis added)</span></p>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>These two standpoints cannot be easily reconciled because 
			Krashen's position is that acquisition, rather than mere learning, 
			occurs unconsciously and Schmidt's position is that this is 
			impossible.&nbsp; To support his assertion, he discusses the way in 
			which information is processed.&nbsp; A pictorial view of what 
			happens, based on Kihlstrom, is presented by Schmidt (<em>op cit</em>.):<br />
			</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="input" height="155" src="../../imagesgraphics/input.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>To explain:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The sensory registers accept data from a number of sources, 
				primarily what we hear and what we read.&nbsp; If we pay them no 
				attention (as we might pay no attention to a passing car while 
				we are watching TV) no memory is retained at all.&nbsp; The 
				information is lost.</li>
				<li>If we do pay attention to the data (i.e., notice what we 
				read and hear actively), the data are placed in the short-term 
				memory store (also called working or primary memory).</li>
				<li>Finally, the data have to be processed in some way in order 
				to remain in long-term memory and one way of doing that is to 
				produce what we have heard, write what we have read and so on.&nbsp; 
				That is what is meant by rehearsal and retrieval.&nbsp; Without 
				this, items are deleted very quickly, in a matter of seconds, 
				from the short-term memory store.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>About the only ground on which both theories agree is that the 
			input, however it is processed, has to be comprehensible to the 
			learner.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Learners will, theory has it, identify input worth noticing 
			because there is a communicative intention behind the data.&nbsp; 
			Someone is trying to communicate something so it's not just noise.</p>
			<p>The question remains to discover what happens in the learner when 
			she/he is consciously converting input into intake.&nbsp; In this 
			process, the learner will be noticing one of two things and may be 
			noticing both at the same time:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Noticing the <strong>gap</strong>: the difference between the input data and 
				the language the learner can produce.<br />
				For example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>I pronounce the word <em>comfortable</em> as /kʌm.fɔː.ˈteɪb.l̩/ 
					but my teacher just said /ˈkʌmf.təb.l̩/.&nbsp; I need to 
					adjust how I say this word.&nbsp; I'll write it down now.</li>
					<li>I said:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fire is in the forest</em><br />
					and the person I spoke to said<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you say, "There's a fire in the 
					forest"?</em><br />
					I need to remember to use the <em>There is</em> formula to 
					sound more natural.&nbsp; I'll try saying it now.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Noticing the <strong>form</strong>: the way in which the input data exemplify 
				how the language should be used.&nbsp; For example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>I heard some people talking and one said:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the kids go early</em><br />
					and the reply was<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I allowed them to go early yesterday</em><br />
					so, <em>let</em> is not followed by <em>to</em> + the 
					infinitive but <em>allow</em> is.&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; I'll make 
					a note and try to remember that.</li>
					<li>I read:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We discussed the matter fully at our last meeting.&nbsp; 
					We do not need to talk it over again.</em><br />
					So, the verb <em>discuss</em> does not need a preposition 
					and we can use a separable phrasal verb <em>talk over</em> 
					to mean the same thing.&nbsp; I'll make notes.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The assumption is that we have mental language-processing 
			mechanisms to deal with these issues.&nbsp; It has been described 
			like this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>What happens to learners is that as they encounter
			input, their internal mechanisms begin to make connections between 
			formal features of language and the meanings they encode. The mechanisms responsible for syntax
			work on these data to establish the nature of the syntactic rules 
			the language has.<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style10">(VanPatten and Wong, 2003:408)</span></p>
			<p>The reason this occurs is to do with an internalised knowledge of 
			language that we all possess: Universal Grammar.&nbsp; As an 
			example, a learner encountering a language in which the verbs are 
			heavily marked for person, number, gender and tense may note the 
			fact from only one or two examples but, once alerted to the fact 
			that this is an inflected language, the learner will be primed to 
			notice further inflexions and apply a cognitive process to figuring 
			out the system and its exceptions.</p>

			</table>
			<p>In traditional classrooms, learners have been encouraged and in 
			some cases forced to produce language from the outset.&nbsp; 
			Input-based theories do not require that.&nbsp; In fact, Krashen and 
			Terrell's Natural Approach explicitly confirms the fact that 
			learners should only speak when they feel ready to do so.</p>
			<p>Output from learners is not input to the learning process:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It cannot, by definition, be above the current level of the 
				learner.</li>
				<li>Output from other learners is often flawed and a poor target 
				for useful noticing.&nbsp; Swan (2005) puts this rather forcefully:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>If one was seeking an efficient 
				way of improving one’s elementary command of a foreign language, 
				sustained conversation and linguistic speculation with other 
				elementary learners would scarcely be one’s first choice.</em></span></li>
				<li>Even in a conversation-driven approach, such as Dogme, 
				output from other learners will only form a small part of input 
				worth processing as intake, and proponents of the approach will 
				refer to the texts and other language-rich materials that 
				learners can bring to the class.</li>
				<li>Task-based approaches in which learners cooperate to achieve 
				a task are often cited as times when learners can absorb 
				language from each other, effectively, peer teach.&nbsp; That 
				this may sometimes happen is not in doubt but that it is the 
				most efficient way of learning language and getting input that 
				can be turned into useful intake most certainly is arguable.</li>
				<li>Language drills in the classroom may well be a way of the 
				teacher inserting new input but, because it is clear that it is 
				a drill and not a communicative act, the language will not be 
				noticed in the same way.<br />
				The fact that a teacher believes that something needs drilling 
				is an acceptance that most if not all the learners are producing 
				flawed language in some way, structurally or phonologically.&nbsp; 
				If this is the case, encouraging learners to listen to each 
				other, by drilling only parts of a group at a time, for example, 
				is positively counterproductive.<br />
				Language <em>worth</em> noticing 
				is language produced by someone who wants to communicate 
				something.</li>

					<h2><a name="affordance"></a>Affordances and information

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Affordance theory originates from the work of the American 
			psychologist James Jerome Gibson (although others have attributed it 
			to ecology) and focuses on the perceived possibilities in the 
			environment.<br />
			For example, when you see the door handle above you are probably 
			aware that its main affordance is that pressing it down will open 
			the door but there are other affordances that will occur to you 
			(such as making it a place to hang your clothes, an attractive 
			decoration in its own right, something you can 
			pull without pressing and so on).<br />
			The more immediate and obvious the function is, the more efficiently 
			something has been designed (a principle that is, or should be, 
			close to the hearts of software designers, of course).</p>
			<p>It is assumed that when a learner looks at a text or hears some 
			language (wherever it originates), the main affordance of the text 
			should be clear, i.e.<span class="style_black"><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			This is something I can use as input and convert into intake</em></span>.</p>
			<p>An example might be the language produced by other learners 
			during a classroom conversation (such as might appear in a Dogme 
			approach).&nbsp; If this language is perceived to have an obvious 
			affordance in terms of being useful and noteworthy input, it may be 
			used for that purpose but, if the affordance that is perceived is 
			merely that it is language already mastered being used to express a 
			mildly interesting thought, attention will fade.<br />
			In other words, output from other learners will often be ignored.</p>
			<p>If, on the other hand, the output comes from the teacher and is 
			focused on language the learners clearly do not master (yet), then 
			its main affordance, providing the language has been carefully 
			designed, will be obvious:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is language I need and can 
			incorporate into my repertoire</em></span>.</p>
			<h3>Salient information<br />
			<img alt="wheelbarrow" height="133" src="../../images/wheelbarrow200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>An allied point concerns the perceived usefulness of the information that 
			is carried by the input: its saliency.<br />
			For example, if, on seeing someone pushing a wheelbarrow full of 
			earth across a garden, we can readily notice that the wheelbarrow is 
			carrying a load of something, earth in this case.&nbsp; However, 
			that is not the only information being carried.&nbsp; Depending on 
			how primed we are to notice important information, we may also 
			perceive that the event contains the data concerning the 
			labour-saving nature of wheelbarrows and that may be the most 
			important information if we, too, are concerned with moving heavy 
			materials around the garden (or anywhere else).</p>
			<p>So it is with language.<br />
			A learner may, for example, use the information contained in a 
			clause such as the first one in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">While watching the 
			game</span>, I noticed that the referee was biased against Margate 
			United</em><br />
			to understand that the noticing happened during the game and that we 
			do not know at which point it occurred exactly.&nbsp; That is in the 
			nature of the non-finite clause.<br />
			Another learner, concerned more with syntax than meaning may note 
			something completely different.&nbsp; For example, that it is 
			possible to ellipt the subject and the primary auxiliary verb (<em>I 
			was</em> in the first clause) because the items are common to both 
			clauses or easily understood from the co-text.<br />
			A third learner may extract the information that non-finite 
			participle clauses can be used as time subordinators and a fourth 
			may learn something about the meaning of the word <em>biased</em> 
			and its dependent preposition (<em>against</em>).<br />
			What is noticed will depend on the direction of attention and the 
			information the hearer / reader already has or wants to get.</p>

			</table>
			<p>So, what we need to do is provide rich, comprehensible input, help 
			our learners notice the salient features and let them do the rest, 
			right?<br />
			Not quite.&nbsp; There are some issues for classroom 
			practice:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Comprehensible</strong> input<br />
				<img alt="listen" height="133" src="../../images/listen_headphones200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Krashen asserts that input should be comprehensible (and few 
				dare disagree) but at just above the learners' current level of 
				control.&nbsp;
				Unfortunately, this begs some questions:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>What constitutes 'comprehensible'?&nbsp; Is this input 
					10% above the learners' level, 20% or what?&nbsp; What level 
					of comprehension is required for the input to be converted 
					to intake?</li>
					<li>Whose comprehension?&nbsp; Most teachers teach groups 
					and their abilities in both reading and listening may vary 
					very widely.&nbsp; One learner's comprehensible input in 
					terms of reading text may be another learner's mystery and 
					one learner's listening comprehension may be another's 
					misery.</li>
					<li><span class="style_underline">The solution</span> seems 
					to be to contrive input that is comprehensible <strong>in 
					terms of the targets</strong> rather than wholly 
					comprehensible.&nbsp; There may be surrounding language 
					which is not immediately comprehensible to everyone but, 
					providing the language which <span class="style_underline">
					<strong>contains</strong></span> the targets of 
					instruction is comprehensible, input can convert to intake.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Rich</strong> input<br />
				<img alt="rish cake" height="133" src="../../images/cake_rich200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Most writers in the field recognise that rich language input is 
				needed to help learners encounter and notice the patterns of the 
				language they are learning.&nbsp; If one only ever encounters a 
				single genre, a single register or a single style with a narrow 
				topic range, the data simply aren't there to help the process.&nbsp; 
				There is a serious issue here, too:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>Overly rich input may 
					disguise the very phenomena we want the learners to notice 
					because the richer the input, the less frequently in 
					proportion the items will occur.<br />
					Having to read 300 
					words to encounter two uses of a particular tense form is 
					not an efficient use of learners' time.</li>
					<li><span class="style_underline">The solution</span> is to 
					strike a balance between richness and focus.&nbsp; Texts 
					need to be graded, and probably quite contrived at lower 
					levels, to ensure that the targets are salient enough to be 
					effectively noticed and processed.<br />
					Maintaining naturalness is something of a challenge but can 
					be achieved with care and thought.</li>

				Many will also agree that it is the teacher's role to manipulate 
				input to select stretches of language that contain something 
				worthy of noticing but which happens to be at the right level.&nbsp; 
				However,<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>It is not easy to select or 
					alter texts in a way which allows this because the result is 
					often an unnaturally densely packed text or one which 
					contains too few of the examples of the form.</li>
					<li><span class="style_underline">A solution</span> is to 
					adjust the text so that the targets are in some way 
					highlighted.&nbsp; With written texts, this can be done by
					<span class="auto-style6">highlighting</span> sections, 
					varying <strong><span class="auto-style7">font size </span>
					<span class="auto-style8">and colour</span></strong> and so 
					on.<br />
					With spoken texts, this is more challenging but pre- and 
					while-listening tasks can be devised which force learners to 
					focus on the language targets in the text.&nbsp; For 
					example,<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen and write down the 
					words John uses to make polite requests to his boss.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					This time, listen to how the boss responds and write what 
					language she uses exactly.</em></span><br />
					Packing texts with numerous examples of the targets is known 
					as input flooding and making the targets stand out in some 
					way is referred to as input enhancement, incidentally, and 
					there's a bit more to this in the guide to noticing, linked 
					below.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Noticing</strong> is self-selecting<br />
				<img alt="notice" height="133" src="../../images/man_notice200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				One strength of an input approach to teaching is often noted as 
				being that it allows the learners to pay attention to the 
				language they need in their setting and for their purposes (as 
				well as their level).&nbsp; However,<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>This may work with 
					sophisticated adult learners with clear learning aims but 
					will not be effective with younger learners (who may have no 
					current need for the language) or for those with vaguer 
					and less concrete aims and purposes.</li>
					<li><span class="style_underline">A solution</span> is to 
					raise awareness in the learners of where their productive 
					ability falls short of their language needs.&nbsp; A 
					Test–Teach–Test approach is often effective in this regard, 
					as is a task-based tactic.<br />
					Obliging the learners to deploy their current interlanguage 
					to achieve a communicative outcome, and then noting the gaps 
					between what they can do and what they need to be able to do 
					is often effective.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These are not insurmountable problems, of course, but their 
			solutions need some thought and care, especially concerning what 
			input is provided and what exactly the learners are being asked to 
			notice and turn into intake.</p>
