			<h2>Why does one writer get a whole guide to himself?</h2>
			<p>Quite simply because he is so influential.&nbsp; His ideas penetrate 
			nearly all areas of 
			the study of language.&nbsp; Henk Van 
			Riemsdijk, himself an influential figure and Professor emeritus of 
			Linguistics at Tilburg University, The Netherlands, writes:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>I had already decided I wanted to be a 
			linguist when I discovered this book. But it is unlikely that I 
			would have stayed in the field without it. It has been the single 
			most inspiring book on linguistics in my whole career.<br />
			<span class="smallfont"></span></em><span class="auto-style60">In Chomsky 
			(2002)</span></p>
			<p>Frank Palmer (1971:135) has said of the book that it was</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>the book that first introduced to the 
			world the most influential of all modern linguistic theories, 
			'transformational-generative grammar'</em></span>.</p>
			<p>The book in question was: Syntactic Structures, first published 
			in 1957.</p>
			<p>Word of warning: what follows is an overview of the classic 
			version of Chomsky's theories concerning Transformational-Generative 
			Grammar (TGG).&nbsp; As such, it can only do some injury, minor, it 
			is hoped, to the complexities and subtleties of the approach.&nbsp; 
			For more, consult the literature.&nbsp; There are some references 
			at the end but there is a wealth of literature in the field.<br />
			In addition, there is Chomsky's own website at
			www.chomsky.info 
			and many more or less reliable websites covering the area.&nbsp; The

			<h2>Background: Structural Linguistics</h2>
			<p>Attached to the name of Bloomfield and his followers, 
			Structural Linguistics is/was the attempt to apply a truly scientific 
			approach to grammar.&nbsp; Although all linguists are concerned to 
			study structure, or patterns and regularities, in language, of 
			course, Bloomfield's central concern was with a mechanistic and 
			purely empirical approach to language study, looking for structure, 
			not meaning.<br />
			Structural linguistics defined the essential building blocks of 
			language as phonemes and morphemes, the latter consisting of 
			combinations of the former, and the approach to analysing grammar 
			was to divide the language up into its 'Immediate Constituents'.&nbsp; 
			Hence, we have IC analysis: Immediate Constituent analysis.<br />
			The details of IC analysis need not concern us here but the result 
			was to analyse language according to a branching tree diagram.&nbsp; 
			IC analysis can be quite illuminating.&nbsp; Here's an example of 
			what is meant.&nbsp; If we analyse the sentence<em><span class="style_brown"><br />
			</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown"><strong>&nbsp;The large dog with huge teeth chased 
			the man from the room</strong><br />
			</span></em>into its immediate constituents we 
			can do so like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="tree" height="252" src="../../imagesgraphics/structuralist_tree_diagram.png" width="930" /></p>
			<p>
			(Here, we have not inserted a row of phonemic analysis below the 
			level of morphemic analysis but it is possible to do so and break 
			down each morpheme into its constituent phonemes so we would have, 
			e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the</em> = /ð/ = /ə/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>large</em> = /l/ + /ɑː/ + /dʒ/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>dog</em> = /d/ + /ɒ/ + /ɡ/<br />
			etc. and so on for each morpheme.)</p>
			<p>
			This kind of analysis can be fruitful because it is simple to 
			see that we can substitute the sequences of morphemes in the bottom 
			row with others and, while maintaining the same analysis, apply it to 
			any number of sentences.&nbsp; We can analyse, e.g., a sentence such as<span class="style_brown"><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man with grey hair dropped his keys 
			in the street<br />
			</em></span>which follows the same pattern:</p>

			<p>While such an analysis works well for many examples of

					<td class="auto-style25">
					<h3>
					Problem 1: embedding</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			This all works very well when sentences behave themselves and come 
			along quietly with all the constituents in order.&nbsp; However, the first 
			problem strikes when we consider sentences such as:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>She messed the whole thing up.</em></li>
				<li><em>Is John going home?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The problem is that while it's easy to see that the verb phrase in 
			sentence 1. is<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mess + -ed + up<br />
			</em>and in sentence 2. it is<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			primary auxiliary + stem + -ing<br />
			</em>no simple tree diagram will 
			allow this separation of verbs by objects (sentence 1.) or verbs by 
			subjects (sentence 2.).</p>
			<p>It has been suggested that one could represent these sorts of 
			embedded ideas this way:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="problem 1" height="145" src="../../imagesgraphics/structuralist_discontinuous.png" width="320" /></p>
			<p>
			or we could have crossing lines like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="problem 1" height="119" src="../../imagesgraphics/structuralist_discontinuous2.png" width="320" /></p>
			<p>but that defeats the purpose because IC analysis depends on the 
			possibility of substituting <strong>sequences</strong> with other sequences 
			and discontinuous phenomena like these are not sequences at all.</p>

			(i.e., a gerund), 
			then we are referring to the act of eating apples which can be 
			pleasing.&nbsp; If we remove the modal, it becomes clear:</p>
			<ol class="style_brown">
				<li><em>Eating apples are pleasing.</em></li>
				<li><em>Eating apples is pleasing.</em></li>

			<p><span class="style_brown">A more famous example of this problem

			<span class="style_brown">
			<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visiting aunts can be boring</strong></em>.<br />
			Is it the action of 
			visiting aunts or the aunts themselves which/who can be boring?<br />
			There is a guide to ambiguity on this site, linked at the end, which

			<p>Instead of relying on tree diagrams to represent how sentences 
			were constructed from individual morphemes, Chomsky was concerned to 
			discover the patterns by which one sentence could be transformed 
			into another.&nbsp; The classic example is the passive in English.<br />
			How is<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary allowed Peter to go home<br />
			</em>transformed into<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Peter was allowed to go home, by Mary</em>?<br />
			Here's how 
			(Chomsky, 2002:43):</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>If S1 is a grammatical sentence of the 
			form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NP<sub>1</sub> 
			— Aux — V— NP<sub>2</sub>,<br />
			then the corresponding string of the form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NP<sub>2</sub> 
			— Aux + be + en — V — by + NP<sub>1</sub><br />
			is also a grammatical sentence.</em></p>
			<p>To explain:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>S1</strong></span> is the first or kernel sentence.<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>NP</strong><sub>1</sub></span> and 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>NP</strong><sub>2</sub></span> are the noun phrases (<em>Mary</em> 
			and <em>Peter</em> in our examples).<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>V</strong></span> is the verb (<em>allow</em> in our examples)<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>Aux</strong></span> stands for the tense marker, 
			not necessarily an auxiliary verb, (the past of <em>allow</em> and <em>
			be</em> in our examples)<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em><strong>en</strong></em></span> is the marker for past participle.<br />
			So the rule for transforming the active, <strong>kernel</strong> 
			sentence into the passive is:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>put <span class="style_black">NP<sub>2</sub></span> first<br />
				so we get:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter ... to go home</em></li>
				<li>add the 
			tense of the verb <em>be<br />
				</em>so we get:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter was ... to go home</em></li>
				<li>add the past participle of the main 
			verb<br />
				so we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter was allowed ... to go home</em></li>
				<li>add <em>by<br />
				</em>so we get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Peter was allowed by .... to go home</em></li>
				<li>insert <span class="style_black">NP<sub>1</sub></span><br />
				so we get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Peter was allowed to go home by Mary</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Easy, 
			and the last two steps are optional, of course, because by step 3. 
			we have a well-formed passive-voice clause.</p>

			Instead of the cumbersome tree diagrams for every sentence, we now 
			have a set of rules to work from to transform <strong>kernel</strong> sentences 
			(i.e., the original from which we make the transformations) into 
			others and we have a way of dealing with both the embedding problem 
			and the ambiguity problem we met above.</p>

			<p>For example, if we take a sentence such as<em><span class="style_brown"><br />
			</span>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>
			<span class="style_brown"><strong>The man who was in the 
			bar spoke to me</strong>.<br />
			</span></em>the structural linguistics analysis 
			would either have lines crossing each other or result in the kind of 
			block diagram we saw above, like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="bar" height="51" src="../../imagesgraphics/structuralist_man_bar.png" width="320" /></p>
			<p>However, we can look for the kernel sentences which make it 
			up and then work out the transformation rules.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The kernel sentences are:<ol class="auto-style9">
					<li><em>The man spoke to me.</em></li>
					<li><em>The man was in the bar.</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The transformation rules are:<ol class="auto-style9">
					<li>Place the second sentence after the first NP in the 
					first sentence.<br />
					That gives us:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man the man was in the bar spoke 
					to me</em></li>
					<li>Replace the second NP with <em>who</em>.<br />
					That then gives us:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
				man </em><span class="auto-style7"><em>The man</em></span>
			<span class="style_red"><em>who</em></span><em> was in the bar spoke to me</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We can do the same thing with other forms of relative pronoun 
			sentences, transforming, for example:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style9">
				<li><em>I cut down the tree</em></li>
				<li><em>The tree was hanging over the gate</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>by using similar rules to generate:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style9">
				<li><em>I cut down the tree the tree was hanging over the gate</em><br />
				which involves placing the second sentence after the noun phrase 
				in the first sentence</li>
				<li><em>I cut down the tree <span class="auto-style7">the tree</span>
				<span class="style_red">which / that</span> was hanging over the 
				gate</em><br />
				which involves replacing the second noun phrase with <em>which</em>
				<strong>or</strong> <em>that</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Other relative pronoun sentences can be generated slightly 
			differently so from:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style9">
				<li><em>I cut down the tree</em></li>
				<li><em>The tree was hanging over the gate</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>we apply other rules:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Move the first sentence to the front of the second and 
				produce:<br />
				<em>I cut down the tree the tree was hanging over the gate</em></li>
				<li>Delete the first noun phrase to produce:<br />
				<em>I cut down <span class="auto-style7">the tree</span> the 
				tree was hanging over the gate</em></li>
				<li>Delete the second verb phrase and produce<br />
				<em>I cut down the tree <span class="auto-style7">was </span>
				hanging over the gate</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is called the relative transformation, by the way.</p>

			<p>The often-cited example of an ambiguous statement which 
			transformational-generative grammar can deal with is:<em><span class="style_brown"><br />
&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
			shooting of the hunters was terrible</strong></span>.<br />
			</em>The ambiguity, of course, is that we don't know whether the 
			hunters were bad shots or whether they <strong>were</strong> shot.<br />
			Here's how TGG can unravel the problem:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The key noun phrase is <em>the shooting of the hunters</em></li>
				<li>This noun phrase can come from two possible kernel 
				sentences:<ol class="auto-style9">
					<li><em>The hunters shot (something)</em></li>
					<li><em>The hunters were shot</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Once we know which of the kernel sentences produced the noun 
				phrase we have disambiguated the sentences.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is an example of the workings of deep structure.&nbsp; I.e., 
			the structure of the sentence which derives from the nature of the 
			kernel sentences and is below the surface structure traditionally 
			analysed in structural linguistics.&nbsp; There are two possible 
			deep structures here identifiable from the two possible kernel 
			sentences.</p>
			<p><a name="2"></a>As another example, we can take our earlier

			</table>
			<p>The idea of a grammar being generative is the second string of 
			the theory.</p>
			<p>Simply put, this means that the grammar must be capable of 
			generating 'all and only' the grammatical sentences of the language.&nbsp; 
			This does not mean that it must do so, only that it must be capable 
			of doing so.&nbsp; For example, a generative grammar must be able to 
			produce <em>She likes apples </em>but not<em> Like apples she </em>
			and so on<em>.</em></p>
			<p>There is a fundamental difference of approach here from that 
			taken by structural linguists.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Structural linguists were concerned to identify the 
				sentences of the language and then analyse them.&nbsp; In other 
				words, they collected a corpus of data and then analysed the 
				data working from the phonemes making up each morpheme upwards 
				to make the tree diagram we are familiar with.</li>
				<li>A generative approach is not concerned with what has been 
				observed but with what is possible.&nbsp; A corpus of data (even 
				a huge, modern computer-based one), 
				however large, cannot contain all the sentences of a language 
				and will inevitably miss some out.&nbsp; This is because any 
				language contains an <strong>infinite</strong> number of 
				possible sentences.<br />
				For example, I can say,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who was in the room was 
				reading</em>.<br />
				I can then add another relative clause to 
				make<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who was in the room which was on the second 
				floor was reading<br />
				</em>and I can continue to add clauses to 
				make, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who was in the room which was on the 
				second floor which was part of the building which was in the 
				High street was reading<br />
				</em>and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>.&nbsp; 
				There is theoretically, no limit although the sentence will, of 
				course, become unmanageable and harder and harder to understand 
				as it grows.&nbsp; That's not the point; the point is that it is 
				theoretically possible <strong>never</strong> to come to the end of the sentence.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In Syntactic Structures, Chomsky demonstrates the generative 
			nature of this sort of grammar by considering the form of the 
			negative in English.&nbsp; This is not the place to repeat all the 
			steps but the conclusion is (op cit:62):</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>The rules (37) and (40) now enable us to 
			derive all and only the grammatical forms of sentence negation</em></p>
			<p>As you may imagine, rules 37 and 40 are somewhat complex but that 
			they can be used to produce <strong>all and only</strong> the 
			grammatical forms is not in dispute.</p>

			<p>The key here is that TGG is not concerned with analysing that 
			which is actually said but with establishing the rules concerning 
			what <strong><em>can</em></strong> be said.&nbsp; For many, involved as they are in analysing 
			what people actually say and write, this is a central weakness of 
			Chomsky's position.</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>What is actually said by speakers of the language is called
				<strong>performance</strong> and is not the concern.</li>
				<li>What is possible for a speaker to say is called <strong>
				competence</strong> and is the concern.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>According to the theory, then, what happens is that speakers of a 
			language work to an internalized set of rules from which they 
			generate grammatically accurate language.&nbsp; The proper concern 
			of grammar studies, then, is to find out what these rules are and 
			that cannot be done solely by looking at what is said but by 
			considering what <strong>can</strong> be said.</p>
			<p>There are, however, obvious problems with this simple 
			distinction:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Who judges what is and is not grammatical?&nbsp; Is, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This car should have been being serviced<br />
				</em>grammatically 
				correct?&nbsp; At a formal level, none of the 'rules' of the 
				language has been transgressed but many would reject such a 
				sentence.<br />
				Chomsky's response to this charge was to rely on what he termed
				<strong>intuition</strong> and that is a native speaker's 
				judgement of correctness and appropriacy.</li>
				<li>How complex do we allow sentences to be?&nbsp; Is, e.g., our 
				example above<br /><em>The man who was in the room which was on the 
				second floor which was part of the building which was in the 
				High street was reading<br />
				</em>acceptable?&nbsp; If it is, how 
				about something like<br /><em>The old, tall, talkative and somewhat 
				eccentric man who was in the long, thin, well-lit, poorly 
				decorated room which was on the second floor which was part of 
				the newly-built but apparently only half-finished building which 
				was in the bustling and crowded High Street which was in the 
				centre of the small but attractive and rapidly growing town 
				which was in the County of Kent which is in the South-East 
				corner England was reading a book which he had recently bought 
				from a shop on the corner</em>?<br />Native speakers know that they need to draw a line somewhere but 
				it is extremely difficult to generate a rule to say where that 
				line lies.</li>

			<ol class="auto-style9">
				<li>Rules like these will generate a number of different

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman ate the pear<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A woman ate the pear<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A woman ate a 
				pear.</em><br />
				The rules will also generate unacceptable sentences, however, 
				such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pear ate the woman<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A pear ate a woman<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The pear ate a 
				woman.<br />
				</em>It will also generate the truly ungrammatical:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A man stood the forest<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A person arrived a hotel</em></li>
				<li>We can combine re-write rules with transformational rules 
				and that, as we saw above, can transform<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman ate a 
				pear<br />
				</em>into<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pear was eaten by the woman<br />
				</em>by the 
				removal of the second noun phrase to the front of the sentence

			<p>However, getting around the problem of generating statements such 
			as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A pear ate a woman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person arrived a hotel<br />
			</em>is not an easy matter.<br />
			This is done by stating upfront what kind of main verb is permitted 
			with what kind of noun.&nbsp; We forbid a certain class of noun 
			(i.e., here, ones as subjects which are not animate) and certain 
			classes of verb (i.e., ones which are not transitive).&nbsp; Then 
			the restrictions only have to be stated once in either our 
			phrase-structure or transformation rules which we apply.<br />
			So we get:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="woman pear 2" height="209" src="../../imagesgraphics/woman_pear2.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Now this form of phrase-structure analysis cannot generate<br />
			<em>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The pear ate the woman<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			A person arrived a hotel</em>.<br />
			because <em>The pear</em> is not animate and <em>arrive</em> is not 
			transitive.</p>
			<p>What's more, applying these restrictions to the kernel sentence 
			means that our transformational rules cannot produce<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman 
			was eaten by the pear<br />
			</em>but will generate<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pear was eaten 
			by the woman.</em></p>
			<p>The rules will also produce odd-sounding sentences such as<br />
			<em>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The bear ate the house<br />
			</em>although we could get around that by 
			specifying the kind of noun which slots into the
			<span class="style_black">NP<sub>2</sub></span> position<em>
			</em>but, recall, we are concerned with
			<strong>possible</strong> sentences, not language that is <strong>
			actually</strong> produced.<br />
			Such an approach, combining the phrase-structure 
			rules with transformational rules, can generate, for example,</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>The dog broke the window.</em></li>
				<li><em>The window was broken by the horse.</em></li>
				<li><em>A picture was stolen by a thief.</em></li>
				<li><em>The man injected the dog.</em></li>
				<li><em>The vet cured the dog.</em></li>
				<li><em>Some men broke the door.</em></li>
				<li><em>Those people enjoyed the fruits.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on and so on.&nbsp; Each and every sentence produced in 
			this way will be grammatical.&nbsp; That is the power of 
			phrase-structure rule generation.</p>

			<p><a name="3"></a>As an example, we'll use question formation in 
			English and start with a declarative sentence:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; A unicorn is in the garden<br />
			</em>and make the question:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is a unicorn in the garden?<br />
			</em>and that was simple enough because the rule is to take the 
			primary auxiliary verb and move it to the beginning.&nbsp; That 
			means we can generate any number of correct interrogative forms by 
			applying the simple rule so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man is outside &rarr; Is a man outside?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see it → Can you see it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was in the garden → Was John in the garden?<br />
			and so on for, quite literally, millions of sentences.<br />
			However, now make a question from:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A unicorn which has a golden horn is in the garden<br />
			</em>
			<a href="#3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'unicorn',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have done that</a>.</p>
			<p id="unicorn" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">The 
			question now is that if we apply the rule we induced from the first 
			example (i.e., move the auxiliary verb to the beginning), we get:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has a unicorn which a golden horn is in the garden?<br />
			</em>and that's nonsense.<br />
			The rule now is: move the <strong>second</strong> auxiliary verb to the beginning but 
			leave the first one alone.&nbsp; Then we get the acceptable (if 
			slightly unusual):<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is a unicorn which has a golden horn in the garden?<br />
			</em>That is a complex and non-intuitive rule.&nbsp; However, it has been demonstrated that all children by around the age of 
			four can do this unfailingly and never produce the nonsense.</p>
			<p>Here's a second example of the issue, one often cited as counter 
			evidence to a behaviourist view of language acquisition.<br />
			When we decide whether or not to put an <em>-s</em> ending on the 
			base form of the verb requires us, in English, to make 4 decisions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>whether the verb is in the 3rd person</li>
				<li>whether the subject is singular or plural</li>
				<li>whether the action is present tense</li>
				<li>whether the action is in a simple, progressive or perfect 
				aspect</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Then, having considered those four points, to learn the system 
			children must:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Notice that some verbs come with an <em>s- </em>ending in 
				some sentences but not in others</li>
				<li>Search for the grammatical causes of this phenomenon (rather

			<p>By around three years of age, children get this right at least 
			90% of the time.<br />
			Not only that but <em>en route</em> they use it inappropriately (<em>bes, 
			gots </em>etc.) which they can't have heard so are <strong>not</strong> 
			imitating because those malformed examples cannot have been heard.</p>
			<p>The fundamental problems Chomsky (and others) see with how 
			children manage to produce such complex grammar so early are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>There aren't enough data:<br />
				</strong>Children acquire language very quickly and are making 
				complex, grammatically correct sentences at a very early age.&nbsp; 
				By this stage in their development, they simply haven't been 
				exposed to adequate information about the language to be able to 
				do so.<br />
				This is a debatable point because, in fact, normally brought up 
				children are exposed to enormous amounts of data, certainly 
				enough to base a linguistic corpus on before they are five years 
				old.</li>
				<li><strong>The data are not always grammatical:<br />
				</strong>Studies show that carer-speak is focused on meaning not 
				structure and that very young children in particular are exposed 
				to a lot of language which is ungrammatical.&nbsp; If that is 
				the sole source of their production, much of it would remain at 
				the '<em>Get choo-choo</em>' level of speech.<br />
				This, too, has been challenged and, for example, one study found 
				that of 1500 utterances analysed, only one was ungrammatical (or 
				a disfluency, in the jargon).&nbsp; The study found that the 
				speech of carers directed towards children was '<span class="style_black"><em>unswervingly well 
				formed</em></span>'<br />
				(Newport, Gleitman and Gleitman, 1977:121, cited in Moerk 
				2000:96)</li>
				<li><strong>Reinforcement is unreliable and inconsistent:</strong><ul class="greybullet">
					<li>adults do not consistently respond positively to 
					grammatically correct utterances.&nbsp; They respond to 
					meaning (and sometimes cuteness) more often than not, 
					however malformed the child's language output is.</li>
					<li>adults do not always provide loud and enthusiastic 
					reinforcement (as the behaviourist theory would require). 
					They often speak quietly, or even not at all, in response to 
					whatever the child produces.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Chomsky states it this way:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>Language is not a habit structure.&nbsp; Ordinary linguistic behaviour characteristically involves 
			innovation, formation of new sentences and patterns in accordance 
			with rules of great abstractness and intricacy.<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style26">(Chomsky (2003) p 349)</span></span></p>
			<p>There's an allied problem that, although many animals communicate 
			with each other (sometimes sending quite sophisticated signals), 
			only humans have developed such a complex and subtle system of 
			communication: language.&nbsp; (And if you have trouble with that 
			idea, try the guide to theories of language evolution, linked 
			below.)<br />
			The conclusion is that something else is going on.<br />
			</p>
			<p>What is going on according to Chomsky is that the child is using 
			a genetically inherited <strong>Language Acquisition Device</strong> 
			which is hard-wired in the structure of our brains.&nbsp; We are, 
			therefore, inherently prepared to analyse the structure of whatever 
			first language(s) we are exposed to as infants.</p>
			<p>What this means is that, before we even leave the womb, our 
			brains are prepared for the kinds of phrase structures and 
			transformational rules we will need to process the language we hear.<br />
			Some have compared this to a kind of internal switchboard with which 
			we can categorise input making guesses and assumptions such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			"<span class="style_black">Aha! This language uses a Subject - Object - Verb ordering but 
			seems to place adjectives after nouns</span>"<br />
			</em>and so on.<br />
			How this works lies in the field of first-language acquisition 
			theories, to which there is a guide on this 
			site (linked below).</p>
			<p>An allied concept is known as the <strong>Critical Period 
			Hypothesis</strong> which is the source of a good deal of debate 
			concerning its existence and, if it exists, its definition.&nbsp; 
			The two key issues are:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>The definition.<br />
				Many theorists will claim that it starts 
				around the age of three and stops at 
				around the age of 13 (or so) by which time it becomes much more 
				difficult for people to acquire native-like use and 
				pronunciation of the target language.</li>
				<li>Whether and what extent the LAD is available to adults.<br />
				The assumption is often that children acquire a second or 
				subsequent language quite easily because, some say, they retain 
				access to the LAD.&nbsp; After a certain age, it is argued, 
				people have to rely on less efficient generalised learning 
				mechanisms.&nbsp; An intermediate position is taken by those who 
				contest that <strong>some</strong> elements of the system remain 
				available but some are forever lost to adults, particularly the 
				ability to attain native-like pronunciation.</li>

					<h3>The evolution of the ability to process language</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There is, unsurprisingly, some debate among evolutionary biologists 
			concerning how such a mechanism may have evolved.&nbsp; Recent 
			genetical research is pointing to a set of genes including one 
			called FOXP2 which looks like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="FOXP2" height="307" src="../../images/foxp2.jpg" width="200" /></p>
			<p>It would be a gross oversimplification to 
			dub this 'the language gene' as much else, including the 
			interactions between this gene and a range of others and with the 
			environment, is involved in 
			the ability to process language.&nbsp; 
					FOXP2 is what is known as a transcription gene.&nbsp; It 
					does not have a direct effect but it acts to switch on, or 
					off, other genes.&nbsp; What these other genes are exactly 
					and what they do is still not fully understood.&nbsp; However, the gene appears to 
			be central to our ability to process and produce language and people 
			who lack it or in whom it is mutated or inactive cannot handle 
			language.&nbsp; Incidentally, this gene has been identified in the 
			DNA extracted from Neanderthal bones (and it also occurs in 
			echolocating bats and songbirds).</p>
			<p>There is a good deal more about theories concerning the evolution 
			of language in the guide, linked below.</p>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>The LAD can be visualised as operating in combination with 
			phrase-structure and transformational rules something like this:</p>

					<h2>Part 3: Universal Grammar (UG)</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>An allied theory is that there is, therefore, something called 
			Universal Grammar.&nbsp; This is supposed to be a set of categories 
			and rules common to all languages, no matter what their individual 
			grammatical structures are like and no matter what sorts of 
			languages they are (isolating, agglutinative, synthetic and so on).<br />
			The basis for this reasoning is that without such a UG, children 
			would have nothing on which to use the LAD.</p>
			<p>Pinker sums up the viewpoint of those who accept the idea of a 
			Universal Grammar like this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">
				<span class="style_black"><em>According to Chomsky, a visiting 
				Martian scientist would surely conclude that aside from their 
				mutually unintelligible vocabularies, Earthlings speak a single 
				language</em></span><br class="style_black" />
				<span class="auto-style6">Pinker, 2007: 232</span></p>
			<p><strong>This has obvious implications for teaching:</strong></p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>If a UG exists then our learners already have the concepts 
				of things such as noun phrases, adjectives, verb phrases and so 
				on and can use these universal concepts to understand the 
				structure of a language they are learning.</li>
				<li>It is not, in other words, new to them that we can use the 
				kinds of tree diagram, phrase-structure analysis we saw above.</li>
				<li>It will also not be new to them that we can, by employing 
				comprehensible rules, transform a set of kernel sentences into a 
				new structure.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Not to take advantage of learners' inherent knowledge would seem, 
			therefore, to be somewhat perverse, wouldn't it?</p>

			</table>
			<p>Studies in comparative linguistics reveal that the 
			existence of language universals is questionable.&nbsp; Evans and 
			Levinson put it this way:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>Languages are 
			much more diverse in structure than cognitive scientists generally 
			appreciate. A widespread assumption among cognitive scientists, 
			growing out of the generative tradition in linguistics, is that all 
			languages are English-like, but with different sound systems and 
			vocabularies. The true picture is very different: languages differ 
			so fundamentally from one another at every level of description 
			(sound, grammar, lexicon, meaning) that it is very hard to find any 
			single structural property they share. The claims of Universal 
			Grammar, we will argue, are either empirically false, unfalsifiable, 
			or misleading in that they refer to tendencies rather than strict 
			universals.</em><br />
			<span class="auto-style59">Evans &amp; Levinson, 2009:2</span></span></p>
			<p>Evans and Levinson, and others, go on to point out that the 
			supposed 'big four', nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, are 
			not, in fact universals of human language at all.&nbsp; There are 
			languages which cope happily without adverbs and some without 
			adjectives (Lao, for example).&nbsp; The jury is still out (and has been for over 100 
			years) considering whether there exist languages without verbs or 
			nouns but there are certainly languages which combine verbs with 
			nouns so that something like the verb <em>cut</em> will vary 
			depending on what is being cut so the expression for <em>cutting 
			wood</em>, for example, will be a different verb from <em>cutting 
			meat</em> and so on.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, there are word-class categories in some languages 
			which do not have equivalents in others.&nbsp; Examples are the 
			classifiers which exist in many East Asian languages, ideophones 
			(single words to describe entire events or states) and obscure (to 
			speakers of Indo-European languages) categories such as positionals 
			(which refer to how objects are arranged in space) 
			and coverbs (which function a little like delexicalised verbs in 
			English but are syntactically unique).<br />
			They sum up, <em>op cit</em>.: 14 like this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">the great variability in how languages 
			organize their word-classes dilutes the plausibility of the innatist 
			UG position</p>

					<h3>Scepticism #2</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The other connected criticism directed at Chomsky is his 
			dependence on the analysis of just one language: English.&nbsp; He 
			defends the position, unapologetically like this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">I have not hesitated to propose a general 
			principle of linguistic structure on the basis of observation of a 
			single language. The inference is legitimate, on the assumption that 
			humans are not specifically adapted to learn one rather than another 
			human language ... Assuming that the genetically determined language 
			faculty is a common human possession, we may conclude that a 
			principle of language is universal if we are led to postulate it as 
			a ‘precondition’ for the
			acquisition of a single language.<br />
			<span class="auto-style26">(1980, p. 48)</span></p>
			<p>The counter argument to this is that, in fact, languages differ 
			very fundamentally from English in an almost infinite number of 
			ways.&nbsp; Many, for example, will not even have a recognisable 
			passive structure or recognisable embedded relative clauses.&nbsp; 
			In some languages, for example, verbs contain adjectives and in 
			others, adjectives themselves are marked for tense like verbs.<br />
			Rare and, to many, exotic languages exhibit a bewildering and 
			unfamiliar set of structural and lexical systems which cannot be 
			interpreted using Chomskyan grammar. generative or otherwise.&nbsp; 
			Some, e.g., Tofa (a Siberian language) has a suffix (-<em>sig</em>) 
			which may be appended to any noun and carries the meaning of <em>
			smells like</em>.&nbsp; Others may have a range of affixes which 
			denote particular sounds and so on.&nbsp; Even superficially simple 
			concepts such as <em>wh</em>-words may vary across languages which 
			require the speaker to think about the type of noun in consideration 
			before selecting the correct form of <em>How many ...? </em>to use.<br />
			Even superficially simple verbs such as <em>go</em> and <em>give</em> 
			may be rendered in ways which require the speaker to consider the 
			direction and type of travelling which is being undertaken or the 
			nature of the object of the verb <em>give</em>.&nbsp; Such 
			subtleties are not, it seems, accessible through transformational 
			generative grammar of the sort that Chomsky outlined.<br />
			The issue here is that many cognitivists are not particularly 
			interested in or well informed about the possible structures of 
			languages with which they are unfamiliar and the counter argument is 
			that language typologists are too interested in the minutiae of rare 
			language structures to see the bigger picture.&nbsp; The truth may 
			lie somewhere in between.</p>

			<p>Chomsky was concerned, in his words, <span class="style_black">
			<em>to learn something about human nature</em></span> via the task 
			of <span class="style_black"><em>studying the properties of natural 
			languages</em></span>. (Chomsky, 1974:4)</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, many argue, this has been interpreted so narrowly 
			so that the content of what people say has been lost from the task 
			of studying the properties of natural languages.&nbsp; Chomsky 
			himself (<em>ibid</em>. emphasis added) refers to the
			<span class="style_black"><em>structure, organisation,
			<span class="style_underline">and use</span></em></span> of 
			languages but the last part has been neglected.&nbsp; He also, 
			incidentally, refers to languages in the plural which goes some way 
			to countering the objections above.<br />
			The argument goes on that we cannot understand people's languages if 
			they are divorced from their cultural and social contexts and 
			studied in a vacuum.<br />
			With reference to language teaching and English Language Teaching in 
			particular, Hymes stated (1971:278):</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em><span class="style_black">There are rules of use without which 
			the rules of grammar would be useless</span>.</em></p>
			<p>For example, a rule of use in English-speaking cultures is that 
			direct statements of wishes are generally perceived as rude so they 
			are normally tempered or  rephrased to provide some distance.&nbsp; 
			It is perfectly possible in English and probably in all languages to 
			say:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I want that</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me a coffee</em><br />
			but, in English and a range of languages, there is a rule of use 
			which disallows such directness and requires something like:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like that</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please give me a coffee.<br />
			</em>Honorifics, too, are subject to rules of use just as strict as 
			rules of grammar.&nbsp; English has a fairly simple system requiring 
			honorific use in some settings (courtrooms, schools, formal meetings 
			and so on) but Japanese, to take a well-known example, appends 
			honorifics to nouns and verbs in a complex manner which is not, 
			arguably, something that structural linguistics of any sort can deal 
			with adequately.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>So, before we get too enthusiastic about using Chomskyan 
			theories to inform our teaching we should remember that he was 
			addressing the ways in which:</p>
			<ol class="redbullet">
				<li>
				the language is structured at an 
				abstract level (i.e., at the level of competence not 
				performance).</li>
				<li>
				our first (not 
				subsequent) languages are acquired.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Chomsky is not fundamentally concerned with second language 
			teaching and learning.&nbsp; That his theories may inform those who 
			are, is another matter.</p>
