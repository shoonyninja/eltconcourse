	By this definition, we employ different registers to suit different 
	social settings.<br />
	For example, in some settings we might avoid using 
	slang and words such as <em>ain't</em> because the social pressure is to adopt 
	a more correct and formal tone.&nbsp; In some writing, such as emails to 
	friends, we might ignore niceties of punctuation and spelling and in other 
	writing we would be very careful to get this just right.<br />
	This definition, though now arguably out of date, is often used in language 
	teaching to describe levels of formality when <em>style</em> would be a 
	better term.<br />
	The fact that it is an out-of-date and discredited use of the term register 
	cannot, however, be denied.&nbsp; The distinction between style (a measure 
	of formality) and register (a measure of appropriateness to social setting) 
	has been around for well over 50 years (Stern 1983:125).</dd>

			By this definition, we employ different registers depending on 
			the topic of concern and our roles.<br />
			Doctors, journalists, 
			carpenters, hotel receptionists, help-line workers and even language teachers have a distinct set of terms 
			and phrases which they use professionally.&nbsp; Games and sports 
			also have particular lexical items which are characteristic of them 
			and so on.<br />
			Allied to this is the notion that register defines language by <em>
			user</em> rather than <em>use</em> so we have distinctive varieties 
			such as legalese and motherese along with sports commentator 
			language, IT-ese and so on.</dd>
</dl>
		<p>As we shall shortly see, there is a close relationship between 
		appropriate style and appropriate register but the concepts are 
		fundamentally different.</p>

		<p>One sociolinguistic definition of style is</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><em>varieties of language 
		viewed from the point of view of formality</em><br />
		<span class="auto-style14">(Trudgill, 1992)</span></p>
		<p>Style, properly considered, is a consequence of the constraints of 
		register because it is the register in which people operate that often 
		determines the level of formality which is appropriate.&nbsp; It is, 
		however, not always the case that informal style cannot be deployed in 
		professional registers or that formal style is not sometimes used 
		between friends and relations with whom one normally communicates quite 
		informally.</p>
		<p>The most useful categorisations of style from a language teacher's point 
		of view are arguably those suggested by Martin Joos (1961):</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tablebrownborder" style="width: 100%">
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 132px" class="style_black">Frozen style</td>
				<td class="auto-style6">The wording remains unchanged in this 
				style so it includes things like quotations from Shakespeare, 
				some written signs such as <em>The management accepts no 
				liability for ...</em>&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; Often this style is written but it 
				does occur in spoken language less commonly.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style4" style="width: 132px">Formal style</td>
				<td class="auto-style5">This is most familiar in the form of 
				lectures and monologues where interruption is not allowed and 
				technical, precise language is at a premium.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style4" style="width: 132px">Consultative style</td>
				<td class="auto-style5">This is the sort of thing that occurs 
				between, e.g., doctors and patients, teachers and students, 
				counsellors and clients, service providers and customers etc.&nbsp; It allows for two-way 
				communication but shared knowledge is not essential.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style4" style="width: 132px">Casual style</td>
				<td class="auto-style5">This is such as happens in 
				communications between friends.&nbsp; It is characterised by lots of slang and some 
				in-group language, plenty of interruption and a good deal of 
				assumed knowledge so a lot can be left out or left unsaid.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style4" style="width: 132px">Intimate style</td>
				<td class="auto-style5">This occurs between family members and 
				very close friends and is characterised by a good deal of 
				non-verbal communication and some 'private' vocabulary.&nbsp; It 
				is not commonly adopted in the public domain.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br />
		Of course, this is not a neatly defined set of styles and it's easy to 
		see that each merges seamlessly into the adjacent styles.&nbsp; In fact, it's 
		possible to invent new categories of ever-increasing precision, such as 
		semi-formal, but it 
		isn't helpful for our purposes to do so.<br />
		The key issue here is that style is dependent on appropriate language 
		use in a social setting.&nbsp; It differs from register in that the 
		latter is concerned with the sorts of language used by certain people in 
		certain topic areas and settings.&nbsp; 
		In other words, register is defined by the language 
		<span class="style_underline">user</span> not by the language <span class="style_underline">use</span>.<br />

		<p>Native or very expert speakers are at home in a variety styles and 
		registers.&nbsp; In other words, native speakers are multicodal in the 
		sense that they can switch codes depending on the setting they find 
		themselves in and the domain (or field of discourse) in which they are 
		operating.<br />
		Doctors, lawyers and English language teachers, for example, will be 
		equally at ease using both register-specific language and 
		situation-specific formality.<br />
		Dialect and accent, too, are issues and their use may be appropriate in 
		certain styles (usually less formal) and in certain social settings 
		(registers).&nbsp; Using a regional accent or dialect terms at other 
		times is something many will consciously avoid.</p>
		<p>Learners of English, on the other hand, will not have these skills to 
		draw on and may be very limited, therefore, in the amount of appropriacy 
		they can bring to their language production.<br />
		Register-appropriate language is the meat and drink of teachers of 
		language for special purposes (business, academic English, engineering, air-traffic 
		control etc.) but considerations of style affect all teachers (or 
		should).</p>

		<h2>Six types of register</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Up to now, we have only been considering one form of register, 
		namely, that determined by the topic or, in Halliday's term, the <em>
		field of discourse</em> in which the choice, particularly of 
		topic-specific or technical lexis is determined.&nbsp; There are, 
		following Chui, 1972, five other determinates of language use which can 
		be ascribed to register in the widest sense of the term.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Temporal variation<br />
			Language choices vary over time as a glance at a newspaper written 
			20 years ago and one in current circulation will confirm.&nbsp; This 
			is a natural and well-documented phenomenon in all languages 
			although English, in its role as the dominant language in science 
			and technology as well as the social sciences, is more prone to 
			change than many other languages.<br />
			Terms such as the verb to text or those used to describe 
			internet-related phenomena are obvious examples of words which are 
			marked as having up-to-date relevance whereas other terms, such as 
			wireless or horseless carriage, once also cutting-edge technologies 
			are falling out of fashion and are marked for obsolescence rather 
			than current use.</li>
			<li>Geographical variation<br />
			English is spoken very widely in the world and a range of 
			identifiable varieties have developed all of which will have 
			peculiarities of lexis, pronunciation and grammar associated with 
			them.&nbsp; Within a single nation, too, there are wide dialectical 
			variations with grammatical, phonological and lexical differences.&nbsp; 
			For example, in the north of Britain, the use of a negative 
			expression such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They'll not be coming</em><br />
			is more prevalent, whereas in the south, the preferred form is more 
			likely to be:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They won't be coming</em><br />
			There are, too, as most people can attest variations in words for 
			common objects both within national dialects and between national 
			varieties such as the use in AmE of <em>elevator</em> where BrE 
			prefers <em>lift</em>.<br />
			For more, see the guide to language variety linked in the list of related guides at the end.</li>
			<li>Social variation<br />
			Within all languages there are attested differences in language use 
			depending on social class and position.&nbsp; In some languages, 
			these are very marked indeed and are the product of centuries of 
			class division and caste systems only now beginning to be broken 
			down.&nbsp; In English, some evidence exists of distinctions between 
			what are termed U (upper class) and non-U (lower class) uses of 
			certain words such as <em>coat</em> (U) vs. <em>jacket</em> (non-U),
			<em>serviette</em> (non-U) vs. <em>napkin</em> (U) and so on.</li>
			<li>Social role variation<br />
			This is the nearest register gets to being better described as style 
			because role relationships, especially power relationships, directly 
			affect the types of language speakers and writers will deploy.&nbsp; 
			Deferential language is more likely to be used by those with lower 
			power in a given setting and imperatives and demands are more likely 
			to be deployed by those who have greater power in any setting.&nbsp; 
			The fact that power relationships are very variable and often 
			setting specific means that speakers consciously and unconsciously 
			use different language forms in different social settings.</li>
			<li>Mode variation<br />
			Mode is another Hallidayean term and refers to the channel of 
			communication.&nbsp; Written vs. spoken vs. texted vs. Twitter and 
			other social media channels will all have an effect, sometimes a 
			very distinct one on the choice of vocabulary, grammar and precision 
			that language users make.&nbsp; For example, the use of 
			abbreviations such as LOL (laughed out loud or lots of love) will 
			not occur in spoken forms of language and not will they appear in 
			formal written communication.&nbsp; Grammatical complexity varies, 
			too, from mode to mode so an academic text will display markedly 
			more sophistication than a Twitter message.</li>
