			<p>There is an additional type of exophoric referencing, not

			for its understanding.&nbsp; So for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're going to the zoo<br />
			</em>will be understood in many cultural, national or regional 
			settings to refer only to a particular zoo known to both parties to 
			the exchange, regardless of the fact that there are many zoos in the

				</table>
			<p>The following draws heavily on Halliday and Hasan (1976) as does 
			much else in this area of study.<br />
			We'll take each of the categories they identified and exemplify them 
			with short written or spoken texts.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>References and referents</dt>
				<dd>The <strong>reference</strong> is the item doing the 
				pointing in a text, the <strong>referent</strong> is the item to 
				which it directs the hearer or reader.<br />
				The most common ways by far to achieve this type of cohesion is 
				to use the English pronoun system, in particular, personal and 
				demonstrative pronouns, but others, such as <em>the former, the 
				other</em> etc. which work similarly, are also encountered.<br />
				Here are simple examples or two of the most common ways 
				references and referents are used:<ol>
					<li>Personal pronoun referencing (anaphoric):<br />
					<img alt="1" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg1.png" width="200" /><br />
					Personal pronoun referencing (cataphoric):<br />
					<img alt="2" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg2.png" width="200" /></li>
					<li>Demonstrative pronoun referencing (anaphoric):<br />
					<img alt="3" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg3.png" width="200" /><br />
					Demonstrative pronoun referencing (cataphoric):<br />
					<img alt="4" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg4.png" width="200" /></li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt>Substitution</dt>
				<dd>Substitution is the replacement of an item with something 
				which refers to it and is often (as we see above) a simple 
				pronoun reference.&nbsp; It may, however, be more complex so it 
				gets its own category.<br />
				Here are three examples of the system at work:<ol>
					<li>Nominal clause substitution:<br />
					<img alt="5" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg5.png" width="200" /></li>
					<li>Verbal substitution:<br />
					<img alt="6" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg6.png" width="200" /></li>
					<li>Clausal substitution:<br />
					<img alt="7" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg7.png" width="200" /></li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt>Ellipsis</dt>
				<dd>Involves, as the name suggests, simply omitting the referent 
				and relying on context and co-text for the sense to be clear to 
				the hearer (usually) or writer (rarely).<br />
				Here are three examples of the system at work with the white 
				triangle indicating where the item it omitted:<ol>
					<li>Nominal clause ellipsis:<br />
					<img alt="8" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg8.png" width="200" /></li>
					<li>Verb ellipsis:<br />
					<img alt="9" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg9.png" width="200" /></li>
					<li>Clausal ellipsis:<br />
					<img alt="10" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg10.png" width="200" /></li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt>Conjunction</dt>
				<dd>We'll consider four types only here (although there are more 
				in the guides to the areas).&nbsp; This area also includes the 
				use of conjuncts which lie outside the clause structure.<ol>
					<li>Additive conjunct:<br />
					<img alt="11" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg11.png" width="200" /></li>
					<li>Adversative conjunction:<br />
					<img alt="12" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg12.png" width="200" /></li>
					<li>Clausal conjunction:<br />
					<img alt="13" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg13.png" width="200" /></li>
					<li>Temporal conjunction:<br />
					<img alt="14" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg14.png" width="200" /></li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt>Lexical cohesion</dt>
				<dd>This is a varied category and refers to how lexical choices 
				act to make a text cohere.&nbsp; It is most obvious in written 
				texts because there are usually three or so topic areas which 
				form threads of connected ideas through the text.<ol>
					<li>Repetition:<br />
					<img alt="15" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg15.png" width="200" /></li>
					<li>Synonym:<br />
					<img alt="16" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg16.png" width="200" /></li>
					<li>Hyponym:<br />
					<img alt="17" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg17.png" width="200" /></li>
					<li>Superordinate or hypernym:<br />
					<img alt="18" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg18.png" width="200" /></li>
					<li>General term (vague):<br />
					<img alt="19" height="62" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_eg19.png" width="200" /></li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Most of the examples above are, or could be, in spoken texts so now, 
			to balance things, we'll turn to a written text.</p>

					<h2>Shell nouns: another source of cohesion</h2>

				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>This guide is about cohesion and mostly focuses on the ways in 
			which it is achieved via referencing and connective devices.<br />
			There is, however, an additional lexical trick in most 
			languages through which entire texts and sets of propositions can be 
			effectively linked through the use of shell nouns.<br />
			These are discussed at a greater level of detail in the guide to 
			them, linked below, so here we will just cite more or less what is 
			said in the guide to nouns in general to give you a flavour of how 
			they operate to increase internal cohesion in texts.<br />
			Briefly, what shell nouns do is to 
			encapsulate ideas in a way that makes the noun itself the shell for 
			a set of propositions.&nbsp; For example in:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>The problem is that too many vehicles use 
			the new bypass causing congestion at peak times so the aim is to 
			limit the traffic by improving and extending alternative routes 
			through the suburbs.</em></p>
			<p>we have two shell nouns, <span class="style_black"><em>problem</em></span> 
			and <span class="style_black"><em>aim</em></span> which respectively 
			encapsulate the propositions of identifying an issue and seeking a 
			solution.<br />
			The shell noun is usually followed by the proposition that it 
			encapsulates linked either with a <em>that-</em>clause (<em>problem</em>) 
			or just a simple copula such as <em>be</em> (<em>aim</em>).<br />
			Shell nouns fall into recognisable categories which are explained 
			and exemplified in the guide to them.&nbsp; They include, for 
			example, nouns such as:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">ability, advantage, aim, aspect, belief, 
			capacity, context, danger, difference, doubt, drawback, effort, 
			event, fact, idea, knowledge, mistake, mystery, need, opportunity, 
			part, permission, place, plan, position, possibility, priority, 
			problem, problem, procedure, proof, question, reality, reason, 
			result, sign, similarity, situation, situation, solution, struggle, 
			theory, time, trouble, truth, view, way, worry</p>
			<p>The use of shell nouns is particularly common is some kinds of 
			academic texts in which the author is concerned to set up a series 
			of propositions under an overall heading of, e.g., <em>reason, 
			problem, theory, outcome, necessity</em> and so on.<br />
			In terms of cohesion, you can see the efficacy of using shell nouns 
			by comparing these two short texts:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style77">
				<li><em>People in the organisation are spending too much 
				duplicating work that is being done in other departments leading 
				to unfocused activity and often to internal contradictions.&nbsp; 
				This must be addressed by setting out clearer definitions of 
				people's roles.&nbsp; It can be tackled in one of three ways ...</em></li>
				<li><em>People in the organisation are spending too much 
				duplicating work that is being done in other departments leading 
				to unfocused activity and often to internal contradictions.&nbsp; 
				This <strong>wasteful duplication</strong> must be addressed by 
				setting out clearer definitions of people's roles.&nbsp; It can 
				be tackled in one of three ways ...</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>It should be clear that in the second version, the issue is 
			discussed within a noun shell, the expression <em>wasteful 
			duplication</em>, which is quite specific and more carefully defined 
			than it would be with the use of a more generalised shell noun such 
			as <em>problem</em>.<br />In the first version, the use of <em>it</em> in the final sentence is 
			potentially confusing because the reader is left to surmise what the 
			referent might be.&nbsp; In the second version, because we have a 
			shell noun, it is quite clear what <em>it</em> refers to: <em> <strong>wasteful duplication</strong></em>.<br />That means that the writer can thereafter refer to the whole 
			set of propositions with a simple pronouns, <em>this, that </em>or<em> it</em>, 
			used to refer to <em>the wasteful duplication</em> rather than vaguely 
			pointing at something in the text.<br />
			It also means that the text hangs together much more successfully 
			because the reader is aware of exactly what is being discussed.&nbsp; 
			In other words, cohesion is achieved.<br />

			click here</a>.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>Here's a diagrammatic way to show what resources are available to 
			maintain and construct cohesion:<br />
			<img alt="summary" height="524" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_summary.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>You may find all of the above referred to as discourse markers 
			and some of them are.&nbsp; However, properly understood, the term 
			discourse marker applies to an item used to manage spoken 
			interaction so things like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I see your point but ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, for a start ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you see?</em><br />
			etc. are discourse markers which contribute to coherent exchanges.<br />
			On this site, we avoid the term discourse marker except in this 
			narrower sense and prefer cohesive device for the items we are 
			concerned with in this guide.</p>

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>The role of articles</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are three ways that article use contributes to cohesion and 
			referencing.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The first time a noun is mentioned, it is usually preceded (if 
			it is countable) by the indefinite article.&nbsp; The second time by 
			the definite article, signalling to the reader / hearer that the 
			reference is to a known item.&nbsp; For example,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strange car was parked outside my house.&nbsp; It's difficult 
			to find a parking space in my street so I hoped the car wouldn't be 
			there later.<br />
			</em>In that example, the use of <em>the car</em> later signals that 
			it is a known entity and refers to the same car.</li>
			<li>Note however, that we can use the definite article to signal the 
			only possible entity as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A car drew up and the driver got out.<br />
			</em>In this case, the 
			definite article signals to the reader / hearer that it is the driver 
			of a particular car, not just any driver.<br />Consider the oddness 
			of:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			A car drew up and a driver got out<br />
			</em>but the acceptability of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A car drew up and a passenger got out</em></li>
			<li>The definite article may also refer to something outside the 
			text which is known to both speaker / writer and reader / hearer because 
			they share a common cultural or social milieu.&nbsp; For example,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minister has replied to our letter<br />
			</em>Now, <em>minister</em> can mean a politician or a member of the 
			clergy and there are probably many thousands of them around the 
			world.&nbsp; It is clear, however, from the use of the definite 
			article that a particular minister, known to both participants in 
			the discourse, is meant here.<br />
			Another example, of what is called homophoric reference is to 
			entities such as <em>the government, the Queen, the President, the 
			Czar</em> etc. when knowledge of the culture precludes any other 
			meaning.<br />
			Exophoric referencing cannot, 
			technically, be called cohesive because it does not connect items in 
			the text.&nbsp; It is, however, a potential barrier to 
			understanding and makes the text coherent.</li>

			<p>Mention is briefly made above to theme-rheme structures and 
			here's a little more on that, erm, theme.<br />
			There are three types of theme that contribute to cohesion in texts, 
			whether written or spoken:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Topical themes<br />
				are the most familiar and concern us in what follows.&nbsp; They 
				refer to the subject of the verb usually so in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">The washing 
				machine in the basement</span> has broken down</em><br />
				the noun phrase <em>The washing machine in the basement</em> is 
				the topical theme and the rest of the sentence constitutes the 
				rheme.<br />
				The topical theme is not always the subject of the verb, 
				however, so we can also have, e.g., with the topical themes
				<span class="styleblackbold">highlighted</span>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was </em><span class="styleblackbold">
				<em>John </em></span><em>she gave the money to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>The clothes</em></span><em> 
				have been washed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>Money</em></span><em>, 
				that's what we need</em><br />
				Topical themes are often fronted but may be post-positioned as 
				in the first of those examples.</li>
				<li>Textual themes<br />
				serve directly to link items together and in this guide we have 
				been referring to them as conjunctions and conjuncts.&nbsp; 
				Additionally, <em>wh-</em>words can form textual themes.&nbsp; 
				The textual themes are <span class="styleblackbold">highlighted
				</span>in these examples:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary spoke to him
				<span class="styleblackbold">as soon as</span> she arrived.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was, <span class="styleblackbold">however</span>, not 
				really listening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Why </span>was that?</em></li>
				<li>Interpersonal themes<br />
				concern the interactions between speakers (usually) and signal 
				the speaker's opinions and viewpoints.&nbsp; They are
				<span class="styleblackbold">highlighted </span>in these 
				examples:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="styleblackbold">might
				</span>get upset<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">I think</span> she's going to<br />
				</em>In most cases, interpersonal themes do not contribute 
				specifically to cohesion but they are powerful drivers of 
				coherence in texts.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This is important because, although we may know what forms of cohesion there are in English, unless we 
		know what to connect with what, the picture is incomplete and the 
		knowledge is unused (and useless).&nbsp; The analysis of theme-rheme 
		structures allows us to identify where and to what references <em>should</em> 
		be made, in other words.</p>
		<p>There is a separate guide to theme-rheme structures on this site, 
		linked below, 
		where you should go for more detail but, briefly, the theme is the 
		jumping off point for the clause and what follows it is the rheme.&nbsp; 
		That rheme often forms the theme of the next clause with a new rheme 
		which, in turn forms the theme of a subsequent clause.&nbsp; The 
		structure of this form of cohesion can be exemplified like this:</p>
		<p class="indentpara">Mary came to the party and she brought her 
		brother.&nbsp; He turned out to be an interesting person because he 
		worked in television with some quite famous people.&nbsp; They included 
		some of my favourite personalities.</p>
		<p>In which we have:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style89">
				<li>The first theme (<em>Mary</em>) with its rheme (<em>came 
		to the party</em>) and then the theme repeated, with linking additive 
		coordination (<em>and</em>) and pronoun substitution (<em>she</em>) with 
		a new rheme <em>brought her brother</em>.</li>
				<li>That rheme forms the theme of the next clause (<em>turned out to be an interesting person</em>) 
		which is connected by subordination (<em>because</em>) with the next 
		pronoun substitution (<em>he</em>) with its rheme (<em>worked in 
		television with some quite famous people</em>).</li>
				<li>That rheme becomes the next theme (<em>they</em>) which has the rheme <em>included some of 
		my favourite personalities</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>And so on.&nbsp; We would expect at some time that <em>my 
			favourite personalities</em> 
		will become the topical theme of another clause which will have its own rheme.&nbsp; 
			It not always as straightforward as this, of course, because rhemes 
			do not always immediately (or ever) become themes and may have to 
			wait a little before, say, Rheme 3 becomes Theme 8.&nbsp; More on 
			this is in the guide.<br />
			It looks like this, with the cohesive links (both topical and 
			textual) <span class="style_underline">underlined</span> (and a 
			diagram is often a good way to present the structure in a 
			classroom).<br />
			<img alt="diagram" height="492" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohesion_theme_rheme.png" width="465" /></p>
		<p>The moral is that teaching people how to make texts cohesive without 
		teaching what items <strong>need</strong> cohesive links is a waste of valuable time.</p>
