			<p>Deixis is derived from the Greek word for reference or showing 
			(the adjective is <em>deictic</em>, incidentally).&nbsp; It 
			concerns the ability of language to identify objects, times, people 
			or ideas with reference to something else.&nbsp; In other words, it 
			refers to things which can only be understood in some kind of 
			context.<br />
			In simpler terms, deixis refers to the way we signal 
			<em>here</em> or <em>there</em>, <em>now</em> or <em>then</em> and 
			<em>you</em> or <em>I</em>.</p>
			<p>A definition:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>The name given to those aspects of language whose interpretation 
			is relative to the occasion of utterance<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style72"><span class="auto-style73">Fillmore (1966) in Harman 
			(1989)</span></span></p>
			<p>If, for example, you say<em>:</em></p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em><strong>I like it </strong> <span class="style_black">
				<strong>here</strong></span></em></dt>
				<dd>We can only understand what <em>here</em> refers to by knowing 
			where you are &ndash; <em>here</em> is a <strong>relative</strong> 
					not absolute concept of space.<br />
				The centre is <strong>
					here</strong>.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>I like </strong> </em><span class="style_black"><em>
				<strong>him</strong></em></span></dt>
				<dd>We can only understand what <em>him</em> refers to by 
					knowing who you are.<br />
				The centre is <strong>I</strong>.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>She is going </strong> </em><span class="style_black"><em>
				<strong>tomorrow</strong></em></span></dt>
				<dd>We can only understand what <em>tomorrow</em> means by 
					knowing when this is said.<br />
				The centre is <strong>now</strong>.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>In the first sentence, <em>here</em> 
			is an adverb (although some analyses will refer to it as a pro-form 
			standing for <em>this place</em>) but deictic pointers can fall 
			into various word classes.<br />
			In the second example, the pointer is a pronoun and in the third 
			example it is another adverb (also classifiable as a noun acting 
			adverbially, in this case).</p>

					<td class="auto-style7">
					<h2>The centre</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The deictic centre is the place, time or person from which everything else 
			is relative.&nbsp; For example</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>I gave it to him </em>(the deictic centre is <em>
				<strong>I</strong></em> &ndash; 
				the person from which <em>him</em> can be understood)</li>
				<li><em>I went yesterday</em> (the deictic centre is the time 
				of speaking: <strong>now</strong> &ndash; without knowing that, <em>yesterday</em> is 
				meaningless)</li>
				<li><em>I will sit there</em> (the deictic centre is <strong>the speaker's 
				position</strong> &ndash; without knowing that, we have no idea where <em>
				there</em> is)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is impossible to understand a simple sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are going there tomorrow</em><br />
			without knowing what the deictic centre is.&nbsp; In other words, we 
			need to know who is speaking, when they are speaking and where they 
			are speaking.&nbsp; We also, incidentally, need to know whether <em>
			we</em> includes or excludes the hearer.</p>

			<p>
				We can, in fact, move the centre away from the speaker / writer and 
			we often do.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Keeping the centre in place:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I am going to London soon</em><br />
				The deictic centre is <em>I</em> and <em>now<br />
				</em>There is no shifting of the centre because <em>go</em> 
				indicates movement away from here and <em>soon</em> is related 
				to now.</li>
				<li>Moving the centre:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I am coming to see you<br />
				</em>The deictic centre has been shifted from <em>here</em> 
				to <em>there </em>because<em> come </em>indicates movement 
				towards.&nbsp; In many languages, that would be more logically 
				rendered as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to see you</em><br />
				but, in English, that would be ambiguous because we don't know 
				if the <em>going to</em> bit refers to a current intention or a movement 
				away from here.<br />
				In English we conventionally move the centre to the person being 
				addressed.&nbsp; It is considered polite.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This shifting of the centre accounts for a great deal of 
			confusion with related verbs such as <em>bring-fetch-take</em> and
			<em>come-go</em> in English because other languages conceptualise 
			spatial and temporal relationships differently.&nbsp; Japanese, for 
			example, always uses the equivalents of <em>come</em> and <em>go</em> 
			from the point of view of the speaker.&nbsp; German tends also to be 
			speaker centred in this respect.<br />
			It results in 
			errors such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'll bring you to the station<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I'll go to you now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you coming to the cinema with us?&nbsp; *Yes, I'm going.<br />
			</em>Diagrammatically representing the deictic centre to learners 
			is often helpful.&nbsp; Like this:<br />
			<img alt="bring fetch take" height="227" src="../../imagesgraphics/bring_fetch_take.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>In the last example with <em>bring</em> the speaker remains on 
			the left but has moved the centre to the hearer on the right, hence 
			the use of <em>bring</em> rather than <em>take</em> and <em>come</em> 
			rather than <em>go</em> which would be 
			the preferred forms in many languages.<br />
			Much confusion and distress can be avoided by simply explaining to 
			learners that in English we often imagine ourselves in the hearer's 
			place (moving the deictic centre) and that explains why we can say 
			say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll bring a bottle to John's party next week</em><br />
			The speaker has simply moved the centre to John and therefore is 
			happy to use a verb which means <em>towards me</em> rather than <em>
			away from me</em>.<br />
			The speaker could also have said:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll take a bottle to John's party next week</em><br />
			without moving the centre but if she were speaking to John on the 
			telephone, it is almost certain that she would use <em>bring</em> 
			because that is considered courteous.<br />
			Out here on the web, people have posted all kinds of weird reasons 
			for the anomalous use of these verbs in English but it's actually 
			quite simple once one is armed with an understanding of the 
			rudiments of deixis.</p>

			<p>English does not distinguish between nouns by gender unless the 
			sex is clear but number is another matter.&nbsp; In English, <em>
			they</em> is often used to refer to a singular person whose sex is 
			not known:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person who wrote this is illiterate; <span class="style_red">
			<strong>they</strong> </span>can't even spell.<br />
			</em>The use of <em>they, their </em>and <em>them</em> to refer to a 
			singular entity whose sex is not known or irrelevant is attested in 
			English from at least the 14th century.&nbsp; Only when 
			Latin-influenced grammarians rose to prominence did the insistence 
			on the non-marked use of <em>he</em> arise.&nbsp; The use of the 
			plural pronoun and determiners, <em>they, their, theirs</em>, to 
			denote a singular referent is making something of a comeback.</p>
			<p>English also has no gender marker for plural entities: <em>you, 
			we, they</em> are all unmarked forms.&nbsp; When we say<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrived late</em><br />
			we have no idea whether the group is male only, female only or 
			mixed.&nbsp; We do not even know if we are referring to people or 
			objects.</p>
			<p>Other languages distinguish, e.g., between plural 
			females and plural males (such as French does with <em>elles</em> 
			and <em>ils</em>) so it is clear who is being referred to.&nbsp; For 
			a mixed group, the masculine plural is 
			used in most languages which make this distinction.&nbsp; However, 
			in French the word for <em>person</em> is <em>personne</em> and it 
			is feminine so when the plural (<em>les personnes</em>) is referred 
			to, the appropriate pronoun is <em>elles</em> even if all the people 
			are male.&nbsp; Similar phenomena exist in other languages (Spanish, 
			for example).<br />
			There is a guide, linked below, to how languages handle gender and 
			how gender marking in English may be avoided.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Languages which distinguish all nouns by gender (as very many do) 
			will usually demand the use of the gender-specific pronoun.&nbsp; 
			For example, in both German and Greek, the word for <em>group</em> 
			is feminine (<em>die Gruppe, η ομάδα [ee om</em><strong><em>a</em></strong><em>da]</em>).&nbsp; In these cases, 
			the feminine pronoun must be used to refer to it, even if everyone 
			in the group is male.&nbsp; We get, therefore:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The group has arrived and she is getting on her bus<br />
			</em>English, incidentally, gets confused here and speakers will use 
			a plural pronoun to refer to the group (which is clearly a singular 
			count noun), so we can have either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group has arrived and it is getting on 
			the bus</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group have arrived and they are getting 
			on the bus</em><br />
			We can even allow:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The group has arrived and they are getting on the bus</em><br />
			in which we promiscuously mix singular verb forms with plural 
			pronoun forms.<br />

					<h3><strong>Social deixis</strong></h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We claimed above that there are 4 main categories of deixis: 
			personal, spatial, temporal and discourse.<br />
			Some writers (e.g., Levinson, 1983) also identify a fifth category, 
			social deixis.&nbsp; It comes in two flavours:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Relative social deixis<br />
				In many European languages there is a distinction between 
			familiar and polite forms of the pronoun <em>you</em> and the 
			distinction signals closeness and/or formality.&nbsp; This is called 
			the T-V distinction after the French (or Latin) <em>tu</em> and <em>
			vous</em> forms.&nbsp; German, incidentally, also has a plural 
			familiar form (<em>ihr</em>) which many Romance languages in 
			Europe lack.<br />
				Many East- and South-Asian languages, such as Japanese, also have 
			distinguishing honorifics (such as <em>san</em>) which make more 
			complex and subtle social relationships clear.<br />
				English is defective in this area, making no distinction in the 
			pronoun between social closeness or distance or even the number of 
			people addressed.&nbsp; It just uses <em>you</em>.<br />
				This form of deixis is referred to as relative because its use 
				depends on the relationship between speakers / writers and 
				hearers / readers.&nbsp; For example, whether or not one uses 
				the familiar or polite pronoun for <em>you</em> in most 
				languages which make the distinction depends on closeness of 
				relationship between speakers and sometimes on the addressees' 
				provenance (in Greek, for example, the familiar form is 
				customary for all fellow residents of a village regardless of 
				how well they are known to the speaker).</li>
				<li>Absolute social deixis<br />
				In this area English is somewhat richer in having conventional ways to address people especially in certain, 
				usually formal, settings.&nbsp; Such terms include, e.g., <em>
				Your Honour, Ms., Miss, Mrs, Sir, Madam, Your Grace, Captain, 
				Mr President, Your Lordship, Ma'am, Doctor, 
				Ladies and Gentlemen</em> and so on.<br />
				Absolute forms such as these are confined to certain 
				settings, of course, and a judge is unlikely to be addressed as
				<em>Your Honour</em> or <em>My Lord</em> by his family and 
				friends although that term would be used even by close contacts 
				in professional settings.<br />
				Even when reference is not direct but to a third person, there 
				are conventions of identification so we speak of, e.g., <em>Her 
				Majesty, His Excellency, Mr, His Honour, Mr Chairman, The Very 
				Reverend</em> and so on.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Levinson (1969) gives examples from many languages in which the 
			use not only of terms of address but also syntax, the entire pronoun 
			system and other language items are dependent on the conventions of 
			social deixis.&nbsp; The conventions apply in some languages, not 
			only to whom one is speaking but also to any reference to a third 
			party and even depend on the status of any bystanders.</p>

					<h3><strong>Empathetic deixis</strong></h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This form of deixis is sometimes analysed as a separate type but 
			here, we'll consider it a subset of social and personal deixis.<br />
			It is usually expressed through the use of demonstrative determiners 
			and pronouns.<br />
			It is clear that, in English, <em>that</em> and <em>those</em> are 
			distal references far from the speaker while <em>this</em> and <em>
			these</em> are proximal references, near to the speaker.&nbsp; (For 
			more, see the following section on spatial deixis.)&nbsp; They are 
			also used in a metaphorical manner to give a sense of nearness or 
			distance of abstract ideas.<br />
			For example, compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a problem, isn't it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are things we need to deal with</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a problem, isn't it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are things you need to deal with</em><br />
			In the first pair of sentences, the speaker is evoking a sense of 
			empathy with the use of the proximal pronouns which give a sense of 
			cooperation and, metaphorically, nearness to both speaker and 
			hearer.&nbsp; In the second pair of sentences, the speaker has 
			selected the pronouns to give a sense of distancing from the issue 
			and there is no or less sense of cooperation and empathy.<br />
			Often, a speaker may select a passive structure to enhance the sense 
			of distance as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's something that needs to be dealt with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are problems which must be solved</em></p>

			<p>The different ways in which the learners' first languages deal 
			with personal deixis is the source of a good deal of error such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The team got off the bus and she ran into the stadium.</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The group of friends met at 9 and then it went to the cinema.</em><br />
			which is grammatically sound but almost impossible to a 
			native-speaker's ear.<br />
			as well as stylistic errors such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You give me that</em><br />
			which is fine in languages in which the pronoun is already marked 
			for politeness but can cause offence in English if no politeness 
			routine such as <em>Please would, ... I wonder if you could ... </em>etc. 
			is used.</p>

			</table>
			<p>In English the form <em>you</em> refers to other people including 
			the hearer and does not include the speaker and the form <em>we</em> 
			includes the speaker(s) and may or may not include the hearers.<br />
			Other languages do things differently and distinguish between a 
			pronoun meaning <em>you</em> not including the hearer and <em>you</em> 
			including the hearer as well as having a separate pronoun for <em>we</em> 
			not including the hearer and <em>we</em> including the hearer.<br />
			English cannot do this and cannot, additionally, distinguish between
			<em>they</em> including a third party and <em>they</em> excluding a 
			third party.</p>

					<h2>Temporal deixis</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are two main types of temporal reference:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Adverbials</strong><br />
				The obvious ones are items such as <em>tomorrow, yesterday, the 
				day before yesterday, next year, then, now, afterwards, already, 
				yet, the week before last</em> etc.&nbsp; They are usually 
				adverbs or prepositional phrases acting as adverbials (although 
				an alternative analysis is to call some of them nouns or noun 
				phrases acting as adverbials.).<br />
				Absolute dates are excluded from this category so 
				expressions such as <em>the 4th of March 1627</em> are not 
				deictically related to now in the way that <em>10 years ago</em> 
				is because it can be understood whenever the sentence is spoken.&nbsp; 
				The prepositional phrase <em>10 years ago</em> can <strong>only</strong> 
				be understood by knowing when the statement is made.</li>
				<li><strong>Tense forms</strong><br />
				There are two types of tense in English:<ol class="redbullet">
					<li><span class="style_black">Absolute</span> tenses such as the past simple or the future with<em> 
				will</em>.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					She sold the house<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I will be 35 next birthday<br />
					</em>which both refer to time not relative to another time.&nbsp; 
					Deictically, these two utterances are related to now (where we are centred).</li>
					<li><span class="style_black">Relative</span> or relational tense 
					forms such as the perfect in English.&nbsp; 
					For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have 
				broken the lock<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I had seen him before<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I will have spoken to 
				him<br />
					</em>relate deictically 
				to other times:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have broken the lock<br />
					</em>relates to the present 
					because it is now broken and unusable.&nbsp; It is the past 
					within the present.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had seen him before<br />
					</em>relates a more to a less distant 
					past.&nbsp; It is the past within the past.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have spoken to him<br />
					</em>relates a more to a less distant 
					future.&nbsp; It is the past within the future.<br />
					Deictically, relative or relational tense forms relate one time to another, not 
					necessarily the time of speaking.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For more, see
			the 
				guides to tense and aspect linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>
			<p>Temporal deixis is problematic when it comes to indirect speech, 
			as we shall shortly see.</p>
			<h4>Other languages</h4>
			<p>Some languages do not exhibit relational tense forms so the 
			concepts in English will be obscure.&nbsp; Others may use absolute 
			terms for concepts such as <em>the previous year, the next day </em>
			etc.</p>
			<p>Not understanding the concept of relative time often leads to 
			familiar errors such as:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li class="redbullet">mistakenly using an aspect which refers to the present for an 
			absolute time:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I have done it in 1984</em></li>
				<li class="redbullet">mistakenly using an absolute tense form when a relative one is 
			required (although this is acceptable in some varieties of English)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I already did it</em></li>
				<li class="redbullet">mistakenly using the simple, absolute form of the tense to 
			refer to a time relative to a more distant future<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I will speak to him by then</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.</p>

					<h2>Spatial deixis</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In Modern English there are essentially two forms:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Near the speaker<br />
				<em><span class="style_red"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This</strong> </span>is a 
				nice place<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I am lucky to be <span class="style_red"><strong>here</strong></span><br />
				<span class="style_red"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These</strong> </span>are 
				wonderful</em></li>
				<li>Far from the speaker<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to move <span class="style_red"><strong>there</strong></span><br />
				<span class="style_red"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That</strong> </span>was a 
				wonderful place to spend a holiday<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I think <span class="style_red"><strong>those</strong> </span>
				look good</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Spatial deixis is usually achieved by the use of:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>prepositional 
			phrases:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put it <span class="style_red">
				<strong>in the corner</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They live <span class="style_red"><strong>behind the church</strong></span></em></li>
				<li>demonstrative determiners:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My colleagues gave me
				<span class="style_red"><strong>that </strong></span>picture<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want <span class="style_red"><strong>this</strong></span> 
				disc?</em></li>
				<li>demonstrative pronouns:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wants <span class="style_red">
				<strong>those</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd be happy with <span class="style_red"><strong>this</strong></span></em></li>
				<li>adverbs:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave it <span class="style_red"><strong>
				there</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go <span class="style_red"><strong>away</strong></span></em></li>
				<li>nouns (also analysable as nouns acting as adverbials):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrived <span class="style_red">
				<strong>yesterday</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They want to go <span class="style_red"><strong>home</strong></span></em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Just as tenses are relative and absolute, prepositions exhibit two forms of deixis:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black">Relative</span> position, from where the person is, was or will 
				be.<br />
				If the speaker moves, the sentence may no longer be 
				true:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is 
				<span class="style_red"><strong>on</strong></span> the left<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I can't see it; it's <span class="style_red"><strong>behind</strong></span> the tree</em></li>
				<li><span class="style_black">Absolute</span> position, but often relative to something else, in 
				which the speaker's position is irrelevant.<br />
				The sentence 
				remains true wherever the speaker is:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car park is 
				<span class="style_red"><strong>opposite / outside / near</strong></span> the school<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He has a house <span class="style_red"><strong>in the south 
				of </strong></span>Spain</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Unless it is otherwise clear from the context, spatial deixis is 
			centred on the speaker / writer but there are many cases when we can 
			move the centre.&nbsp; Here's an example of giving directions over 
			the phone or in an e-mail:</p>
			<p class="auto-style6"><em>When you get to the lane, look for a blue gate
			<span class="style_red"><strong>on the left </strong></span>and
			<span class="style_red"><strong>that</strong> </span>is where I live</em></p>
			<p>If one assumes that the addresser is at home, it is clear that 
			she/he is moving the centre of deixis to the addressee.&nbsp; From 
			the speaker / writer's point of view, the blue gate is probably not on the 
			left and <em>this</em> not <em>that</em> is where home is.<br />
			The speaker has also moved the time centre to the future, i.e., the moment the person arrives at the lane 
			and that may be months away.</p>

			<h3><a name="langs"></a>Other languages and spatial deixis</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In English, it is often the case that we project ourselves into another place.&nbsp; We get, for example, 
			when speaking on the telephone to someone who is at home:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm coming home tomorrow</em><br />
			In this case, the addressee is not in the same place as the speaker 
			and is near to or in the speaker's home<em>.</em>&nbsp; In 
			effect, we are imagining speaking from where the listener is, not 
			where we are.<br />Alternatively, when addressing someone who is in the same 
			place, we will hear:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I'm going home tomorrow<br />
			</em>because there is no need to move the deictic centre.&nbsp; The 
			verb simply indicates movement away from the current location.<br />
			It bears repeating that languages differ in the use of simple verbs 
			like this and it is a source of error.</p>
			<p>In fact, in English, not moving the deictic centre may result in 
			confusion or be deliberately done for comic or dramatic effect.&nbsp; 
			Consider the old Tommy Cooper (an English comedian) joke:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">So I rang the guesthouse bell and a lady 
			opened the window and said:<br />
			"What do you want?"<br />
			"I want to stay here," I replied.<br />
			"Well stay there, then," she said and shut the window.</p>
			<p>The key to getting the joke lies in the visitor and landlady's 
			different understandings of <em>here</em> and where the deictic 
			centre should be.</p>
			<p>Other languages do not move the centre so easily and that accounts for 
			phone answering messages in many languages which tell the caller 
			that<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not there<br />
			</em>not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not here at the moment</em>.</p>
			<p>It also accounts for some confusion between <em>go</em> and <em>come</em>.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you coming to the party?</em><br />
			is not the same as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you going to the party?</em><br />
			The first implies either that you are accompanying us / me or that 
			it is my party in my home we are referring to.<br />
			The second carries no such sense and may be referring to a party to 
			which the speaker has not been invited.<br />
			There is rich ground for covert error here.</p>
			<p>The verbs <em>leave</em> (and <em>depart</em>) and <em>arrive</em> 
			may also be subject to the movement of the deictic centre.&nbsp; 
			Usually, if we ask:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has she arrived?</em><br />
			we are referring to whether or not she has reached the speaker's 
			place but that may not be the case because the speaker may be moving 
			the deictic centre to the hearer and enquiring whether or not she 
			has reached the hearer.<br />
			A similar phenomenon occurs with <em>leave / depart</em> and:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has he left?</em><br />
			may refer to whether the person in question is no longer in the 
			speaker's vicinity or no longer in the hearer's vicinity.</p>
			<p>Old and Middle English, in common with a range of modern 
			languages including Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Georgian, Basque, 
			Korean and Japanese had a third, medial, distinction to describe things far away 
			from <strong>both</strong> speakers (<em>yonder</em> is an example) 
			and many modern languages have this form.&nbsp; It still exists in 
			some dialect forms of English such as the use of the determiner <em>yon</em>
			in Scots<em>. </em><br />
			Modern Standard English can do this but requires a periphrastic form 
			to make the distinction clear so we have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this car</em> (proximal and near the speaker)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>that car </em>(medial and far from the speaker but 
			possibly close to the hearer)<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that car over there</em> (distal and far from 
			both speaker and hearer)<br />
			German uses the same form for the demonstrative determiners <em>that</em> 
			and <em>those</em> as the definite article but when it means <em>
			that</em> or <em>those</em> rather than <em>the</em>, it is 
			stressed.<br />
			Languages which have the threefold 
			distinction can refer to objects near the speaker, objects 
			near the hearer and objects far from both the speaker and the 
			hearer, work like this usually:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><strong>proximal</strong> (near me but far from you)</li>
				<li><strong>medial</strong> (near you but far from me)</li>
				<li><strong>distal</strong> (far from both of us)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Speakers of these languages will often have difficulty deciding which 
			form is appropriate in English.&nbsp; It results in some covert, and 
			not so covert, 
			error such as saying<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want that </em>(when <em>this</em> is meant)<br />
			<em >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went here</em> (when <em>came</em> is meant)<br />and so on.</p>
			<p>In other languages, the terms <em>here</em> and <em>there</em> are very differently 
			interpreted and may depend, for example, on whether the place being 
			referred to is at a higher or lower altitude or upstream or 
			downstream from the speaker.</p>

					<h2>Discourse deixis</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We need to be slightly careful to distinguish here between 
			anaphoric and cataphoric referencing and discourse deixis proper.</p>
			<p>Referencing within a text is covered in the guide to cohesion 
			linked in the list of related guides at the end.&nbsp; 
			It refers to the use of markers to stand for or link to an item 
			previously mentioned or yet to appear in the text.&nbsp; For 
			example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he got to <span class="style_red"><strong>it</strong></span>, 
			he found the house was much as he had expected; </em>
			<span class="style_red"><strong><em>the place</em></strong></span><em> 
			was old and shabby.<br />
			</em>we have two cohesive devices.</p>
			<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>The pronoun,<em> <span class="style_red"><strong>it</strong></span></em>,<em>
				</em>which stands for <em>the house</em> and refers forward in the text.&nbsp; 
			That's cataphoric referencing.</li>
				<li>A general term, <span class="style_red"><em><strong>the place</strong></em></span>, which refers back and stands for 
				<em>the house</em>.&nbsp; 
			That's anaphoric referencing.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Both references are to something 
			in the text so they are both endophoric references.</p>
			<p>Discourse deixis is different because it does not relate 
			to a specific item but to a stretch of discourse.&nbsp; Such a 
			stretch of discourse can be very long or quite short.&nbsp; For 
			example, the novel <em>The Husband’s Secret</em> by Liane Moriarty begins 
			with the line:<br />
			<em><span class="style_red"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It </strong></span>was all 
			because of the Berlin Wall.<br />
			</em>In this, the marker <em>It</em> refers to everything which 
			follows, the rest of the novel, not to a particular item.&nbsp; That is discourse deixis.<br />
			It needn't be a literary device, of course, although it often is.&nbsp; 
			Simply responding to an anecdote with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<em><span class="style_red"><strong>That</strong></span>'s fascinating</em><br />
			is an instance where 
			one person's entire discourse is referred to with the term <em>That</em>.<br />
			Equally, we can include in our own discourse something like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>...and <span class="style_red"><strong>that</strong></span>'s&nbsp;why ...</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_red"><strong>This</strong></span> is a 
			good one ...</em><br />
			 or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Listen to <span class="style_red"><strong>this</strong></span></em> ...<br />
			and those are examples of discourse deixis; 
			the first anaphoric and the second and third cataphoric.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="demonstrative" height="133" src="../../images/finger_demonstrative200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style7">
					<h3><em>this, these, that, those</em></h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The marker <em>this / these</em> can refer anaphorically 
			to a previous stretch of discourse and cataphorically to something 
			to follow but the marker <em>that / those</em> can <strong>only</strong> 
			refer anaphorically.</p>
			<p>At the end of a presentation or proposal, for example, it is 
			perfectly acceptable to respond with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is an interesting idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an interesting idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are interesting ideas</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are interesting ideas</em><br />
			and all the references are anaphoric, referring to the ideas 
			presented beforehand.</p>
			<p>However, we cannot refer cataphorically to what is to follow with <em>that</em> or
			<em>those</em> so something like<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I won't be able to come and those are my reasons: firstly, ...<br />
			</em>is unacceptable but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't be able to come and this is the reason ...</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't be able to come and these are the reasons</em> 
			...<br />
			are both acceptable.</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="auto-style73">In brief:</span><br />
			<em>this / these</em><span class="auto-style73">: anaphoric <strong>and</strong> cataphoric</span><br />
			<em>that / those</em><span class="auto-style73">: anaphoric only.</span></p>
			<p>See above under empathetic deixis for how the demonstratives are 
			used to give a sense of nearness (empathy) and distance (lack of 
			empathy).</p>

			<p>Deixis plays a central role in getting reported or indirect 
			speech right, of course, because by its nature indirect speech is 
			often a relation of speech which occurred in another place, at 
			another time and directed to another person.&nbsp; In other words, 
			the forms are subject to spatial, temporal and personal deixis and 
			change according to where the centre is at the time of reporting.<br />
			Another way of putting this is to refer to the encoding time (when 
			the statement was made) and the decoding time (when the statement 
			was reported).&nbsp; If the encoding and decoding times are the 
			same, few if any changes need to be made to time markers and tense 
			forms so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: I'm coming now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: What did she say?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C: She said she's coming now</em><br />
			However, if the encoding and decoding times are sufficiently 
			separated, we do make changes accordingly so the exchange might end 
			as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she was coming then.</em></p>
			<p>All four forms of deixis are relevant to getting the forms right.&nbsp; 
			There is a guide to indirect speech on the site, linked below, so 
			examples will do here.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Temporal deixis</strong><br />
				Reporting<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am catching the train tomorrow</em><br />
				as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said I was catching the train the next 
				day</em><br />
				in which the tense form changes along with the adverbial to show 
				that the reporting time centre differs from the time centre when 
				the utterance was made.</li>
				<li><strong>Spatial deixis</strong><br />
				Reporting<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please put it here</em><br />
				as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The order was to put it outside the 
				garage</em><br />
				in which the fact that the reporting is happening in another 
				place is reflected in the amount of detail which needs to be 
				added to make the sense clear.</li>
				<li><strong>Personal deixis</strong><br />
				Reporting<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you please be quiet</em><br />
				as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was told to be quiet</em><br />
				because the addressee is now the speaker and the pronouns need 
				to be altered accordingly with the shift in deictic centre.</li>
				<li><strong>Discourse deixis</strong><br />
				Reporting a long turn as something like<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She explained in great detail why she was 
				late</em><br />
				is often the preferred form to save time and avoid irrelevant 
				details which, because of the change to the spatial and temporal 
				centre, are no longer required.</li>
