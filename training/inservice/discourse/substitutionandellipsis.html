		<p>There are many occasions in both speaking and writing when repeating 
		ourselves is considered poor form, poor style or quite odd.&nbsp; For 
		example, an utterance such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expected the weather to be bad and stop us playing and the weather 
		was bad and the weather stopped us playing<br />
		</em>would sound strange whenever it was said or written.<br />
		It can be amended to the better-sounding:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expected the weather to be bad and stop us playing and it was and 
		did</em></p>

			<p>OK.&nbsp; Let's see what's happening.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The sentence:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought a shirt online but when the shirt arrived I didn't 
			like the shirt</em><br />
			changed to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought a shirt online but when <span class="style_black">it</span> 
			arrived I didn't like <span class="style_black">it</span></em><br />
			The noun <em>shirt</em> (with its article) has been replaced 
			twice by <em>it.&nbsp; </em>Pronoun substitution is just about the 
			most common form of substitution.&nbsp; The third-person pronouns 
			are used to refer to things in the text, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't really need reading glasses but
			<span class="style_black">they</span> help</em><br />
			and first- and second-person pronouns are used to refer to people and things outside the text, 
			e.g.:<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I liked the shirt but <span class="style_black">you</span> didn't like 
			<span class="style_black">it</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Maggie, Jim and I set out on time but <span class="style_black">we</span> 
			were delayed</em></li>
			<li>The exchange:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have any dark green floor tiles?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			No we don't have any dark green floor tiles but we have some dark 
			blue floor tiles</em><br />
			changed to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have any dark green floor tiles?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			No, we don't, but we have some dark blue <span class="style_black">ones</span></em><br />
			In this example, two things are happening:<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li>The noun phrase (<em>dark green floor tiles</em>) has been 
				replaced with <em>ones, </em>another common device.&nbsp; This 
				is a pronoun of sorts (the term pro-form would be better) and it 
				can exist in both singular and plural guises (<em>one/ones</em>).</li>
				<li>The whole clause <em>have any dark green floor tiles</em> 
				has been simply elided (left out), leaving only the auxiliary 
				verb and the negative particle.&nbsp; The verb <em>have</em> is 
				clearly understood by both speakers.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>The exchange:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the post come?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			No, the post hasn't come</em><br />
			changed to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the post come?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			No <span class="style_black">it</span> hasn't</em><br />
			Again, two things are happening:<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li>The noun phrase (<em>the post</em>) has been replaced with
				<em>it, </em>as in 1.</li>
				<li>The lexical verb <em>come </em>has been elided, leaving only 
				the auxiliary verb and the negative particle (<em>No, it hasn't</em>).&nbsp; 
				Clearly, the verb <em>come</em> is understood.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>The sentence:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She loves gardening and Tom loves gardening</em><br />
			changed to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She loves gardening and <span class="style_black">so</span>
			<span class="style_black">does</span> Tom</em><br />
			Here we have an example of <em>so </em>+ the auxiliary standing 
			for the lexical verb.&nbsp; In these cases the auxiliary is called 
			the operator.&nbsp; It is a common device within and across 
			sentences so we can also have, e.g., <br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love gardening<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			So <span class="style_black">do</span> I!<br />
			</em>You may have changed this differently, having, perhaps:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She and Tom love gardening</em><br />
			which elides the verb and its object from the first half.<br />
			or even<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She loves gardening and Tom, too<br />
			</em>eliding the whole verb phrase and its object<br />
			In this case the adverb <em>too</em> must be inserted or we 
			understand that she loves Tom (and the ambiguity is still present).</li>
			<li>The sentence:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor advised me to take more exercise and I will take 
			more exercise</em><br />
			changed to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor advised me to take more exercise and I will
			<span class="style_black">do</span> (<span class="style_black">so</span>)</em><br />
			Here again the operator auxiliary stands for the whole clause <em>will 
			take more exercise</em>.&nbsp; It can be followed by <em>do</em> or 
			its variant <em>do so.<br />
			</em>In this case, we can also reduce it to<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The doctor advised me to take more exercise and I will<br />
			</em>where the auxiliary is left to stand for the whole verb phrase.</li>
			<li>The sentence:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't think he would arrive but he arrived</em><br />
			changed to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't think he would arrive but he <span class="style_black">
			did</span></em><br />
			Here the word <em>did</em> (the operator) stands for the verb 
			<em>arrived</em>.&nbsp; It's a straight substitution that is used with 
			lexical verbs in simple past and simple present tenses.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She promised to come early and did<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He thought it would rain but it didn't</em><br />
			In 
			tenses in the progressive and perfect aspect we can remove the main 
			lexical verb and leave the auxiliary to substitute, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has promised to pay me and he has</em><br />
			but if we do that 
			with simple tenses, there's nothing left.&nbsp; We can't have<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I 
			didn't think he would arrive but he<br />
			</em>so English inserts the 
			operator (<em>did</em>) to stand as the verb or verb phrase.&nbsp; It can stand for 
			very long verb phrases as in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was surprised that the government <span class="style_brown">
			decided to pass a law making it illegal to study grammar in school 
			or even the privacy of your own home</span> but it
			<span class="style_brown">did</span>.</em></li>
			<li>The sentence:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has cleaned and she has polished the car</em><br />
			changed to<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			S<em>he has cleaned and polished the car</em><br />
			Both the subject, <em>she</em>, and the auxiliary verb, <em>has</em>, have been elided because 
			they are common to both verbs.&nbsp; The object of both verbs is <em>
			the car.<br />
			</em>At other times, various parts 
			of the sentence can be elided, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have painted the house and the garage<br />
			</em>eliding the subject, the auxiliary verb and the main verb<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have washed the car and painted the door<br />
			</em>eliding only the subject and the auxiliary verb because the 
			object of each verb is different<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has cleaned and repaired the door<br />
			</em>eliding the object common to both verbs and the auxiliary.</li>
			<li>The exchange:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is she?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She is in the garden</em><br />
			changed to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is she?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			In the garden</em><br />
			Again, shared information has allowed the elision of the verb and 
			its subject, leaving only the prepositional phrase.</li>

			</table>
			<p>Ellipsis (or elision) has been described as substitution by zero.<br />
		Technically, ellipsis only occurs when the item that is omitted is 
		'uniquely recoverable'.&nbsp; That is to say, there is no doubt about 
		what has been omitted.&nbsp; In, say,<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She often drinks sherry and probably will this evening</em><br />
		only <em>drink sherry</em> is the possible ellipsis.<br />
			In something 
		like<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I liked the car so I bought three</em><br />
		there are a number of possibilities (<em>of them, cars, more</em> etc.) 
		so this is not a case of ellipsis in the technical sense.&nbsp; For 
			teaching 
		purposes, that doesn't really matter.</p>
		<hr />
		<p>Here's a graphical way of representing what we do with these devices.&nbsp; 
		The examples of ellipsis are outlined in red and the rest are 
		substitutions of one kind or another.</p>

					<h2>Clausal elision in spoken English</h2>

		<p>A dialogue such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you bring that book upstairs?<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		I brought this book upstairs to read in bed</em><br />
		is at least unusual and very clumsy.<br />
		It would be better as<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you bring that book upstairs?<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		To read in bed<br />
		</em>which elides the whole clause <em>I brought this book upstairs</em></p>
		<p>This is such a common phenomenon (and not only in English) that we can 
		often forget the fact that learners can have some difficulty 
		understanding the sense.&nbsp; It is not always the case that this kind 
		of elision occurs in response to questions.&nbsp; It can happen with all 
		initiation types, for example:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Initiations which inform</strong></dt>
			<dd><em>I have bought a new sweater<br />
			Where?</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Initiations which ask if</strong></dt>
			<dd><em>Can you help me with this?<br />
			Yes, of course.</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Initiations which ask whether</strong></dt>
			<dd><em>Do you think it'll rain?<br />
			No chance.</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Initiation which direct</strong></dt>
			<dd><em>Get me some chocolate when you are at the station, will you?<br />
			Sure.</em></dd>
		</dl>
		<p>For teaching purposes, we can call these <strong>response 
		elisions</strong> because they almost always occur in the response to some kind of 
		initiation.&nbsp; Here are a few examples of clausal elision in 
		responses:</p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li>Conditional sentences<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>What will you do if he is late?<br />
				Carry on without him</em><br />
				(eliding the <em>if</em> clause)</li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>I'm taking the train<br />
				If they are running</em><br />
				(eliding the main clause)</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Causal subordinate clauses</li>
			<li class="auto-style14"><em>Why are you taking your laptop?<br />

			<li>Additive clauses</li>
			<li class="auto-style14"><em>He's winning at the moment<br />
			And looks like he'll take the points</em><br />

			Even though she couldn't afford it</em><br />

			17</em><br />

			<li>Elicitations</li>
			<li class="auto-style14"><em>Is the weather very cold at this time
