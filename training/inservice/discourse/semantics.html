			<h1>Semantics</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="semantics" height="207" src="../../images/meaning_man310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Semantics is the study of meaning in language.&nbsp; It is a 
			sub-discipline of the science of semiotics which, roughly speaking, 
			is the study of meaning in general.&nbsp; There is, of course, a 
			distinction between meaning and meaning expressed <em>via</em> 
			language.<br />
			For example, which of the following represents meaning expressed 
			through language?&nbsp; Click on the table when you have an answer.</p>
			<p>
			<img id="img1" alt="semantic" height="351" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'../../imagesgraphics/semantics1.png')" src="../../imagesgraphics/semantics2.png" width="600" /></p>
			<p>Whatever our personal views about whether dogs and cats 
			understand (or use) language or whether true language is a 
			phenomenon confined to humans, in what follows, we will be 
			discussing spoken or written language not the many other ways in 
			which meaning can be expressed.&nbsp; We will not, for example, be 
			dealing with body language but what follows does apply to the 
			various sign languages used by people around the world.<br />
			There is a guide to language evolution, linked below, which contains 
			some consideration of whether language is confined to humans or may 
			be said to be used by other animals.</p>

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Words, lexemes and lemmas (or lemmata)</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The guide to morphology, linked at the end, takes 
			trouble to distinguish between a word and a lexeme and explains why 
			many tests for identifying what a word actually is fail.&nbsp; You 
			should go to that guide for more detail.</p>
			<p>Here we will simply note that the term <em>word</em> applies in 
			this guide to any meaningful item in English which can be made by 
			applying the normal rules of morphology.&nbsp; By this definition, 
			the following are lexemes even when they contain more than one word:<br />
			<em>The European Union, Mars, washing machine, happiness, 
			undoability, redefinability, colourlessness</em>,<em> go on, look 
			forward (to)</em><br />
			Not all of these will be found in a standard dictionary, of course, 
			but that doesn't stop them from carrying a single significance and 
			functioning as words in English.</p>
			<p>Strictly speaking, a lexeme is often defined as a set of related 
			forms of the same word so, e.g., <em>speak, speaking, spoken, 
			spoke</em> are all various forms of the single lexeme <em>speak.</em></p>
			<p>A lemma is what dictionaries use as headwords from which other 
			forms are derived.&nbsp; You would not, for example, expect all the 
			forms of the lexeme <em>speak</em> to have a separate entry in a 
			dictionary.&nbsp; You would simply go to the lemma and from there 
			discover, perhaps, that the past tense of the verb is irregular.</p>

					<h2>What does <em>mean</em> mean?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are three fundamental forms of meaning.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Sense</strong><br />
				This refers to a word's general significance.<br />
				For example, we can probably agree on the sense of the word <em>
				coin</em>.&nbsp; The word, as a noun, means a small metal unit 
				of currency.&nbsp; This is the word's sense or its <strong>denotation</strong>.<br />
				One word can have a range of senses in which it is 
				used.&nbsp; For example, <em>coin </em>can be a verb (with a 
				number of meanings) and the word <em>bank</em> can refer to a 
				business that deals with money, the side of a river, a verb 
				meaning <em>rely</em> and a verb meaning <em>deposit money</em>.&nbsp; All 
				of these are senses (or denotations) of the word.&nbsp; For 
				more, see the guide to polysemy, linked in the list of related 
				guides at the end.</li>
				<li><strong>Reference</strong><br />
				This refers to the actual thing I mean (or the action etc. but 
				for simplicity's sake, we'll focus on nouns).&nbsp; In other 
				words, it is this instance of the word's use.<br />
				For example, if I say, <em>The coin on the book</em>, I know (and so do 
				you) that I am referring not to coins in a general sense but to 
				a particular one I have in mind.&nbsp; However, just by looking 
				at the words, we have no idea what exactly I am referring to and 
				in a different setting the referent (thing referred to) may be 
				different.</li>
				<li><strong>Connotation</strong><br />
				This refers to a second level of meaning above denotation and is 
				often personally or culturally determined.&nbsp; For example, 
				the words <em>quack</em> and <em>doctor</em> carry the same sense (<em>medical 
				practitioner</em>) but mean very different things.&nbsp; The same can 
				be said of a whole range of near synonyms such as <em>
				youth-teen, child-brat, newspaper-rag, speech-sermon, 
				dirt-filth, police officer-copper-cop</em> and so on.<br />
				The distinction between denotational and connotational meaning 
				goes under a variety of guises in the literature including 
				extension meaning <em>vs</em>. intention meaning, definitional 
				information <em>vs</em>. contextual information and core meaning 
				<em>vs</em>. 
				encyclopaedic knowledge.<br />
				The last of these is the route taken below.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Fuzziness<br />
			<img alt="blur" height="133" src="../../images/blurred_lights200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>Before we leave a discussion of what words mean we need to deal 
			with the borderlines of meaning.&nbsp; For example, we may know what 
			we understand as the distinction between related verbs such as <em>
			climb</em> and <em>scramble</em> but identifying exactly at which 
			point a <em>scramble</em> becomes a <em>climb</em> and <em>vice 
			versa</em> is quite difficult and will probably vary between 
			speakers of the language.We may equally be comfortable distinguishing, for example between 
			these related terms:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>claw</em> vs. <em>talon</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>tooth</em> vs. <em>fang</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>tree</em> vs. <em>bush</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>hill</em> vs. <em>mountain</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>fire</em> vs. <em>blaze</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>red</em> vs. <em>pink</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>ill</em> vs. <em>poorly</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>walk</em> vs. <em>run</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>expect</em> vs. <em>anticipate</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			However, precisely where we draw the line is clearly debatable.<br />
			Partly, we are discussing here something called troponymy.&nbsp; 
			Because, for example, <em>walk</em> and <em>run</em> (as well as <em>
			amble, stroll, wander, gallop, trot a</em>nd so on) are ways of 
			moving on legs.&nbsp; In other words, they have a relationship of a 
			special kind of hyponymy.<br />
			The guide to lexical relationships, linked at the end, has a little 
			more on hyponymy and troponymy.</p>
			<p>Often, we decide where the borders between meanings are on the basis of:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>contrasting the meanings with other related word so, for 
				example, we may distinguish between <em>red</em> and <em>pink</em> 
				by deciding whether it is a colour more closely approximating to
				<em>rose</em> or <em>crimson</em>.</li>
				<li>the context in which it occurs, preferring <em>fang</em> for 
				the tooth of a large carnivore and <em>tooth</em> for that of a 
				smaller animal or person.</li>
				<li>comparison with a prototype so we decide where the line is 
				drawn between a <em>mountain</em> and a <em>hill</em> by simply 
				comparing the size, characteristics and shape of what we see to 
				a well-known prototype of a mountain such as Mont Blanc.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Meaning is, therefore, partly dependent on sense relations or 
			categories of related meaning.&nbsp; This is the meat and drink of 
			semantics.</p>
			<p>Some words, of course, do not exhibit any obvious fuzziness and 
			they are mostly those which are carefully defined in certain fields 
			or are associated with particular objects.&nbsp; Examples of such 
			words are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aspirin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carbohydrate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; planet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; triangle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; logarithm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DVD<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keyboard</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			However, among experts even more than among lay people some terms 
			may be the object of heated debates and the precise point at which a 
			place such as Pluto is downgraded to that of dwarf planet, for 
			example, was only settled in 2006 and many non-astronomers will 
			still refer to it as the ninth planet of the solar system.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Allied to the distinction between denotation and connotation is 
			the concept, variously described and classified, of some sort of 
			core or basic meaning of a word and its meaning for whomever reads 
			or hears it.<br />
			Here we need to distinguish, as Aristotle did some time ago, between 
			a word's essential meaning and its reference meaning.&nbsp; 
			Aristotle referred to <strong>essence</strong>: the 
			essential qualities of a thing without which it loses its identity.</p>
			<p>For example, if I hear:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look.&nbsp; There's a dog in the garden</em><br />
			I will not randomly peer through the window trying to understand 
			what is meant but will immediately be alert to spot a four-legged, 
			furry object which matches my mental picture of <em>dogness</em>.&nbsp; 
			I have probably never seen the dog in question but I will 
			immediately recognise it because I have a set of mental constructs 
			which applies only to dogs.&nbsp; I will, therefore, not waste my 
			time looking at trees, ponds, unicorns or elephants because that is not what I 
			am primed to see.</p>
			<p>What I am looking for is something which contains the <strong>
			semantic components</strong> of the word dog.&nbsp; I.e., it is 
			animate, furry, four legged and of a certain size (a somewhat 
			variable component).</p>
			<p>How we do this is slightly mysterious but to try an explanation, 
			here's an example.&nbsp; Given a resource like this,<br />
			<img alt="cup" height="133" src="../../images/cup_glass200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			if someone says:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please give me that cup</em><br />
			it will not be difficult for most people to recognise the object 
			which is being spoken about from a range of possible containers and 
			other objects in sight even if the cup in question has never been 
			seen before.&nbsp; To do that, people need a mental prototype of a 
			cup which distinguishes it from other sorts of objects.&nbsp; And to 
			do that, we assign characteristics (either positively or negatively) 
			which we use to distinguish cups from other objects.&nbsp; For example, 
			we may select the following as part of the essence or core meaning of the term <em>
			cup</em>:</p>

			<p>When it comes to more closely related concepts, speakers of a 
			language will often disagree about what to call something.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like a cup or a mug of coffee?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she stroll or amble here?<br />
			</em>In the first of these examples, we have two hyponyms which bear 
			some relationship to a hypernym such as
			<em>food container.<br />
			</em>In the second of those two examples, we encounter a 
			relationship between words called troponymy.&nbsp; That is to say, 
			both the words <em>amble</em> and <em>stroll</em> are ways of 
			further defining the concept of <em>walk</em>.&nbsp; However, 
			exactly how the nature of <em>strolling</em> differs from that of
			<em>ambling, wandering, sauntering, rambling, mooching</em> and so 
			on is quite obscure and native speakers of a language are unlikely 
			to agree completely about where to draw the lines.<br />
			For a little more on these two concepts, see the guide to lexical 
			relationships, linked in the list at the end.</p>
			<p>What we are discussing here is a word's <strong>semantic space
			</strong>which concerns the 
			prototypical features of a word which determine the limits of its use.&nbsp; 
			Children, learning their first language, often make errors in this 
			regard, calling, for example, all four-legged creatures <em>horses</em> 
			or all adults apart from mother and father, <em>uncle</em> and so 
			on.&nbsp; Quite rapidly, children learn to identify the prototypical 
			features of lexemes and limit their use to within conventional, 
			culturally determined boundaries.&nbsp; This goes on through life 
			and most native speakers are frequently faced with uses of words 
			outside the fields in which they have previously been encountered.<br />
			Unfortunately, semantic space varies across languages and adults 
			already have a set of prototypical features which they employ 
			frequently to distinguish, for example between a <em>cup</em> and a
			<em>glass</em> (using the ideas we discussed above such as with or without a handle, 
			transparent or opaque, porcelain or not etc.).<br />
			For example, in German, the word <em>vegetable</em> does not include 
			the term <em>potato</em> and in Swedish, the word <em>wood</em> for 
			the material and for a small group of trees is not the same although 
			it is, for example, in French.<br />
			Applying the conventional prototypical features that one has 
			acquired with one's first language to a second is, therefore, often 
			perilous.<br />
			Moreover, determining the boundaries of closely connected words such 
			as <em>railing</em> and <em>fence</em>, <em>shade</em> and <em>
			shadow</em>, <em>job</em> and <em>career</em>, <em>position</em> and
			<em>post</em> and so on is difficult and requires repeated exposure 
			to the lexemes in context.&nbsp; Even native speakers may disagree 
			about the determining features which distinguish a <em>tree</em> 
			from a <em>shrub</em> or a <em>leaflet</em> from a <em>tract</em>, 
			for example, and the distinguishing features of such terms are very 
			unlikely to be parallelled in the learners' first language(s).&nbsp; 
			This is not a phenomenon confined to nouns and the distinctions 
			between <em>stroll, saunter</em> and <em>wander</em> and <em>chilly, 
			cool </em>and <em>fresh</em> are not immediately apparent from 
			context.<br />
			The core meanings of <em>railing</em> and <em>fence</em> are 
			virtually identical (involving concepts of a barrier delineating 
			spaces) so only secondary features (such as the materials from which 
			it is made, the purposes to which it is put and its design), which 
			may not always be present, can be used to disambiguate.&nbsp; 
			Hunting the internet for images of either will often throw up the 
			same images in different categories.</p>
			<p>To further complicate matters, individuals will vary in the 
			characteristics they see as essential and those which are optional.&nbsp; 
			Between cultures, variations will be even more obvious with German 
			speakers, for example, often excluding <em>potato</em> from the 
			general category of <em>vegetable</em>.<br />
			It is also the case that in German, any container for hot drinks 
			which does not have a saucer may be described as a <em>mug [Becher]
			</em>but that definition will not function too well in English for a 
			small cup with a handle.<br />
			Semantic space can differ very dramatically across languages.</p>
			<p>The selection will be made on the basis of choosing the object 
			which ticks most of the boxes and excluding those with forbidden 
			characteristics.<br />
			What we do, in the jargon, is to carry out a semantic or 
			componential analysis of, 
			in our example, 
			the terms <em>cup</em> and <em>glass</em>.&nbsp; When we do that, if 
			we are faced with two similar objects (or actions, adjectives or 
			whatever), we may use the optional 
			characteristics above to make our choice.&nbsp; So, for example, we 
			may exclude a container made of glass which has no handle in favour 
			of a glass one with a handle when we are searching for the cup in 
			question.</p>
			<p>Alert readers will, however, have noticed a snag with an analysis 
			like this: the distinctions are fuzzy at the edges.&nbsp; Some cups 
			are made of glass, some glasses are made of plastic and so on.&nbsp; 
			Aitchison, 1987, suggests that in addition to the prototypical 
			features of the object, people also apply those characteristics with 
			which they are most familiar so that, for example, speakers from 
			certain cultural backgrounds may insist that all cups have handles 
			and come with saucers but 
			for others that distinction may not apply.</p>

				<h3>Encyclopaedic knowledge</h3>
				</td>

			</table>
			<p>In addition to all this, there is a distinction between the core 
			meaning (what we have discussed up to now) and what is sometimes 
			called encyclopaedic knowledge or extension meaning which refers to 
			what we know about the word from our general knowledge of the world.<br />
			Schmitt, 2000: 27, provides the example of the term <em>bachelor</em>, 
			the semantic analysis of which would be +human, +male, +adult and 
			-married or, in other words, an adult, unmarried, male human.&nbsp; 
			The issue here is that while the semantic definition holds true, 
			there's a lot we know about bachelors which is not included.&nbsp; 
			As Schmitt points out, this knowledge includes the fact that 
			bachelors <span class="style_black"><em>are often young, date women 
			and have exciting lifestyles</em></span> and none of that 
			information can be captured by a purely semantic analysis because it 
			forms part of the schema that native speakers have, in certain 
			cultures, concerning the state of bachelorhood.&nbsp; As Schmitt 
			points out, the core definition of <em>bachelor</em> would include
			<span class="style_black"><em>a divorced, middle-aged man with 
			several children</em></span> or <span class="style_black"><em>a male 
			who is unmarried, but living with his partner</em></span> but our 
			encyclopaedic knowledge might act to exclude such people from the 
			definition.<br />
			The issue is twofold:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Core semantic features of a word will be limited and can be 
				taught by exemplification and helping learners to notice where 
				the word starts and stops and how the concept is distinguished 
				from similar concepts (as in the difference between <em>cup</em> 
				and <em>glass</em> discussed above).</li>
				<li>Encyclopaedic knowledge is open ended and varies between 
				cultures and individuals within cultures.&nbsp; The schema which 
				for each person is activated by encountering a word such as <em>
				farmer</em>, for example, will be variable and some individuals 
				(and some cultures) may exclude, for example, someone who has a 
				smallholding on which she works part time or a large landowner 
				who lives in the city and rarely visits a farm.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Encyclopaedic knowledge, incidentally, is part of the ability to 
			recognise impossible collocation.&nbsp; For example, if we encounter 
			words such as <em>lacy, silky, smooth, velvety</em> etc., our 
			knowledge of the world tells us that they cannot be applied to any 
			noun in the whole English lexicon (of which there are over 85,000).&nbsp; 
			One cannot have, for example,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a velvety rhinoceros</em><br />
			simply because the animal doesn't come that way.<br />
			Equally, of course, we know that verbs such as <em>assert</em> or
			<em>enjoy</em> cannot have inanimate subjects because tables and 
			houses etc. do not do these things.&nbsp; Poetically, we may allow 
			many kinds of odd combinations for effect, of course.<br />
			For more in this area of what is called suppositional or 
			pre-suppositional meaning.&nbsp; See the guide to collocation, 
			linked below.</p>

				<h3>Kinship terms and the packaging of information</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Core meaning and encyclopaedic knowledge is well exemplified when 
			considering kinship terms.<br />
			For example, in English the terms are relatively simple.&nbsp; We 
			can, for example, say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is my grandfather<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is my niece<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is her aunt</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			From our encyclopaedic knowledge, we know that <em>grandfather</em> 
			is a male parent of someone's parents and we can define other 
			kinship terms in the same way: female offspring of a brother or 
			sister, sister of a parent etc.<br />
			However, when we ask what information is encoded in the terms, the 
			situation is somewhat rough and ready.&nbsp; When someone says, for 
			example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; That is my nephew</em><br />
			we know only that the person in question is one generation removed 
			(down the family tree) and is male.&nbsp; We do not know:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>whether the person is related to the speaker by blood or 
				marriage</li>
				<li>whether the person is older or younger than the speaker</li>
				<li>whether the person is the son of a sister or a brother</li>
				<li>whether the person is the son of an older or younger sibling</li>
				<li>whether the person is a boy or a grown man</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Equally, someone may say:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; That is my uncle</em><br />
			and again, the details of the person and the precise family 
			relationships that exists remain unclear.&nbsp; In many 
			English-speaking societies, the man in question may not even be 
			related in any way to the speaker but the term <em>uncle </em>simply 
			denotes an older male friend of the speaker's parents.&nbsp; Even 
			less informative in this respect is:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; That is my cousin</em><br />
			in which we do not even have access to the information about the 
			person's sex.</p>
			<p>This is because languages encode the meanings that are socially 
			important and English-speaking culture, presumably, has seen no need 
			historically for the relationship details to be made clear.<br />
			Other languages will encode different data and make any or all of 
			the relationships (blood vs. marriage, older or younger, male or 
			female, connection to other family members and so on) clear in the 
			term that is chosen.&nbsp; Some, such as Sudanese, will be much more 
			informative and have words for <em>cousin</em> which distinguish 
			between<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; father's brother's children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; father's sister's children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother's sister's children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother's brother's children</em><br />
			Tamil, an ancient South Indian language, too, has specific kinship 
			terms rendered by only two lexemes in English:<br />
			<em>aunt</em>: <em>chitthi </em>(mother's younger sister)<em>, 
			periyamma </em>(mother's elder sister)<em>, mami </em>(uncle’s wife)<em><br class="whiteback" />
			uncle</em>: <em>chithappa </em>(father's younger brother)<em>, 
			periyappa </em>(father's elder brother).<em><br />
			</em>Other languages may be even <strong>less</strong> informative than English.&nbsp; Some 
			Hawaiian languages, for example, do not distinguish between sibling 
			and cousin at all.</p>
			<p>Kinship terms are just one of the areas in which languages choose 
			to encode what is culturally important to them.&nbsp; Some languages 
			will have single words to describe events and objects which need a 
			whole sentence in other languages to explain.&nbsp; For example, 
			some languages, will have separate verbs for <em>go</em> which 
			distinguish whether the verb means<em> go uphill, downhill, on foot</em> 
			or <em>on horseback</em> and others will have separate nouns to 
			describe the same animals at different stages of their development 
			and usefulness.</p>

					<h2>Schemata</h2>

			</table>
			<p>Schemata (singular <em>schema</em>) are sometimes called frames 
			or scripts.<br />
			The significance is that they activate our encyclopaedic knowledge 
			through context and that has very obvious implications for the 
			classroom and the teaching of lexical meaning.</p>
			<p>For example, if one considers a simple sentence such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glasses were broken</em><br />
			it is likely that, without any other context, most people will have 
			their schema concerning glass drinking vessels activated.&nbsp; 
			However, given the context of being able to read a label and the 
			sentence<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My glasses were broken</em><br />
			it is likely that the schema which will now be activated concerns
			<em>spectacles</em>.<br />
			Given, as another example, the sentence:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The party was united</em><br />
			vs.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party was noisy</em><br />
			it is likely that wholly different schemata will be activated simply 
			by the difference in the adjective used to describe <em>party</em>.</p>
			<p>Because encyclopaedic knowledge, on which schemata work, is 
			variable from individual to individual and the core meanings of 
			words are not easily translated across languages or between 
			cultures, it becomes very important for teachers to provide adequate 
			data to allow learners to notice (or be told) what is and is not 
			included in a concept represented by a lexeme.<br />
			At the outset, it may be enough to define, for example, the verb <em>
			harvest</em> by reference to well-known examples such as gathering
			<em>wheat, rice, vegetables</em> etc. but that may not be enough to 
			distinguish the word from the idea of <em>pick</em> (as in flowers, 
			blackberries or other wild fruits) and it almost certainly won't be 
			enough to allow learners to understand that <em>harvesting data</em> 
			is possible but <em>picking data</em> has a wholly different 
			meaning.<br />
			Word meaning is learned incrementally with the learners' 
			understanding of limitations and inclusions in the meaning of a 
			lexeme being refined as more data become available.<br />
			It is, therefore, as important to help learners understand what is 
			excluded from a word means as it is to convey what is included.<br />
			For example, the comparatively simple idea conveyed by the word <em>
			steps </em>(which might be explained as a series of flat surfaces on 
			which to climb up or down) needs to be refined by excluding carpeted 
			wooden examples inside houses but which will include metal external 
			fire escapes while probably excluding internal stone fire escapes.</p>
			<p>The concept of register (i.e., the field, in Halliday's 1978 
			analysis) in which a word occurs is critical in this area.<br />
			If, for example, we know that we are listening to or participating 
			in a conversation about a parliamentary debate, we will almost 
			certainly understand the word <em>minister</em> differently from how 
			we would understand it if the conversation concerns church 
			employees.</p>
			<p>Little by little, we are now moving from word and sentence 
			meaning to utterance meaning and here we trespass on the territory 
			of pragmatics.&nbsp; So be it.<br />
			However, before we move on, here's a summary of the story so far:</p>
			<p>

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2><a name="composition"></a>Compositionality</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>You will readily see that knowing the senses of the individual 
			lexemes in a clause or phrase usually allows you access to the overall 
			meaning.&nbsp; For example, knowing the meaning and/or function of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; completely, problem, the, is, clear, me, to<br />
			</em>You can arrive at the meaning of the sentence:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is completely clear to me<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To me, the problem is completely clear</em><br />
			and even<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Completely clear to me is the problem<br />
			</em>That is what is meant by compositionality.</p>
			<p>However, there are many instances of language when knowing the 
			sense of the constituent parts of a string of words will not allow 
			you access to the overall meaning.&nbsp; You may, for example, know 
			the meanings of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; family, he, black, of, sheep, the, is</em><br />
			but that will not allow you to understand<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is the black sheep of the family</em><br />
			This is what is meant by non-compositionality.&nbsp; Idioms and 
			phrasal verbs are familiar examples of non-compositionality but it 
			is not an either-or distinction.&nbsp; Some idiomatic expressions 
			can be understood with access to the concept of metaphor and such 
			items vary in the level of transparency.&nbsp; So, for example<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put the meeting off until Wednesday</em><br />
			is reasonably transparent with an understanding that the particle
			<em>off</em> frequently carries the meaning of <em>away from</em> 
			as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took the plate off the table<br />
			</em>and 
			application of the meaning of the prepositional phrase helps, too, 
			of course.&nbsp; However,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put up with her</em><br />
			is almost completely obscure unless you are aware of the meaning of 
			the multi-word verb <em>put up with</em> (=<em>tolerate</em>).<br />
			When it comes to idioms, some are often used quite literally and 
			some can only be understood as metaphors.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She won </em><strong><em>by a hair's breadth</em></strong><br />is an idiom in English which is fixed so you can't change <em>
			hair</em> to <em>strand</em> or <em>breadth</em> to <em>width</em> 
			and retain the same meaning.&nbsp; It is, however, reasonably 
			transparent in suggesting a narrow margin of victory.<br />
			On the other hand, something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made it <strong>by the skin of his teeth</strong><br />
			</em>is less transparent insofar as teeth do not have skin for one 
			thing.&nbsp; Indeed,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That doesn't <strong>cut the mustard</strong><br />
			</em>is almost wholly obscure and must be understood as a single 
			idea (not good enough).<br />
			There are, in other words, various <strong>levels</strong> of non-compositionality.<br />
			For more about this, see 
			the guide 
			to idiomaticity, linked at the end, which also covers the notion of fixedness.</p>

			<p>The distinction here is between <strong>sentence</strong> meaning

			<span class="style_black"><em>Usage means focusing on the meaning 
			attached to something as an instance of language isolated from

			(what it means).<br />
			Use refers to the meaning of something when used for communicative 
			purpose.&nbsp; This is its </em><strong><em>value</em></strong><em> (what 
			it does).<br />
			For example:<br />
			A: Why don't you see a doctor if you are feeling so ill?<br />
			B: Mount Everest is very high and Mercury is the nearest planet to 
			the sun.<br />
			B's statement has significance (we know what is meant) but no value 
			(it communicates nothing useful).<br />
			</em>
			<span class="auto-style25">(Widdowson, 1978)</span></span></p>
			<p>Utterance meaning can be quite obscure and include attempts at 
			satire, irony and so on.&nbsp; Two obvious examples are hyperbole 
			and litotes.<br />
			Hyperbole is deliberate exaggeration for effect in, e.g.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were millions of people at the party<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It weighed a ton</em><br />
			when in neither case do we literally mean <em>millions</em> or <em>a 
			ton</em>.<br />
			Litotes is the polar opposite way to get the same effect in, e.g.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll find the centre of London a bit busy on Monday mornings<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I drove to Greece and back from the UK so I've done a few miles</em><br />
			when in neither case is the downtoner (<em>a bit</em> and <em>a few</em>) 
			meant literally.&nbsp; The centre of London is actually extremely 
			busy at this time and there are more than a few miles between Greece 
			and the UK.</p>

			<p>Another way to distinguish between sentence and utterance meaning

			If for example, someone says:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The food is on the table</em><br />
			there are three possible communicative forces in play:</p>
		
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Locutionary force</strong></dt>

			propositional content </strong>of the utterance.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Illocutionary force</strong></dt>
			<dd>The meaning intended or the meaning perceived &ndash; the 
			utterance meaning.<br />
			In our example, the statement could mean, <em>Please sit down and 
			eat</em> or a number of possible meanings such as <em>It is getting 
			cold</em>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Perlocutionary force</strong></dt>
			<dd>This refers to the fact that an utterance like this may actually 
			produce a reaction in the hearer.&nbsp; If, in this example, the 
			hearers immediately come to the table, sit and begin to eat then the perlocutionary force of 
			the statement has been demonstrated.&nbsp; In some instances, the 
			simple utterance results in the effect.&nbsp; For example, <em>I now 
			pronounce you man and wife</em> may result in the marriage with no 
			intervening linguistic form.</dd>
		</dl>
			<p>The distinction between sentence meaning and utterance meaning is 
			important for language teachers, of course.&nbsp; The distinction is 
			also used to divide semantics proper (i.e., the study of sentence 
			meaning) from pragmatics (i.e., the study of utterance meaning) but 
			the distinction is neither clear cut nor universally accepted.</p>

			<p>Herbert Paul Grice's work is relevant in the area and to the 
			teaching of language using any communicative approach.&nbsp; It 
			bears some analysis here although it is also relevant to other areas 
			in this site.<br />
			If one starts from the premise that utterances have some kind of 
			illocutionary force, i.e., an intended meaning which the hearer 
			understands, we need to know something about the principles at work 
			which allow the meaning to be understood.<br />
			Grice's work is not, of course, without its critics so the following 
			is, at best, the theory, at worst, simply a hypothesis.&nbsp; There 
			are four main maxims which determine how interactions proceed.&nbsp; 
			Overriding all four is the Cooperative Principle.&nbsp; In Grice's 
			words, this is:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>Make your contribution such as it is 
			required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose 
			or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.<br />
			</em>
			<span class="auto-style25">(Grice 1989: 26)</span></p>
			<p>The four maxims we follow to achieve this are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>THE MAXIM OF QUALITY:<ol class="redbullet">
					<li>Don't say what you believe to be false.</li>
					<li>Don't say things for which you have no evidence.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>THE MAXIM OF QUANTITY:<ol class="redbullet">
					<li>Be informative enough.</li>
					<li>Don't over-inform.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>THE MAXIM OF RELATION:<ol class="redbullet">
					<li>Be relevant.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>THE MAXIM OF MANNER:<ol class="redbullet">
					<li>Avoid obscurity.</li>
					<li>Avoid ambiguity.</li>
					<li>Be brief.</li>
					<li>Be orderly.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The issue here is not that we always follow these maxims but that 
			we are subconsciously aware of them.&nbsp; When any are broken, we 
			are immediately alert to the fact that something other than the 
			sentence meaning is intended.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Example 1:</dt>
				<dd>If in answer to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What time's dinner?</em><br />
				the response is<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you promised!</em><br />
				Then, on the face of things, the maxim of relevance has been 
				breached because the response is not obviously relevant to the 
				question.&nbsp; However, if the hearer is alert, she/he may 
				presume that the response means something like<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not cooking because you promised to do it so you tell me 
				when it'll be ready.</em></dd>
				<dt>Example 2:</dt>
				<dd>If the response to:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll get myself a beer</em><br />
				is<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a shop down the road, just by the post-office which 
				sells all kinds of drinks, including beer</em><br />
				Then, on the face of it, the maxim of quantity has been breached 
				because this is just too much information.&nbsp; However, the 
				illocutionary force to which the hearer may be alerted could be<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should go and buy your own beer and not keeping helping 
				yourself to mine.</em></dd>
				<dt>Example 3:</dt>
				<dd>If the response to:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lend me $200</em><br />
				is<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pigs might fly</em><br />
				Then it seems that both the maxim of quality and the maxim of 
				relevance have been broken but the response may simply mean<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is about as likely that I will lend you $200 as pigs 
				flying</em> (i.e., not particularly).</dd>
				<dt>Example 4:</dt>
				<dd>Jokes are rich sources of maxim breaking precisely because 
				they rely so often on unexpected responses to utterances.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rang the bell of a bed-and breakfast place and a lady 
				appeared at a window.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				"What do you want?" she asked.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				"I want to stay here," I replied.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				"Well, stay there then," she said and closed the window.</em><br />
				which breaks the maxim of quality at least and probably the 
				maxim of relevance by deliberately misunderstanding what is 
				meant by <em>here</em>.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>There's a good deal more on Gricean maxims and their classroom 
			implications in the guide to 
			pragmatics on this site.</p>

			<p id="joke" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">The

			provided too little information.<br />
			She is also breaking the maxim of relevance by referring to another

			The whole joke (if it can be called that) is dependent on breaking 
			the cooperative principle.</p>
