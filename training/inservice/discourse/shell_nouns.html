			<h1>Cracking and Using shell nouns</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="shell" height="207" src="../../images/shell_crack310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Shell nouns are widely used in Academic English of all kinds as 
			well as in Business English and many other forms of 
			formal writing and speaking.&nbsp; Accordingly, this guide is linked 
			from both the EAP index and the Business English index.<br />
			They are, however, also a feature of many general texts, written and 
			spoken, and of quite casual conversation.&nbsp; What follows focuses 
			a good deal on more formal texts because it is in those that the use 
			of shell nouns is important.&nbsp; Such texts need not be confined 
			to academic or business contexts and almost any kind of report or 
			fact-based text will contain shell nouns whose understanding is 
			crucial to a comprehension of the writer / speaker's view of things.</p>
			<p>Here are some examples of shell nouns in action,
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>highlighted</em></strong></span>, 
			and then we'll try a definition of what is a rather slippery 
			concept.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>In major cities, the most pervasive form of pollution is 
				caused by heavy traffic, particularly diesel goods vehicles and 
				buses.&nbsp; This </em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>
				problem</em></strong></span><em> is exacerbated in hot weather 
				and when the air is still.</em></li>
				<li><em>The </em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>outcome</em></strong></span><em> 
				of our investigation was the finding that the majority of 
				students in halls of residence were generally satisfied with the 
				level of service they were receiving although intermittent 
				internet access at peak demand times is an </em>
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>issue</em></strong></span><em> 
				for many which causes intense frustration and discontent.</em></li>
				<li><em>The </em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>aim</em></strong></span><em> 
				of this experiment was to see how far and how widely the 
				findings of other researchers in the area are parallelled in this 
				environment.</em></li>
				<li><em>The <span class="style_black"><strong>plan</strong></span> 
				was to take the bus to the station and then get the 4:30 train 
				up to London in time for the wedding.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it 
				didn't work out that way.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style75">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="think" height="60" src="../../../gfx/think60.jpg" width="60" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style76">What is happening here and why are 
					these nouns highlighted in particular?<br />
					<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'egs',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have some ideas</a>.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<div id="egs" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
			<p><a name="1"></a>The nouns here are abstract entities: <em>
			<span class="style_black"><strong>problem, outcome, issue</strong></span>
			</em>and <span class="style_black"><em><strong>aim</strong></em></span>.&nbsp; 
			They all refer to how something is viewed by the writer / speaker 
			and clearly differ from more obviously simple content nouns such as
			<em>apple, book, egg, fountain, generosity, happiness, joke, money</em> 
			and so on.<br />
			What these nouns are doing in the discourse is to encapsulate 
			propositions in a way that determines how they are seen and how they 
			should be understood.&nbsp; In more detail:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In example 1., the word <span class="style_black"><em>
				<strong>problem</strong></em></span> clearly sends the message 
				that the writer / speaker sees the issue as a negative event or 
				state which needs in some way to be solved or ameliorated.&nbsp; 
				The whole of the first sentence (which could have been a longer 
				text if we had wished to try your patience a little) is 
				encapsulated or, so to speak, put in the shell of the term <em>
				problem</em>.&nbsp; Thereafter, in the text, that is how it is 
				to be understood and references to <em>it</em> and <em>this</em>, 
				for example, are clearly linked to the shell and not to elements 
				within it.</li>
				<li>In example 2., there are two shell nouns:
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>outcome</strong></em></span> 
				and <span class="style_black"><em><strong>issue</strong></em></span>.<br />
				The first encapsulates findings which have already been set out 
				or which are to be set out later.&nbsp; The author of this text 
				clearly wants the reader to understand that the information 
				presented to the reader / listener derives from an investigation 
				of some kind and is not simply assertion or guesswork.<br />
				The second raises an <em>issue</em>, often a euphemism for a <em>
				problem</em>, which is to be seen as something in want of a 
				solution.&nbsp; The reader is being primed to understand what 
				follows that way.</li>
				<li>In example 3., the shell noun is <span class="style_black">
				<em><strong>aim</strong></em></span> which sets the context for 
				what follows.&nbsp; It is clearly distinguished from <em>
				outcomes</em> or <em>reasons</em>, for example, and is to be 
				taken as the context in which all that follows is to be 
				understood.<br />
				The word <em>findings</em> is not highlighted but it, too, is 
				potentially a shell noun if there are a number of results of 
				other people's investigations included in the overall term.</li>
				<li>The last example shows how shell nouns can be used in quite 
				casual speech to place a series of propositions within a simple 
				shell noun, <span class="style_black"><em><strong>plan</strong></em></span>, 
				in this case.&nbsp; The use of the shell noun allows the speaker 
				to refer back to the three intentions easily with the simple anaphoric 
				reference, <em>it</em>.</li>

			</table>
			<p>Now we get to the hard part: defining what exactly a shell noun 
			is and is not.</p>
			<p>Firstly, shell nouns do not form a class of nouns which can be 
			definitively and exhaustively listed (although we'll make an attempt 
			at listing and categorising them later for teaching purposes).&nbsp; 
			All shell nouns are able to be used, as it were , in non-shell 
			functions when they simply represent an entity, abstract or 
			concrete, to use rather old-fashioned terms, and are nouns like any 
			other.<br />
			What identifies a shell noun is the function it performs in a 
			discourse.&nbsp; Some nouns, usually like the ones exemplified above 
			which represent rather loose abstract concepts, lend themselves to 
			being the shell in which other stretches of discourse are understood 
			and should be viewed.<br />
			So, for example, in:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>John has a problem with his car so he's 
			taking it to the workshop tomorrow</em></p>
			<p>we do not have a shell-noun use of the noun <em>problem</em>.&nbsp; 
			It merely represents a dispreferred circumstance.<br />
			However, in:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Climate change and human exploitation of the 
			animals' habitat are combining to create a serious challenge for 
			conservation efforts.&nbsp; This problem is beginning to be tackled 
			by a range of non-governmental agencies, not least our own.</p>
			<p>we do have the use of the term <em>problem</em> as a shell noun because it 
			functions to subsume the whole preceding text (which could have been 
			very much longer and more complex).&nbsp; It defines, in other 
			words, the way in which the preceding or following propositions need 
			to be understood.&nbsp; It is their context, rather than their 
			co-text.<br />
			We also have another shell noun, <em>challenge</em>, to which 
			reference can later be made leading the reader through the text 
			logically.</p>
			<p>Schmid, 2018:112, identifies the characteristics of shell nouns 
			like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em class="style_black">the specific concepts [shell nouns] 
				encapsulate are local, to a large part context-specific and 
				therefore transient.&nbsp; What is characterized as a </em>
				<span class="style_black">problem, challenge</span><em class="style_black"> 
				or </em><span class="style_black">aim</span><em class="style_black"> 
				changes from one use of these nouns to the next, depending on 
				the proposition encoded in the surrounding linguistic context, 
				i.e. the shell content.</em><br />
				So, for example, while we can quite easily define the word <em>
				problem</em> in the example of John's car, above, we can only 
				define the word in the second example by reference to the 
				surrounding text and the intentions of the author.</li>
				<li>Shell nouns characterise the propositions they enclose and 
				they do this on a cline from very general ideas such as <em>aim, 
				thing, problem, issue </em>and so on to more narrow definitions 
				encoded in shell nouns such as <em>disadvantage, peculiarity, 
				uniqueness</em> and so on.</li>
				<li>Discoursally, shell nouns allow internal referencing to be 
				much more precise than would otherwise be the case.&nbsp; For 
				example, having defined a stretch of discourse (which may be 
				long or short) as <em>an aim, a problem, an issue, an advantage</em> 
				or whatever, thereafter, the writer can safely used deictic 
				markers such as <em>this</em> and<em> it</em> with the shell 
				noun as the referent rather than being obliged to refer to the 
				whole section of discourse.&nbsp; As we shall see, the use of
				<em>this</em> as the pronoun for the shell noun is very common 
				and allows it to be used as if the whole of a text were 
				nominalised.&nbsp; The text is not nominalised but the text is 
				enclosed within the shell and that is, of course, just a noun.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The key principle at work here is the way that nouns can <strong>
			reify</strong> propositions, i.e., convert an abstract idea into a 
			thing.&nbsp; The other term, used extensively for this behaviour of 
			nouns, is that they provide the ability to <strong>hypostatize</strong>, 
			i.e., treat or represent something abstract as a concrete reality.<br />
			Only nouns can do this, of course, because nouns are, along with 
			verbs, the chief way 
			in which any language represents reality.</p>
			<p>For example, compare these two mini-texts:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style77">
				<li><em>People in the organisation are spending too much 
				time duplicating work that is being done in other departments leading 
				to unfocused activity and often to internal contradictions.&nbsp; 
				This must be addressed by setting out clearer definitions of 
				people's roles.&nbsp; It can be tackled in one of three ways ...</em></li>
				<li><em>People in the organisation are spending too much 
				time duplicating work that is being done in other departments leading 
				to unfocused activity and often to internal contradictions.&nbsp; 
				This <strong>wasteful duplication</strong> must be addressed by 
				setting out clearer definitions of people's roles.&nbsp; It can 
				be tackled in one of three ways ...</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>It should be clear that in the second version, the issue is 
			discussed within a noun shell, the expression <em>wasteful 
			duplication</em>, which is quite specific and more carefully defined 
			than it would be with the use of a more generalised shell noun such 
			as <em>problem</em>.<br />In the first version, the use of <em>it</em> in the final sentence is 
			potentially confusing because the reader is left to surmise what the 
			referent might be.&nbsp; In the second version, because we have a 
			shell noun, it is quite clear what <em>it</em> refers to: <em>
			<strong>wasteful duplication</strong></em>.<br />That means that the writer can thereafter refer to the whole 
			set of propositions with a simple pronouns, <em>this </em>or<em> it</em>, 
			used to refer to <em>the duplication</em> rather than vaguely 
			pointing at something in the text.<br />
			It also means that the text hangs together much more successfully 
			because the reader is aware of exactly what is being discussed.&nbsp; 
			In other words, cohesion is achieved.</p>
			<p>It should now also be clear why shell nouns should be the target 
			of some teaching in, especially, programmes focused on academic and 
			business English in which the cohesiveness of both spoken and 
			written production has a high priority.<br />
			They should not, however, be neglected on general English courses 
			because the ability to understand and use them has positive 
			communicative benefits.<br />
			In the last sentence, there is the deliberate inclusion of the shell 
			noun, <span class="style_black"><em><strong>ability</strong></em></span>, 
			which encapsulates both understanding and using.</p>

					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>Theme and rheme</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>If the concepts of theme and rheme are obscure to you, try the 
			guide the theme-rheme structures, linked below.</p>
			<p>An obvious use of shell nouns is in the maintenance of coherence 
			and cohesion in a text.&nbsp; These twin ideas can be achieved in a 
			variety of ways, of course, but shell nouns are convenient and easy 
			to manipulate in this regard.<br />
			For example, in a text such as:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Photocopying costs are getting out of hand 
			because people are making unnecessary copies, failing to use copies 
			that already exist on the shelves and using the machines for 
			personal purposes and this is becoming a real issue.&nbsp; Because 
			of it, we are instituting a new system of card operation so a check 
			can be kept on who is copying what.</p>
			<p>The theme of the first sentence is simply <em>photocopying costs</em> 
			but it has a long and extended rheme of over 30 words which should 
			form the theme of the next sentence but is simply too long to be 
			easily put into the theme position.&nbsp; However, in this case, the 
			writer has neatly encapsulated the initial rheme propositions inside 
			the shell noun <em>issue</em>.&nbsp; What follows, therefore, is a 
			simplified theme using <em>it </em>as a pronoun reference to <em>
			issue</em> which makes the text coherent and cohesive without the 
			need to introduce a very long theme expression.<br />
			Neat.</p>
			<p>Shell nouns are also used in reverse, of course, and can begin as 
			the theme of a statements such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span class="style_black"><strong>problem</strong></span> 
			of ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span class="style_black"><strong>findings</strong></span> 
			were that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our <span class="style_black"><strong>intention</strong></span> 
			was to ...</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			and in these cases, once set up as topical themes, reference can be 
			made to them with simple pro-forms such as <em>they, it, this</em> 
			etc. which themselves may form themes of subsequent sentences 
			followed by rhemes explaining their nature or importance.</p>

			<p>Here we draw heavily on Schmid's (2018) summary but will add in a

				sometimes less obviously shell nouns at all.&nbsp; In this group 
				come nouns such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; danger, fear, mistake, proof, sign<br />

			</table>
			<p>In academic and business settings, a limited number of genres 
			need to be deployed.&nbsp; It is unlikely, for example, that in 
			these environments there will be much need for the skills of writing 
			or orally presenting a narrative or an exposition, setting out a 
			story or one side of an argument only.<br />
			However, in general English use, such texts are quite common and 
			need to be produced and understood by many learners.<br />
			As far as academic and business English are concerned, we are left, therefore, with a set of four generic categories into 
			which it will be useful to include shell nouns to maintain cohesion 
			and to nominalise ideas and concepts.<br />
			Here are the these four with the shell nouns highlighted
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>like this </em></strong>
			</span>and the deictic pointers (determiners, pronouns and lexical 
			alternatives) which make the text cohesive, <span class="style_red">
			<em><strong>like this</strong></em></span>:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Recount</strong></dt>
				<dd>A recount is intended to set out clearly what has happened.&nbsp; 
				It is the format for reporting back on experiments conducted, 
				surveys carried out and work done.<br />
				Into these kinds of texts, there are obvious opportunities to 
				encapsulate propositions and concepts in noun shells.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The </em><span class="style_black">
				<strong><em>aim</em></strong></span><em> of the survey was to 
				identify the </em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>aspects</em></strong></span><em> 
				of the business which ... and this <span class="style_red">
				<strong>aim</strong></span> was ... see which of
				<span class="style_red"><strong>them</strong></span> ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The </em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>context</em></strong></span><em> 
				of the experiment was ... and it gave us the </em>
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>opportunity</em></strong></span><em> 
				to ... and ... .&nbsp; <span class="style_red"><strong>These a</strong></span><span class="auto-style78"><span class="style_red"><strong>ffordances</strong></span>
				</span>were ...<br />
				</em>Recounts are also common in less specialised settings, too, 
				and are often the way in which excuses are given.&nbsp; They 
				occur in anecdotes, news reports, explanations and excuses and 
				so on.<br />
				Here's an example of part of a recount, with the shell noun and 
				the references highlighted in the same way.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, my </em><span class="style_black">
				<strong><em>assumption</em></strong></span><em> was that the 
				trains would be running as normal so I'd be able to get to the 
				party with plenty of time to spare.&nbsp; </em>
				<span class="style_red"><strong><em>It</em></strong></span><em> 
				turned out to be wrong, however, because I had forgotten about 
				the Bank Holiday timetable changes.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Procedure</strong></dt>
				<dd>A procedure text (spoken or written) is intended to explain 
				how something is done.<br />
				Suitable shell nouns might be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To measure the </em>
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>products</em></strong></span><em> 
				of the reactions it was necessary to take a </em>
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>sample</em></strong></span><em> 
				of the material.&nbsp; </em><span class="style_red"><strong><em>
				These products</em></strong></span><em> were ... and </em>
				<span class="style_red"><strong><em>the samples</em></strong></span><em> 
				showed ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span class="style_black"><strong>purpose</strong></span> 
				of the procedure is to ensure that customer
				<span class="style_black"><strong>complaints</strong></span> are 
				dealt with in a timely matter.&nbsp; <span class="style_red">
				<strong>This</strong></span> will be achieved by classifying
				<span class="style_red"><strong>each one</strong></span> on the 
				basis of ...</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Information report / Explanation</strong></dt>
				<dd>An information report is intended to present data logically 
				and has a simple structure although the ordering of information 
				needs careful attention.&nbsp; This form of writing is common when a 
				student is asked to summarise the results of reading and 
				research to demonstrate understanding or a concise report of 
				activities undertaken is needed in a business context.<br />
				Suitable shell nouns might be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span class="style_black"><strong>
				attributes</strong></span> of the programme a<span class="auto-style78">llow 
				it t</span>o address the <span class="style_black"><strong>
				problems</strong></span> of ... by reducing the
				<span class="style_black"><strong>possibility</strong></span> 
				that ... .&nbsp; <span class="style_red"><strong>These</strong></span> 
				mean that the <span class="style_red"><strong>issues</strong></span> 
				are ... and the <span class="style_red"><strong>chance</strong></span> 
				of is ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Napoleon's first <span class="style_black"><strong>priority</strong></span> 
				in 1813 was to ... and <span class="style_red"><strong>this</strong></span> 
				he achieved by ...</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Discussion</strong></dt>
				<dd>A discussion is intended to present both sides of a 
				controversy and is more common in the humanities than the 
				sciences.<br />
				This kind of text is, naturally, what is required when 
				departments issue essay titles containing the word <em>Discuss</em>.&nbsp; 
				Often, within a discussion, it is necessary to embed other text 
				forms as digressions or explanation phases.<br />
				Discussions may also occur in a business context, often as part 
				of a report which sets out alternatives with pros and 
				cons balanced.<br />
				Such texts almost require the use of suitable shell nouns such 
				as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a <span class="style_black"><strong>view</strong></span> 
				that ... and <span class="style_red"> <strong>this</strong></span> needs to be taken into 
				account because of the <span class="style_black"><strong>
				possibility</strong></span> that ... <span class="style_red">
				<strong>which</strong></span> may lead to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While initial <span class="style_black"><strong>costs</strong></span> 
				may be ... <span class="style_black"><strong>advantages</strong></span> 
				are that ... and the <span class="style_red"><strong>latter</strong></span> 
				may serve to reduce the impact of the <span class="style_red">
				<strong>former</strong></span> by ...</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Now we can look at how shell nouns might be used in other genres, narratives and expositions, which are more usually used in 
			less specialised settings.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Narratives</strong></dt>
				<dd>Narratives exhibit a similar structure to recounts with 
				the addition, usually, of some kind of complication or problem 
				occurring in them which is resolved somehow.&nbsp; This issue is 
				often embedded&nbsp; within a shell noun so that it can be 
				referred to easily.&nbsp; Here's an example of part of a 
				narrative where this happens:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course the <span class="style_black">
				<strong>upshot</strong></span> of all the problems with the car, 
				the cancelled train service, the weather 
				and so on was that we couldn't leave when we intended.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_red"><strong>That</strong></span> led to all 
				sorts of difficulties later on because the hotel was shut by the 
				time we arrived.&nbsp; <span class="style_red"><strong>It</strong></span> 
				had a silver lining in that we&nbsp; got to stay somewhere much 
				nicer in the end.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Expositions</strong></dt>
				<dd>Expositions are found frequently on blog sites, in newspaper 
				leader articles, in essays and in letters and proposals.&nbsp; 
				They differ from discussions in that they are intended to 
				persuade, not inform, and conventionally focus only on one side 
				of an argument.&nbsp; Like discussions, however, they can use 
				shell nouns to present issues concisely and in a way that allows 
				the author of the text, written or spoken, to refer to quite 
				complicated issues without being too vague.&nbsp; Like this, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span class="style_black"><strong>
				need</strong></span> is for a rapid and sensible response to
				<span class="style_black"><strong>these issues</strong></span> 
				and <span class="style_red"><strong>it</strong></span> is a 
				pressing <span class="style_red"><strong>one</strong></span>.&nbsp; 
				Unless <span class="style_red"><strong>they</strong></span> are 
				tackled soon, the situation will only get worse and
				<span class="style_red"><strong>the problems </strong></span>
				will multiply.</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>While there is nothing very mysterious to most readers faced with 
			texts like this, learners need considerable practice following some 
			awareness raising to deploy shell nouns effectively because they have 
			to:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>select the correct shell noun which appropriately 
				encapsulates the propositions it holds</li>
				<li>make sure that the shell noun is as precise or as general as 
				it needs to be</li>
				<li>make anaphoric reference in the following text to the 
				correct shell noun</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is by no means easy but the dividends, in terms, of 
			cohesive, mature texts are considerable.</p>

					<img alt="thimb" src="../../images/thumb_bw250.jpg" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>Form</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are few hard-and-fast rules, well, none, to be fair, but 
			there are some rules of thumb:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Most of the shell nouns are complemented by a copular verb 
				and a <em>that-</em>clause.&nbsp; So for example, we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reality is that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem appears that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advantage has been that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our hypothesis was that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theory emerged that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The likelihood grows that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The danger remained that ...</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				It is worth noting here that not all so-called abstract nouns in 
				English can follow this pattern.&nbsp; We do not, for example, 
				allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The science was that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The hatred was that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The comprehension was that ...</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				This pattern is not unique to shell nouns but is an important 
				defining characteristic and one that makes them particularly 
				useful and flexible.</li>
				<li>Because of its usual prospective meaning (think about: <em>hope to, 
				intend to, want to, am going to</em> etc.) the <em>to-</em>infinitive 
				is the natural complement for shell nouns with prospective 
				meanings, too, with and without a copula, so we get, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; An opportunity exists to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aim has been to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got permission to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government does not have the ability to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our efforts were made to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It w<span class="auto-style78">as </span>a silly mistake to ...</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Again, not all abstract nouns in English allow this pattern so 
				we cannot have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The love was to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The mercy was to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The understanding was to ...</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				And, again, this pattern is not unique to shell nouns but is 
				another which makes them useful and flexible.</li>
				<li>Illocutionary shell nouns depend for their grammar on the 
				type of communicative function which the nouns suggest as in, 
				e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The complaints about ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The demand that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question whether ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposal for ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point was made that ...<br />
				</em>and so on.</li>
				<li>Some shell nouns, especially the circumstantial ones, take 
				less predictable complements so we may encounter:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The context of ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The environment in which ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The surroundings of ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The background to ...</em><br />
				etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The form of the language is, therefore, unpredictable in detail 
			but reasonably straightforward, nevertheless.<br />
			Patterns 1. and 2. above are particularly important, according to
		Schmid, 2000:3.</p>

			<p>This has to come in sections, piecemeal, and it is foolish to 
			believe that the ability to comprehend and use shell nouns is 
			something that can be taught quickly or easily.<br />
			To get the trick of using these nouns appropriately demands a good 
			deal of time and effort but the rewards are substantial.<br />
			Many of the examples which follow are set in an academic or business 
			English teaching context but it is simple to see how they can be

			</table>
			<p>Simply being able to identify the role of shell nouns in texts is 
			a great help to comprehension and it is a comparatively 
			straightforward matter to alert learners to them in any texts you 
			use.&nbsp; Concept-checking questions and leading questions are 
			effective such as:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the meaning 
			of </em><span class="style_underline">aspect</span><em> in the 
			second sentence?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does the word </em><span class="style_underline">issue</span><em> 
			include?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does </em><span class="style_underline">this</span><em> 
			refer to in the second paragraph?</em></span><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Providing learners with a list of the shell nouns in longer texts 
			and getting them to scan for them and mark them in some way is also 
			an effective approach.&nbsp; Once identified, they can be analysed 
			for meaning and their pronoun and other references identified.</p>
			<p>Noticing tasks are familiar approaches to raising awareness of 
			the existence of these sorts of nouns and the functions they 
			perform.&nbsp; Simply <span class="auto-style79"><strong><em>
			highlighting</em></strong></span> the nouns in texts is often a good 
			beginning and, thereafter, the advantages of using shell nouns can 
			be the focus of the awareness-raising procedures.&nbsp; Like this, 
			perhaps:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder" style="width: 90%">

			That (i.e., the shell noun <span class="style_black"><em><strong>

			<p>There are, in just the list above, over 200 of these potential 
			shell nouns and it is a challenge for most learners to acquire more 
			than around ten new items of lexis a day (and many fail to do that).&nbsp; 
			(There are at least another 400 or so which have not been mentioned 
			(Schmid, 2000, lists 670 of them).)<br />
			If, as seems likely, your learners and you do not have 20 days to 
			spare, there needs to be some focus:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Many shell nouns are, in fact, quite common whether 
				functioning as shells or as simple nouns denoting abstractions.<br />
				This means that most learners above, say B1 level, already know 
				many of them but may not be alert to their possibilities in 
				terms of writing and presenting texts.</li>
				<li>A survey of the lists above and others will quickly show 
				that many shell nouns are synonymous (or nearly so) with 
				others.&nbsp; So for example<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consequence, effect</em> and <em>outcome</em> form a set<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cause </em>and <em>reason</em> are often synonymous in many 
				environments<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; likelihood, probability, chance</em> and <em>possibility</em> 
				are also often interchangeable<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plan, plot, scheme, idea </em>and <em>proposal</em> carry the same senses but at varying levels of formality and so on.<br />
				These sets of (near) synonyms share grammatical characteristics 
				and form colligations concerning the kinds of complementation 
				which are appropriate.<br />
				Synonymy is also widely used in keeping the text cohesive 
				lexically so one may start by characterising something as <em>a 
				plan</em> and refer to it later as <em>an intention</em> or 
				begin with the shell noun <em>a problem</em> which is later 
				referred to as <em>the issue</em>.</li>
				<li>Learners do not need to master 670, or even 200, shell nouns but they do need at 
			least one in each of the categories to be able to write and present 
			texts appropriately.&nbsp; More than one would be better.</li>
				<li>Helping learners to produce texts is often done <em>via</em> a 
			modelling approach in which a text is analysed for its features and 
			then learners are tasked with writing or presenting a similar text 
			which parallels the model.&nbsp; For an example and explanation, see 
			the guide in the EAP section to understanding generic structures.<br />
				Shell nouns in model texts, of which there are almost always 
				more than a few, can effectively be a major or minor part of the 
				analysis.&nbsp; This can only happen if you are alert to the 
				possibilities.</li>
