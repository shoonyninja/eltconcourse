		<p class="concoursebluepara">If you haven't followed

		and then come back to this guide for the teaching implications.<br />
		Now that we have reviewed the essential

		about how this knowledge helps us to help our learners read more 
		effectively and write more powerfully.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><span class="auto-style7">Reading</span>: because knowledge of 
			text types and structure allow readers to identify the text's 
			purpose and locate the information they need as well as being able 
			to predict what comes next.</li>
			<li><span class="auto-style7">Writing</span>: because knowledge of 
			how text types are structured according to purpose will allow 
			learners to write in a way that impresses the reader and gets the 
			message across conventionally.&nbsp; Knowledge of genres structure 
			is power.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>One of the skills readers need is knowledge of generic structure.&nbsp; 
		This is sometimes called schematic genre knowledge.<br />
		Here are some teaching ideas.</p>

				doing.<br />
				They both said, "Nothing!", of course, and I had no proof so 
				there was nothing I thought I could do so I started to walk 
				away.<br />
				Just as I was coming to the school gate, I heard a loud bang 
				behind me and when I looked, I could see that one of the kids 
				had thrown a bit of concrete over the fence and it was resting 
				very close to the track.&nbsp; I ran back to the fence and 
				looked over and saw that the concrete could possibly be hit by a 
				passing train.&nbsp; I shouted at the kids and told them how 
				stupid they'd been and that I was going to get the police.&nbsp; 
				They were pretty frightened and ran off down the road.<br />
				I wanted to chase after them but that would mean I could do 
				nothing about the danger so I decided to call the police instead 
				and tell them what had happened.&nbsp; They told me to wait 
				where I was until they arrived, which they did very quickly.&nbsp; 
				As soon as they saw the danger, one of them climbed over the 
				fence and removed the piece of concrete.</td>

			<p class="concoursebluepara"><strong>Look for the language</strong></p>
			<ol class="auto-style12">
				<li>
				focus the learners on the types of 
				verbs in each section.&nbsp; They should notice that the 
				orientation and coda contain what are called projecting 
				processes (<em>like, think, hope,</em> etc.) and relational 
				processes with verbs like <em>be</em> and <em>cause</em>.&nbsp; 
				The other two sections contain different sorts of verbs 
				describing what actions were taken and so on.&nbsp; These are 
				called material processes.&nbsp; If you want to learn about 
				verbs as processes, see <a href="../verbs/verbalprocesses.html">the guide 
				to verb processes</a> on this site.
				</li>
				<li>
				Look for what are called 
				circumstances (or adverbials in some grammars).&nbsp; These are 
				things like <em>on my way back, yesterday, very quickly, in the 
				circumstances, just as </em>etc.&nbsp; Recounts are rich in 
				these because the reader needs to be kept in the picture.&nbsp; 
				If you want to learn about circumstances, see
				<a href="../lexicogrammar/circumstances.html">the guide to circumstances</a> 
				on this site.

			<strong>Use it as a model</strong>
			<ol class="auto-style12">
				<li>
				Everyone has some sort of anecdote 
				they can tell or write but learners of English need to know how 
				to structure the text.
				</li>
				<li>
				After you have done stage 1, you 
				can get the learners to make notes about their own anecdote, 
				dividing what happened into the four sections.&nbsp; First they 
				write the Orientation and then sequence the events.&nbsp; Then 
				they need to look at the example of Reorientation and write that 
				before writing the Coda.&nbsp; A mistake learners often make, 
				especially if they come from cultures in which the structure 
				differs from English, is to start with a Coda, tell the story 
				and then orientate the reader.
				</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Re-ordering</h4>
		<p>A simple but effective way of raising 
		awareness of text staging is to take an example such as a Discussion 
		text and chop it up separating the various stages into discrete parts: 
		statement of issue, arguments for, arguments against and personal 
		evaluation (if it exists).<br />
		Then do the same with an Exposition and see if the learners can spot the 
		differences in staging and structure.&nbsp; That might help them to 
		avoid writing an Exposition when they need a Discussion and <em>vice 
		versa</em>.<br />
		Of course, the exercise above can also be done with these genres but the 
		verbal structure and circumstances will vary.&nbsp; In particular, you 
		should focus on modal verbs.&nbsp; Expositions tend to contain lots of
		<em>should, must, be prohibited, can't, ought </em>etc. while 
		discussions are toned down with, e.g., <em>arguably, it might be that 
		..., may</em> and so on.<br />
		Circumstances in Expositions tend to be more extreme and terms such as
		<em>everywhere, always, invariably, massively, most of ... </em>etc. 
		while Discussions use more hedged expressions such as <em>often, much, 
		some</em> etc.</p>
		<h4>Exploiting theme and rheme</h4>
		<p>We saw in the last section how the theme of one clause will generate 
		a rheme which will, in turn, become the theme of a subsequent (although 
		not necessarily the next) clause.<br />
		For example, notice how, in the Recount above, the theme
		<span class="auto-style13"><em>On my way back from lunch</em></span> 
		leads to the rheme <span class="auto-style13"><em>I saw two school kids 
		mucking about</em></span> and that this rheme becomes the theme
		<span class="auto-style13"><em>One of them</em></span>.&nbsp;
		<span class="auto-style13"><em>I</em></span> and
		<span class="auto-style13"><em>the kids</em></span> recur later as 
		themes of subsequent clauses with their own rhemes.&nbsp; The 
		connections are made for the reader with a number of discourse devices 
		such as pronoun substitution (<span class="auto-style13"><em>they</em></span> 
		for <span class="auto-style13"><em>the kids</em></span>), repetition (<span class="auto-style13"><em>I</em></span> 
		occurs frequently), synonymy (<span class="auto-style13"><em>danger</em></span> 
		for <span class="auto-style13"><em>piece of concrete</em></span>) and so 
		on.&nbsp; How this is done exactly is a topic for another guide but it 
		can be exploited in the classroom to help learners notice the structure 
		and duplicate it.<br />
		Underlining the devices and getting learners to identify the 
		connections is a good beginning but we can do more:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Try getting learners to duplicate the structure of the first two 
			theme-rheme connections by saying or writing about what happened to 
			them in an anecdote.&nbsp; Then they can set up the first theme with a 
			circumstance like <span class="auto-style13"><em>On my way back from 
			lunch </em></span>and then to follow it with a rheme concerning what 
			they saw / heard / felt etc. and then using that rheme to form the 
			theme of the next clause and so on.</li>
			<li>Play a round-the-class retelling of a familiar story (fables are 
			good) in which the next learner has to use the last learner's rheme 
			to form a new theme.</li>
			<li>Look at the theme-rheme structure of a simple Discussion, 
			Explanation&nbsp;or Exposition and get the learners to identify 
			which rhemes become themes later in the text and how the connections 
			are made.&nbsp; In these genres, a common structure is for the main 
			theme to recur frequently with a variety of rhemes only some of 
			which will become themes of clauses.&nbsp; For an example of an 
			Explanation text (with sequential events) to use, try this text from 
			a reading lesson for B1 / B2 learners 
			on Crime and Punishment.&nbsp;
			<a href="../../../learners/lessons/b1b2lessons/b1b2reading/candp1.htm" target="_blank">
			The lesson starts here</a> (opening in a new window or tab) and the 
			text is this with the words <span class="auto-style17">in red</span> 
			being the target lexical sets for the lesson:</li>
		</ol>
      <p class="auto-style18">
     
	  <span class="auto-style19">John has had a long and interesting </span>
	  <span class="auto-style17"><span class="auto-style19">criminal career</span></span>.<br />
	  <span class="auto-style19">He first <span class="auto-style17">broke the 
	  law</span> when he was only 16.&nbsp; He <span class="auto-style17">was 
	  arrested by the police</span> for <span class="auto-style17">vandalism</span> 
	  because he was caught painting <span class="auto-style17">graffiti</span> 
	  on the walls of his local underground station.&nbsp; After that, it just got 
	  worse.<br />
	  By the time he was twenty, John&nbsp;had <span class="auto-style17">convictions</span> 
	  for <span class="auto-style17">theft</span>, <span class="auto-style17">
	  arson</span>, <span class="auto-style17">drug dealing</span> and
	  <span class="auto-style17">assault</span>.&nbsp; He had already spent over a 
	  year in <span class="auto-style17">institutions for young offenders</span>.&nbsp; 
	  At the age of twenty-two, however, his <span class="auto-style17">crimes</span> 
	  became even more <span class="auto-style17">serious</span>.&nbsp; He was 
	  arrested on <span class="auto-style17">two counts of burglary</span>, 
	  having <span class="auto-style17">broken into</span> houses in North 
	  London.&nbsp; He was also accused of resisting arrest and
	  <span class="auto-style17">assaulting</span> a policeman.&nbsp; Although 
	  John <span class="auto-style17">pleaded guilty</span>, the
	  <span class="auto-style17">court</span> took these
	  <span class="auto-style17">offences</span> very seriously and John was
	  <span class="auto-style17">sentenced to</span> ten years'
	  <span class="auto-style17">imprisonment</span>.<br />
	  However, while he was <span class="auto-style17">in prison</span>, John 
	  became a reformed character and he deeply regretted his earlier
	  <span class="auto-style17">life of crime</span>.&nbsp; The prison
	  <span class="auto-style17">warders</span> noticed John's change of heart 
	  and recommended him for early <span class="auto-style17">release</span>.<br />
	  When he <span class="auto-style17">came out</span>, John took a degree in 
	  social work and became an advisor in schools.&nbsp; He travels around the 
	  country talking to young people about the dangers of
	  <span class="auto-style17">crime</span> and </span>
	  <span class="auto-style17"><span class="auto-style19">drug dealing</span></span>. </p>
		<p class="auto-style15">Notice how the main theme (<span class="auto-style13"><em>John</em></span>) 
		leads to many rhemes and how the rhemes (<span class="auto-style13"><em>crimes, 
		the police, prison</em></span> etc.) become, in turn, themes of 
		subsequent clauses.&nbsp; If you can do this, so can your learners.&nbsp; 
		And then they can go on to construct a believable and well connected 
		(cohesive) biography of a real or imagined character.</p>
		<p>In the guide to understanding generic structure and theme-rheme 
		patterns for English for Academic Purposes, the outline of a whole 
		writing course to tackle the key issues is provided linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>
		<p>One area of grammar which can be explained with a good deal of 
		precision and makes sense to many people by using the concepts of theme 
		and rheme is the formation of the passive in English linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>
		<p>This is not the place to provide more 
		examples, many of which won't help you with your particular learners
