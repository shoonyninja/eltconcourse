			<h1>Tense and genre</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="time" height="207" src="../../images/clock_waiting310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>A good deal of attention has been lavished on analysing, for 
			example, narrative tenses and attempting to categorise them in terms 
			of their structures and grammatical characteristics.&nbsp; This 
			guide takes a rather different view: it looks at tense forms in 
			terms of their functions rather than their structures.&nbsp; If you 
			need to find a guide to analysing the forms of tenses themselves, 
			consult <a href="../../tenses/tenses_index.html" target="_blank">the general 
			index of tenses</a>.<br />
			This guide focuses on two general text types in which the use of 
			tense forms plays a crucial communicative role: recounts and 
			narratives and descriptive or explanatory texts.</p>
			<p>Before we begin, however, we need to get two concepts clear:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The distinction between finite and non-finite forms</li>
				<li>The distinction between relative and absolute tense forms</li>
			</ol>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="progressive and continuous" height="166" src="../../images/four_men250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Finite and non-finite forms</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style42">
					<em>Having waited by the harbour for a while,<br />
					the men decided to go to the pub.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In the sentence above there are two tense forms:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style43">
				<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>having waited</strong></em></span>:<br />
				This is a non-finite form because it carries no marker for tense 
				or person.&nbsp; The reader / hearer needs to infer when and 
				about whom the phrase refers.&nbsp; In this case, the we can 
				easily infer that the waiting preceded the decision to go to the 
				pub and that both events occurred in the past and we can 
				conclude that it was the men who waited.&nbsp; We conclude that, 
				however, from the rest of the sentence, not from the verb phrase 
				itself.&nbsp; We can also have, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having waited so long, I'm happy to stay 
				a little longer</em><br />
				in which we can infer that the waiting is related to 
				something happening now and is still going on in the present.&nbsp; 
				We can also infer that the speaker / writer has done the 
				waiting.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having arrived at the airport, you will 
				see the sign for our offices on the left of the main entrance</em><br />
				in which the events are set in order, in the future and refer to 
				the reader / hearer.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having seen the film, he had already 
				decided not to go with his friends so he stayed at home</em><br />
				in which the seeing of the film precedes an event in the past 
				and that event precedes the decision and that in turn precedes 
				the staying at home.<br />
				Other non-finite forms are:<br />
				The bare infinitive in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They should <span class="style_black">
				<strong>see</strong></span> the film</em><br />
				The <em>to</em>-infinitive in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want <span class="style_black"><strong>
				to see</strong></span> the film<br />
				</em>The <em>-ed / -en</em> participle:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>Broken</strong></span>, 
				the machine was useless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The audience was left <span class="style_black"><strong>bored</strong></span></em></li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong><em>the men decided</em></strong></span>:<br />
				This is a finite tense form because it is marked for time with 
				the -<em>ed</em> suffix telling us that it is in the past.&nbsp; 
				In English, past tenses are not marked for person in any verb 
				except the deeply irregular <em>be</em> (which has <em>was</em> 
				and <em>were</em> to mark number but still not persons) but they are in many languages which inflect to show both person 
				and tense.&nbsp; In German, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stole = ich stahl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you stole = du stahlst<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we stole = wir stahlen</em><br />
				and these are all examples of a finite verb being marked
				<span class="style_underline">both</span> for time and for 
				person.<br />
				Other marked finite forms in English are, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_black"><strong>goes
				</strong></span>to work by car</em><br />
				which is marked for tense (present) and person (third-person 
				singular -<em>es</em> ending).<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black"><strong>had 
				succeeded</strong></span></em><br />
				which is marked for time in two ways (the form of <em>have</em> 
				and the non-finite -<em>ed</em> ending).<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'<span class="style_black"><strong>m going</strong></span> tomorrow</em><br />
				which is marked as a present intention concerning the future and in the first person because 
				of the non-finite <em>-ing</em> ending and the finite form of <em>be, 
				am</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For more on the distinction between finite and non-finite forms, 
			see the guide linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>

					<td class="auto-style3">
					&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In the example above, there are two distinct types of tense 
			forms, both finite:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style43">
				<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>they had waited</strong></em></span><br />
				This is a relative or relational tense form because we can only understand the 
				time at which this event takes place by reference to the 
				co-text.&nbsp; From that we can infer that the waiting preceded 
				the decision to go to the pub.&nbsp; It is the past embedded in the 
				past.<br />
				Other relational tense forms include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_black"><strong>has 
				arrived</strong></span> and is apologising for her lateness</em><br />
				in which we can infer that the arrival preceded the apology.&nbsp; 
				It is the past embedded in the present.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black"><strong>was 
				walking</strong></span> to the pub when I met John</em><br />
				in which we can infer that the walking preceded the meeting 
				(and, quite possibly continued after it).<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black"><strong>was 
				going to go</strong></span> to the pub when the telephone rang</em><br />
				in which we can infer that the future intention was thwarted in 
				some way and was not fulfilled.&nbsp; It is the future embedded in the 
				past.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong><em>decided to go to the 
				pub</em></strong></span><br />
				Here we have an absolute tense form and do not need a context to 
				know that the event is set in the past and is previous to the 
				here and now.<br />
				Other absolute tense forms include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_black"><strong>is 
				waiting</strong></span> </em>in her office<br />
				in which we know that the action is set in the present.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black"><strong>will speak
				</strong></span>to her tomorrow</em><br />
				in which we know that the action is set in the future.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For more on the distinctions between and forms of absolute and 
			relational tenses, see the guide to tense forms linked in the list of 
			related guides at the end.</p>
			<p>
			Now we have these two fundamental concepts clear, we can get on to 
			looking at what tense forms are likely to occur in a range of 
			genres.<br />
			Texts, whether written or spoken, belong to the same genre when they 
			share a common social purpose.&nbsp; Different social purposes will 
			lead to the construction of texts with a range of identifying 
			features.&nbsp; Here we are only concerned with tense forms but the 
			types of verb (i.e., what they do), the kinds of circumstances 
			(i.e., how they are modified) and so on will all be affected by the 
			social purpose the text is designed to fulfil.<br />
			For more, see the guide to verbal processes and the guide to 
			circumstances, both linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>

			<p>
			A narrative is distinguished from a simple recount because it is 
			structured to be entertaining and/or instructive whereas a recount 
			simply sets out a series of events.&nbsp; The distinction between 
			the two text types can be set out like this:</p>
			<table class="tableblueborder" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">

					<strong>Recount</strong></td>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			It is clear from this table that the `distinction between these two 
			text types lies in the central aspect of the text: the complication 
			and its resolution.&nbsp; Without those aspects, a text does not 
			qualify as a narrative at all.</p>
			<p>
			In fact, Labov and Waletzky (1967), identify the stages of a 
			narrative rather more precisely, like this:</p>
			<table class="tableblueborder" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style98" colspan="2">

					<td class="auto-style106">Evaluation</td>
					<td class="auto-style107"><em>this is the </em>So, what?<em>

					<td class="auto-style106">Resolution</td>
					<td class="auto-style107"><em>how the problem was resolved

			<p>
			Lambrou (2007), drawing on Plum (1988) identifies two other forms of 
			recount which also do not qualify as narratives, lacking, as they 
			do, the critical complication-resolution stages.&nbsp; They are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Anecdote<br />
				which usually concerns a remarkable (to the teller) event of 
				some kind followed by a personal reaction to it.</li>
				<li>Exemplum<br />
				which is a record of an event followed by an interpretation of 
				its generalisability.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			Although the overall structures and the ways in which the 
			information is delivered (i.e., staged) differ, the tense forms that 
			we use in all these text types are reasonably similar so, while we still 
			need to bear the differences firmly in mind, we can make some 
			generalisations which apply to the subgenres.<br />
			Here's how:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
			<img alt="nailed" height="133" src="../../images/fix_hammer_nail200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h3>The absolute past: nailing things down</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">
			Almost by definition, recounts and narratives are set in the past 
			and usually the speaker / writer will take pains to orientate the 
			reader quite precisely to the time(s) of the event and its location(s) 
			with something like:</p>
			<p class="auto-style112">
			This <strong>happened</strong> to me last year when I <strong>was</strong> on holiday in Japan.&nbsp; 
			It <strong>was</strong> June and the weather <strong>was</strong> really fine.</p>
			<p class="auto-style113">
			or</p>
			<p class="auto-style112">
			In 1815, Napoleon <strong>escaped</strong> from imprisonment on the island of Elba 
			and <strong>returned</strong> to the French mainland.</p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">
			The text may go on in this vein using solely simple past, absolute 
			tense forms but that leads to a rather unsophisticated, not to say 
			dull, text such as:</p>

			This <strong>happened</strong> to me last year when I <strong>was</strong> on holiday in Japan.&nbsp; 
			It <strong>was</strong> June and the weather <strong>was</strong> really fine.&nbsp; I 
			<strong>was</strong> in a hotel 
			in Tokyo and <strong>went</strong> on an excursion to the countryside.&nbsp; I 
			<strong>took</strong> a 
			train to Kyoto and <strong>stayed</strong> in a traditional hotel in that city.</p>

			In 1815, Napoleon <strong>escaped</strong> from imprisonment on the island of Elba

			near Grenoble and they <strong>joined</strong> him on a march to Paris.&nbsp; He 
			<strong>arrived</strong> in Paris in March and <strong>took</strong> over power from the king.</p>
			<p>
			So, the central characteristic of both recounts and 
			narratives is that the main structural events of the story which 
			lend it its coherence are realised through a series of simple, 
			absolute past tense forms.&nbsp; However, to make texts more 
			interesting, we need a number of other structures.</p>

				</table>
			<p>
			Relative or relational tense forms are generally tangential to the main events of 
			the story and are used in three main ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="auto-style113">To introduce some perspective in terms of the events 
				preceding the main story without which the reader / hearer 
				cannot set it in context.&nbsp; Past perfect tense 
				forms perform this function most commonly.&nbsp; For example:</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style112">I <strong>had been staying</strong> at a hotel in Tokyo when I 
			decided to take an excursion to Kyoto, a city I <strong>had</strong> always 
			<strong>wanted</strong> to 
			visit.</p>
			<p class="auto-style113">or</p>
			<p class="auto-style112">Napoleon <strong>had abdicated</strong> the throne on 4th April 
			1814 and <strong>had been imprisoned</strong> by the British on the island of Elba.&nbsp; 
			There, he plotted his escape.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">To provide descriptive background, again 
				tangential to the main events, but in order to give some colour 
				and context.&nbsp; Continuous or progressive tense forms 
				commonly perform this function.&nbsp; For example:</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style112">Tokyo <strong>was beginning</strong> to get warm and humid and 
			I <strong>was getting </strong>tired of the busy, modern city so I went on an 
			excursion to Kyoto.</p>
			<p class="auto-style113">or</p>
			<p class="auto-style112">Napoleon <strong>was ruling</strong> the island of Elba and<strong> was 
			instituting</strong> a new legal code as well as <strong>developing</strong> the island's 
			industry when he escaped to the mainland of Europe.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">To anticipate later events in the story which bear 
				upon the events being written of / spoken about.&nbsp; Future in 
				the past forms are commonly used to realise this function.&nbsp; 
				Additionally, forms with the modal auxiliary verb <em>would</em> are 
				frequently deployed for the same effect.&nbsp; For example:</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style112">I <strong>was going</strong> to leave Japan in three weeks and 
			<strong>would</strong> not have a chance to travel here again so I wanted to see more 
			of the country before I left</p>
			<p class="auto-style113">or</p>
			<p class="auto-style114">Napoleon <strong>was </strong>never <strong>going</strong> to be satisfied with 
			a life of obscurity on the island of Elba and <strong>would</strong> always represent 
			a threat to the monarchy in France.</p>

				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Present tenses (especially simple, absolute ones) are often used 
			instead of past tenses either to set the scene or to make the events 
			more vivid and exciting.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style112">This story of mine <strong>takes</strong> place in Japan, where 
			I <strong>am staying</strong> at a hotel in Tokyo.</p>
			<p class="auto-style113">or</p>
			<p class="auto-style112">Europe in 1815 <strong>is</strong> exhausted by 23 years of 
			almost unbroken warfare and Napoleon <strong>is</strong> finally in exile on the 
			island of Elba.</p>
			<p>Present tenses can also be used to make even the events of a 
			narrative (especially) or a recount more gripping and exciting.&nbsp; 
			For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style112">So, I <strong>arrive</strong> in the rain in Kyoto and it'<strong>s
			</strong>very 
			late, of course.&nbsp; It<strong>'s</strong> difficult to find my hotel in the middle 
			of the night.&nbsp; Suddenly a taxi <strong>appears</strong> and I 
			<strong>flag</strong> it down.&nbsp; 
			What a relief!</p>
			<p class="auto-style113">or</p>
			<p class="auto-style114">Napoleon <strong>sees</strong> his chance and daringly 
			<strong>escapes</strong>

			<p>Non-finite verb forms perform similar functions:</p>

			<p class="auto-style112"><strong>Having become</strong> a little bored with the 
			congestion and modernity of Tokyo, I took an excursion to Kyoto.&nbsp; 
			<strong>Arriving</strong> there, I was delighted by the peaceful atmosphere.</p>

			<p class="auto-style112"><strong>Despairing</strong> of his life on Elba, Napoleon 
			escaped to the mainland.&nbsp; <strong>Having done</strong> so, he immediately 
			marched north.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">To express consequences and reasons as well as to 
				catenate verbs linking actions and events in a series, <em>to-</em>infinitives and 
				<em>-ing</em> forms are often deployed.&nbsp; For example:</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style112">I became bored <strong>waiting</strong> around in Tokyo so I 
			decided <strong>to get</strong> out of the city <strong>to see
			</strong>something of the rest of

			<p class="auto-style113">or</p>
			<p class="auto-style114">Napoleon became dissatisfied with <strong>ruling</strong> a small 
			island in the Mediterranean Sea and resolved on <strong>escaping</strong> to mainland 
			France <strong>to recover</strong> his empire.&nbsp; <strong>Meeting</strong> up there with his old

			<p>Present simple tenses are most frequently used because both types 
			of descriptive text are generally presented as being constant, i.e., 
			absolute, truth.&nbsp; Two types of verbs are 
			used in this way.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Relational verbs which relate one thing to another are most 
				commonly found in descriptions rather than explanations.&nbsp; 
				For example:</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style112">An alligator <strong>is</strong> a crocodilian in the genus 
			Alligator of the family Alligatoridae. The two living species 
			<strong>are</strong> 
			the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) and the Chinese 
			alligator (A. sinensis). Additionally, several extinct species of 
			alligator <strong>are known</strong> from fossil remains.<br />
			...<br />
			Alligators <strong>have</strong> muscular, flat tails that propel them while 
			swimming.<br />
			<span class="auto-style93">Wikipedia</span></p>
			<p>In this extract, we are told how one thing is related to another 
			(through the use of the verb <em>be</em>) and the tense is simple present because the facts apply generally, 
			not specifically tied to time.<br />
			The second part tells us the relationships between parts of the 
			animals and what constituents they have (through the use of the verb
			<em>have</em>).</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Behavioural process verbs which tell us what 
				things do or what is done are common to both descriptions and 
				explanations.&nbsp; For example:</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style112">[Alligators] may <strong>kill</strong> larger prey by 
			<strong>grabbing</strong> 
			it and <strong>dragging</strong> it into the water to <strong>drown</strong>. Alligators 
			<strong>consume</strong> food 
			that cannot be eaten in one bite ... by <strong>biting</strong> and then 
			<strong>spinning</strong> or 
			<strong>convulsing</strong> wildly until bite-sized chunks are 
			<strong>torn</strong> off.<br />
			...<br />
			When young, alligators <strong>eat</strong> fish, insects, snails, crustaceans, and 
			worms. As they <strong>mature</strong>, progressively larger prey is 
			<strong>taken</strong>, including 
			larger fish such as gar, turtles, and various mammals, particularly 
			coypu and muskrat, as well as birds, deer, and other reptiles.<br />
			...<br />
			In summer, the female <strong>builds</strong> a nest of vegetation where the 
			decomposition of the vegetation <strong>provides</strong> the heat needed to 
			<strong>incubate</strong> 
			the eggs.<br />
			<span class="auto-style93">Ibid</span></p>
			<p>And, again, you can see that present tense forms are exclusively 
			used.</p>
			<p>Or, using more material rather than behavioural processes because 
			the subjects are generally inanimate so do not 'behave' in any real 
			sense:</p>
			<p class="auto-style112">There are several steps in the brewing 
			process, which may include <strong>malting, mashing, lautering, boiling, 
			fermenting, conditioning, filtering,</strong> and <strong>packaging</strong>.<br />
			Malting is the process where barley grain is <strong>made</strong> ready for brewing. 
			Malting is <strong>broken down</strong> into three steps in order to 
			<strong><em>help</em> to
			release</strong>  
			the starches in the barley. First, during steeping, the grain is 
			<strong>added</strong> to a vat with water and <strong>allowed to 
			soak</strong> for approximately 40 
			hours. During germination, the grain <strong>is spread</strong> out on the floor of 
			the germination room for around 5 days. The final part of malting is 
			<strong>kilning</strong> when the malt <strong>goes</strong> through a very high temperature drying in 
			a kiln; with gradual temperature increase over several hours.<br />
			<span class="auto-style93">Ibid</span></p>
			<p>However, the verb forms for explanations usually involve frequent 
			(and sometimes sole) use of simple present passive forms because it is the material 
			process on which the focus is put rather than the activities (i.e., 
			behaviours) which is most central to what is being described.<br />
			Catenation of verb forms is common.</p>

				</table>
			<p>Relative or relational tenses are almost invariably present and are used 
			in two ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To set the subject of the description in context and 
				describe peripheral facts (asides, in a sense).&nbsp; For example:</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style112">Alligators <strong>have</strong> also <strong>been observed</strong> to rise up 
			and balance on their hind legs and semi-step forward as part of a 
			forward or upward lunge.<br />
			...<br />
			Alligators, much like birds, <strong>have been shown</strong> to exhibit ...<br />
			<span class="auto-style93">Ibid</span></p>
			<p class="auto-style113">or</p>
			<p class="auto-style112">Beer may <strong>have been known</strong> in Neolithic Europe 
			as far back as 5,000 years ago, and was mainly brewed on a domestic 
			scale.<br />
			...<br />
			a few brewers <strong>have produced</strong> gluten-free beer<br />
			<span class="auto-style93">Ibid</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">To show sequences in an explanation.&nbsp; For 
				example:</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style114">When a beer <strong>has been brewed</strong> using a cool 
			fermentation of around 10°C ... then stored for several weeks (or 
			months) at temperatures close to freezing point, it is termed a 
			"lager".<br />

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h3>Past forms</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Some descriptions, naturally, are of events, locations, things or 
			people in the past and some processes are explained although they 
			are no longer in use.&nbsp; In these cases, the verb forms are used 
			in the same way but the past forms are selected for obvious reasons 
			so we may have, for example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style112">By the 16th century, cannon <strong>were made</strong> in a 
			great variety of lengths and bore diameters, but the general rule 
			<strong>was</strong> that the longer the barrel, the longer the range.<br />
			<span class="auto-style93">Ibid</span></p>
			<p class="auto-style113">or</p>
			<p class="auto-style114">While dinosaurs <strong>were</strong> ancestrally bipedal, many 
			extinct groups included quadrupedal species, and some <strong>were 
			able </strong>to 
			shift between these stances.<span class="auto-style93"><br />

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h3>Non-finite verb forms</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>These sort of texts often use non-finite verb forms, often 
			catenative, to set sequences of events in order, to suggest 
			causality and provide background.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style112"><strong>Having determined</strong> the most 
			useful lengths and bores of on-board cannons, the Navy Board settled 
			on six categories of cannon by the beginning of the war.<br />
			</p>
			<p class="auto-style112"><strong>Being</strong> nocturnal the animal 
			had very large light-capturing eyes and an acute sense of smell.<br />
			</p>
			<p class="auto-style112">The beer <strong>is left to ferment</strong> 
			for up to four days before being drawn off into vats.</p>
