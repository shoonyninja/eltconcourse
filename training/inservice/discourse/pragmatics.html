			<h1>Pragmatics</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="pragmatics" height="207" src="../../images/feedback310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>The first thing to get clear is the distinction between 
			pragmatics and semantics.&nbsp; It is not universally accepted that 
			there actually is a clear-cut distinction and the fields certainly 
			overlap.&nbsp; For the purposes of this guide, however, we will 
			accept that:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>semantics is the study of meaning at and below the level of 
				the sentence</li>
				<li>pragmatics is the study of utterance (written or spoken) 
				meaning</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is a separate 
			<a href="semantics.html" target="_blank">guide to semantics</a> on this site 
			(new tab) and much of that is repeated 
			here in an effort to get the concepts clear.&nbsp; The fact that 
			there is such repetition, of course, bears out the assertion that 
			the two fields overlap.<br />
			This guide will not repeat what is said there concerning lexical 
			meaning, (non)compositionality, lemmas, denotation, connotation and 
			reference etc. so if any of those terms are a mystery to you, you 
			can follow the guide to semantics before tackling this one.&nbsp; It 
			is not, however, a pre-condition for understanding what 
			follows.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Use and Usage<br />
					Signification and Value</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The distinction here is between <strong>sentence</strong> meaning 
			(semantics proper) 
			and <strong>utterance</strong> meaning (the concern of pragmatics) and lies at the heart of 
			communicative language teaching.&nbsp; Take, for example, the 
			following two exchanges:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Two strangers on the street:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>A: <em>Excuse me, do you know if there's a 
				bank near here?</em></li>
					<li>B: <em>Yes, there's one just around the next 
				corner.&nbsp; Turn right there.</em></li>
					<li>A: <em>Thanks.</em></li>
					<li>B: <em>No problem.</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Two strangers in the street:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>A: <em>William Butler Yeats wrote a poem 
				called The Cloths of Heaven.</em></li>
					<li>B: <em>Asphodel 
				grows widely in southern Greece and is a plant I'm very fond of.</em></li>
					<li>A: <em>My name is Mary and I'm an 
				accountant.</em></li>
					<li>B: <em>The speed of sound in dry air at 20Â°C is 
					approximately 343 metres per second.</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In exchange 1. real communication has taken place.&nbsp; In other 
			words, the utterances of the two speakers carry <strong>
			communicative value</strong> in terms of the message.&nbsp; 
			Widdowson and others refer to this as <strong>language use</strong>.<br />
			In exchange 2. on the other hand, no communication of any value has 
			taken place.&nbsp; We, and both speakers, are able to understand the 
			meaning of what is said (i.e., its <strong>significance</strong>) 
			but there is no communicative <strong>value</strong> in the utterances.&nbsp; This is
			<strong>language usage</strong>, not use.</p>
			<p>For slightly more, see the guide to semantics (linked above and 
			below).</p>

			<p>This, again, is repetition of what is in the guide to semantics, 
			with a different example.<br />
			If you hear:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			There's a fire in the living room</em><br />
			you may put a number of interpretations on the sentence depending on 
			the relationship you have with the speaker, your current position, 
			your current state of knowledge and so on.</p>
		
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Take the sentence at face value as a piece of information</strong></dt>
			<dd>In this case, you are focused on the <strong>locutionary force</strong> 
			of what you have heard and are now aware that there is a fire in the 
			living room â no more, no less.&nbsp; You may, of course, have also 
			processed the noun <em>fire</em> and understood what kind of fire is 
			meant here.&nbsp; You have interpreted the 
			sentence meaning.<br />
			Another way of saying this is that you have understood the <strong>
			propositional content </strong>of what has been said.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Take it that the speaker has something important to 
			communicate</strong></dt>
			<dd>If you understand what you have heard to mean, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick, get the fire extinguisher and phone the fire brigade!</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please go and sit there.&nbsp; It's warmer than here and you'll be 
			more comfortable</em><br />
			then you are focused on the <strong>illocutionary force</strong>, i.e., the meaning intended or the meaning perceived &ndash; the 
			utterance meaning.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Do something</strong></dt>
			<dd>If, on hearing the statement, you immediately telephone the fire 
			brigade or go to the living room and get warm and comfortable, you 
			have demonstrated the <strong>perlocutionary force</strong>.&nbsp; This 
			refers to the fact that an utterance like this may actually produce 
			a reaction in the hearer.</dd>

			</table>
			<p>What we understand from an utterance lies at the heart of 
			pragmatics rather than semantics and is determined by:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the nature of the hearer / reader</li>
				<li>the intentions that person has concerning the exchange</li>
				<li>the context in which something is heard or read (this may be 
				referred to as the person's ontology: the set of concepts and 
				categories which make up that person's understanding of the 
				world).</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">For example, on hearing:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me the gun!</em><br />
			what is understood may vary depending on:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The nature of the hearer:<br />
				If the hearer is a fellow gunsmith, the utterance may be 
				interpreted as a simple imperative and will probably be complied 
				with as part of the normal working day.<br />
				If the hearer is a violent criminal being addressed by an armed 
				police officer, the utterance will also be perceived as an 
				imperative but one which implies a threat of being shot.<br />
				If the hearer is another child, the utterance may be interpreted 
				as a request for cooperation in a game.<br />
				If the hearer is a non-speaker of English, the utterance may 
				simply be understood as something said with no meaning attached.</li>
				<li>The intentions of the hearer:<br />
				If the hearer intends to be cooperative, the utterance may be 
				interpreted as a simple request.<br />
				If the hearer intends to be non-co-operative, the utterance may 
				be interpreted as a threat or an indication of aggression.</li>
				<li>The context:<br />
				If the context is a stand-off in the street between a police 
				officer and a woman with a gun, the utterance may constitute a 
				threat or a command.<br />
				If the context is a shooting competition in a gun club, the 
				utterance may constitute a simple request.<br />
				If the context is that of a carpenter at work, the utterance may 
				constitute a request for someone to hand over a machine for 
				driving in nails.</li>

					<h2>Gricean maxims</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This section is again repeated in the guide to semantics but is 
			extended here later to see what is meant and what the implications 
			are.&nbsp; A version of what follows appears in the guide to semantics 
			but this guide will return to the maxims set out below after a short 
			diversion into pragmatics theory.</p>
			<p>Herbert Paul Grice's work is relevant to the teaching of language 
			using any communicative approach.<br />
			If one starts from the premise that utterances have some kind of 
			illocutionary force, i.e., an intended meaning which the hearer 
			understands, we need to know something about the principles at work 
			which allow the meaning to be understood.<br />
			Grice's work is not, of course, without its critics so the following 
			is, at best, the theory, at worst, simply a hypothesis.<br />
			There 
			are four main maxims which determine how interactions proceed.&nbsp; 
			Overriding all four is the Cooperative Principle.&nbsp; In Grice's 
			words, this is:</p>
			<p class="auto-style5"><em>Make your contribution such as it is 
			required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose 
			or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.<br />
			</em>
			<span class="smallfont">(Grice 1989: 26)</span></p>
			<p>The four maxims we follow to achieve this are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>THE MAXIM OF QUALITY:<ol class="redbullet">
					<li>Don't say what you believe to be false.</li>
					<li>Don't say things for which you have no evidence.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>THE MAXIM OF QUANTITY:<ol class="redbullet">
					<li>Be informative enough.</li>
					<li>Don't over-inform.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>THE MAXIM OF RELATION:<ol class="redbullet">
					<li>Be relevant.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>THE MAXIM OF MANNER:<ol class="redbullet">
					<li>Avoid obscurity.</li>
					<li>Avoid ambiguity.</li>
					<li>Be brief.</li>
					<li>Be orderly.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is no implication here that Grice was suggesting that this 
			is how people <em>ought</em> to communicate with one another, in 
			terms of giving advice.&nbsp; The hypothesis is, on the other hand, 
			that speakers proceed in communication <em>as if </em>they were 
			applying the 4 maxims.</p>
			<p>In order to understand how Gricean maxims affect communication 
			(and therefore, be able to teach and present language naturally) we 
			need to understand three key ideas.</p>

			<p>Now that we have, so to speak, cleared a few conceptual decks, we 
			can consider three key ideas that lie at the heart of both semantics 
			and pragmatics.&nbsp; The first two of these are usually taken to be 
			semantic issues but, for the purposes of language teaching, we need 
			not be too prescriptive in dividing semantics from pragmatics.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Entailment is to do with the truth of propositions.</p>
			<p>Consider this simple sentence:</p>

			<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'para1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have an answer</a>.</p>
			<p id="para1" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">Only sentence 3. cannot be true if sentence A is true because

			<p>To show entailment, we have to see that sentence A cannot be true 
			if sentence 3. is true and that, conversely, sentence 3. cannot be 
			true if sentence A is true.<br />
			If sentence A is true then sentences 1., 2., 4., 5., and 6. are all 
			true.&nbsp; If any of those second-level sentences is false, for 
			example, that Peter and Mary don't have a garden, that no peacock

			</table>
			<p>Implicature is different.&nbsp; It means that the truth of one 
			sentence implies the truth of another but does not require it.</p>
			<p>Here's our example sentence:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style10" >
				<li><em>Mary smoked a cigarette outside the theatre</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>We can have a number of entailed sentences here, such as:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style9">
				<li><em>There is a person called Mary</em></li>
				<li><em>A cigarette was smoked by Mary</em></li>
				<li><em>Mary was outside the theatre</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>etc.<br />
			and if i., ii., or iii., is not true, then sentence a. cannot be 
			true.</p>
			<p>However, the following sentences are not entailed, they are implications:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Mary did not smoke a cigarette inside the theatre</em> 
				(she may have done, but the implication is that she didn't).</li>
				<li><em>Mary smoked a cigar</em> (that sentence or its negation 
				does not affect the truth of sentence a. although the implication 
				is that she smoked a cigarette, not a cigar.&nbsp; She may have 
				smoked both, of course.)</li>
				<li><em>Mary didn't smoke two cigarettes </em>(but she may 
				have).</li>

			</table>
			<p><strong>Implicature can be cancelled but

			For example, if we say:<br />

			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary smoked a cigarette outside the theatre

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary smoked a cigarette outside the theatre and then another 
			when she went in</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary smoked a cigarette outside the theatre and then

			<p>Implication is also, of course, at work in conjunction with 
			Grice's maxims.&nbsp; If we take an exchange such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: <em>I have a letter to post</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: <em>There's a box over the road</em><br />
			we have to form some understanding of what the speakers are implying 
			and to do that we unconsciously use Grice's maxims alongside our 
			knowledge of the world (sometimes referred to as encyclopaedic 
			knowledge).&nbsp; We assume, therefore:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style10">
				<li>That A's statement is not simply intended to inform B of a 
				random fact.&nbsp; It needs to be interpreted as some kind of 
				request for information from B concerning where to put the 
				letter.&nbsp; This adheres to the maxim of quantity because B 
				assumes that A is not over-informing.&nbsp; There is, therefore, 
				a communicative purpose (or value) in what A has said.<br />
				B will also assume that A is telling the truth about the letter, 
				adhering to the maxim of quality.</li>
				<li>That B's statement concerning a box refers to a post box, 
				not a cardboard box of cat food.&nbsp; This adheres to the maxim 
				of relation because A assumes that B's information is relevant 
				to what has been said and true (quality again).&nbsp; It is also 
				evidence of the speakers' and our knowledge of the world because 
				we can relate what happens to letters with where to put them.</li>
				<li>Both speakers are engaged in a sensible effort to

			</ol>
			<p>It is difficult, but not unimaginably so, to interpret the 
			exchange differently so the analysis of pragmatics involves a 
			certain interpretation on our part.&nbsp; Unlike grammar, there are 
			no strict rules to types of exchanges and what they could mean.&nbsp; 
			Nevertheless, we can and do make reasonable assumptions about what 
			speakers intend.</p>

			<p>Presupposition is also different from entailment.&nbsp; With 
			presupposition, a truth is taken for granted in what one says.&nbsp; 
			Presupposition is, therefore akin to implicature.</p>
			<p>Here, the example sentence is:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style11">
				<li><em>The garden shed fell down in the storm</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The presupposition here is that there is or was a shed in the 
			garden that was standing upright.&nbsp; The entailment (or one of 
			them) is:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>The garden shed is no longer standing</em><br />
				but if we say</li>
				<li><em>The garden shed is standing upright</em><br />
				then sentence I. must be false</li>
			</ol>
			<p>However, if we say:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style11" start="2">
				<li><em>The shed didn't fall down in the storm</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is no longer an entailed sense that the shed is standing 
			upright or not because</p>
			<ol class="auto-style10">
				<li>The garden shed may be standing, having survived the storm</li>
				<li>The garden shed may have fallen down for another reason and 
				not be standing</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Presupposition survives the negation of the sentence but 
			entailment does not.</p>
			<p>Presuppositions, like implicatures, can, of course, be cancelled 
			so we can have:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style10" start="3">
				<li><em>The shed didn't fall down in the storm â it was the 
				earthquake that did for it</em></li>
			</ol>

			<p>Now that we understand a little about entailment, implication and

			maxims to the kinds of language we present to students in our 
			classrooms.</p>
			<p>The first point to remember is that Grice's maxims and the 
			phenomena of entailment, implication and presupposition are not 
			confined to English.&nbsp; All languages work this way.</p>

			<p>While the exercise of imagination in classrooms is arguably 
			motivating and engaging, there has to be a limit and a point in 
			which reality intrudes or we will not be preparing our learners for 
			communication in the real world.&nbsp; This is the whole point, of 
			course, of personalisation of the target language or skill which we 
			are practising.<br />
			For example, forcing a role on a learner which is wholly out of step 
			with his or her real characteristics will lead to all kinds of 
			implications, entailments and presuppositions which will not reflect the reality 
			in which we hope the learner will be able to use English accurately 
			and effectively for communication.<br />
			For example, one website offering teachers materials and ideas for 
			use in class suggests that a role play involving arguments between 
			neighbours</p>
			<p class="auto-style5" style="width: 646px"><em>can be as absurd or 
			ridiculous as the studentsâ want, as long as they are speaking and 
			using the language correctly</em><br />
			<span class="smallfont">https://busyteacher.org (apostrophe misuse 
			in the original)</span></p>
			<p>This ignores the fact that most learners will never find 
			themselves in anything like this kind of situation and will be using 
			language and taking on roles which have no possible relevance to 
			them.&nbsp; They will not, of course, be '<span class="style_black"><em>using the language 
			correctly</em></span>' because the whole exercise is based on usage rather than 
			use.&nbsp; Making something '<span class="style_black"><em>absurd or ridiculous</em></span>' may entertain but 
			will result in entailments and presuppositions which bear no 
			relationship to the real worlds of the learners.<br />
			MORAL: we need to match the roles our learners are expected to take 
			on in classrooms to the real roles they must or may have to assume 
			outside the classroom.</p>

			<p>Cultural issues play a part here but the construction of natural 
			language, whether written or spoken, depends partly at least on 
			knowing what and how much information to include and, crucially, who 
			should supply it.&nbsp; For example, here's a dialogue intended to 
			practise the present perfect and past simple forms:</p>
			<p class="auto-style12"><span class="style_black">A: <em>Have you 
			ever been to Paris?</em><br />
			B: <em>Yes, I have.</em><br />
			A: <em>When did you go?</em><br />
			B: <em>I went last year.</em></span></p>
			<p>The problems with this are at least:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We almost never ask a question in English without giving a 
				reason for asking (unless it's obvious), so the first line is 
				not informative enough and might more usefully be<br />
				<em>I'm thinking about taking a weekend break.&nbsp; Have you 
				ever been to Paris?</em></li>
				<li>The response to the question is also not informative enough 
				so a better version might be<br />
				<em>Yes, I have.&nbsp; I went last year for a long weekend.&nbsp; 
				What do you want to know?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Notice that the structural focus remains.&nbsp; All that has 
			changed is making the dialogue fit with basic conversational maxims.<br />
			MORAL 1: make example dialogues realistic.<br />
			MORAL 2: avoid presenting a travesty of communication.</p>

				<li>A: <em>I want my living room redecorated before Christmas.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In these cases, A's second comments can only be relevant in one

			<p>As an example for this, consider the following coordinated 
			clauses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>He sold his house and lived in Florida on the money</em></li>
				<li><em>Her name is Michelle and her father's called Harry</em></li>
				<li><em>He went into the garden and started digging</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In sentence 1., we have the coordinator <em>and</em> used to 
			express a number of meanings:<br />
			Implication A: <em>he sold his house in order to be able to live in 
			Florida</em><br />
			Implication B:<em> he could not have afforded to live in Florida if 
			he had not sold his house</em><br />
			Presupposition: <em>he owned his own house</em><br />
			Entailment A: <em>he sold his house <span class="style_underline">
			before</span> he went to live in Florida<br />
			</em>Entailment B:<em> he went to live in Florida
			<span class="style_underline">after</span> he sold his house<br />
			</em>Reversing the clauses makes no sense, therefore:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*He lived in Florida on the money and sold his house</em></p>
			<p>In sentence 2. the coordinator works simply to attach the ideas 
			to each other and the meaning could just as well be expressed in 
			reverse:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her father's called Harry and her name is Michelle</em><br />
			so there is no implication of reason, no entailment of event 
			ordering and no presupposition.</p>
			<p>In sentence 3 we have slightly different meanings:<br />
			Implication: <em>he went into the garden in order to dig</em> (which 
			could be cancelled if we add <em>because he didn't know what else to 
			do</em>)<br />
			Presupposition: <em>it was his garden</em> (which can be cancelled 
			if we follow the sentence with <em>and later he got in his car and 
			went home to his own garden</em>)<br />
			Entailment A: <em>he went into the garden
			<span class="style_underline">before</span> he started digging</em><br />
			Entailment B: <em>he started digging <span class="style_underline">
			after</span> he went into the garden</em><br />
			Because of the entailments, reversing the clauses produces nonsense:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He started digging and went into the garden.</em></p>
			<p>Entailments are everywhere in language.&nbsp; Consider, as 
			another two examples, these sentences in which the entailment can be made clear by 
			pictorial clues:</p>
			<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style13">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style14" style="width: 300px">
					<img alt="cycling" height="166" src="../../images/two_cycling250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style15" style="width: 300px">

				</tr>
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style17" style="width: 300px"><em>They were 
					cycling in the park when they met.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style16" style="width: 300px"><em>He was 
					cycling to work when he fell on the ice and broke his leg.</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In the example on the left, the entailment is:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meeting did not interrupt the cycling</em><br />
			In the example on the right, the entailment is:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; falling off put an end to the cycling</em></p>
			<p>MORAL: Don't let your learners assume that coordination is simple 
			addition or that tense use always implies the same relationship 
			between events.&nbsp; In more general terms, be alert for hidden 
			entailments in language.&nbsp; They are almost always there.</p>

					<h2>Checking</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are times in classrooms when we need to check our learners' 
			understanding (or lack of it) of what we have said or presented / 
			practised.<br />
			We do this frequently by asking questions:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>instruction-checking questions (to discover if our 
				instruction has been understood)</li>
				<li>concept-checking questions (to discover if the meaning of 
				the language is clear rather than just its form)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In both cases, we need to bear entailment in mind and avoid 
			asking questions which rely on implication or presupposition.&nbsp; 
			For example,</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>If you want to check that the instruction to work in pairs 
				has been understood, you can ask:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li><em>How are you going to do this?</em><br />
					but that requires a <strong>presupposition</strong> that the 
					question refers to alone or with a partner and could equally 
					be understood another way (<em>I'm working hard, I'm working 
					in writing</em> etc.)<br />
					A better question might, therefore, be:</li>
					<li><em>Who is your partner for this?</em><br />
					because that <strong>entails</strong> the fact that it is 
					pair work.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If you want to check a concept, the same considerations 
				apply so a question such as:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li><em>What time was his action?</em><br />
					is open to a number of interpretations depending on the 
					learner's understanding of the <strong>implication</strong> 
					(<em>at 4 o'clock, after his brother came home, when he 
					finished breakfast</em> etc.).<br />
					A better question will involve entailment so might be:</li>
					<li><em>Does the sentence refer to the present or the past?</em><br />
					because only one of these can now be true.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
