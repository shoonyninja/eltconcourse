			<h1>Paragraphs</h1>

			<img alt="paragraph" height="207" src="../../images/paragraph_point310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>At all levels of mastery of the language, except, perhaps, the 
			very lowest, teachers are often concerned to train their learners in 
			how to write an acceptable, cohesive and persuasive paragraph.<br />
			This is what this guide concerns.</p>

			<p class="nomarginbottom">Originally, the word paragraph referred to 
			the mark which sets off a section of a text from other parts of it 
			and only later did the word come to refer to the section of the text 
			itself.<br />
			Nowadays, we might define a paragraph as:</p>
			<p class="auto-style2">a distinct part of a text relating to a 
			particular point</p>
			<p class="auto-style3">and there are two things to notice in that 
			definition:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A paragraph is a <strong>distinct</strong> part.<br />
				These days, the identification of a paragraph is generally 
				achieved in one of two ways (which are often combined):<ol class="auto-style1">
					<li>by indenting the first line only</li>
					<li>by inserting a wider space between the section and the 
					rest of the text than is normal between lines of the text</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>A paragraph relates to a <strong>particular</strong> point.<br />
				To serve its purpose well, in English, a 
				paragraph is concerned to address one point among many and all 
				its components, in English at least, should be relevant to that 
				point and no other.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Kaplan, whom we shall meet again, includes the following citation 
			in a paper on paragraph organisation across cultures:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Paragraph divisions signal to the reader that 
			the material so set off constitutes a unit of thought. For the 
			reader this marking off of the whole composition into segments is a 
			convenience, though not a strict necessity. ... Since communication 
			of one's thought is at best a difficult business, it is the part of 
			common sense (not to mention good manners) to mark for the reader 
			the divisions of one's thought and thus make the thought structure 
			visible upon the page. ...<br />
			Paragraphing, obviously, can be of help to the reader only if the 
			indicated paragraphs are genuine units of thought. ... For a 
			paragraph undertakes to discuss one topic or one aspect of a topic.<br />

			<p>Here's a typical paragraph taken from an encyclopedia and intended as 
			part of an information report:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The earliest examples of a conventional use of 
			written symbols are on clay tablets discovered in various parts of 
			the Middle East and south-east Europe from around 3500 B.C.&nbsp; 
			Large numbers of tablets made by the Sumerians have been found in 
			sites around the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates in present-day Iraq and 
			Iran.&nbsp; For example, on tablets from the city state of Uruk, 
			about 1500 symbols have been listed, most of them abstract in 
			character.&nbsp; They seem to have recorded such matters as land 
			sales, business transactions, and tax accounts.<br />
			<span class="auto-style14">(Crystal, 1987:196)</span></p>
			<p>and here are some notes concerning what makes this paragraph a 
			good example of its kind:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It has a clear topic sentence which comes first in the 
				paragraph and directs the reader to what is to follow.&nbsp; We 
				instantly know that this paragraph will concern<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earliest 
				examples of a conventional use of written symbols</em></span><br />
				and, very importantly, <strong>nothing else</strong>.<br />
				That phrase constitutes the subject of the verb <em>are</em> and 
				is connected to a complex prepositional phrase (<span class="style_black"><em>on 
				clay tablets discovered in various parts of the Middle East and 
				south-east Europe from around 3500 B.C.</em></span>) 
				post-modifying the noun phrase, <span class="style_black"><em>
				clay tablets</em></span>.&nbsp; It is the theme of the first 
				sentence and the theme, indeed, of the whole paragraph.</li>
				<li>The rheme of the first sentence has been set up as <em>clay 
				tablets</em> and this rheme forms the theme of the next 
				sentence, <span class="style_black"><em>Large numbers of tablets 
				made by the Sumerians</em></span>, being raised to the patient position of a passive 
				voice clause with the verb phrase <span class="style_black"><em>
				have been found</em></span>.</li>
				<li>The final two sentences continue this pattern of theme and 
				rheme structures with the tablets, or a pronoun referring to 
				them, as the subjects (in this case, topical themes) of both 
				sentences.</li>
				<li>The sequence of information in the paragraph forms a 
				recognisable pattern which is duplicated in many other texts of 
				this nature.&nbsp; The pattern is:<ol class="auto-style1">
					<li>Topic: theme</li>
					<li>Where found: locative data</li>
					<li>Example: to concretise the description</li>
					<li>Description</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The writer has selected a rather narrowly defined shell noun 
				in this case: <span class="style_black"><em>tablets</em></span>.&nbsp; A shell noun, as its name suggests, 
				encapsulates a larger thought so instead of having to repeat<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clay tablets 
				discovered in various parts of the Middle East and south-east 
				Europe from around 3500 B.C</em></span><br />
				each time the subject is needed, the writer can just refer to
				<em><span class="style_black">the tablets</span>  </em>and later, 
				that can be reduced further to the simple pronoun <em>
				<span class="style_black">they</span>.<br />
				</em>(The writer could have selected a different and more 
				generalised shell noun such as <em>artefact</em>, but chose not 
				to.)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once we have done this sort of analysis of a paragraph in 
			English, we can apply it repeatedly to many other paragraphs in this 
			and other genres.&nbsp; For example, it is readily apparent that 
			this paragraph, taken from a text on a very different subject:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The young man had come on impressively in the years since he was 
			playing marbles with pundibs and marvelling at the intricate beauty 
			of pound stones.&nbsp; He had done tolerably well at school &ndash; 
			though considering his family's poverty, there was no thought that 
			he might go on to university.&nbsp; He had an apparent aptitude for 
			geometry, he could draw adequately, and he had a fascination for the 
			rocks among which he lived.&nbsp; His diary and his memoirs record 
			his growing eagerness to understand what was going on beneath the 
			green of the Oxfordshire meadowlands.<br />
			<span class="auto-style14">(Winchester, 2002:56)</span></p>
			<p>follows a similar pattern with the topic of the paragraph 
			realised in the first noun phrase, <span class="style_black"><em>The 
			young man</em></span> (in which the use of the definite article 
			alerts the reader to whom the writing is about and in this case, 
			that is the subject of the whole book).<br />
			The difference here is that the theme is maintained throughout the 
			first three sentences before a rheme (<span class="style_black"><em>fascination 
			for the rocks</em></span>) is taken up as the theme of the final 
			sentence concerning his diary and memoirs.&nbsp; The terms
			<span class="style_black"><em>fascination</em></span> and
			<span class="style_black"><em>eagerness to understand</em></span> 
			function as synonyms in this paragraph.<br />
			A second difference is that the prepositional clauses concern times 
			rather than places but that is still the same kind of patterning we 
			saw in the first paragraph from Crystal.<br />
			We also have, as did Crystal, exemplification of the points being 
			made about the growing maturity of the subject.<br />
			(Should you be wondering, pundibs, which boys used for marbles, are 
			small fossilised animals like clams and pound stones were fossilised 
			sea urchins which people often used as pound weights.)</p>
			<p>We can take almost any book intended to inform the reader and 
			open it at random to discover many more examples of this kind of 
			patterning.</p>
			<p>Even in unrelated genres (such as narratives) the same sort of 
			patterning can often be discerned.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">With sensibly trimmed, unvarnished fingernails, Yvonne is sliding 
			a wad of press photographs at them across the oval table.&nbsp; In 
			the foreground, half a dozen burley young men in Armani-type suits 
			are congratulating a victorious racehorse, champagne glasses aloft 
			for the camera.&nbsp; In the background, advertisers' hoardings in 
			Cyrillic and English.&nbsp; And far left, arms folded across his 
			chest, the baby-faced bodyguard with his neatly shaven blond head.&nbsp; 
			Unlike his three companions, he wears no dark glasses.&nbsp; But on 
			his left wrist he wears a bracelet of gold links.<br />
			<span class="auto-style14">(le Carr&eacute;, 2010:15)</span></p>
			<p>and here, the topic sentence sets up the protagonist of the scene 
			(<em><span class="style_black">Yvonne</span>) </em>and introduces 
			the rheme,<em> <span class="style_black">a wad of photographs</span></em>, 
			which will form the theme of the rest of the paragraph with 
			the descriptions of what they contain.<br />
			We also have the same data we saw in the other two examples 
			concerning places in this case (<span class="style_black"><em>In the 
			background, far left, on his left wrist</em></span>).</p>
			<p>To sum up, then, the following are the usual positive characteristics of a 
			paragraph in English:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A paragraph is identifiable from the layout of a text</li>
				<li>A paragraph contains a single topic</li>
				<li>A paragraph will identify the topic in the first sentence 
				(often in the first noun phrase)</li>
				<li>A paragraph will contain exemplification and description of 
				the topic</li>
				<li>A paragraph will contain data about the topic (times and / or places, 
				frequently)</li>
				<li>A paragraph will proceed in a predictable fashion: <strong>Topic &rarr; 
				Data &rarr; Example &rarr; Description</strong> (although the 
				ordering of Example and Description may be reversed).&nbsp; In 
				other words, English paragraphs are linear.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and a paragraph will not:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>contain data irrelevant to its topic</li>
				<li>contain exemplification except of its 
				topic</li>
				<li>contain digressions or parenthetical 
				comments unrelated to its topic</li>
			</ol>

			<p>So far, so simple.<br />
			So, if learners of English can write a cohesive paragraph in their 
			own language, presumably they will be able to do so in English, 
			won't they?<br />
			Unfortunately, not so.</p>
			<p>Back in the 1960s, in a seminal and oft-cited paper, Robert 
			Kaplan related his findings after having carefully examined approximately 
			600 essays written by non-native speakers of English and arrived at this 
			conclusion:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">A fallacy of some repute and some duration is 
			the one which assumes that because a student can write an adequate 
			essay in his native language, he can necessarily write an adequate 
			essay in a second language. ... Foreign students who have mastered 
			syntactic structures have still demonstrated inability to compose 
			adequate themes, term papers, theses, and dissertations. Instructors 
			have written, on foreign-student papers, such comments as: "The 
			material is all here, but it seems somehow out of focus," or "Lacks 
			organization," or "Lacks cohesion." And these comments are 
			essentially accurate. The foreign-student paper is out of focus 
			because the foreign student is employing a rhetoric and a sequence 
			of thought which violate the expectations of the native reader.<br />
			<span class="auto-style14">(Kaplan, ibid)</span></p>
			<p>In the analysis so far done above in this guide, we have repeatedly 
			used the phrase <em>in English</em> to reflect that fact that 
			readers of English do have quite clear expectations of how a 
			paragraph should be organised, what it should contain and how it 
			should be written.&nbsp; Violating these expectations leads to mis- 
			or incomprehension at worst, a negative response at best.<br />
			</p>
			<p>Kaplan was concerned, it should be emphasised, not to investigate 
			the overall structure of a stretch of discourse (the field of genre 
			analysis which is considered elsewhere on this site, links below), 
			but to look at how a range of different languages and language 
			families approach the structure of a paragraph.<br />
			This is what he found:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Arabic and other Semitic languages:<br />
				In these, the paragraph is based on a complex series of parallel 
				constructions, both positive and negative.<br />
				Kaplan provides exemplification from The King James Bible 
				(because that was a translation of an ancient Semitic text) and 
				identifies four different sorts of parallelism:<ol class="auto-style1">
					<li>Synonymous Parallelism: synonymous expressions repeating 
					points connected by coordination.</li>
					<li>Synthetic Parallelism: completing and idea raised in the 
					first part in a later part of the paragraph.</li>
					<li>Antithetic Parallelism: contrasting an idea raised in 
					the first part in a later part of the paragraph with its 
					opposite.</li>
					<li>Climactic Parallelism: stating facts upon fact without 
					discussion or exemplification leading up to a statement of a 
					thesis.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Korean and Chinese:<br />
				Kaplan identifies here an approach to a paragraph which he 
				describes as <span class="style_black"><em>an approach by 
				indirection</em></span>.&nbsp; Here, he describes how a 
				paragraph's contents do not address its topic directly but 
				circle it, viewing it from various angles, making generalised 
				statements rather than providing data about the topic itself.&nbsp; 
				Only at the end and at the expense of some backtracking is the 
				reader able to identify the relevance of the generalisations.</li>
				<li>Romance languages and Russian:<br />
				Kaplan identifies the tolerance of considerable digression and 
				irrelevance in the writing of speakers of these languages both 
				when operating in their own language and in English.&nbsp; Such 
				digressions are not permitted in the construction of a paragraph 
				in English or will, at least, irritate the reader and possibly 
				obscure the writer's intention.<br />
				In Russian, in particular, Kaplan exemplifies long digressions, 
				often taking up the majority of the paragraph, which will strike the 
				English reader as irrelevant and obscure 
				the writer's meaning.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Kaplan summarises his points in this well-known diagram (op. 
			cit.:21):<br />
			<img alt="kaplan" height="135" src="../../imagesgraphics/kaplan.jpg" width="465" /><br />
			So, no, learners cannot be expected to know instinctively how to 
			write a paragraph even if they have mastered the grammar and lexis 
			of English to a high level.<br />
			Most learners, especially adults, will assume that the structures of 
			their first languages will be reflected in the structures of a 
			second language unless explicit information is given to the 
			contrary.</p>

		</table>
			<p>Kaplan's conclusion was that we have a duty not only to teach the 
			structures and syntax of the language but also to embark on some 
			comparative rhetorical analysis, setting the paragraph structures of 
			the learners' first language(s) alongside that of English and 
			identifying the differences.</p>
			<p>In terms of alerting learners to the way in which good paragraphs 
			are constructed in English, Kaplan suggests two approaches:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Ordering cut-up paragraphs to raise awareness of the nature 
				of topic sentences, themes and rhemes and so on.</li>
				<li>Providing skeleton outlines to encourage learners to write a 
				paragraph in which the ordering of items is clear.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To that, naturally, we can add other techniques such as inserting 
			a rogue digression in an otherwise acceptable paragraph for learners 
			to identify and, crucially, explain why it is a rogue, or getting 
			learners to identify the theme in the topic sentence and its rheme 
			which forms a later theme.<br />
			We can also indulge in a little cooperative language analysis with 
			our learners, identifying the structure of a well-formed English 
			paragraph (see above) and then set them the task of writing a 
			parallel text on a different topic.</p>
			<p>Because learners of English are usually not concerned to write 
			narratives, we can focus our efforts on the kinds of texts that they 
			are likely to need to write such as discussions, information 
			reports, procedures and so on in which most paragraphs will follow a 
			very similar organisational structure.<br />
			For more on the overall structure of such texts, see the guide to 
			genre, linked below.</p>
			<p>However we choose to approach this area of our teaching, starting 
			with an understanding that there is something <strong>worth</strong> teaching is a 
			good beginning.</p>
