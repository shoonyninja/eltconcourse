		<h2>The context of culture</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Culture plays a very significant role in how people choose to 
			communicate with each other as you may have discovered if you have 
			been to country whose culture is so far removed from your own that 
			you find it almost impossible to understand what people are doing 
			and saying.&nbsp; This is not only a linguistic issue because within 
			cultures there are systems of meanings and mutually understood ways 
			of behaving which to others are simply alien and impenetrable.<br />
			This cultural knowledge grows more sophisticated and complete as we 
			grow up and children may often break the rules.&nbsp; Adults, after 
			a period of intense socialisation usually apply the rules of their 
			culture unconsciously.</p>
			<p>However, culture varies in two ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Synchronically</strong><br />
				<img alt="nets" height="133" src="../../images/two_nets200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Cultures around the world and the languages they use have 
				enormous variations in how texts are constructed and how social, 
				spoken communication takes place.<br />
				In some, for example, deference towards elders and authority is 
				encoded in terms of address, the sorts of verbs which are 
				allowable and even the nouns one uses.<br />
				In others, power distance is much narrower and terms of address 
				rarely used.&nbsp; In the USA and the UK, for example, it is 
				quite common for banks to address customers in email messages 
				and on websites using the customer's first names.&nbsp; Such an 
				approach is completely unthinkable (literally) in many other 
				cultures in which a respectful attitude is a social imperative.<br />
				Languages reflect the society in which they develop and change 
				and reflect the needs of their speakers.&nbsp; In some cultures, 
				for example, a clear distinction is made between the names for and the forms of address one uses with maternally or 
				paternally related people so there is a distinction between 
				grandmother as the mother of my mother and grandmother as the 
				mother of my father.&nbsp; In other cultures, no difference at 
				all is made between the words describing what in English are 
				signalled by the words <em>brother, sister</em> and <em>cousin</em> 
				and English has no way of distinguishing a male from a female 
				cousin, slightly unusually.<br />
				Such differences do not arise randomly &ndash; they are the 
				product of, usually, many hundreds of years of language change 
				and development.</li>
				<li><strong>Diachronically</strong><br />
				<img alt="old young" height="133" src="../../images/old_young200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				It will not be a surprise to you, whatever culture you inhabit 
				and whatever language you speak at home to discover that 
				languages vary over time.<br />
				Ways of expression which were once conventional and often almost 
				compulsory change over time as do the ways in which we 
				communicate with each other.&nbsp; Each innovation (text 
				messaging, emails, online video chats, virtual meetings and so 
				on) brings with it a change in the form and structure of the 
				language we use.<br />
				For example, two editions of the same newspaper separated by as 
				little as 20 years when put side by side are instantly 
				recognisable by people in the culture in which they were 
				produced and easily assigned to the decades in which they were 
				written.<br />
				Dialogue in a movie made 50 years ago and one made last year 
				will also be recognisably different to people in the culture 
				because the topics, the forms of address and the language 
				structures themselves are phenomena which betray their vintage.<br />
				We have been careful here to refer to <strong>people in the 
				culture</strong> because, of course, people from other cultures 
				may not be at all sensitive to such changes.&nbsp; For them, 
				it's all foreign anyway.&nbsp; Most learners of English, for 
				example, would have no way to distinguish between a letter from 
				a landlord written 50 years ago and one written yesterday.</li>

		</table>
			<p>The context of situation is nested within the context of culture 
			and is the determining factor in how any text, spoken or written, is 
			the way it is.<br />
			A conversation between two friends on a riverside bench will be very 
			differently structured from, say, an encounter with a police officer 
			regarding your witnessing a traffic accident.<br />
			Equally, a letter expressing a complaint about a service received 
			from a shop and one inviting friends to a party will be very 
			differently set out and use completely different language 
			structures, lexical resources and layout.&nbsp; In the latter case, 
			too, the medium (probably email or a text message) will differ from 
			the former (which may even be <em>via</em> old-fashioned postal 
			services).</p>
			<p>The context of situation, then, consists of three parts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>The field</strong><ol class="auto-style85">
					<li>What is the topic?</li>
					<li>What do the participants want to achieve?</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>The tenor</strong><ol class="auto-style85">
					<li>Who is speaking to whom?</li>
					<li>What is their relationship?</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>The Mode</strong><ol class="auto-style85">
					<li>How is communication happening?</li>
					<li>How is coherence maintained?</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>The field</strong> is described as the <strong>
			experiential meaning</strong> of the text because it refers to the 
			world outside the language users themselves and their experiences of 
			it.<br />
			<strong>The Tenor</strong> is described as the <strong>interpersonal 
			meaning</strong> of the text because it refers to the participants 
			in the exchange.<br />
			<strong>The Mode</strong> is described as the <strong>textual 
			meaning</strong> because it relates to the type of text that is 
			being made and how it will be used or transmitted.</p>
			<p>Diagrammatically, it looks like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="ftm" height="379" src="../../imagesgraphics/field_tenor_mode_3.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>To take our two example situations above, the situation looks

			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>Pose questions (or not)</li>
				<li>Use verbs concerning behaviours or relationships between

				<li>Express circumstances or time, place, angle and contingency 
				(or not)</li>
				<li>Use appropriate tense forms</li>
				<li>Refer to shared information outside the text (or not)</li>
				<li>Maintain formal textual cohesion (or not)</li>
				<li>Structure what they say or write chronologically or by theme</li>
				<li>Use politeness and distancing strategies (or not)</li>

		<p>How much can you remember?&nbsp; 
		<a href="genrehp.htm">Click here 
		for a test</a> before we go on.</p>
			<p>There may, of course, be subgenres within these categories so, 
			for example, you may read a news report in a newspaper which happens 
			to be a kind of recount and follows the same pattern as most 
			recounts.&nbsp; On the other hand, some news reports are Information 
			reports because they do not recount a series of events but try to 
			give the facts of a matter.&nbsp; Others may be Explanations.<br />
			We may also be confronted by a blog page and will 
			need to figure out whether it's a narrative, a recount, an 
			exposition, a discussion or what so we can understand its nature and 
			know where to look for the data we need.&nbsp; We also need that 
			information to make sure it is what we are looking for.&nbsp; A page from an 
			instruction manual will usually follow the patterns of an 
			explanation but parts of it will usually be an information report 
			and so on.<br />
			Once you have identified the overarching category, we can then say 
			what subgenre the text belongs to.<br />
			If you prefer a diagram:<br />
			<img alt="summary" height="267" src="../../imagesgraphics/genres_subgenres.png" width="775" /></p>
			<p>As you can see, genres can be a characteristic of many text types 
			so, for example, a spoken or written anecdote may be a narrative or 
			it may be a simple recount.&nbsp; It may even be an information 
			report (or contain one).<br />
			Although the word genre is used quite loosely in everyday terms to 
			refer to types of literature, painting, film and so on, it is not 
			used that way here.&nbsp; None of the subcategories above 
			constitutes a genre in its own right although they may loosely be 
			described as text types.<br />
			Do not suggest, for example, that a newspaper is a genre.&nbsp; It 
			isn't because it is a collection of different sorts of texts which 
			have different generic characteristics.&nbsp; Web pages, too, do not 
			constitute a genre because we have to look at the intentions of the 
			author and the purposes of the texts to identify exactly what the 
			genre really is.</p>

		<p>This will be familiar territory if you have looked at
		the guide to spoken discourse, linked below.<br />
		You are probably familiar with the idea that the first sentence of 
		many paragraphs in written texts signals the writer's theme for the 
		paragraph.&nbsp; This is often called the <strong>topic sentence</strong>.&nbsp; 
		Consider this paragraph from a popular novel (La Plante, 2006) which is 
		an extended narrative with smaller narrative sequences inserted within 
		it, like most novels:</p>
		<p class="indentpara" ><em><span class="auto-style10">Arriving at Milan 
		airport, Anna passed through customs way behind Langton and Professor 
		Marshe.&nbsp; They seemed to be in deep conversation; he was constantly 
		bending down to listen to her, guiding her with one hand at the small 
		of her back.&nbsp; There was a familiarity about them that Anna found 
		upsetting</span></em></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			The first clause sets the scene and is 
		called the <span class="style_red">theme</span> (it's the non-finite clause,
			<em>Arriving at Milan airport</em>).&nbsp;
			The <span class="style_red">rheme</span> of that is <em>Anna passed through customs</em></li>
			<li>
			This becomes the <span class="style_red">theme</span> of the next 
			small section with the <span class="style_red">rheme</span> <em>way 
			behind Langton and Professor Marshe</em></li>
			<li>
			<em>They</em> (the two characters, Langton and Marshe) form the
			<span class="style_red">theme</span> of the next clause which has as its 
			<span class="style_red">rheme</span> <em>in deep conversation</em></li>
			<li>
			This idea forms the <span class="style_red">theme</span> of the next 
			section with the rheme <em>he was constantly bending down to listen to her, guiding her with one 
		hand at the small of her back</em></li>
			<li>
			<p>That <span class="style_red">rheme</span> becomes the next
			<span class="style_red">theme</span> (<em>a familiarity about them</em>) 
			which has as its <span class="style_red">rheme</span> <em>Anna found 
			upsetting</em>.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This is how well written 
		paragraphs hang together and guide the reader smoothly through the text.</p>
		<p>There is much more to it than this and not 
		all texts (spoken or written) will conform to such a neat structure.&nbsp; 
		It is possible, for example, for theme 1 to have rheme 1 and for that to 
		become theme 5 later in the text and so on.</p>
		<p>Theme-rheme structures can look nice and tidy, like this:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="theme and rheme" height="207" src="../../imagesgraphics/theme_rheme.png" width="310" /></p>
		<p>or they can be much more complicated with, for example, the first rheme becoming the fourth 
		theme and so on, like this:<br />
		<br />
		<img alt="theme rheme" height="237" src="../../imagesgraphics/theme_rheme3.png" width="310" /><br />
		where:<br />
		Theme 1 has rheme 1 which becomes theme 2 with a new rheme 2.<br />
		Rheme 2 becomes both theme 3 and theme 4.<br />
		Then rheme 3 becomes theme 5 and rheme 4 becomes theme 8 and so on.<br />
		The more the theme-rheme structure is disturbed, the more difficult the 
		text is to navigate and comprehend and the more lost the reader (and 
		writer) can 
		become.</p>
