			<h1>Backchannelling</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="channelling" height="207" src="../../images/buildings_amsterdam310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This is variously spelled as back-channelling or back channelling.&nbsp; We will stick with the one-word compound.</p>
			<p>Backchannelling should not be confused with turn taking, although 
			there are connections, as we shall see.&nbsp; Turn taking is to do 
			with what happens at the interface <strong>between</strong> moves in an interaction, 
			backchannelling is to do with what happens <strong>during</strong> 
			longer 
			moves.<br />
			There is a link at the end to the guide to turn taking or you can 
			click <a href="turn-taking.html" target="_blank">here</a> to go there now 
			(new tab).</p>
			<p>Backchannelling can be defined as listener responses to what is 
			being said rather than the listener attempting to interrupt or take 
			a turn.&nbsp; In this sense, it is part of what is essentially 
			one-way communication because the person doing the backchannelling 
			is not contributing anything new to the exchange.&nbsp; It can be verbal, paralinguistic or 
			signalled by silence and eye contact.&nbsp; When backchannelling is 
			verbal, it is normally phatic, i.e., requires no response and 
			communicates little but ongoing interest.</p>
			<p>Backchannelling is also not simply a response to an utterance as 
			in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've passed my driving test.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's great!</em><br />
			That is just an initiation and a conventional response (in this case 
			the preferred one).<br />
			Backchannelling differs in being the on-going reaction of the 
			listener during a speaker's longer turn.</p>
			<p>In almost all cultures, it is important that both the speaker and 
			the listener are taking an active part in an interaction.&nbsp; 
			Listeners, in other words, need to be active.<br />
			We use the expression <em><strong>almost all cultures</strong></em> 
			deliberately.<br />
				There is evidence that within Anglophone cultures, and many 
			other cultures, especially in Europe, silence on 
				behalf of a participant in a conversation signals the need for 
				someone else to take a turn and is not tolerated for long.&nbsp; 
				In other cultures, such as those containing speakers of North 
				American Athabaskan or Dene speakers (which includes, e.g., 
				Navajo) silence betokens no such thing and speakers of these 
				languages remain silent without this causing any feelings of 
				discomfort.<br />
				Encounters between English speakers and Athabaskan speakers may 
				result, as Trudgill (2000:132) has suggested in<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athabaskans ... thinking that 
				English speakers are rude, dominating, superior, smug and self 
				centred<br />
			</span></em>and English speakers finding<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athabaskans rude, 
			superior, surly, taciturn and withdrawn</em></span></p>
			<p>In what follows we are analysing what is properly known as 
			discourse makers, i.e., those signals that speakers use to manage 
			and mark phases in discourse.&nbsp; Discourse markers are also part 
			of turn taking language, of course.<br />
			The term discourse marker is now used so loosely in the profession, 
			to mean almost any language element that contributes to coherence or 
			cohesion that it has lost all utility as a technical term.&nbsp; We 
			shan't use it again here.</p>

				<dt><strong>Non-verbal</strong></dt>
				<dd>Backchannelling does not need to be spoken, it can be 
				achieved by smiles, eye contact, gesture and a number of other 
				paralinguistic features.<br />
				Eye contact is, in particular, variable across cultures and what 
				is perceived by a person from one culture as a token of interest 
				in what is being said may be deemed slightly aggressive in 
				another culture.&nbsp; Anglophone cultures fall into the first 
				category.&nbsp; On the other hand, in East Asian, South American 
				and some African cultures, extended eye contact can be 
				interpreted as a challenge or hostile act.<br />
				Cultures with large power distances also tend to be those in 
				which extended eye contact with one's superiors is often 
				culturally inappropriate.<br />
				In most cultures, head nodding is a sign of agreement while eyebrow raising 
				is one of surprise or disbelief.&nbsp; That is not a universal 
				truth because in some, an upward tilt of the head means <em>No</em> 
				and in others it signals doubt or disagreement.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Verbal</strong></dt>
				<dd>Most verbal backchannelling is phatic, insofar as it 
				communicates little but the listener's intention to maintain a 
				comfortable rapport with the speaker.<br />
				It takes various forms, for example:<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li>Noises and interjections such as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mm Mm<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Uh Huh<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Ah<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Wow!<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Cor!<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Oh!<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Urgh!<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mmmm</em><br />
					etc. which
					signal the listener's reaction to (and by implication 
					comprehension of) what the speaker has said.</li>
					<li>Single-word comments such as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My!<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Goodness!<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Awful!<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Interesting<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Yes</em><br />
					etc. which do carry a bit more meaning but are still phatic 
					insofar as they perform no communicative function in terms 
					of the transmission of information.&nbsp; Mostly these words 
					signal the desire to maintain rapport.</li>
					<li>Short phrases or clauses such as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					What then?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					How awful for you<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					How nice for you<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					That's good<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Do go on<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Tell me more</em><br />
					etc. which carry some information and are often routinised and 
					produced as single language chunks (which is how they can be 
					taught, of course).<br />
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Functions of backchannelling</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>There is as yet no complete or generally agreed description of 
			the functions of backchannelling but the following is based on some 
			intuitively sensible functions that backchannelling signals realise.&nbsp; 
			All these functions can be achieved verbally and non-verbally.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Continuers</strong>: <em>Please go on</em><br />
				<img alt="go on" height="133" src="../../images/talk_eye_contact200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Making prolonged eye contact while remaining silent is, in some 
				cultures, an encouragement to continue talking.&nbsp; In others, 
				as we saw, it is not and may be seen as aggressive.<br />
				Other ways of realising the function are with rising intonation, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mm Mm<strong> ↗</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh Huh<strong> ↗</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah Yeah<strong> ↗</strong></em><br />
				etc.<br />
				It has been noted that most continuers are multisyllabic (rather 
				than the monosyllabic fillers which have no discourse function).&nbsp; 
				For example, saying<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh<strong> ↘</strong><br />
				</em>in the middle of a turn functions as a filler, therefore, 
				but saying<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh huh<strong> ↗</strong><br />
				</em>during someone else's turn is a backchannelling device.<br />
				Continuers are almost always spoken with a fall-rising tone or a 
				simple rising tone.&nbsp; Uttering, for example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah<strong> ↘</strong>, yeah<strong> ↘</strong><br />
				</em>with a 
				falling tone would be construed as showing a lack of interest or 
				impatience.<br />
				The conventional pitch movements to teach are, therefore:<br />
				<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" >
					<tr>
						<td>
						<img alt="fall-rise" height="43" src="../../imagesgraphics/fall_rise_arrow.gif" width="50" /></td>
						<td>or</td>
						<td>
						<img alt="rise" height="50" src="../../imagesgraphics/rising_arrow.gif" width="50" /></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Comprehension signals</strong>: <em>I understand<br />
				</em>
				<img alt="understand" height="133" src="../../images/aha200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				These sorts of backchannelling devices are almost always verbal 
				because there is no universal gesture or facial expression which 
				sends the message that the listener understands what has been 
				said.&nbsp; They include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh Huh<strong> &rarr;</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I see<strong> &rarr;</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK<strong> &rarr;</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right<strong> &rarr;</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mm<strong> &rarr;</strong></em><br />
				The difference is that these can be uttered with a flat or 
				slightly falling tone as they do not signal encouragement, just 
				that the listener has understood so far.&nbsp; For example, 
				when being given directions, the listener may insert any one of 
				these kinds of signals after each stage of the directions to 
				signal that what has been said so far has been noted and the 
				speaker may go on rather than recapitulating.<br />
				The pitch shows no movement (or a slight fall) and is, therefore:<br />
				<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
					<tr>
						<td>
						<img alt="flat" height="17" src="../../imagesgraphics/neutral_arrow.gif" width="50" /></td>
						<td>
						or</td>
						<td>
						<img alt="fall" height="50" src="../../imagesgraphics/falling_arrow.gif" width="50" /></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Agreement signals</strong>: <em>That's right<br />
				<img alt="agree" height="133" src="../../images/perfect_a200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</em>These devices may be non-verbal and include vigorous 
				nodding and smiling alongside hand gestures such as thumbs-up 
				sign, displaying both empty hands to imply <em>I don't know 
				either</em> and so on.&nbsp; They can also be verbal and include, 
				for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, yes<strong> ↗</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right!<strong> ↗</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree<strong> ↗</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spot on<strong> ↗</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True.&nbsp; True<strong> ↗</strong></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too true<strong> ↗</strong></em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dead right<strong>! ↗</strong></em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Again, like continuers, they need usually to be uttered with a 
				rising or fall-rising tone or miscomprehension will arise.&nbsp; 
				Spoken with a falling or even a flat tone, for example,<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes,<strong> ↘</strong> yes<strong> ↘</strong></em><br />
				can indicate 
				impatience and frustration.<br />
				The pitch movement is, therefore:<br />
				<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
					<tr>
						<td>
						<img alt="fall-rise" height="43" src="../../imagesgraphics/fall_rise_arrow.gif" width="50" /></td>
						<td>or</td>
						<td>
						<img alt="rise" height="50" src="../../imagesgraphics/rising_arrow.gif" width="50" /></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Empathy signals</strong>: <em>How awful for you!<br />
				</em>
				<img alt="hand holding" height="133" src="../../images/handholding200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				These can be positive responses or those showing sympathy.&nbsp; 
				They also vary in strength with some expressing quite high 
				levels of emotional response and others being much weaker.&nbsp; For example, these are positive empathetic comments:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great! <strong>↗</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congratulations! <strong>↗</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow <strong>↗</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesss!</em> <strong>
				<em>↗</em></strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Good for you <strong>↗</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well done</em> <strong>
				<em>↗</em></strong><br />
				etc. and these can also include non-verbal signals such as fist 
				pumping or handshaking.<br />
				Sympathy signals can also be made non-verbally with a sad face 
				or downcast mouth shape but verbal signals include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, dear<strong> ↘</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, I'm sorry<strong> ↘</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a pity<strong> ↘</strong></em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Non-verbally, this form of backchannelling can often be achieved 
				by, e.g., tightly shutting one's eyes to show horror or great 
				sympathy, raising eyebrows to show interest or surprise or slow, 
				repeated head nodding to show empathy.<br />
				Verbally, the two types have different intonation contours so the positive 
				ones will usually be spoken with a rising or fall-rise contour 
				and the sympathetic responses with a falling intonation and, 
				usually, lowering of voice volume.<br />
				The pitch movement is, therefore:<br />
				<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
					<tr>
						<td>
						<img alt="fall-rise" height="43" src="../../imagesgraphics/fall_rise_arrow.gif" width="50" /></td>
						<td>or</td>

						<td>or</td>
						<td>
						<img alt="fall" height="50" src="../../imagesgraphics/falling_arrow.gif" width="50" /></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Expansion request</strong>: <em>Is that so?<br />
				</em>
				<img alt="question" height="133" src="../../images/question_girl200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				These are not quite the same as interruption asking for more 
				detail or clarification.&nbsp; They are simply minor prompts to 
				the speaker that he / she should expand a little on what's just 
				been said so they do not constitute turn-grabbing acts.&nbsp; 
				They include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really?<strong> ↗</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that so?<strong> ↗</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And?<strong> ↗</strong></em><br />
				etc.<br />
				A common form is that the listener repeats the last 
				phrase uttered by the speaker but with a rising or questioning 
				intonation contour such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the hospital?<strong> ↗</strong></em><br />
				Which signals the listener's wish for a little more information.<br />
				The pitch movement is, therefore, usually, simply:<br />

				<h2>The grey area</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>It bears repeating that backchannelling and turn-taking are not 
			at all the same thing.<br />
			There is, however, a slightly grey area 
			between them which concerns what happens when a speaker interprets a 
			back-channelling device as a request for a turn and concedes the 
			floor or when a listener converts or extends a backchannelling 
			signal into a new turn and overrides the speaker.<br />
			The first of these can happen in a dialogue such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: <em>And the road between here and my parents' house has 
			just got worse and worse</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: <em>I know, I've driven it myself</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: <em>Have you?&nbsp; When?</em><br />
			in which speaker A has misinterpreted B's comment to be a request 
			for a turn and so concedes the floor by asking the question.&nbsp; B's 
			comment may have been intended as an agreement signal only and B may 
			have expected A to continue the turn after it was uttered.</p>
			Backchannelling can also be used as a way of sneakily grabbing a 
			turn because what begins as a backchannelling device can, if the 
			speaker allows it, be converted by extending it into a proper turn-taking 
			move.&nbsp; 
			It can happen like this:<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style59">
				<tr>
					<td valign="top">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style58" valign="top"> <em>And the road between here and my parents' house has

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td valign="top">B:</td>
					<td class="auto-style58" valign="top"><em>Has it?</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td valign="top">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style58" valign="top"> <em>Yeah.&nbsp; It's almost undriveable because of the 
			roadworks and so on</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td valign="top">B:</td>
					<td class="auto-style58" valign="top"><em>I know, I've driven it myself and you are right about 
			it.&nbsp; I've written to the council twice and got no response so 
			I'm going down to the Town Hall tomorrow to speak to the Chief 
			Engineer and see what she has to say about it.&nbsp; We need to get 
					something done</em>.</td>
				</tr>

			in which speaker A has responded conventionally to speaker B's first 
			backchannelling utterance by giving the required information.&nbsp; Speaker B 
			has then, however, used an agreement expression but extended it and 
			stolen the turn.&nbsp; Speaker A has been patient and tolerant to allow this 
			to happen.<p>Thornbury (2005) and others include backchannelling as a part of 
			turn-taking skills and that is a defensible position.&nbsp; The 
			problem is that, as we have just seen, how the current speaker and 
			the backchanneller interpret what is said is open to a good deal of 
			doubt and dependent to a large extent on the listener's confidence 
			and intentions and the context.&nbsp; The current turn-holder's 
			confidence and intentions also play a role.<br />
			Most backchannelling does not mean that the hearer wishes to take a 
			turn, especially if they are softly spoken or non-linguistic.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mm, mm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh, huh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see</em><br />
			and so on spoken softly with a level or slightly rising tone, simply mean that the 
			hearer is alert to what is being said.<br />
			However, utterances such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear me!</em><br />
			etc. are variously interpretable and unpredictable.&nbsp; They may 
			be encouragement to continue the turn or they may be signalling a 
			wish to take a turn.&nbsp; They may, too, be misinterpreted and 
			misused.<br />
			The guide to turn-taking is linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>
			<p>Imagine it like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="grey area" height="277" src="../../imagesgraphics/turntaking_backchannelling.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>In these cases, it may be very difficult to infer speakers' intentions just by listening to them but it does not help 
			our students if we teach backchannelling and turn-taking skills as 
			if they were the same.&nbsp; They are not, and they require 
			different approaches.</p>

				<h2>Teaching backchannelling skills</h2>

			<p>There are poor ways to do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To ignore the area and assume that the skill will be absorbed or transferred from the learners' first 
				languages(s) or that the learners can construct appropriate 
				backchannelling expressions spontaneously while they are also 
				trying to decode what they are hearing.<br />
				An associated issue is that backchannelling is often a 
				culturally determined phenomenon and learners from cultures 
				which consider silent listening a sign of politeness and respect 
				may be reluctant to say anything.&nbsp; If that happens when 
				they are interacting with people whose cultural rules <strong>
				expect</strong> a good deal of backchannelling, the speakers may 
				become disorientated, uncomfortable and confused, often to the 
				point at which they simply stop talking altogether because they 
				are not getting any feedback or encouragement.<br />
				This is even more the case when no visual signals are available 
				as on the telephone.&nbsp; If, when someone is taking a 
				reasonably long turn in a telephone conversation, the listener 
				is completely silent, it is not usually a matter of more than 10 
				seconds before the speaker self-interrupts with:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you still there?</em><br />
				or something similar.</li>
				<li>To conflate backchannelling and turn-taking skills.&nbsp; If 
				you do this, learners may confuse any form of backchannelling 
				with a request to take a turn and confuse listeners by conceding 
				the floor unnecessarily.&nbsp; Alternatively, they may assume 
				that all interruptions are simply backchannelling and refuse to 
				recognise a legitimate request for a turn.</li>
				<li>To teach the language without teaching the purposes for 
				which the language is used.&nbsp; This generally decays into a 
				kind of phrase-book approach in which learners are given 
				dubiously useful sets of language exponents but are not able to use 
				them appropriately because the setting and purposes have not been made clear.<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>While it is useful to have a set of language chunks at 
					one's disposal, some are not used for 
					backchannelling <em>per se</em> but to introduce a speaker's 
					turn, re-start a turn or interrupt in order to take a turn 
					(although that is rare).<br />
					Using backchannelling devices inappropriately as 
					turn-grabbers may often be considered rude.&nbsp; Knowing how to 
					use them appropriately, on the other hand, is a real aid to 
					fluency because they are prefabricated and do not need to 
					be constructed from scratch.</li>
					<li>Sets of exponents might include, for example:<ol class="smallgreybullet">
						<li><em>Uh Huh</em> 
				<em><strong> ↗ </strong></em>(= please go on)</li>
						<li><em>I see <strong> &rarr; </strong> </em>(= I understand so far)</li>
						<li><em>Right</em> 
				<em><strong> ↗ </strong></em>(= I agree)</li>
						<li><em>Rotten luck</em> 
				<em><strong> ↘ </strong></em>(= I sympathise)</li>
						<li><em>So? <strong> ↗</strong></em> (= I am asking for some expansion)</li>

			<p>Many learners (and not a few teachers) are unaware how and to 
			what extent cultures differ in this area.&nbsp; Before we can begin 
			to teach it, learners need to be convinced that there is 
			something worth learning.<br />
			A little cross-cultural awareness-raising is called for.<br />
			In mono-cultural settings with all the learners from the same 
			culture, especially if the teacher shares awareness of the culture's 
			norms, this is comparatively straightforward because we only need to 
			tackle the differences between two cultures.<br />
			In more diverse settings, the situation is more complex, albeit more 
			interesting as well.<br />
			Guessing games are a way of doing this.&nbsp; For example, a simple 
			questionnaire to discuss in pairs or small groups (putting learners 
			who share cultures into the same groups) can work well.&nbsp; Like

			</table>etc.<p>How you approach this and what the settings are will vary, of 
			course.&nbsp; One way is to get people to fill in the grid 
			individually and then get them to explain their choices to a friend.&nbsp; 
			Alternatively, you can discuss the outcomes as a whole class, 
			focusing especially on what prompts a 'sometimes' answer.&nbsp; For 
			example, it may be expected in an Anglophone culture to use 
			backchannelling expressions very frequently, others may see it as 
			disrespectful especially if there is a power difference as in the 
			second half of the little exercise above.<br />
			The next step is to run the same exercise but focus on what is 
			acceptable in an Anglophone environment such as Britain, Australia 
			or the USA.<br />
			The answers may well surprise people.</p>

				<h3>Combining the functions</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Backchannelling has, as we saw above a number of distinct 
			functions.&nbsp; However, they are connected and often used together 
			while listening to someone else's long turn so three or even all of 
			the types can be practised together but only <strong>providing the 
			learners know what they are doing and can get the intonation right</strong>.<br />
			It helps, therefore, to introduce and practise the forms discretely 
			before asking learners to combine them.<br />
			Because the skill is by no means easy to master and, unlike turn 
			taking, is essentially not about the reversal of roles between 
			speaker and listener, you can do the speaking and the learners can 
			do the backchannelling.&nbsp; That way, they only have one thing to 
			think about and pressure is reduced.<br />
			A good place to start is with your telling an anecdote or story and 
			getting each learner in turn to focus on what you are saying.&nbsp; 
			Like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First telling of the story:<br />
				Each learner must produce a continuer, such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Go on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me more </em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Second telling:<br />
				Each learner must produce an expression of interest, such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh Huh</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Third telling:<br />
				Each learner must produce an expression of emotional reaction, 
				such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Oh dear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow!</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Yuck</em>!<br />
				etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>And so on until all the five different types have been mastered and 
			the intonation contours the learners are producing are satisfactory.<br />
			The next stage is to give each learner a different type (or two) of 
			backchannelling devices to achieve so some are expressing interest, some 
			understanding, some sympathy and so on.<br />
			You may, in fact, need to have a range of short stories and 
			anecdotes to use so that you can evince content-appropriate 
			responses.</p>
			<p>The ambition, of course, has to be for you to step aside and for 
			the learners to take over both the role of speaker and 
			backchanneller.<br />
			However, they can only focus on one role at a time, because this is 
			not about turn taking, so the learners need to swap roles frequently 
			to even out the practice opportunities.</p>

				<h3>Forcing the issue</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Verbalised backchannelling is a salient feature of audio-only, 
			telephone conversations.&nbsp; The lack of the availability of any 
			gesture or facial expressions to signal interest and so on has to be 
			made up for by the continual use of backchannelling expressions.&nbsp; 
			Staying silent when someone is taking a long turn in a telephone 
			conversation is not an option because even short silences will 
			evince something like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Hello?&nbsp; Are you still there?</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			These sorts of interactions are, therefore ideal practice vehicles 
			in this area because they force the use of backchannelling 
			expressions (in all cultures).<br />
			Ideally, you can send people out of the room to telephone classmates 
			and take a long turn while the listener deploys as many 
			backchannelling devices as they can.&nbsp; Then, the listener can 
			call back or take over the turn and the roles are reversed.<br />
			If this is not an available option, simply placing learners on 
			back-to-back chairs can simulate the effect.&nbsp; Topics, 
			naturally, need to be easy and familiar (because we are not focusing 
			on taking the long turn) and might include:</p>
			<ul class="smallgreybullet">
				<li>giving directions to a place known to one but not the other 
				(which requires extensive use of comprehension and continuer 
				expressions)</li>
				<li>telling someone about an enjoyable day (which requires use 
				of empathy signals)</li>
				<li>telling someone about an awful day (which requires use of a 
				different kind of empathy signals)</li>
				<li>suggesting doing something enjoyable together (which 
				requires the use of agreement signals)<br />
				and so on.</li>
			</ul>

				<td class="auto-style2">
				<h3>Paralinguistic features</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>These need first to be demonstrated.&nbsp; TV interviews are a good source 
			because the interviewers will often pre-record their responses of 
			showing interest and encouragement to go on, by nodding and 
			appearing interested with direct eye contact which are then spliced 
			into the interview before it is broadcast.&nbsp; That way, only one 
			camera is required.<br />
			Again, focus is important so that the cultural appropriacy of each 
			feature and how it is performed can be learnt.&nbsp; You need to 
			focus on, e.g.:</p>
			<ul class="smallgreybullet">
				<li><span class="style_black">nodding</span></li>
				<li><span class="style_black">eye contact</span></li>
				<li><span class="style_black">smiling</span></li>
				<li><span class="style_black">looking sad</span></li>
				<li><span class="style_black">eyebrow raising</span></li>
				<li><span class="style_black">eye closing</span></li>
				<li class="style_black">hand movements</li>
			</ul>
			<p>etc.<br />
			Practising these can be fun and getting learners to act out short 
			interactions containing three of them at least can be 
			productive, engaging and raise cultural awareness of the importance 
			of backchannelling gestures.</p>

				<h3>Eye contact and eye movements</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We have already noted that the signal sent by the maintenance of 
			eye contact is culturally determined to a large extent but we need 
			to elaborate here just a little.&nbsp; Here are some points to bear 
			in mind:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In western and especially Anglophone cultures eye contact in 
				non-conflictual interactions is usually a signal of maintained 
				interest.&nbsp; However, in any conflictual situation, such as a 
				disagreement, it may be considered as aggressive and hostile.</li>
				<li>In many other cultures, any extended eye contact may signal 
				discourtesy or impertinence especially between people of varying 
				social power.</li>
				<li>Breaking eye contact does not necessarily mean a loss of 
				interest.&nbsp; If you ask someone a difficult question which 
				requires them to think hard, the usual reaction is to break eye 
				contact immediately.&nbsp; Equally, if speakers are trying to 
				find the correct words to explain something or recall a 
				complicated series of events, they, too, may break eye contact 
				while they think.&nbsp; It is not a signal of giving up a turn; 
				it is a signal of thinking hard.</li>
				<li>Whatever proponents of Neuro Linguistic Programming may say, 
				there is no truth in the assertion that different types of eye 
				movements betray different sorts of cognitive processes.</li>
