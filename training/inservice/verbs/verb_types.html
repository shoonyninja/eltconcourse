			<h1>Types of verbs and clause structures</h1>
			<p>
					<img alt="fractal" height="207" src="../../images/fractal310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			
			<p>This is an overview.&nbsp; For more detail 
					on any of this, follow the links in the table at the 
					end.<br />
					Verb types in English are complicated.&nbsp; In her book,
					<em>English Verb Classes and Alternations: A Preliminary 
					Investigation</em>, Beth Levin considers some 3000 English 
					verbs and classifies them in a bewilderingly complex way, 
					identifying over 80 types based on their functions in 
					sentences.&nbsp; Note, too, that this is subtitled <em>A
					<strong>Preliminary</strong> Investigation</em>.<br />
					This is a site for language teachers, not theoretical 
					linguists, so the following will not be quite so 
					comprehensive.&nbsp; In fact, we'll focus on just six types 
			to begin with and then we'll look at some alternative 
			classifications.</p>
			<p>This guide considers lexical or main verbs only.&nbsp; There is a 
			separate 
			<a href="../../initial/grammar_essentials/primary_auxiliaries.html" target="_blank">guide to 
			primary auxiliary verbs</a> and
			<a href="../indexes_is/modality_index_is.html" target="_blank">modal auxiliary verbs</a> 
			get a whole section to themselves (both links open in a new tab).<br />
			So, what is considered below are verbs which are <strong>not:</strong></p>
			<ol class="auto-style62">
				<li>acting to form a tense, voice structure or aspect (the role of primary auxiliary verbs), 
				for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John <strong>was</strong> reading<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <strong>has</strong> finished<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <strong>got</strong> the house painted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <strong>have been</strong> arrested</em></li>
				<li>signalling the speaker's view of an event or state is in 
				terms of its likelihood, necessity, ability, desirability etc. (the role of modal 
				auxiliary verbs), for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <strong>dared</strong> to complain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <strong>should</strong> be here soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We <strong>must</strong> go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <strong>would</strong>n't be able to help</em></li>
			</ol>

			if you are looking for something in particular.<a name="top"></a></p>

			<p>If you put something like <em>verb types</em> into a search 
			engine, you will be confronted with a confusing variety of sites 
			which claim to know what verb types there are.&nbsp; Some will 
			define three types, some four, some five and so on up to 12.&nbsp; 
			Within those classifications we will find modal auxiliary verbs, 
			primary auxiliary verbs and lexical or main verbs of one type or another 
			mixed with promiscuous carelessness.&nbsp; That way, madness lies.<br />
			This guide, as we said, is not concerned with all verb types and 
			excludes auxiliary verbs of either type.&nbsp; It is also not 
			concerned with gross levels of analysis which distinguish between 
			transitive and intransitive verbs and leave it at that.<br />
			What we are concerned with here is how we can classify verbs by 
			their grammatical functions and their structural characteristics and 
			that means avoiding crude descriptions such as action verbs and so 
			on.</p>
			<p>An alternative analysis, to which there is a guide on this site, 
			linked at the end, is to classify verbs into what processes they 
			encode.&nbsp; Briefly, that will include</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>Material and behavioural processes:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>The house <strong>collapsed</strong></em></li>
					<li><em>John <strong>left</strong></em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Thinking and saying processes:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>She <strong>believed</strong> his story</em></li>
					<li><em>He <strong>said</strong> he was driving</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Existential and relational processes:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>There <strong>used to be</strong> a garden here</em></li>
					<li><em>His office <strong>is</strong> on the top floor</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>That is a perfectly legitimate, some might say, superior analysis 
			of verb types and considering the processes that verbs encode 
			explains a good deal about traditional categories concerning 
			transitivity and dynamic or stative uses.<br />
			It is not the approach taken here because this guide is mostly concerned 
			with the grammatical rather than semantic characteristics of verbs.&nbsp; 
			Meaning, however, plays an important part in the alternative 
			structures that are available.</p>

			<p>There are, by some estimates, over 25,000 verbs in English (not 
			including derivatives) so we need a way to make sense of the data.<br />
			This guide does not lay claim to what follows being the only way.</p>
			<p>Here are six examples of <span class="style_red"><strong>verbs</strong></span> performing 
			various functions in English.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>The police officer <span class="style_red"><strong>became</strong></span> 
				angry.</em></li>
				<li><em>She </em><span class="style_red"><em><strong>is</strong></em></span><em> 
				a doctor.</em></li>
				<li><em>They </em><span class="style_red"><em><strong>gave</strong></em></span><em> 
				the man some money.</em></li>
				<li><em>I </em><span class="style_red"><em><strong>cooked</strong></em></span><em> 
				the dinner competently.</em></li>
				<li><em>Peter </em><span class="style_red"><em><strong>arrived</strong></em></span><em> 
				late at the party.</em></li>
				<li><em>They </em><span class="style_red"><em><strong>elected</strong></em></span><em> 
				her president.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>These six types have been chosen because distinguishing between 
			them is one of the most difficult things for learners of English to 
			do.&nbsp; Partly, this is because languages vary a lot in how verbs 
			can be characterised and what they do.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p><a name="sixexamples"></a>The six examples above represent six of the most common clause 
			forms in English.&nbsp; We can analyse them like this:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>In each there is a simple subject<ol class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>Sentence 1.: <em>The police officer</em></li>
					<li>Sentence 2.: <em>She</em></li>
					<li>Sentence 3.:<em> They</em></li>
					<li>Sentence 4.: <em>I</em></li>
					<li>Sentence 5.: <em>Peter</em></li>
					<li>Sentence 6.: <em>They</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The subjects are 
			followed by what is usually called the <strong>predicate</strong> 
			(i.e., the rest of the sentence including the verb which drives the 
				meaning).&nbsp; In functional grammar, these 
			two parts would be called the <strong>theme</strong> (the subject) 
			and the <strong>rheme</strong> (the predicate).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, the predicates are more complicated.&nbsp; There are six 
			different sorts.&nbsp; Here are the example sentences again with the 
			predicates in <span class="style_red"><strong>red</strong></span>.&nbsp; 
			Your task, should you accept it, is to identify what makes up 
			the predicates (type of verb, word class, types of phrase etc.)<br />

				doctor</em> is still 
				<strong>not</strong> 
				the object of the verb because <em>a doctor</em> and <em>she</em> 
				represent the same entity.&nbsp; The two are, in the jargon, 
				co-referential.&nbsp; Again, it's a <strong>subject 
				complement</strong>.<br />
				The structure of this sentence is also<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb–Subject 
				Complement or SVC</strong><sub>S</sub>.</dd>
				<dt>In <em>They </em><span class="style_red"><em><strong>gave 
				the man some money</strong></em></span></dt>
				<dd class="style_brown">we have two proper objects: <em>the man</em> and <em>some 
				money</em>.&nbsp; The roles of these objects are different, 
				however:<br />
				<em>some money</em> is the <strong>direct object</strong> 
				because that is what they gave (it is what was <strong>affected</strong> 
				by the action of the verb).<br />
				<em>the man</em> is the <strong>indirect object</strong> because 
				he is the <strong>recipient</strong> of the action.<br />
				The structure of this sentence is<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb–Indirect 
				Object–Direct Object or SVO</strong><sub><strong>I</strong></sub><strong>O</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub>.<br />
				In English, indirect objects come before direct objects.&nbsp; 
				In many languages, it's the other way around.<br />
				A simple test for the difference is to leave one of the objects 
				out:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_red">gave</span> some money<br />
				</em>makes sense so<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some money<br />
				</em>is the direct object.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_red">gave</span> the man<br />
				</em>makes no sense so<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man<br />
				</em>is 
				the indirect object.<br />
				English can reverse the order of the two objects by using a 
				prepositional <em>to-</em>phrase or <em>for</em>-phrase as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They <span class="style_red">gave</span> some money to 
				the man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_red">bought</span> dinner for everyone<br />
				</em>In this case, we have the simpler clause structure of<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb–Direct Object–Adverbial or SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub><strong>A<br />
				</strong>as in the next example.</dd>
				<dt>In <em>I </em><span class="style_red"><em><strong>cooked 
				the dinner competently</strong></em></span></dt>
				<dd class="style_brown">we have only one object, <em>the dinner</em>, and if there 
				is only one object, it is the direct object.&nbsp; This sentence 
				also contains an adverbial (the adverb <em>competently</em>).<br />
				The structure of this sentence is<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb–Direct 
				Object–Adverbial or SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub><strong>A<br />
				</strong>The position of the 
				adverbial is not fixed in English so we allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I competently cooked the dinner</em><br />Other elements are much 
				more stable.<br />Leave out the adverbial and we have the simpler 
				<strong>SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub> 
				sentence.</dd>
				<dt>In <em>Peter </em><span class="style_red"><em><strong>arrived 
				late at the party</strong></em></span></dt>
				<dd class="style_brown">we have no object at all.&nbsp; This is 
				because <em>arrive</em> is an intransitive verb (in English) and 
				can take no object.&nbsp; In this sentence, there are two 
				adverbials:<br />
				The<strong> temporal adverbial</strong> <em>late</em> which is 
				an adverb.<br />
				The <strong>locative adverbial</strong> <em>at the party</em> 
				which is a prepositional phrase.<br />
				The structure of this sentence is<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb–Adverbial–Adverbial or SVA<br />
				</strong>(only one 'A' because we 
				can keep adding adverbials <em>ad infinitum</em>).<br />
				It is possible, of course, to omit the adverbial and the we get 
				a simpler structure<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb or </strong><strong>SV<br />
				</strong>as in, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
				<span class="style_red">works<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They 
				<span class="style_red">complained<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It 
				<span class="style_red">snowed<br />
				</span></em>etc.</dd>
				<dt>In <em>They </em><span class="style_red"><em><strong>elected 
				her president</strong></em></span></dt>
				<dd class="style_brown">we have a slightly less common sentence 
				structure in that we are using an <strong>object complement</strong> 
				rather than the subject complements we saw in examples 1 and 2.&nbsp; 
				In this sentence <em>her</em> is the direct object and the noun
				<em>president</em> is its complement telling us about the object in the 
				same way that <em>angry</em> and <em>a doctor</em> tell us about 
				the subject in example sentences 1 and 2.<br />
				It is also possible (and more common) to use an adjective as the 
				object complement in a clause such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_red">made her angry</span></em>.<br />
				The structure of these sentences is<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb–Object–Object

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Nominalised object clauses</strong><br />
				Direct objects of verbs can also be clauses acting as nouns, 
				introduced with <em>that</em>, which is why they are called 
				nominalised <em>that-</em>clauses.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; He told me a lie</em><br />
				has the direct object <em>a lie</em> and the indirect object <em>
				me</em> but:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me that he was hungry</em><br />
				Has the structure<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb–Indirect Object–Direct 
				Object<br />
				</strong>but here the Direct object is the nominalised clause
				<em>that he was hungry</em>.<br />
				Nominalised <em>that</em>-clauses cannot act as indirect 
				objects.&nbsp; Indirect objects are mainly noun clauses or 
				pronouns, never <em>that</em>-clauses.<br />
				Nominalised <em>that</em>-clauses cannot be moved as indirect 
				noun-phrase or pronoun objects can, so, while we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told a lie to me</em><br />
				we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He told that he was hungry to me</em></li>
				<li><strong>Object complements</strong><br />
				There is a variant of the<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb–Direct 
				Object–Adverbial<br />
				</strong>structure which deploys a complement 
				(usually an adjective or a non-finite verb form).&nbsp; For 
				example:<strong><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> </strong><em>He kept the people happy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left her mother wondering what happened</em><br />
				We could make this the seventh structure but in fact, it follows 
				the structure of the final category above.&nbsp; It is, functionally<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb–Object–Object 
				Complement or SVOC</strong><sub><strong>O</strong></sub></li>
				<li><strong>Optional and obligatory adverbial complements</strong><br />
				Adverbial complements are usually considered optional 
				elements of sentences so we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made the beds</em><br />
				which is<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb–Direct 
				Objector SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made the beds immediately</em><br />
				which is<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb–Direct 
				Object–Adverbial or SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub><strong>A</strong><br />
				However, a few transitive verbs (notably, <em>put, place, stand
				</em>and <em>treat</em>) insist on an adverbial complement so 
				while we can have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put it down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He treated her badly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I placed the table in the corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood the lamp over there</em><br />
				we do not allow simply <strong>SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub>,
				<span class="style_underline">in these meanings</span> of the 
				verbs:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I put it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He treated her
				</em>(except in a medical sense)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I placed the table<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I stood the lamp<br />
				</em>The normally intransitive verbs <em>lie</em> and <em>live</em> 
				(the latter in the sense of <em>abide</em> rather than <em>exist</em>) 
				also demand an adverbial complement so do not allow the pattern 
				of simple <strong>Subject–Verb or SV </strong>as most 
				intransitive verbs do.&nbsp; So, for example, we can accept<strong><br />
				</strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lay on the bed</em><br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She lived in London</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He lay</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She lived </em>(except in the meaning of
				<em>survived</em>)<br />
				What this all means is that some verbs require adverbials which 
				are not adjuncts, for adjuncts may be omitted, but these 
				compulsory adverbials may not.<br />
				There is a little more on this in the guide to adverbials, 
				linked below, under the heading of <strong>PP complement verbs</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Ellipsis of the object or conversion</strong><br />
				Some transitive verbs which would normally demand the 
				structure<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb–Direct 
				Object–Adverbial or SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub><strong>A<br />
				</strong>allow us to suppress or make implicit the object and can appear 
				in<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject–Verb–Adverbial or SVA<br />
				</strong>structures (or 
				simply <strong>SV</strong>, of course):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She's reading at the moment</em><br />
				implies an object, as does<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are smoking outside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They washed before lunch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drank</em> <em>quickly</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				In other words, the <strong>SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub><strong>A </strong>
				exists by implication but not in the overt structure of the 
				sentence.&nbsp; In the example above the implied objects are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a text of some sort<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cigarettes, pipes or cigars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their hands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some liquid<br />
				</em>Many other transitive verbs do not allow this object ellipsis so 
				we do not permit:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He used<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The children liked</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				There are two views of this:<ol class="auto-style62">
					<li>That the object is implicit and suppressed so, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is eating</em><br />implies an object (some kind of food).</li>
					<li>That the verb has been converted from a transitive to an 
				intransitive version so, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is eating breakfast</em><br />is 
					<strong>SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub><br />but<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is eating</em><br />is <strong>SV</strong></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Postponement of the object</strong><br />
				Slightly unusually, the normal word ordering of either <strong>SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub><strong>A</strong> 
				or <strong>SVOC</strong><sub><strong>O</strong></sub> can be 
				disturbed when we wish to lay some emphasis on the direct object 
				of the verb.&nbsp; We can change, therefore, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She made all the people at the meeting uneasy<br />
				</em>which follows the usual <strong>SVOC</strong><sub><strong>O</strong></sub> ordering 
				to<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She made uneasy all the people at 
				the meeting</em><br />
				in which the complement splits the subject and the direct 
				object.<br />
				We see this, too, in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They explained how to fix the problem to the engineers<br />
				</em>which is the normal <strong>SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub><strong>A</strong> 
				ordering changing to:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They explained to the engineers how to fix the 
				problem<br />
				</em>in which the adverbial splits the verb from its object.<br />
				What is happening here is that the direct object of the 
				verb is postpositioned because the speaker / writer wishes to 
				mark it in some way and the conventional way to do that (or one 
				of them) in English is to transpose the phrase or clause to the 
				end of the sentence, giving it end focus and end weight.</li>
				<li><strong>Split phrases</strong><br />
				The usual ordering of the elements of a clause can also be 
				disturbed (and more difficult for people to follow) if a noun 
				phrase is split from its modification by the adverbial(s).&nbsp; 
				We may have therefore, instead of the usual:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We delayed the discussion of the new 
				policy until the end of the meeting<br />
				</em>which has the usual ordering of <strong>SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub><strong>A</strong>, 
				we can encounter:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We delayed until the end of the meeting 
				the discussion of the new policy<br />
				</em>in which the modifier of the noun phrase is split from the 
				noun by the adverbials.<br />
				We may also meet with:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone came to the party except the 
				Smiths<br />
				</em>in which the subject noun phrase is <em>everyone except the 
				Smiths</em> but it has been split by the verb phrase and the 
				adverbial with the modifier of <em>everyone</em> (<em>except the 
				Smiths</em>) postpositioned for emphasis.<br />
				This also occurs frequently with comparative clauses and phrases 
				so we get, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More people have come to the party than 
				we expected</em><br />
				in which the subject noun phrase (<em>more people than we 
				expected</em>) is split by the verb phrase and the adverbial.<br />
				It can, naturally, be rephrased as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More people than we expected have come to 
				the party<br />
				</em>in which the structure (<strong>SVA</strong>) is somewhat 
				clearer.</li>
			</ol>
			
			
			<p>The last two of the points above (5. and 6.) refer to unusual or 
			slightly unexpected ordering of the elements but the elements 
			themselves are unchanged.&nbsp; However, any splitting or unusual 
			positioning of phrases in clauses make the meaning less easy for 
			non-native speakers to infer.</p>

			<p>Intensive verbs take subject complements rather than objects and 
			appear in clause structure SVC<sub>S</sub>.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>I <span class="style_red">am</span> a nurse</em></li>
				<li><em>Peter <span class="style_red">is running</span> to fat</em></li>
				<li><em>She <span class="style_red">is getting</span> aggressive</em></li>
				<li><em>He <span class="style_red">is growing</span> old</em></li>
				<li><em>He <span class="style_red">seemed</span> even more delighted</em></li>
				<li><em>John <span class="style_red">fell</span> ill</em></li>
				<li><em>She <span class="style_red">turned</span> aggressive</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>When they are used as copular verbs they cannot be used 
			dynamically:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They are being doctors<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was appearing happy<br />
			</em>etc.&nbsp; Examples 1, 5, 6 and 7 are copular verbs taking the SVC<sub>S</sub> 
			structure.</p>
			<p>When such verbs <span class="style_underline">are</span> used 
			dynamically, the sense is usually <strong>a change of state</strong> rather than a 
			consistent attribute of the subject.&nbsp; Examples of the SVC<sub>S</sub> 
			structures with these verbs used dynamically are 2, (a change of 
			state from <em>thin</em> to <em>fat</em>), 3, (a change of state from
			<em>peaceable</em> to 
			<em>aggressive</em>) and 4. (a change of state from <em>younger</em> to 
			<em>older</em>).<br />
			You can see that the example<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_red">turned</span> 
			aggressive<br />
			</em>is copular rather than dynamic use because it represents 
			the end point of the change of state, not the process.<br />
			Similarly,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_red">fell</span> ill<br />
			</em>is a 
			copular use for the same reason but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_red">
			is falling</span> ill<br />
			</em>is a dynamic use describing the change of 
			state.&nbsp; Both uses differ from the more common intransitive use 
			of the verb as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He fell over<br />
			</em>Although not a term with which to trouble your learners, verbs referring to changes in state are often called 
			<strong>inchoative</strong> or 
			<strong>inceptive</strong>.</p>
			<h4>Intensive verbs do not take objects &ndash; they take 
			complements.</h4>
			<p>In the sentences above we have the following types of complement:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>a nurse</em> (a noun complement co-referential with the 
				subject)</li>
				<li><em>to fat</em> (an adverbial complement, in this case a 
				prepositional phrase)</li>
				<li><em>aggressive</em> (an adjective subject complement)</li>
				<li><em>old</em> (an adjective subject complement)</li>
				<li><em>even more delighted </em>(an adjective phrase 
				subject complement)</li>
				<li><em>aggressive</em> (an adjective subject complement)</li>

			is transitive and <strong>SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub><strong>A</strong><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_red">worked</span> in the same office<br />
			</em>is intransitive and <strong>SVA</strong>, but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_red">worked </span>a miracle for us<br />
			</em>is transitive and <strong>SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub><strong>A</strong></p>
			<p>An alternative way to analyse this is to suggest that the object in 
			the first example has been ellipted but is implied (see Note 4 above).<br />
			An example of a verb which changes meaning when used in the two ways 
			is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I can <span class="styleredbold">manage</span> on $50 a week</em> 
			(intransitive and <strong>SVA</strong>)<br />
			vs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She <span class="styleredbold">manages</span> two shops</em> 
			(transitive and <strong>SVO</strong>)<strong><br />
			</strong>When they are transitive, these sorts of verbs follow one of the patterns 
			below.<br />
			See also Note 3, above concerning the verbs <em>lie</em> 
			and <em>live</em> which insist on the inclusion of an adverbial and 
			cannot be merely <strong>SV</strong>.&nbsp; More on this below.</p>

				<p>Factitive verbs usually signal that their object has been 
				changed in some way.&nbsp; This can be that it is put into a 
				certain category or that its condition has changed and in this 
				sense the verbs are causative in nature.&nbsp; They differ, 
				however, from causative verbs properly defined and that is made 
				clear in the guide to the causative, linked below.</p></dd></dl>
				<p>Most transitive verbs do not allow the ellipsis of the object 
				(see Note 4 above).<br />
				Some transitive verbs allow the use of a nominalised <em>that</em>-clause 
				as the direct object.&nbsp; None allows <em>that</em>-clauses as indirect 
				objects (see Note 1 above).</p>
			<p>There is a class of verbs, sometimes called <strong>PP complement verbs</strong>, which 
			<span class="style_underline">require</span> complementation with an 
			adverbial.&nbsp; The adverbial in this case is not an adjunct 
			because it cannot be omitted and leave a well-formed sentence.<br />
			These verbs usually refer to placing something somewhere and are, 
			necessarily, nearly always transitive and follow the <strong>SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong></sub>A 
			format with the difference that A is <strong>obligatorily</strong> 
			present.<br />
			The verbs include at least: <em>
			<span class="style_black">keep, lay, place, plonk, position, put, 
			rest, set, site, situate, stick, stuff</span></em><br />
			For example, we cannot have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *John laid the book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I placed the vase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I stuck the suitcase<br />
			</em>and so on although, of course, the verbs can be used in other 
			senses without the adverbial.<br />
			For more, see the guide to adverbials, linked below.<br />
			The verbs <em>stay</em> and <em>venture</em> are intransitive but can be included when 
			the former means <em>live 
			temporarily </em>and the latter means<em> move oneself into danger, </em>so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed in a hotel<br />
			</em>is possible but, in the same sense of the verb,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I stayed<br />
			</em>is not.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ventured into the castle<br />
			</em>is acceptable, but in the same sense of the verb<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We ventured<br />
			</em>is not.<br />
			These two verbs, therefore, follow the <strong>SVA</strong> patterns when used in 
			these senses.<br />
			There is an argument that many so-called prepositional verbs such as
			<em>account,
				acquaint,
				adhere,
				allude,
				amount,
				conceive </em>[as in<em> imagine</em>]<em>,
				consist,
				count, long,
				rely</em> and <em>vouch</em> also fall into the category because 
			they are intransitive in use but require a prepositional phrase 
			complement.<br />
			They are often categorised as verbs with dependent prepositions and 
			may be considered transitive if taken with the preposition or 
			intransitive and followed by a compulsory complement.<br />
			For more, see the guide to multi-word verbs, linked below.</p>
			<p>A further class of monotransitive verbs are called <strong>
			reflexive verbs</strong> (see below).</p>

			<dl>

				<span class="style_underline">to</span> her father<br />

				<dt><em>for</em> + the indirect 
				object</dt>
				<dd>suggests that the object is the beneficiary of the action

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She baked me a cake<br />
				</em>shifts to:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She baked a cake
				<span class="style_underline">for</span> me<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She saved me a bit<br />
				</em>shifts to:
				<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he saved a bit <span class="style_underline">for</span> me</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Occasionally, a verb may take either <em>to </em>or<em> for</em> 
			depending on its meaning so we allow both:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She taught the class for me </em>(i.e.,
			<em>instead of me</em>)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She taught chemistry to me
			</em>(i.e., <em>instructed</em>)<br />and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They left the money for me </em>(i.e., <em>
			allowed to remain</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>His father left the money to him </em>(i.e., <em>
			bequeathed</em>)<br />and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He paid the money to her </em>(i.e., <em>gave</em>)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He paid the money for her </em>(i.e., <em>instead of her</em>)<br />The verb <em>ask</em> is also slightly irregular because it can 
			be formed using <em>of</em> in the dative shift with:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I asked the man a question<br />
			</em>shifting to:<br /><em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked a question of the man.</em></p>
			<p>A few verbs for stylistic reasons will only appear with or 
			without this dative shift.&nbsp; This is a purely idiomatic effect 
			with no rule to follow so we allow, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She introduced me to the teacher</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She introduced the teacher me</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me a break</em><br />

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Give a break to me<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They bet me five dollars<br />
			</em>not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They bet five dollars to me</em></p>
			<p>Other verbs which cannot be used with the <em>to</em> or <em>for</em> 
			dative shift are:<br /><em>allow, call, charge, consider, cost, fine, name, permit, refuse, 
			spare </em>and <em>wish.<br />
			</em>So, while we allow, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He allowed the audience three questions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They cost us too much money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spared me some time<br />
			</em>etc., we do not allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He allowed three questions to / for the audience<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They charged $400 to / for him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They wished Happy Christmas to / for me</em></p>

				<p>The distinction between the use of <em>to </em> or<em> for</em> as the 
			choice in the prepositional phrase is mostly a semantic issue:</p>
			<ul class="smallredbullet">
				<li>If the object is the <strong>target</strong> of the verb,
				<em>to</em> is preferred so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They brought the food to us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paid to money to him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read a story to the children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They gave the money to their lawyer</em></li>
				<li>If the object is the <strong>beneficiary</strong> of the 
				verb, <em>for</em> is preferred so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bought the car for her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cooked a meal for them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wrote an essay for him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tailor made a coat for her</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some verbs which signify that the indirect object is the 
			beneficiary can <strong>only</strong> be used with <em>for</em> + the indirect object 
			dative shift and they include:<br />
			<em>allocate, bake, build, buy, catch, cause, cook, construct, cut, 
			design, dig, draw, earn find, get, make, order, pour, prepare, 
			print, save, set, wash </em>and <em>win</em>.&nbsp; So, while we 
			allow, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They allocated some seats for us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They caused some trouble for us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She designed a house for me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They ordered lunch for us</em><br />
			and so on, we cannot have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *They built a house to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She poured a drink to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He printed the letter to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The hotel washed a shirt to me</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p>Other ditransitive verbs are slightly more forgiving but one 
			form is often strongly preferred.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They asked her a question<br />
			</em>not usually<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They asked a question to her</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I owed her the money</em><br />
			not usually<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I owed the money to her<br />
			</em>If the less preferred option is the dative shift, it is often a 
			case of marking the indirect object for emphasis.</p>
			<p>We saw above that the dative shift cannot be used when the direct 
			object is a nominalised <em>that-</em>clause and the same applies to 
			nominalised <em>wh-</em>clauses so we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told him that she would be late</em><br />
			but not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *She told that she would be late to him<br />
			</em>and we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She taught the class what they needed</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She taught what they needed to the class</em></p>
			<p>The dative shift or alternation is often the preferred way of 
			marking the rheme of the sentence in a way that makes it the natural 
			theme of the following clause so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She read the children a story ...</em><br />
			is naturally followed by:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... which they loved</em><br />
			but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She a read a story to the children ...</em><br />
			is more naturally followed by:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and they went to sleep happily.</em></p>

			<p>A distinction sometimes made between verbs is whether the word is 
			functioning reciprocally or not.<br />
			For example, these are non-reciprocal uses:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary was talking to us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John and Peter fought in the war<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary and Ann shouted at me</em><br />
			and reciprocally, they may be expressed as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary and we were talking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John and Peter were fighting over a toy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary and Ann shouted at each other</em><br />
			When used reciprocally, such verbs often take a reciprocal pronoun 
			as their objects, <em>each other, one another</em> etc. or an 
			adverbial, <em>together, with each other </em>etc.</p>
			<p>Reflexive verbs, on the other hand, are those in which the 
			subject and the object are the same.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was washing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog was scratching</em><br />
			in which, because the object is omitted, we assume it to be <em>herself</em> 
			and <em>itself</em> respectively.<br />
			English makes little use of reflexive verbs.&nbsp; They occur, for 
			example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked herself a question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He poured himself a drink</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			In other languages, however, reflexive verbs are very extensively 
			used and will include verbs such as: a<em>pologise, brag, call, 
			change, complain, decide, hide, lie, prepare, shower, (un)dress, 
			sit, swim, talk, worry</em> and hundreds more.</p>
			<p>Reflexive verb use in English is often signalled by the use of a 
			reflexive pronoun if any ambiguity is to be avoided:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was talking to herself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog was scratching itself</em></p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>The rule: A potentially transitive verb used with no object will 
			normally be understood to be operating reciprocally or reflexively.</strong></p>

			<p>English is far laxer than many languages in allowing verbs to be 
			used with and without an object.&nbsp; The phenomenon is known as
			<strong>ambitransitivity</strong> and applies to a range of verbs.<br />
			In other languages, when such verbs are used with an object, they 
			are often made reflexive so, for example, in English we can allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I washed</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I washed the car</em><br />
			as well as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I broke the cup</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cup broke</em><br />
			In other languages, such as most Romance languages, that is not 
			possible and the form without an object will translate as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I washed myself</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cup broke itself</em><br />
			Many common verbs, such as <em>break, drive, finish, manage, smoke, turn</em> 
			and <em>write</em> etc., are two-faced in this way and can be transitive or intransitive.<br />
			There are three sorts of these:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Those in which the <strong>meaning remains</strong> whether transitive or 
				intransitive.<br />
				For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He only smokes in the garden<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He smokes a pipe<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I drove for hours<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I drove my father's car<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I flew to Nice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I flew the helicopter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ate at 6<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ate dinner at 6<br />
				</em>The verb <em>call</em> is slightly anomalous because 
				intransitively it means <em>visit</em> or <em>telephone</em> and 
				transitively it only means <em>telephone</em>:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I called at 5 but you were out<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called at six but you didn't answer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called him repeatedly but he didn't answer</em><br />The verb also has a transitive-only use with an object 
				complement meaning <em>name</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We called the cat George</em></li>
				<li>Those in which there is a variably substantial <strong>difference in 
				meaning</strong> depending on how they are used.<br />
				For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shone the light on the desk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun shone brightly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child grew quickly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It grew dark<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grow potatoes on my allotment</em><br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She left early<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left the keys on the table<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked to London<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked the dog<br />
				</em>(There is another pseudo-transitive use of the verb <em>walk</em> as 
				in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We walked six miles<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We walked a good hour</em><br />but these are better seen as reduced prepositional phrases for
				<em>for six miles</em> and <em>for a good hour </em>respectively.<br />The verb 
				<em>work</em> as in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I worked an hour</em><br />may be considered similarly as an intransitive use with a 
				reduced prepositional phrase, <em>for an hour</em>.)</li>
				<li>Those in which the <strong>nature of the subject alters</strong> depending on 
				how they are used (usually the choice is animate for transitive 
				uses and inanimate in intransitive uses but it may also concern 
				human <em>vs</em>. non-human entities).<br />
				For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glass fell and broke<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I broke my glasses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dropped the subject<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain dropped on my head<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bomb exploded<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I exploded the bomb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I galloped the horse down the hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The horse galloped down the hill</em><ol class="smallredbullet">
					<li>When they are transitive, they command one of the three transitive 
			clause structures and when intransitive they need SV or SVA only.</li>
					<li>Some transitive verbs can be mono- or di-transitive and the same 
			considerations apply: when they are ditransitive they require a 
			different clause structure from when they are used monotransitively 
			(see above).</li>
				</ol>

			</table>
			<p>There are a few verbs in English which derive from the same (or a 
			closely connected) root but have transitive and intransitive 
			variants.<br />
			For example, <em>rise</em> and <em>raise</em> derive from the same 
			source (the Old English <em>ræran</em>, <em>rear</em>) but the first 
			is intransitive and the second transitive.&nbsp; There are others, 
			for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He rose early</em> (intransitive)<br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He raised the question</em> (transitive)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They are lying on the beach</em> (intransitive)<br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They are laying the foundations</em> (transitive)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He sat near the table</em> (intransitive)<br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He set it near the table</em> (transitive)</p>
			<p>Other pairs of verbs which are unrelated in terms of origin also 
			form transitive-intransitive pairs.&nbsp; In English, for example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>fall</em> is intransitive but <em>drop</em> is often 
				transitive:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ball fell<br />
				</em>vs.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She dropped the ball<br />
				</em>(But note the change to an inanimate subject which allows 
				the intransitive use:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The price dropped<br />
				</em>and the transitive verb<em> fell</em>, meaning <em>cut down</em> 
				as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She felled the trees at the end of the garden</em>)</li>
				<li><em>speak</em> is usually intransitive but <em>tell</em> is 
				transitive (often ditransitive):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke at the meeting<br />
				</em>vs.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me the truth</em></li>
				<li><em>die</em> is intransitive but <em>kill</em> is transitive<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He died in 1940<br />
				</em>vs.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She killed him in 1940</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This sort of pairing is, unsurprisingly, not parallelled in most 
			other languages and causes a good deal of inter-lingual error.</p>
			<p>Some other verbs take on slightly different meaning when used 
			transitively or intransitively. For example<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He ran across the garden</em> (intransitive)<br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He ran a good business</em> (transitive)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I can manage alone</em> (intransitive)<br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He managed the school</em> (transitive)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The plane flew </em>(intransitive)<br />
			vs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He flew the plane</em> (transitive)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She called at 6</em> (intransitive)<br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She called her friends</em> (monotransitive)<br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She called me an idiot </em>(ditransitive)</p>

			<p>&dagger; These four verbs are deeply confusing because they all mean 
			roughly the same thing although some are used with increasing 
			formality and rarity.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke early today<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke Mary early today<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wakened early today<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wakened Mary early today<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I awoke early today<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I awoke Mary early today<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I awakened early today<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I awakened Mary early today</em><br />
			are all possible although some are rare and literary.<br />
			The verbs <em>wake</em> and <em>awake</em> are both irregular 
			(although AmE usage is often to regularise them).&nbsp; The <em>a</em>-adjective,
			<em>awake</em>, derives from the third of these.<br />
			Only <em>wake</em> is regularly used with the adverb particle <em>up</em>.<br />
			The verbs <em>awaken</em> and <em>waken</em> are often used 
			metaphorically as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It awakened unhappy memories<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's loud enough to waken the dead</em></p>

			<p>It is sometimes suggested that all transitive verbs can form 
			passive structures.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>Monotransitive verbs form passives such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary wrote the paper &rarr; The paper was 
				written by Mary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They elected him president → He was elected president</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Ditransitive verbs can have two different passive forms:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She read the children a story → The 
				children were read a story / A story was read to the children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave me the money → The money was given to me / I was 
				given the money<br />
				</em>etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In these cases, the subject of the active clause is frequently 
			omitted but is either understood or too obvious to warrant mention.&nbsp; 
			The erstwhile subject has become the <strong>agent</strong> and the 
			erstwhile object becomes the <strong>patient</strong> in such 
			constructions.</p>
			<p>However, semantically, some verbs resist the passive even though 
			they are transitive.&nbsp; So, for example, we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *His father is resembled by him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is fitted by that coat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A pint is held by this bottle</em><br />
			For more on these restrictions and a fuller list, see the guide to 
			the passive, linked below.</p>
			<p>A slightly peculiar set of verbs in English can be used in what 
			is called the ergative case.&nbsp; That simply means that what we 
			normally understand to be the object of the verb is, grammatically, 
			the subject of the verb.&nbsp; Structurally, they appear 
			intransitive but semantically we can disentangle the object and the 
			subject.&nbsp; So, for example, we find:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kettle boiled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window opened<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shirts sold well</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The garden flooded</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			These are effectively transitive uses of the verb with the subject 
			understood or implied which allows the object to be raised to the 
			subject position.&nbsp; In the terms of this guide, they are verbs 
			whose normal clause structure is <strong>SVO</strong><sub><strong>D</strong> </sub>but which appear to 
			take an intransitive <strong>SV(A)</strong> structure.&nbsp; Grammatically, they do, 
			semantically, they don't.</p>
			<p>A limited set of verbs in English are conventionally used in the 
			ergative case and they include:</p>
			<ul class="smallgreenbullet">
				<li>Verbs referring to opening and closing, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door slammed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window opened<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shutter banged<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer shut</em></li>
				<li>Verbs referring to starting and stopping, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The noise ceased<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulties commenced<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reaction stopped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The machine started first time</em></li>
				<li>Verbs referring to damage, for example<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window broke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The balloon burst<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The paper yellowed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The material tore</em></li>
				<li>Verbs applied to ways of cooking, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The potatoes cooked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soup boiled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sauce thickened<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The supper burnt</em></li>
				<li>Verbs suggesting an increase or decrease, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The numbers decreased<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The swelling enlarged<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The puddle expanded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain lessened</li>
				<li>Verbs applied to transport and vehicles<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plane banked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truck reversed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boat sailed away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car moved</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Ergative verbs are common in English and sometimes referred to as 
			labile or ambitransitive verbs.&nbsp; On this site, they aren't and 
			the term ambitransitive is reserved for verbs which can be 
			intransitive or transitive, often with a change of meaning.</p>

			<p>A search of the internet for stative verbs will provide you with 
			plenty of lists of verbs which, it is averred, are stative in that 
			they do not and cannot represent progressive events.&nbsp; The 
			upshot is that some websites, coursebooks and, alas, teachers, will 
			tell learners that such and such a verb is stative and dynamic use 
			in a progressive form is wrong.<br />
			The admonition is to say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love fish and chips</em><br />
			rather than<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I am loving fish and chips</em><br />
			and that is of course perfectly acceptable advice.<br />
			However, to assume from that that something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I don't know if he's happy but he's 
			clearly loving the attention</em><br />
			is wrong, is perverse and misleading.</p>
			<p>There is 
			a guide in the initial plus section which sets out the basics of 
			stative and dynamic verb uses and we 
			won't repeat that here.&nbsp; There is a link to the guide below for 
			you, if you would like to refer to it.<br />
			The usual list of verbs is something like:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Verbs of possession or relations between things</strong></dt>
				<dd>This list will include verbs such as
				<span class="style_black"><em>be, appear, consist, contain, 
				cost, have, depend, fit, include, involve, matter, mean, measure, owe, own, possess, seem, weigh</em></span> and 
				so on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Verbs of sensations</strong></dt>
				<dd>This list will include <span class="style_black"><em>feel, 
				hear, look, see, smell, sound, taste, touch</em></span></dd>
				<dt><strong>Verbs referring to emotional states</strong></dt>
				<dd>This list includes <span class="style_black"><em>adore, 
				appreciate, care, desire, dislike, hate, hope, like, love, mind, 
				need, prefer, value, want, wish</em></span></dd>
				<dt><strong>Verbs referring to mental processes and states</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is a longer list and includes <span class="style_black">
				<em>agree, astonish, believe, concern, deny, disagree, 
				doubt, expect, flabbergast, forget, imagine, impress, know,  
				please, promise, realise, recognise, remember, satisfy, suppose, 
				surprise, think, understand</em></span></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>There is no denying that many of these 
			verbs do occur much more frequently in simple tense forms than in 
			progressive ones.&nbsp; On the other hand, a few, such as <em>
			measure</em>, are actually more frequently used dynamically.&nbsp; 
			Of the others, most are used both statively and dynamically with, 
			often, a shift in meaning.<br />
			To select just two from each category, here's what is meant:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Verbs of possession or relations between things</dt>
				<dd>Stative use:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She appears unhappy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have a small cottage in the country</em><br />
				Dynamic use:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is appearing in the play<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are having trouble with their son</em></dd>
				<dt>Verbs of sensations</dt>
				<dd>Stative use:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She felt sad about that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sound a little aggressive</em><br />
				Dynamic use:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is not feeling well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The engine's sounding a bit rough</em></dd>
				<dt>Verbs referring to emotional states</dt>
				<dd>Stative use:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hoped he would be early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They wished the rain would stop</em><br />
				Dynamic use:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was hoping for better weather<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are wishing her happy birthday later</em></dd>
				<dt>Verbs referring to mental processes and states</dt>
				<dd>Stative use:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She denied the theft<br />

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is denying all charges<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was forgetting all about the need to book a table</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>It is, in other words, rare to discover a verb in the lists above 
			which cannot be used dynamically and all of them form progressive 
			forms in non-finite clauses so we routinely allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Containing only four grams, the bottle is 
			tiny<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending how he feels, he'll be here later, I expect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing everyone's already here, let's start<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tasting the soup again, the chef pronounced it ready<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caring little for long walks, I stayed at home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needing some supplies, we went to the supermarket<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Realising the danger, they backed away from the edge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding his difficulty, we didn't press the matter</em></p>
			<p>It is probably clear by now why we said 
			at the outset of this section that simply labelling verbs as stative 
			or dynamic is an inadequate and potentially harmful approach to 
			take.</p>

				<li><strong>Managing error</strong><br />
				Other languages do things differently.<br />
				Verbs which are transitive in English may not be in other 
				languages and <em>vice versa</em>.&nbsp; When we handle errors 
				such as, e.g.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I came the party<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*He made me anger<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*I gave the money the man</em><br />
				and so on, we need to be alert to the fact that underlying them 
				all is probably a confusion of verb type and clause structure.&nbsp; 
				In these examples, it's possibly an unawareness that <em>come</em> is 
				intransitive, that <em>make </em>(in this sense of <em>cause</em>) 
				demands SVOC<sub>O</sub> and that ditransitive verbs need the 
				structure SVO<sub>I</sub>O<sub>D</sub>.</li>
				<li><strong>Embedding verbs in clauses</strong><br />
				If we are presenting verb lexis, it is imperative that we do so 
				in a way that makes its nature (transitive <em>vs</em>. intransitive 
				etc.) clear and that we use clause structures with the verbs.&nbsp; 
				If you simply explain the meaning of <em>happen</em> without 
				getting learners to notice that it's intransitive, for example, 
				you will have directly contributed to:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It happened an accident</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Eating the elephant</strong><br />
				Clause structures in English and the nature of verbs which 
				demand them are hard to learn.&nbsp; There is little point in 
				presenting language for analysis by your learners which 
				conflates three or four different clause structures in the same 
				text.&nbsp; That will confuse more than it enlightens.</li>
				<li><strong>Noticing</strong><br />
				Much is made of the need to help our learners notice language in 
				context.&nbsp; However, it is unlikely, for example, that your 
				learners will notice the nature of the object complement in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I swept the house clean</em><br />
				and be able to contrast it with the adverbial in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I swept the house thoroughly</em><br />
				unless it is explicitly pointed out or highlighted in some way, 
				like this:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I swept the house 
				<span class="style_red"><strong>clean</strong></span></em> 
				(<em>What do I know about the house?</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I swept the house 
				<span class="style_red"><strong>thoroughly</strong></span></em> 
				(<em>How did I sweep?</em>).</li>
				<li><strong>Meta-language can help</strong><br />
				Many teachers, in a laudable effort not to overload their 
				learners, avoid the use of terms such as object, subject, 
				transitive etc.&nbsp; That is not always wise because the terms 
				are very useful (and used in dictionaries) especially for 
				learners studying alone.</li>
				<li><strong>Parsing the structures</strong><br />
				Some learners respond well to tree diagrams (as above) from which they can 
				visualise the structures.&nbsp; Some even enjoy making their 
				own.</li>

		<p>Most verbs in English are regular, taking the past tense and past 
		participle ending with either -<em>d</em> or -<em>ed</em>.<br />
		There are over 650 irregular verbs in English, otherwise called strong 
		verbs, but many are obsolete and some very rarely used.&nbsp; Most of 
		these verbs make a change internally to a vowel or consonant, a process 
		known as vowel mutation or, sometimes, stem mutation.</p>
			<p>Here, for pedagogical use, is a list in 
		memorable groups which share characteristics rather than alphabetically (which is the way most 
		commercial teaching materials do it).<br />
			The fact that some verbs form rhyming groups is a powerful memory 
			aide.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="list" height="1202" src="../../imagesgraphics/irregular_verbs_list.png" width="775" /></p>
			<p>This is not a complete list, of course, and excludes some rarer or obsolete words 
			(such as <em>stride</em> and <em>beget</em>).&nbsp; The list also does not include 
			prefixed verbs whose irregularity can be surmised such as, e.g., 
			<em>forecast, misspend, unlearn, rebuild, withstand, underlie </em>and so on.<br />
			You will see that the table includes some phonemic symbols.&nbsp; 
			You don't need to know them to use the chart (but you could learn 
			them).<br />
			The verbs which do not fit into any categories must be learned 
			as single items.</p>

			<p>A good many verbs are slightly odd.&nbsp; Here's an alphabetical 
			list:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
			<li><em>be<br />
			</em>has tense forms derived from different Old 
		English verbs which accounts for <em>was</em> and <em>were </em>etc. as 
			well as <em>am, are, is.</em>&nbsp; 
			This is known as suppletion, the derivations are different so the 
			words look unconnected.&nbsp; The verb is, in fact, a conglomeration 
			of a number of verbs used in various dialects of Old English.</li>
			<li><em>bear</em><br />
			the past participle is spelled <em>born</em> 
			when it is used in the passive or to refer to birth:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born in 1989<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The request will be born in mind</em></li>
			<li><em>cost<br />
			</em>is often regular when it means <em>calculate a price </em>as 
			in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She costed the work at over £100</em></li>
			<li><em>dive<br />
			</em>is regular in British English but 
		irregular in American English (the past is <em>dove</em>)</li>
				<li><em>fit</em><br />
				is irregular and unchanging in AmE so slots into the first 
				section of the chart after <em>hurt</em>.&nbsp; However, there 
				is some evidence that when the verb is used transitively to mean
				<em>make to measure</em>, as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tailor fitted her for a new dress</em><br />
				it is often used as a regular verb as it is in BrE.</li>
				<li><em>go</em><br />
				has a past tense form derived from different Old 
		English verbs which accounts for <em>went</em> (previously the past of
				<em>wend</em>).&nbsp; This is another case of suppletion.</li>
			<li><em>hang<br />
			</em>is regular when it means <em>execute</em> but irregular in other 
		senses:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hung the picture on the wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was hanged in 1834</em></li>
			<li><em>lie<br />
			</em>is regular when the sense is <em>tell an untruth</em> as in, 
			e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lied about the money</em></li>
			<li><em>pay<br />
			</em>as in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They payed out a rope<br />
			</em>is regular</li>
			<li><em>plead<br />
			</em>is regular in BrE but usually irregular in AmE (<em>pled, 
			pled</em>).&nbsp; It may also be used irregularly in most varieties 
			when the legal sense is being applied.</li>
			<li><em>shine<br />
			</em>is irregular when it refers to light but regular when it 
		means <em>polish</em>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun shone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shined my shoes<br />
			</em>When the use is metaphorical, either form is used:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His eyes shined / shone with pleasure</em></li>
			<li><em>sneak<br />
			</em>is regular but the past form <em>snuck</em> is 
			attested from the late 19th century and making a comeback</li>
			<li><em>strike<br />
			</em>actually mutates from /aɪ/ to /ʌ/ but 
			is included in the group that mutates from /ɪ/ to /ʌ/</li>
			<li><em>wrought<br />
			</em>was originally the past tense of <em>
			work</em> (which is now regular in English).&nbsp; It still exists 
			as a participle adjective in, e.g., <em>wrought iron</em>.&nbsp; The 
			past forms of <em>wreak</em> are in principle regular (<em>wreaked, 
			wreaked</em>) but it has become common to see <em>wrought</em> used 
			as the past of that verb, perhaps by analogy to <em>teach</em> and
			<em>seek</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are some other oddities affecting certain verbs and 
			varieties of English:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
			<li><em>wake, awake, waken</em> and <em>awaken<br />
			</em>all mean the same and 
			can be used with and without a direct object.&nbsp; The last three 
			are more literary and rarer and the first two are often regular in 
			American English.</li>
			<li>some past participle adjectives<br />
			come from earlier forms: <em>
			beholden, 
			bereft, clad, cloven, drunken, forlorn, forsaken, graven, laden, misbegotten, 
			misshapen, shod, shrunken, smitten, strewn, stricken, sunken, swollen, wrought</em></li>
			<li><em>run, become </em>and<em> come<br />
			</em>are slightly odd in 
			having only one change but to the past form not the participle</li>
			<li>the verbs <em>read, mean, leap, deal, dream</em> and <em>lean<br />
			</em>mutate the vowel in the past forms, from /iː/ to /e/, with no 
			spelling change but the similarly spelled <em>hear</em> mutates from 
			/ɪə/ to /ɜː/</li>
			<li>verbs that have 
		regular <em>-ed</em> endings and irregular <em>-t </em>endings<br />
			(such as <em>learn, dream, 
		smell</em> etc.) are more often used in the regular form in American 
		than British English</li>
			<li><em>gotten<br />
			</em>is the Old English 
		form of the past participle of <em>get</em> which American English has 
		retained in certain senses</li>
			</ul>
