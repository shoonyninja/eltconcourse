			<p>English is slightly different from many languages insofar as the 
			tense form in some subordinate clauses (or dependent &ndash; the terms are interchangeable) is not what one 
			would expect.&nbsp; This leads to learner errors such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'll hang out the washing when the rain will stop<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I will tell him when I will see him<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*She will speak to the boss unless he won't have time</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't care who will come</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Many languages happily allow, indeed demand, that the tense in the 
			subordinate clause matches the time being spoken of.&nbsp; English 
			frequently does not, so the correct version of the four examples is:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll hang out the washing when the rain stops<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I will tell him when I see him<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She will speak to the boss unless he doesn't have time<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I don't care who comes<br />
			</em>This is, naturally, non-intuitive for speakers of languages 
			which are stricter about applying the right tense marker appropriate 
			to the time reference.</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>These are probably the most familiar.&nbsp; The subordinating 
			conjunctions which most often link these clauses to the main clause 
			are <span class="style_black">highlighted</span> here:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style32">
				<li><em>I will talk to him </em><span class="style_black"><em>
				after</em></span><em> we have had lunch</em></li>
				<li><em>He will arrive </em><span class="style_black"><em>just 
				as</em></span><em> the party finishes</em></li>
				<li><em>She will explain </em><span class="style_black"><em>
				before</em></span><em> the meeting finishes</em></li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Once</em></span><em> we have 
				the tickets we will be able to get in</em></li>
				<li><em>I will wait </em><span class="style_black"><em>till</em></span><em> 
				she arrives</em></li>
				<li><em>They won't come </em><span class="style_black"><em>until</em></span><em> 
				we have left</em></li>
				<li><em>She will be here </em><span class="style_black"><em>
				whenever</em></span><em> we need her</em></li>
				<li><em>They are going to arrive </em><span class="style_black">
				<em>when</em></span><em> the race starts</em></li>
				<li><em>I will do that </em><span class="style_black"><em>as 
				soon as</em></span><em> you want me to</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In all these cases, the logic of the tense structure seen from 
			the point of view of the speaker is undermined in English.&nbsp; 
			Logically, the forms should be<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I will talk to him after we will have had lunch</em> (because both are 
			relational future events)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She will explain before the meeting will finish</em> (because both 
			events are set in absolute time in the future)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She will be here whenever we will need her</em> (because we are talking 
			about two future states)<br />
			and so on.<br />
			In fact, some languages <strong>require</strong> this form of 
			tense structure so, for learners from some language backgrounds, this is by no means 
			easy.</p>

			<p>These are often taught as if they were a separate (and slightly 
			mysterious) category but they fall into the same pattern as temporal 
			clauses and can be taught together with them.&nbsp; They share 
			grammatical characteristics.<br />
			The subordinating conjunctions which most often link these clauses 
			to the main clause are <span class="style_black">highlighted</span> 
			here:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style32">
				<li><em>I will talk to him </em> <span class="style_black"><em>if</em></span><em> we 
				meet</em></li>
				<li><em>He will arrive </em> <span class="style_black"><em>unless</em></span><em> the 
				train is late</em></li>
				<li><em>She will pay </em> <span class="style_black"><em>as long as</em></span><em> the 
				meal isn't too expensive</em></li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Provided (that)</em></span><em> we have the 
				tickets we will be able to get in</em></li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Given that</em></span><em> the meeting has 
				finished I will be able to get home early</em></li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Assuming (that)</em></span><em> the train 
				is on time, we'll be with you around 10</em></li>
				<li><em>She will be here </em> <span class="style_black"><em>presuming</em></span><em> 
				she has the time</em></li>
				<li><em>They are going to come </em> <span class="style_black">
				<em>whatever</em></span><em> 
				their mother says</em></li>
				<li><em>I will complain </em> <span class="style_black"><em>even if</em></span><em> the 
				boss is there</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Again, the natural tendency in most languages is to use the 
			logical tense in both clauses, leading to errors such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I will talk if we will meet<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*Provided that we will have the tickets we will be able to get in<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*They are going to come whatever their mother will say</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			The fact that time and tense are more firmly linked in many 
			languages explains much about the difficulties learners encounter 
			with English conditional structures.</p>

			<p>There is one conjunction which operates differently in AmE and 
			BrE:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will take her laptop in case it's needed</em><br />
			is differently understood.<br />
			In British English, this means<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			S<em>he will take her laptop </em><strong><em>and</em></strong><em> 
			use it if she needs it</em><br />
			In American English, this might mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will take her laptop </em><strong><em>only if</em></strong><em> 
			there's a need for it</em></p>

			</table>
			
			<p>Dependent clauses in English also act as the object of verbs and 
			in these cases, too, there is a tendency for English to use a 
			present-tense form in the subordinate clause but the situation is 
			slightly complicated by the fact that if the main clause refers to 
			the present, the future is often used in the subordinate clause and
			<em>vice versa</em>.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will want him to explain <span class="style_black">what he 
			thinks about it<br />
			</span></em>main clause refers to the future;
			<span class="style_black">subordinate clause</span> is in the 
			present<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want him to explain <span class="style_black">what he will do 
			about it<br />
			</span></em>main clause in the present;
			<span class="style_black">subordinate clause</span> in the future<br />
			This, again, is non-intuitive for many learners whose languages 
			do not allow this swapping around of tense forms.</p>
			<p>Other nominal clauses produce similarly confusing tense forms 
			especially after certain verbs to do with telling and thinking 
			(verbal and projecting processes, technically).&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us know <span class="style_black">how it turns out</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Tell us <span class="style_black">what you need</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It doesn't matter to me <span class="style_black">what he thinks</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I don't care <span class="style_black">who comes</span></em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Naturally, this leads to error such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Let me know what you will want </em>(which is only possible if 
			the <em>wanting</em> is perceived in the future)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't mind who will come</em><br />
			etc.</p>

			<p>Elsewhere on this site, when
			<a href="../../tenses/tensesandaspects/futuretime.html">analysing 
			future forms</a>, the anomalous nature of the modal <em>will</em> 
			has been discussed.&nbsp; The verb is polysemous in 
			that it can refer to a predicted future as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The forecast says it <span class="style_black">will</span> rain<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I <span class="style_black">will / shall</span> be thirty tomorrow<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The train <span class="style_black">will</span> arrive at 6</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			but is also used to express current (i.e., <strong>present</strong>) 
			volition as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'<span class="style_black">ll</span> cook tonight<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I'<span class="style_black">ll</span> help you</em><br />
			<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will</span> you come?</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			When used in its future-prediction meaning, the verb <em>will</em> 
			can only appear once in the sentence, for example (and see above):<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will come if you ask<br />
			</em>not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He will come if you will 
			ask</em>).<br />
			However, when <em>will</em> clearly carries the volitional sense, 
			the 'rule' is broken so we can have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will marry you if you will promise to give up drinking<br />
			</em>compare<em><br />
			I will marry you if you promise to give up 
			drinking<br />
			</em>and<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I won't pay you if you won't finish the work<br />
			</em>compare<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't pay you if you don't finish the work<br />
			</em>In both those examples, the first modal refers to the future 
			and the second modal refers to volition, 
			not a predicted future, so <em>will</em> can appear twice in the 
			sentence with different meanings.</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>When the main clause is in the past tense, all kinds of tense 
			forms in the <span class="style_black"><em>subordinate clause</em></span> 
			become possible.&nbsp; The rule is</p>
			<p class="indentpara">If the main and subordinate 
			clauses have different time references, English uses the tense that 
			is relevant to the time of speaking.<br />
			</p>
			<p>Other languages, needless to say, have their own rules and 
			conventions and they are usually different.</p>
			<p>Examples will help:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style32">
				<li><em>I cooked the dinner <span class="style_black">because he 
				was too busy</span><br />
				</em>both main and subordinate clauses refer to the same time so 
				the same tense is used for both</li>
				<li><em>I cooked the dinner <span class="style_black">because he 
				was going to be busy<br />
				</span> </em>past main clause relating to a future-in-the-past 
				subordinate clause</li>
				<li><em>I cooked <span class="style_black">so he won't have to<br />
				</span> 
				</em>past main clause relating to a future seen from now</li>
				<li><em>I cooked dinner <span class="style_black">so he has time 
				to work<br />
				</span></em>past main clause relating to a present condition</li>
				<li><em>The dinner was better <span class="style_black">than he 
				expected<br />
				</span> </em>past main clause and past subordinate clause 
				relating to the same time</li>
				<li><em>The dinner was better <span class="style_black">than 
				he'll ever have again<br />
				</span> </em>past main clause relating to a future seen from now</li>
				<li><em>The dinner was better <span class="style_black">than he 
				thinks<br />
				</span> </em>past main clause relating to a present condition</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The tendency in English to use a tense form relevant to the point 
			of speaking can confuse learners and explains, incidentally, some 
			mixed conditional forms.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing he brought the car</span>, 
			we can get a lift to the hotel<br />
			</em>where the bringing of the car is in the past but getting a lift 
			is in the future.<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you haven't already told him</em></span><em>, 
			I won't mention it<br />
			</em>where his not being informed is seen as a present condition 
			although expressed in perfect aspect and the not mentioning is seen 
			in the future.</p>

			<p>The subjunctive, to which there is <a href="../modality/subjunctive.html">a 
			separate guide</a>, is quite rare in English (but very common in 
			many languages).&nbsp; The <span class="style_black"><em>subjunctive</em></span> 
			occurs in, e.g.:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Present subjunctive:</dt>
				<dd><em>The proposal is that the road <span class="style_black">be
				</span>resurfaced<br />
			Whatever <span class="style_black">be</span> your reason, it can't be allowed<br />
				I'll take my coat lest it <span class="style_black">rain</span></em></dd>
				<dt>Past subjunctive:</dt>
				<dd><em>What would the boss think if he 
				<span class="style_black">were</span> late?<br />
			I took a coat lest it <span class="style_black">rain</span><br />
			Suppose she <span class="style_black">were</span> listening ...</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The subjunctive, apart from in the semi-fixed, <em>if I were you</em> 
			form, is mostly confined to formal contexts and even there it is, 
			quite arguably, dying out and hardly worth teaching.<br />
			However, the language needs a replacement for it and this is where 
			we find the putative form of the modal auxiliary verb, <em>should</em>.</p>
			<p>All of the examples above can be rephrased using a putative form:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposal is that the road <span class="style_black">should</span> 
			be resurfaced<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Whatever <span class="style_black">should</span> be your reason, it 
			can't be allowed<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I'll take a coat lest it <span class="style_black">should</span> 
			rain<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			What would the boss think if he <span class="style_black">should</span> 
			be late?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I took a coat lest it <span class="style_black">should</span> rain<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Suppose she <span class="style_black">should</span> have been 
			listening</em> ...</p>
			<p>It is important to understand that <em>should </em>in this use does 
			not carry its common sense of <em>ought to</em>.&nbsp; It is, 
			somewhat formally, a replacement for the even more formal 
			subjunctive.&nbsp; It is also not appearing here in its guise as the 
			first-person equivalent of <em>would</em>.<br />
			Structurally, the form is not difficult but the question of style is 
			more complex so it can be taught in set phrases quite readily.&nbsp; 
			For example, all of these are semi-fixed expressions which can be 
			learnt without any knowledge of the complexities:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a pity that X <span class="style_black">should</span> be Y
			</em>(e.g., <em>It's a pity that it should be so cold </em>[formal])<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I'm surprised that X <span class="style_black">should</span> Y </em>(e.g., <em>I'm surprised that he 
			should threaten you </em>[quite formal])<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It worries me that X <span class="style_black">should</span> Y </em>(e.g., <em>It worries me that you 
			should have stayed out so late </em>[quite formal])<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			How <span class="style_black">should</span> I know? </em>[informal]<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Why <span class="style_black">should</span> X do Y? </em>(e.g., <em>Why should he be so insistent?
			</em>[neutral]<em><br />
			</em>and they are all putative uses of the verb but style varies 
			very considerably.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style31">
					<h2>The optative <em>wish</em></h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Allied to the use of the subjunctive is the verb <em>wish.&nbsp;
			</em>This is one realisation of the optative function and is 
			analysed elsewhere in <a href="../functions/suasion.html">the guide to suasion</a>.
			<em>
				&nbsp;</em>The optative is directed at events or things that we 
			cannot change so is often expressed using an unreal sense with
			<em>
				would
				</em>and the past tense of other modal auxiliary verbs.</p>
			<p>The subordinate clauses can be 
				connected with or without <em>that.</em></p>
			<p>Again, as we saw above, when the verb is used in a past-tense main 
			clause, it is the speaker's temporal state which determines the 
			tense in the dependent clause.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish (that) it would rain </em>(present tense of <em>wish</em> + past 
			of <em>will</em> for futurity)<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I wish (that) she could be here </em>(present tense of <em>wish</em> + past 
			of <em>can</em> for ability)<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I wished (that) it would rain </em>(past of <em>wish</em> + past of <em>

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished (that) she could have been there </em>(past of <em>wish</em> + 
			perfect form of <em>can</em> for ability)</p>
			<p>The verb is often followed by the subjunctive as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish (that) John were here<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I wish (that) she were nicer to him<br />
			</em>This use is often, at least informally, replaced by a simple 
			present as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish (that) John was here<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I wish (that) she was nicer to him<br />
			</em>but there are many who would judge this use as colloquial at 
			best, wrong at worst.</p><hr />

			<p>For teaching purposes, the analysis of tense in subordinate 
			clauses can be very fruitful, not least because it situates the 
			feared conditional in relation to all sorts of other types of 
			subordination which work in exactly the same ways.&nbsp; For 
			example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Once learners are familiar with temporal subordination such 
				as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll tell him when he comes<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I'm going to see him immediately after I have arrived<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He'll be busy so I'll help him with the work<br />
				</em>and so on, then conditional subordination such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll tell him if he comes<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I'm going to see him if I have time after work<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I'll help him if he's busy<br />
				</em>etc. becomes much more accessible and less mysterious.<br />
				Combining the presentation can overcome much difficulty.</li>
				<li>Making learners aware of the polysemous nature of the modal
				<em>will</em> is also fruitful because it explains apparently 
				anomalous constructions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he won't help we won't be able to finish in time</em><br />
				and also explains a great deal about the future forms in English 
				once learners know that, e.g., B's statement in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: There's no sugar!<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				B: Oh, I'll get some.&nbsp; The shop will be open until 6.</em><br />
				contains two distinct uses of <em>will. </em>&nbsp;The first 
				refers to B's <strong>current</strong> willingness (volition) 
				and not to the future at all.&nbsp; The second use is concerned 
				with the predicted <strong>future</strong> and is not to do with 
				volition.<br />
				In conditional sentences, such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it rains, the garden will get watered.</em><br />
				contains the predictive rather than volitional use of <em>will</em>.&nbsp; 
				Compare, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there's no sugar, I'll get some<br />
				</em>in which the word <em>will </em>refers to willingness, not 
				futurity.</li>
				<li>Getting away from the overly simplistic 'sequence of tenses' 
				idea in, e.g., reported speech and result clauses allows 
				learners to see the internal logic of tense use centred on the 
				speaker.&nbsp; E.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tells me he will be in London tomorrow</em> 
				<em><br />
				tomorrow</em> 
				refers to the speaker's temporal frame<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He won the lottery so will never work again<br />
				</em>the speaker's future<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He won the lottery so didn't work again<br />
				</em>the speaker's past<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He won the lottery so hasn't worked since<br />
				</em>the speaker's present understanding.</li>
				<li>Conditional forms in general lose much of their mystery.&nbsp; 
				Once <em>would</em> is seen as the past of <em>will</em>, forms 
				such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would help if you needed me<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He would help whenever he was asked</em><br />
				and the use of <em>wish </em>etc. become a good deal clearer.<br />
				Moreover, mixed conditionals and much else can only be properly 
				understood when the idea of the time frame being centred on the 
				speaker is grasped.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I had brought the car but didn't so won't be able to 
				take you<br />
				</em>is bewildering unless the speaker's temporal viewpoint is 
				considered.</li>
