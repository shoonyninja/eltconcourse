		<p>Because English language teachers are only concerned with the aspect 
		structure of one language, we tend to over-simplify the area.&nbsp; In 
		fact, there are lots of different aspects in languages.<br />
		English has a 
		range but uses only a few ways to distinguish between them.&nbsp; 
		Worse, there is no one-to-one equivalence between form and aspect in 
		English (or most other languages for that matter).<br />
		For example, take the following sentences:</p>
		<ol class="style_black">
			<li><em>I know.</em></li>
			<li><em>I have eaten.</em></li>
			<li><em>I walked to school as a child.</em></li>
			<li><em>I used to play football.</em></li>
			<li><em>He is still eating.</em></li>
			<li><em>I broke the window.</em></li>
			<li><em>I was playing football.</em></li>
			<li><em>Fish swim.</em></li>
			<li><em>It's going to rain.</em></li>
			<li><em>I dreamed all night.</em></li>
			<li><em>He called the help line every hour all day.</em></li>
			<li><em>He was banging on the door for hours.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>All these sentences can be referred to as different aspects of the 
		verb.&nbsp; Traditional English grammars, especially those written for 
		learners, will only identify three aspects in these 10 sentences.&nbsp; 
		These three are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Progressive or continuous aspect, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was 
				living in London</em></li>
				<li>Perfect, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have eaten</em></li>
				<li>Simple, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I broke the window</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is, even in English, a distinction between continuous and 
			progressive aspects, in fact, although the verb form often remains 
			the same.</p>
			<p>In 
			reality, there are more than that and in many languages they would be 
		distinguished grammatically using distinct verb forms, particles or 
		auxiliary constructions.<br />
		One at a time:</p>

				<td class="auto-style4" style="width: 12px">1</td>
				<td class="auto-style88"><em>I know.</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style89">This looks like a simple present tense 
				but in fact, it's in the <span class="styleredbold">continuous</span> 
				aspect because it describes a current state of affairs, not an 
				event or action.&nbsp; In that respect, it is in the same aspect 
				as<br /><em>&nbsp; <span class="style_black">&nbsp; She is wearing a hat.</span><br />
				</em>In some analyses, this example would be called stative because 
				it refers to a state rather than an event or action.</td>

				<td class="auto-style5"><em>I have eaten.</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style83">Most people will spot this as the
				<span class="styleredbold">perfect</span> aspect in English and 
				that is what it is.&nbsp; It draws attention to the fact that 
				the eating has a present relevance in some way.&nbsp; Indeed, 
				the reason this is called a <strong>present</strong> perfect form is that the 
				state applies to the present, not the past.&nbsp; It is the past 
				embedded in and changing the present.&nbsp; Perfect 
				aspect forms are always relative, showing the connection between 
				two times.</td>

				as a child</span><br />
				</em>in the same category.<br />
				Both of these can be referred to as <span class="style_brown">
				imperfect</span> (see below).<br />
				These are also examples of iterative senses because the action 
				was clearly repeated.&nbsp; However, that need not be the case 
				because, e.g.:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to have 
				a full head of dark hair but now it's all grey and 
				thin</em></span><br />
				is habitual in aspect but not iterative because it refers to a 
				state, not an action.&nbsp; The form with <em>would</em> is 
				usually iterative but <em>used to</em> can be either iterative 
				of continuous as well as habitual.</td>

				durative aspect (see below).&nbsp; In English we often also mark 
				this with adverbials such as <em>still, yet, continuously, 
				constantly, incessantly</em> etc.<br />
				The durative aspect may not always be signalled by the auxiliary
				<em>be</em> because semantically some verbs imply durative 
				events and actions.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dreamed all 
				night long</em></span><br />
				is clearly a durative aspect but the verb is simple in form 
				because of the meaning of <em>dream</em>.</td>

				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>
				<span class="style_black">The child was throwing stones at the

				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about to

				<td class="auto-style85" rowspan="2">In English, these similar 
				concepts may be expressed in the simple form (sentence 10) or in 
				the progressive form (sentence 11).<br />
				However, it's clear that the actions are not continuous in the sense expressed in sentence 7, but repeated 
				short, instantaneous events.&nbsp; They are continual, not 
				continuous.<br />
				The term for this is <span class="styleredbold">iterative</span> 
				and some languages will have a different verb form to express 
				this notion.<br />
				English also uses adverbials to signal the repeated nature of the 
				event such as <em>for hours and hours, while the band played, 
				again and again</em> etc. and it also reserves the form for what 
				are known as momentary verbs such as <em>bang, ring, click</em> 
				etc.<br />
				A good deal depends on the meaning of the verb in the selection 
				of this aspect.&nbsp; Some verbs, such as <em>hit, bang, break, 
				start</em> etc. may be referred to as instantaneous but others 
				such as <em>continue, persist, call, speak</em> etc. have 
				meanings which signal a longer lasting event.&nbsp; In the 
				second set of verbs, the same form signals not an iterative 
				aspect but a <span class="styleredbold">durative </span>(i.e., 
				long-lasting aspect).<br />
				In English it is rarely necessary and sometimes plain wrong to 
				select a progressive verb form with durative
				meanings (sentence 
				10. is an example and sentence 11. could be rephrased as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He banged on the door for hours</em><br />
				with no loss of meaning).</td>

		<p>That's not the end of the story and there are probably as many 
		different aspects again as are listed here.&nbsp; The point to 
		understand is that which aspects we analyse and consider significant 
		will depend on the structure of the language we are considering.</p>
		<p>In summary, we may identify eight aspects which can be signalled 
		either by tense forms or by adverbials (or both) in English.<br />
		Here's a 
		summary:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="summary" height="410" src="../../imagesgraphics/aspect_summary.png" width="930" /></p>
		<p>English, as we saw above, distinguishes in the form of the verb, 
		the use of auxiliaries and adverbials to show perfect, continuous, habitual, 
		prospective, iterative, durative, progressive and simple aspects.&nbsp; 
		However, there are many types of aspect which can be 
		distinguished purely by verb forms in other languages.</p>
			<p>It is also clear from the examples above that, with the exception of 
		perfect and progressive aspects, there is no one-to-one relationship in 
		English between verb form and aspect.&nbsp; This can confuse learners 
		whose languages are stricter in this regard, although many languages 
		exhibit the same kind of inconsistent marking and much is often left for 
		the reader / hearer to infer from context.</p>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>The habitual aspect<br />
			<img alt="habit" height="133" src="../../images/woman_smoking200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
			<dd>In a sentence such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I worked hard when I was at university<br />
			</em>the verb is a simple past form but the hearer can infer:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) that the speaker is no longer at university<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) that the speaker habitually worked hard<br />so the use of a form such as 
			<em>would</em> or <em>used to</em> is not 
		necessary.&nbsp; The habitual aspect is signalled by co-textual and 
		contextual clues.<br />
			Of course we can, <em>via</em> the use of a central or semi-modal 
			auxiliary verb, deliberately signal habitual aspects as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to work hard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would arrive early every morning</em><br />
			etc.<br />Equally, English has no way to express a current habit by marking the 
		verb form so present routines and habits are expressed in the present 
		simple.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take the 09:15 train</em><br />
			refers to a present habit.<br />
			It is rare, in any language to express the concept of a future habit 
			not yet begun but the resources are available to do so, so we can 
			find, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be taking the kids to school from now on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll arrive early at work in future<br />
			</em>When we want to signal this rather unusual sense, we use 
			adverbials (e.g., <em>from now on, in future, for the foreseeable
			</em>etc.) to disambiguate the meaning from the usual sense of these 
			future forms.</dd>
			<dt><strong>The perfect aspect<br />
			<img alt="perfect" height="133" src="../../images/perfect_a200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
			<dd>The perfect aspect is always signalled in British English with the use 
		of a form of <em>have</em>.&nbsp; AmE usage, on the other hand, often uses the 
		simple form and requires the reader / hearer to make the connection 
		between relative events.&nbsp; So, for example, BrE will prefer<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Has he left?</em><br />
		to embed a possible past event in the present, but AmE often prefers:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he leave?</em><br />
		for the same notion.<br />
			However, the situation is not so clear with the use of the past 
			perfect aspect and, providing the ordering of events is clear, 
			neither variety will use a perfect form of the tense so we can have 
			either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lost my wallet and had to walk home</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had lost my wallet and had to walk home</em><br />
			But, when the speaker wishes to signal causality or the ordering of 
			events is not otherwise clear, the perfect form will often be 
			preferred so we have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had lost my wallet so had to walk home</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had lost my wallet and walked home<br />
			</em>and in both those examples we have a relative or relational tense form which 
			serves to embed the past within the past.<br />
			We can also embed the past in the future by using the future perfect 
			forms and have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have finished before you arrive</em><br />
			which embeds a past (finishing) in the future (arriving).</dd>
			<dt><strong>The progressive aspect<br />
			<img alt="hurry" height="133" src="../../images/man_hurry200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
			<dd>In English, the progressive is usually signalled by the use of <em>be</em> and the -<em>ing</em> participle as 
		in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She is working in the garden so won't be in for lunch</em><br />
		but the same form is also used to signal a prospective aspect as in, for 
		example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She is doing the driving tomorrow</em><br />
		which is progressive but calling it the present continuous for the 
		future is misleading.&nbsp; It shares the form, not the notion.<br />
		The issue is that, confusingly for some, English uses the same -<em>ing</em> structure 
		for multiple ideas (including, incidentally, verbal nouns and gerunds).<br />
		The continuous, on the other hand, is often expressed using a simple 
		aspect as in, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She believes in ghosts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She likes Mozart</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She works in London</em><br />
		which are continuous but not progressive in any sense.&nbsp; For 
		more, see the guide to stative and dynamic verb uses linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
			Progressive aspects are signalled in other tenses, too, in parallel 
			ways so we get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were watching television<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will be playing the trumpet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother always liked Beethoven's music<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll enjoy being on holiday<br />
			</em>etc.</dd>
			<dt><strong>The continuous aspect<br />
			<img alt="rain" height="133" src="../../images/umbrella_rain200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
			<dd>English can use both the simple and the progressive form of 
			tenses to signal that an event or state is continuous (rather than 
			progressive) and this often denotes a background relative to another 
			action.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The professor over there is writing another book</em><br />
			probably does not refer to what the professor is currently doing but 
			refers to a background event.<br />
			We can also have, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The engine makes a lot of noise<br />
			</em>which does not refer to the present but to a background event that 
			has caused the owner to take it to a mechanic.&nbsp; If we want to 
			suggest that the event is progressive rather than a continuous 
			background state, the form would usually be:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The engine is making a lot of noise<br />
			</em>but that, too, can be interpreted as a background event causing the 
			visit to the mechanic.<br />
			As with progressive aspects, we can embed the notion of the 
			continuous in the past and the future.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The professor was writing a book that year<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The engine made a lot of noise when it got older</em><br />
			When we use the simple form of the verb but intend a continuous 
			sense to be understood, we frequently employ adverbials (<em>that 
			year </em>and <em>when it got older </em>in these examples).<br />
			It is also worth repeating that semantic issues play a significant 
			role with verbs such as <em>walk, read, study, continue</em> and so 
			on signalling a longer-lasting event and may be called durative than 
			verbs such as <em>hit, drop, break, switch</em> etc. which may be 
			described as instantaneous acts and are rarely used in continuous 
			senses.&nbsp; If the progressive form of the verb is used with these 
			verbs, the sense is iterative (repeated) as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were breaking plates at the wedding<br />
			</em>which, because of the nature of the verb, can only mean that 
			the action was repeated.</dd>
			<dt><strong>The prospective aspect<br />
			<img alt="crystal" height="133" src="../../images/future_crystal_ball200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
			<dd>English uses a variety of forms to refer to a prospective event 
			seen from the standpoint of now.&nbsp; This is the reason it is 
			sometimes averred that English has no future tense at all.&nbsp; It 
			is true that English cannot alter the inflexion on a verb to signal 
			futurity as, for example, is possible in French, Spanish and a 
			number of other languages.&nbsp; However, the <em>will</em> + bare infinitive 
			form certainly does act as a future tense for all intents and 
			purposes in expressions such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She will be 35 tomorrow</em><br />
			In this sense, the verb <em>will</em> is acting as a primary 
			auxiliary verb in the same way that the verbs <em>be</em> and <em>
			have</em> act to form a progressive and perfect aspect structure 
			respectively.<br />
			The issue becomes blurred because the modal auxiliary verb <em>will</em> performs 
			a variety of other functions in English that have little to do with 
			the future <em>per se</em> and refer to present willingness (dynamic 
			modality, to be more precise) so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you marry me?</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you have another drink?</em><br />
			are not asking for speculation about the future in the same sense 
			as, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it rain, do you think?</em><br />
			but refer, instead to <span class="style_underline">current</span> 
			willingness.<br />
			This verb and its past form, <em>would</em>, causes a good deal of 
			trouble for learners unless its polysemous nature is clearly 
			explained.</dd>
			<dt><strong>The iterative aspect<br />
			<img alt="bells" height="133" src="../../images/bell_tower200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
			<dd>Some languages reserve a particular tense form or set of 
			inflexions to express repeated events or actions.&nbsp; English 
			usually uses a perfect and/or a progressive form to do the same 
			thing.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bells are ringing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone has been stealing my apples<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have had problems<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is travelling a lot these days</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			all of which express the sense of repetitive events rather than 
			being perfect or progressive aspects especially when an 
			instantaneous verb such as <em>ring</em> (the example above) is used.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>See below for consideration of the durative aspect in English.</p>
		<p>Other languages, it bears repeating, do things differently.</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><span class="auto-style7"><strong>Moral 1</strong></span>: the aspects of verbs that we choose to analyse and teach in 
		English are simply those which are marked in English.&nbsp; In 
		other languages, other aspects are more important and will be analysed 
		and taught differently.<br />
		<span class="auto-style7"><strong>Moral 2</strong></span>: the aspects we focus on in English are <strong>not</strong> 
		universals.&nbsp; Languages differ dramatically in how they represent 
		the nature of events.</p>
		<p>Examples may help.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Italian </strong>(and some other Romance languages)</dt>
				<dd>distinguishes actions which are recent, remote and perfect or 
		imperfect.&nbsp; The language does not, however, distinguish between<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		I was walking<br />
		</em>and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I usually walked</em>.</dd>
				<dt>
		<strong>German </strong> (and some other Germanic languages)</dt>
				<dd>does not distinguish between<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have eaten<br />
		</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ate<br />
		</em>nor, in non-dialect standard, between<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I write<br />
		</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am 
		writing</em>.<br />
		It is arguable that German does not exhibit aspect 
		at all except through the addition of other markers such as adverbs and 
		time expressions.</dd>
				<dt> <strong>Cantonese</strong>, and other Chinese languages</dt>
				<dd>has particles which may be added after the verb, one to 
				signal the progressive aspect<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is putting on her sandals<br />
		</em>and one the continuous (state) aspect<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is wearing sandals<br />
		</em>English cannot distinguish grammatically between these two aspects 
				but relies on adverbials of time to make the difference.</dd>

				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>It is quite arguable that English also has, in particular, a durative 
		aspect which is often realised in different ways grammatically.<br />
		For example,</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li class="style_black"><em>He would keep asking</em></li>
			<li class="style_black"><em>I spent the evening trying to stay awake</em></li>
			<li class="style_black"><em>I was watching television when he called</em></li>
			<li class="style_black"><em>He will be working now</em></li>
			<li class="style_black"><em>She gave a very long presentation</em></li>
			<li class="style_black"><em>I slowly understood what the problem was</em></li>
		</ul>
		<p>are all examples of English using a variety of forms to express the 
		aspect, sometimes by changing the tense form, sometimes by using a modal 
		auxiliary verb, sometimes a lexical or main verb and sometimes by using adverbials.&nbsp; For learners with 
		some language backgrounds, that's easier to grasp than the usual focus 
		on the progressive aspect (i.e., signalled by the -<em>ing</em> ending 
		but not in certain senses of certain verbs).</p>
			<h4>Durative <em>vs</em>. terminative / instantaneous</h4>
			<p>In some languages (notably Russian) a distinction is made in the 
			form of the verb between those which are terminative and those which 
			are durative.&nbsp; English makes no such distinction in form but 
			the concepts account for some of the stative / dynamic, perfective / 
			imperfective and progressive / simple tense forms that can be used.<br />
			Briefly:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>Terminative verbs suggest either of two closely related 
				ideas<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>a change of state, for example<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She peeled the potatoes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They opened the box<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat down</em></li>
					<li>an action which cannot continue (instantaneous), for example<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glass broke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished her good morning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They finished the story</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Durative verbs imply no such condition, for example<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sang at the party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read the paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was working in the office<br />
				</em>are all semantically confined to actions which have a 
				greater duration.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When terminative verbs which imply a change of state are used in 
			progressive forms, they can be made durative so, for example, we can 
			distinguish the sentences above as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was peeling the potatoes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were opening the box<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was sitting down</em><br />
			Instantaneous verbs which imply that an action cannot progress are 
			less often used in this way and cannot usually be made durative so 
			we do not <strong>usually</strong> encounter:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glass was breaking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was wishing her good morning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were finishing the story<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was glancing at the clock</em><br />
			Durative verbs are commonly used in both the simple and progressive 
			forms to imply continuous or progressive states.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived in London at that time </em>
			(continuous)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stayed in a guest house on holiday </em>(continuous)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were studying at university then </em>(progressive
			<strong>or</strong> continuous, i.e., an action or a background 
			state)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was running in the park </em>(progressive)</p>
			<hr />
			<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>A way of visualising the aspect structure of English is like this, 
		bearing in mind that many analyses do not distinguish between continuous 
		and progressive aspects because the form is, in English, often the same.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="summary" height="853" src="../../imagesgraphics/aspects_exemplified.png" width="775" /></p>
		<p>There are advantages to seeing the English aspect system like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>It helps to clear up the stative / dynamic verb use problem by 
			positing both a continuous and a progressive aspect.&nbsp; This will be 
			intuitively comprehensible to learners from many language 
			backgrounds.&nbsp; It explains, e.g., the concept of<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wore a blue 
			shirt yesterday<br />
			</em>as a simple past form being used to 
			express the continuous aspect.&nbsp; It also explains the difference 
			between, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It costs a lot</em> (<span class="style_brown">continuous</span> 
			aspect)<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is costing a lot</em> (<span class="style_brown">progressive</span> 
			aspect).</li>
			<li>It shows how form and function may not be one-to-one equivalents 
			and gets away from the assumption that, e.g., the -<em>ing</em> form 
			is all we use for progressive and continuous aspects.</li>
			<li>It makes it clear that the so-called present perfect is a 
			present aspect (not a past tense as the form is in many languages).</li>
			<li>It puts the past perfect in its place (which is not something 
			that always occurs before the past).</li>
			<li>It makes perfective and imperfective forms clear.</li>
		</ol>
