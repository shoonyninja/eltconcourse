			<h1>The infinitive in English</h1>
			<p>
			
			<img height="207" src="../../images/infinity310.jpg" width="310" alt="infinite" /></p>
			<p>The title of this guide deliberately refers to <strong>in English</strong>.&nbsp; 
			Some languages, such as Modern Greek, Japanese and a range of other 
			languages have nothing that is recognisably an infinitive and in 
			other languages, the base form of a verb plays no grammatical role.<br />
			It is unsurprising that learners of English, especially from those 
			language backgrounds, have some difficulty understanding the concept 
			of an infinitive and using it successfully.<br />
			In many other languages, including many European ones, a single form 
			of the verb does service as the equivalent of the English bare 
			infinitive, the infinitive with <em>to</em> and the -<em>ing</em> 
			form of a verb.</p>

			<p>In the initial plus section of this site, there is
			<a href="../../initial/grammar_essentials/infinitive_essentials.html" target="_blank">an 
			essential guide to the infinitive</a> which explains what the 
			infinitive is and 
			how it is used.&nbsp; The assumption here is that you already 
			understand the distinction between bare and <em>to</em>-infinitives 
			and between finite and non-finite verb forms but a rapid reminder 
			may be helpful:</p>
			<p>The infinitive in English is known as non-finite.&nbsp; That 
			means that you can't tell by looking at it whether it refers to me, 
			you, lots of people, the past, the present or the future.&nbsp; 
			Compare, for example, the verbs in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_black">wants</span> to 
			<span class="style_red">make</span> a cake</em>.<br />
			The verb <span class="style_black"> <em>wants</em></span> has an <em>-s</em> ending here and that tells us that 
			it refers to a singular person, it refers to the third person (it 
			can't refer to me or you) and it is present tense.&nbsp; If we 
			change the form of this verb, we change its function:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He wanted to make a cake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They want to make a cake</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			The verb <span class="style_red"> <em>make</em></span> does not tell us any of these things.&nbsp; 
			It will not change if I replace <em>he </em>with <em>you</em> or <em>
			wants</em> with <em>wanted</em> or <em>want</em>.</p>
			<p>The word infinitive, incidentally derives from the Latin meaning, 
			roughly, <em>unlimited</em> and that is the clue to its nature&nbsp;&ndash;
			the infinitive is not limited by person, tense or number.&nbsp; It 
			just is.</p>
			<p>This guide covers the main ways in which the infinitive is used 
			in English (whether bare or with <em>to</em>).</p>

			<p>This is probably the most common use of the infinitive in English 
			and the first use that most learners encounter.&nbsp; This is not 
			the place to consider all the possible meanings and uses of the 
			infinitive with modal auxiliary verbs but it is worth noting that 
			one usual distinction between pure and semi-modal auxiliary verbs is to 
			consider whether or not they are followed by the bare or the <em>to-</em>infinitive.<br />
			Like this:</p>

				<td class="auto-style6">Infinitive form</td>

			<p>It is fairly easy to spot the rogue here.&nbsp; It is the verb
			<em>ought</em> which, because it is followed by the <em>to-</em>infinitive, 
			is often classified as a semi-modal auxiliary verb.&nbsp; That is not the view 
			taken on this site because in most other respects the verb is a 
			central or pure 
			modal auxiliary verb, having no truly lexical form in the way that semi-modal 
			auxiliary verbs do.<br />
			There is more on all of this linked in the list of related guides at the end 
			(follow the link to the modality index).</p>
			<p>What is less easy to notice from the list above is the 
			colligational nature of some of the verbs.</p>
			<p>We can, for example, have both:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They can do the work</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The work can be done</em><br />
			so both active and passive uses of the infinitive are acceptable.<br />
			The same applies to all the other pure or central modal auxiliary 
			verbs listed above.</p>
			<p>When we look at the semi-modal auxiliary verbs, the following are 
			acceptable:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; They used to do the work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work used to be done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They needed to do the work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work needed to be done</em><br />
			but with the semi-modal auxiliary verb <em>dare</em>, the passive use of the 
			infinitive is not acceptable:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> They dared tell the teacher<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The teacher was dared to be told.</em></p>
			<p>With the marginal modal auxiliary verbs listed, the situation is 
			more diverse and less clear cut:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>happen, mean</em> and <em>care</em> cannot be used in 
				the passive so:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He happened to be talked to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The work meant to be done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The restaurant cared to be visited</em><br />
				are not acceptable.</li>
				<li>The remaining marginal modal auxiliary verbs can be used with a 
				passive infinitive so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work seemed to be finished<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work tended to be done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work turned out to be done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was about to be done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was likely to be done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was supposed to be done</em><br />
				are all acceptable.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The infinitive has just two tense forms:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The present infinitive:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to help</em></li>
				<li>The perfect infinitive<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to have helped</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Both of these can take on aspectual meanings with progressive 
			forms:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The present progressive infinitive:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to be helping</em></li>
				<li>The past progressive infinitive:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to have been helping</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>These forms are subject to the same constraints and structural 
			rules as the simpler form of the infinitive.</p>
			<p>The guide to the passive, linked below, considers passive 
			infinitives in some depth.&nbsp; Here it will be enough to exemplify 
			the two main forms:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Present passive infinitive:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to be invited</em></li>
				<li>Perfect passive infinitive:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should have been repaired</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Both of these forms can be combined with the progressive aspect 
			to make complex formulations such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It needs to be being continuously oiled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The machine should have been being serviced more often</em><br />
			but such forms are rare and of varying acceptability to some 
			speakers.</p>

			<p>The verb <em>catenate</em> may be defined as <em>join together in a 
			series </em>and, just like modal auxiliary verbs, there is a range of 
			verbs in English which can be followed by a non-finite form.&nbsp; 
			That form may be the bare infinitive, the <em>to-</em>infinitive or 
			the <em>-ing</em> form.&nbsp; We are 
			only concerned with the first two of these here.<br />
			Strictly speaking, catenative verbs are those in which the main verb 
			is followed directly by the non-finite form with no intervening 
			object so, for example<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I intend to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like swimming</em><br />
			are true catenative structures but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I want him to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She watched them playing</em><br />
			are not.<br />
			For the purposes of this guide we will ignore this technicality but 
			the guide to catenative verbs linked in the list of related guides at the end, does not.</p>
			<ol >
				<li>Verbs which are followed <span class="style_underline">
				directly</span> by a bare infinitive are almost a closed set and 
				the uses are quite rare.&nbsp; The passive is almost impossible 
				with any of these.&nbsp; They include:<ol class="greenbullet" >
					<li><em>let</em>, as in, e.g.:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't let go!</em></li>
					<li><em>make</em>, as in e.g.:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She made do with very little furniture</em></li>
					<li><em>help</em>, as in, e.g.:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please help repair the table</em></li>
					<li><em>hear</em>, as in e.g.:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear tell he's quite rich</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Verbs which are followed by an object plus the bare 
				infinitive are of two main sorts:<ol class="auto-style31">
					<li>verbs of <strong>physical</strong> (<strong><em>not mental</em></strong>&dagger;) perception.&nbsp; These verbs refer to a single 
				event rather than anything progressive or iterative and can 
					often be 
					used in the passive.&nbsp; They include:<ol class="greenbullet" >
						<li><em>I </em> <strong><em>felt</em></strong><em> the ground move</em></li>
						<li><em>She </em> <strong><em>heard</em></strong><em> the door open</em></li>
						<li><em>I </em> <strong><em>noticed</em></strong><em> the car swerve</em></li>
						<li><em>They </em> <strong><em>observed</em></strong><em> man break in</em></li>
						<li><em>I </em> <strong><em>perceived</em></strong><em> the rain start</em></li>
						<li><em>I </em> <strong><em>saw</em></strong><em> the man arrive</em></li>
						<li><em>I </em> <strong><em>smelt</em></strong><em> the dinner burn</em></li>
						<li><em>I </em><strong><em>watched</em></strong><em> the man jump</em><p class="auto-style54">
						(When these verbs are followed by an <em>-ing </em>form 
						they imply that the whole of an event was not perceived.&nbsp; 
						So for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They observed the man breaking in<br />
						</em>implies that the action began before the 
						observation and may have continued after it.<br />
						Compare, too:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw her sing at the opera vs. I saw her singing in the 
						garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smelt the dinner burn vs. I smelt the dinner burning<br />
						</em>and so on.<br />
						For other examples, see the guide to finite and 
						non-finite forms, linked below.)</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Other verbs, with the same structural characteristics including:<ol class="greenbullet" >
						<li><em>The teacher </em><strong><em>had</em></strong><em> me do it again</em></li>
						<li><em>I </em><strong><em>helped</em></strong><em> her get up</em></li>
						<li><em>I </em><strong><em>let</em></strong><em> her go early</em></li>
						<li><em>I </em><strong><em>have known</em></strong><em> it be cold in April</em></li>
						<li><em>I </em><strong><em>made</em></strong><em> them stay late</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Verbs which are directly followed by the <em>to-</em>infinitive 
				form a large group and many of them refer to the future rather 
				than the past.&nbsp; (When reference is to the past or to a view based on past experience, the -<em>ing</em> 
				form is usually the form which follows.)<ol class="auto-style31" >
					<li>These verbs include:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>afford, agree, aim, apply, 
					arrange, attempt, care, chance, choose, condescend, consent, 
					contrive, decide, decline, demand, deserve, determine, 
					endeavour, expect, fail, happen, hasten, hesitate, hope, 
					intend, learn, long, manage, mean, offer, prepare, pretend, 
					proceed, profess, promise, refuse, resolve, seek, seem, strive, 
					struggle, swear, threaten, trouble, undertake, volunteer, 
					wait, want, wish</em></span>.</li>
					<li>In nearly all cases, the verbs refer to a prospective 
					rather than past action (but there are a few exceptions).</li>
					<li>None can be used with an intervening object, even when 
					they are transitive so we allow, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He failed / struggled / swore / 
					promised / wanted to pass the examination</em><br />
					but not:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He failed / struggled / swore / 
					promised / wanted the examination to pass.</em></li>
					<li>Passive uses are vanishingly rare or forbidden because 
					no intervening object is present.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Verbs which are followed by an object and the <em>to</em>-infinitive 
				are rarer but can by their nature be used in the passive 
				include:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>advise, allow, ask, beg, compel, 
				encourage, forbid, force, get (=persuade), help, instruct, 
				intend, invite, oblige, order, permit, 
				persuade, press, recommend, request, remind, show (how), teach, 
				tell, tempt, urge, warn (not)</em></span><br />
				So, for example, we can have:<br />
				<table class="tableblueborder">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style62">Active form</td>
						<td class="auto-style60">&rarr;</td>
						<td class="auto-style63">Passive form</td>
					</tr>

				Two of these verbs resist passive constructions so we do not 
				usually encounter:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman was got to answer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man was intended to help</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>&dagger;&nbsp;When the verb refers to metaphorical mental perception 
			rather than physical perception, a <em>that-</em>clause is 
			preferred.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			Physical perception:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard the bell ring</em><br />
			Mental perception<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard that the bell is broken</em><br />
			<strong>not</strong><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I heard the bell break</em><br />
			because that carries a different meaning of <em>hear</em>.<br />
			Physical perception:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt the rain start</em><br />
			Mental perception:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt that the rain will help the garden</em><br />
			<strong>not</strong><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I felt the rain help the garden</em></p>

			<p>With catenative verbs the infinitive forms part of the object of 
			the main verb but infinitives can also be nominalised to form the 
			subject of a verb or be part of a nominalised non-finite clause.&nbsp; 
			The form is almost always marked in some way for emphasis and is 
			much more frequent in spoken rather than written language.&nbsp; For 
			example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>To argue with her is pointless</em><br />
				which is the marked form of<br />
				<em>It is pointless to argue with her</em></li>
				<li><em>To see the ballet was a delight</em><br />
				which is the marked form of<br />
				<em>It was a delight to see the ballet</em></li>
				<li><em>To be a member is a real privilege</em><br />
				which is the marked form of<br />
				<em>It is a privilege to be a member</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Occasionally, a <em>for-</em>phrase may be inserted before the 
			infinitive as in, for example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>For her to be so rude was surprising</em><br />
				which is the marked form of<br />
				<em>I was surprised that she was so rude</em></li>
				<li><em>For the car to break down at that time was very 
				inconvenient</em><br />
				which is the marked form of<br />
				<em>It was very inconvenient for the car to break down at that 
				time</em></li>
				<li><em>For me to do it would be impossible</em><br />
				which is the marked form of<br />
				<em>It would be impossible for me to do it</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Infinitive clauses can also post modify the subject noun and form 
			part of a nominalised clause as the subject of the verb.&nbsp; For 
			example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>The right man to ask is John</em><br />
				which is the marked form of<br />
				<em>John is the right man to ask</em></li>
				<li><em>The next train to arrive at Platform 6 is the 15:40 for 
				Victoria</em><br />
				which is a marked form commonly used in announcements because it 
				fronts information relevant to those standing on Platform 6 and 
				alerts them to the importance of the information for them.<br />
				It would be more difficult for passengers to understand:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 15:40 for Victoria is the next train 
				to arrive at Platform 6</em></li>
				<li><em>The best place to stay is the Grand Hotel</em><br />
				which is the marked form of<br />
				<em>The Grand Hotel is the best place to stay.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Nominalised infinitive constructions can also operate as the 
			object of verbs, of course, and any transitive verb followed by the 
			infinitive can be analysed as the verb plus a nominalised infinitive 
			clause object as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expected to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I chose to have the argument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to see her</em><br />
			and that is not at all unusual.<br />
			All the uses of the infinitive with transitive verbs can be replaced 
			by simple noun phrases so we can also have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I expected the bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I chose the silver car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want the money</em><br />
			It is worth commenting in passing that the -<em>ing</em> form is 
			often referred to as a gerund (or, a somewhat different concept, a verbal noun) in expressions such 
			as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy swimming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember going to the game with her</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			If these forms are nouns (i.e., gerunds) then it makes sense, too, 
			to refer to infinitive clauses as nouns in these circumstances.</p>

			<p>There are two main sorts of adjectives which are followed by an 
			infinitive, and it is always the <em>to</em>-infinitive which is used.&nbsp; 
			Simply telling learners that the bare infinitive does not follow an 
			adjective may avoid a good deal of error.<br />
			The following are unmarked forms of some of the structures seen in 
			the previous section.&nbsp; Most of the clauses can be rephrased for 
			marked meaning, i.e., emphasis, so we could have, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; To see the difference is important</em><br />
			instead of the more normal, i.e., unmarked:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to see the difference</em></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Used with the dummy or anticipatory <em>it</em>:<br />Many of these are modal adjectives, some epistemic 
				(referring to possibility or likelihood) some deontic (referring 
				to obligation) and some dynamic (referring to ability).<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>The form is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It</em> + <em>be</em> + adjective + <em>to</em>-infinitive 
					+ object or other verb complement<br />
					as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It is important to see the difference<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is impossible to believe he can do it</em></li>
					<li>epistemic adjectives include:<br />
					<em>impossible, common, unusual, rare, possible, certain, 
					likely, unlikely, normal.</em>&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is impossible to believe it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is certain to be her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unusual to accept it</em></li>
					<li>deontic adjectives include:<br />
					<em>wrong, right, crazy, important, necessary, good, bad, 
					essential, unnecessary.</em>&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is wrong to accept the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is crazy to believe her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is essential to change the oil</em></li>
					<li>dynamic adjectives (referring to ability) include:<br />
					<em>easy, difficult, hard, simple</em>.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is easy to believe her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult to accept that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hard to do it</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Used to describe someone's feelings:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>The form is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject + copular verb + adjective + <em>to-</em>infinitive + 
					object or other verb complement<br />
					as in, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is happy to come to the party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are reluctant to eat it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They seem delighted to be here</em></li>
					<li>Many common adjectives work in this way and many 
					represent some form of dynamic modality, in this case that 
					of willingness.&nbsp; They 
					include:<br />
					<em>glad, surprised, happy, pleased, delighted, sorry, 
					willing, concerned, disappointed, mortified, astonished, 
					unhappy, anxious</em> and more.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would be delighted to assist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The were disappointed not to see her</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Both types of structure exemplified here can be used in the 
			passive although not all adjectives naturally so.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="smallgreybullet">
				<li><em>They were delighted to have been asked</em></li>
				<li><em>I was disappointed not to have been promoted</em></li>
				<li><em>It is unusual to be invited to the palace</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In particular, the adjectives frequently used with the 
			anticipatory <em>it</em> are rare in the passive and often sound 
			clumsy or plain wrong.&nbsp; We would not normally accept, for 
			example:</p>
			<ul class="smallgreybullet">
				<li><em>?It was certain to be done</em></li>
				<li><em>*It is important to be finished</em></li>
				<li><em>*It is difficult to be accomplished</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Passive infinitives are considered in much more detail in the 
			guide to the passive.&nbsp; You can open that section of the guide 
			in a new tab by clicking <a href="passive.html#inf" target="_blank">
			here</a>.</p>

			</table>
			<p>This is not an uncontroversial category because the sense of 
			reason or purpose is often contained within the verb itself, and it 
			may be argued that the use of <em>to</em> in these structures is 
			better considered prepositional rather than part of the <em>to</em>-infinitive 
			(hence its possible replacement with the complex preposition <em>in order to</em>).<br />
			However, for teaching purposes, the category is sometimes useful as, 
			superficially at least, the structure is similar to the forms 
			already considered.<br />
			Here, a few examples will do:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greenbullet"><em>I came to find out what was 
				happening</em></li>
				<li class="greenbullet"><em>She went to London to see her mother</em></li>
				<li class="greenbullet"><em>I came to help with the cooking</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>etc.</p>
			<p>There are some complications:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Negating the structures is more complicated because a 
				sentence such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat in the shade not to get sunburnt</em><br />
				is clumsy and usually replaced with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat in the shade
				<span class="style_underline">so as </span>not to get sunburnt<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat in the shade in order not to get sunburnt</em></li>
				<li>The verbs <em>go</em> and <em>come</em> are routinely 
				followed by <em>and</em> rather than <em>to</em>, especially 
				informally, so, we prefer<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go and look</em><br />
				to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to look</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come and see</em><br />
				to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to see</em></li>
				<li>Slightly less acceptably to many people, and something 
				deprecated in formal English, is the use of <em>and</em> with 
				the verb <em>try</em> as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try and help her</em><br />
				rather than the more formally correct<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to help her</em></li>
				<li>The verb <em>wait is</em> frequently used with <em>and </em>
				rather than <em>to</em> as in, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's just wait and see<br />
				</em>but in this case, it is arguable that the meaning is 
				different from<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's just wait to see<br />
				</em>because the former implies two actions following each other 
				and the latter implies the reason for waiting.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Error alert:</strong><br />
			The verbs <em>come, get, grow, begin</em> and <em>start</em> are 
			often followed by a <em>to</em> infinitive but do <strong>not</strong> imply causality; they 
			imply a sense of a gradual process.&nbsp; So for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came to like her</em><br />
			does not allow an alternative with <em>in order to</em> and nor do:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I got to know her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grew to enjoy the weather<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We began to lose touch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We started to meet quite often</em></p>

			<p>A form that is almost unique to English (among European 
			languages, at least) is the use of the infinitive after the verb <em>
			be</em> to signal absolute obligations and prohibitions.<br />
			The structure is formal and often used in notices and other written texts 
			produced by those in authority.<br />
			Examples of the use are:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children are not to leave the premises unaccompanied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passengers are not to proceed beyond this point<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officers are to be in uniform at all time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desks are to be kept tidy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This door is to be kept clear of obstructions</em></p>
			<p>An allied construction concerns the future, whether in the past 
			and unfulfilled or prospective in sense.&nbsp; The meaning is akin 
			to the previous examples because the expression carries an 
			implication of inevitability unusual for future forms in English.<br />
			Examples include:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is to be another meeting tomorrow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was to be a rehearsal that afternoon but the director 
			was ill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are to meet again tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were to see the boss the next day</em><br />
			and so on.</p>

			<p>Both these adverbs are routinely followed by the <em>to-</em>infinitive 
			(and never by the bare infinitive).&nbsp; They are often analysed as 
			a subset of the previous category but that is mistaken because here 
			it is rarely possible to use the complex subordinator <em>in order 
			to</em> as an alternative.<br />
			Again some examples are enough because the structure is quite 
			simple:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greenbullet"><em>The food was too hot to eat</em></li>
				<li class="greenbullet"><em>We don't have enough money to take a 
				holiday</em></li>
				<li class="greenbullet"><em>She was sensitive enough not to ask 
				the question</em></li>
				<li class="greenbullet"><em>I was simply too tired to do it</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With this structure, negation is more straightforward.&nbsp; For 
			example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li class="greenbullet"><em>The food wasn't too spicy to eat</em></li>
				<li class="greenbullet"><em>It wasn't too wet to go for a walk</em></li>
				<li class="greenbullet"><em>There weren't enough people to do 
				the work</em></li>
				<li class="greenbullet"><em>I wasn't alert enough to spot the 
				problem</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are some complications:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The infinitive can follow an 
			adjective <span class="style_underline">or</span> a noun phrase and that is something not parallelled in 
			many languages.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The food was good enough to eat</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took enough food to keep us going for 
				the whole day</em></li>
				<li>Only the adverb <em>enough</em> can be used preceding a noun 
				phrase so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had enough books to read</em><br />
				but we do not allow<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She had too books to read</em></li>
				<li>The adverb <em>enough</em> follows the adjective but 
				precedes the noun (when it is a determiner, not an adverb) so we get, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather was nice enough to go for a 
				walk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The was enough rain to help the garden</em></li>
				<li>There is a formal use of <em>enough</em> following the noun 
				phrase (again as a determiner) rather than preceding it as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was rain enough to help the garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had books enough to read</em></li>
				<li>The adverb <em>too</em> only precedes an adjective.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pie was too hot to eat</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The pie was hot too to eat</em></li>

			<p>All <em>wh-word</em>s, <strong>apart from <em>why</em></strong>,

			</ul>
			<p>Of these, the first four, using <em>how, what, when</em> and <em>
			where</em> are the most frequent.&nbsp; The words <em>which</em> and
			<em>whose</em> are less commonly used this way.<br />
			Although permitted in many languages, the word <em>why</em> may not,

			do not see, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She asked him why to do it</em><br />
			but that is allowed in many languages and is the source of some 
			interlingual error.</p>
			<p>The indefinite or impersonal pronouns <em>-thing, -one</em> and <em>-body</em>

			<p>Disjuncts come in two flavours: they suggest to the hearer / 
			reader how the speaker / writer wants to be understood (style 
			disjuncts) or they show how the speaker / writer feels about the 
			content of what is said or written (attitude disjuncts).<br />
			Infinitives sometimes perform this function.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>Style disjuncts:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be frank, I don't care for it<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To tell the truth, I'm not very interested in football</em></li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To balance the disadvantages, there's a good deal to be said 
				for it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to beat about the bush, it's a silly idea</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Conjuncts also occur outside the main clause but instead of 
			expressing style or attitude, they connect what has gone 
			before or what follows what is being said or written.&nbsp; 
			Infinitives are sometimes used for this function as in, for example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>Summative:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sum up, the idea has been ditched</em></li>
				<li>Rephrasing:<br />

				<li>Enumerating:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>To begin with, the flight was delayed</em></li>
				<li>Reinforcing:<br />

				<li>Explaining:<br />
