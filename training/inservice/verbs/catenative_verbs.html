			<h1>Catenative verbs: gerunds and infinitives etc.</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="chain" height="207" src="../../images/link_chain_vertical310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>The verb <em>catenate</em> (which has its origins in the Latin 
			<em>catena</em>, a chain) may be defined as <em>join together in a 
			series.<br />
			</em>You may be familiar with the term catenation as it is used in 
			the analysis of connected speech where it refers to how sounds are 
			linked.&nbsp; That is not the concern here but the concepts are 
			analogous.</p>
			<p>There is a range of verbs in English which can be followed by a 
			non-finite form in a chain of meanings.<br />
			That non-finite may be the <em>to-</em>infinitive or  
			the <em>-ing</em> form.&nbsp; A few verbs also catenate with the 
			bare infinitive.<br />
			Here's an example of a catenated structure:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agreed to try making more effort</em><br />
			in which the main, finite verb is <em>agree</em> and its complement 
			consists of a clause with two non-finite verb forms: <em>
			to try, making.<br />
			</em>How verbs catenate and the associated grammar are a source of 
			considerable error for learners of English for two reasons:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style31">
				<li>It is not easy to predict which non-finite structures will 
				follow a verb.</li>
				<li>Other languages do things differently and not all have 
				anything similar to the English non-finite forms.&nbsp; Even 
				those that do will not usually have a choice of forms to pick 
				from.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>(If you are wondering, the verb is pronounced /ˈkæ.tɪ.neɪt/, the adjective is /ˈkæ.ˌtɪ.nət.ɪv/ 
			or /kəˈti:.nə.tɪv/ (your choice) and the noun is pronounced /ˌkæ.tɪ.ˈneɪ.ʃən/.)</p>
			<p>This area is closely connected to the concept of colligation.&nbsp; 
			Verbs which catenate in the same way such as, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She determined to work hard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They chose to work hard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We decided to work hard</em><br />
			are said to form colligates insofar as they are primed (Hoey 2003) 
			to take on certain syntactical structures, in this case, the verbs
			<em>determine, choose</em> and <em>decide</em> are followed by the
			<em>to-</em>infinitive.<br />
			The whole of what follows is an effort to identify colligates: words 
			which function syntactically in the same ways.<br />

			<p>Unfortunately, there is a good deal of confusion concerning what 
			qualifies as a catenative structure.&nbsp; There are websites, 
			unnamed here, the authors of which assume that any clause which 
			contains more than one verb is an example of catenation.&nbsp; 
			That's unhelpful because it is careless, sloppy and vague and leads 
			to poor classroom focus.</p>
			<p>Before we consider what sorts of structures are involved, we need 
			to make clear what are not, <em>sensu stricto</em>, catenative verbs.</p>
			<p>None of the following is an example of catenative verb use for 
			the reasons given:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>She arrived running</em><br />
				because the participle, <em>running</em>, is just a description 
				of how she arrived.&nbsp; It is adjectival, in fact and akin to, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The running woman.</em></li>
				<li><em>He stopped to check the time</em><br />
				in which the main verb is followed by what looks like a <em>to-</em> infinitive.&nbsp; 
				It is not.&nbsp; The nature of<em> to</em> in that sentence is a 
				reduced form of the quasi- or marginal subordinator <em>in order to
				</em>which is replaceable by<em> with the intention 
				of
				</em>or a subordinate clause such as <em>so that he could, so as 
				(not) to
				</em>etc.&nbsp; 
				This is sometimes called the infinitive of purpose although it 
				is not an infinitive, it just looks like one.</li>
				<li><em>He went to work</em><br />
				in which the word <em>to</em> is a preposition of place followed 
				by the noun.&nbsp; It may, alternatively, mean that <em>he went in 
				order to work</em> but that still is not an example of catenation 
				because it is the same as the last point.</li>
				<li><em>She waited before speaking</em><br />
				in which we simply have a verb followed by a prepositional 
				phrase adverbial.&nbsp; The form of the verb when it is the 
				complement (or object) of a preposition is generally the -<em>ing</em> 
				form because it is acting as a noun.<br />
				However, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She waited to speak<br />
				</em>we have a case of true catenation.</li>
				<li><em>I allowed him to leave</em><br />
				because the indirect object has been inserted, thus breaking the 
				chain.&nbsp; In the passive, this verb does catenate as in, for 
				example<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was allowed to leave.<br />
				</em>For teaching purposes, this technical point concerning the 
				insertion of the object breaking the chain can usually be 
				ignored (but see below for awareness raising of the basic 
				structure).<br />
				There is a range of verbs, almost all of which are to do with 
				suasion of some kind which take a direct nominalised clause with 
				the <em>to-</em>infinitive as the object.<br />
				The structure they conform to is:<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style93">Structure:</td>
						<td class="auto-style76">subject</td>
						<td class="auto-style76">verb</td>
						<td class="auto-style76">indirect object</td>
						<td class="auto-style94">nominalised clause as direct 
						object</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style129" rowspan="2" valign="middle">
						Examples:</td>
						<td class="auto-style33"><em>She</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style33"><em>persuaded</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style33"><em>her mother</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style96"><em>to lend her the money</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style131"><em>Peter and John</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style131"><em>forced</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style131"><em>their elder sister</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style132"><em>to sell her house</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				It is probably impossible to come up with a complete list but 
				this is near enough:<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style133" style="width: 523px">

						<td style="width: 86px"><em>advise<br />

				* This verb is only used with a negative clause as its object.<br />
				As we saw, none of these verbs is properly catenative in the 
				active voice but all may be seen that way in the passive.&nbsp; 
				We get, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was compelled to leave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was persuaded to come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were paid to go</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				For our purposes, these are analysed as verbs taking nominalised
				<em>to-</em>infinitive clauses as their objects rather than as 
				catenative verbs <em>per se</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Another issue is that modal auxiliary verbs, which 
			are often followed by the bare infinitive non-finite form or even 
			the <em>to-</em>infinitive are not 
			usually considered examples of catenation.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I must go now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She should arrive soon</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to start somewhere</em><br />
			etc. are not considered here.<br />
			However, there is a grey area when we come to consider semi-modal 
			auxiliary verbs such as <em>dare, need </em>and<em> used</em>.<br />
			When these verbs are used as full modal auxiliaries as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I dared not ask again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need not tell you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Used he to work here?</em><br />
			they are not considered examples of catenation but when they are 
			used as full lexical or main verbs in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't dare to ask<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't need to do that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he used to work here?</em><br />
			they may be considered examples of catenation but will not be 
			included here as the marginal modal auxiliary verbs are dealt with elsewhere on this site 
			(linked below in the list of related guides at the end).</p>
			<p>Finally, we need to consider prepositional verbs and phrasal-prepositional verbs, some of which catenate as in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went on talking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put off meeting him<br />

			<p>The problem facing learners (and teachers who are concerned not 
			to confuse learners) is that there are six possibilities to consider 
			in terms of what verb form may follow the main verb in a clause.&nbsp; 
			Here they are with examples of each and each will be considered in a 
			section in this guide.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Verbs followed by the non-finite <em>to-</em>infinitive.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hoped <span class="style_black">
				<strong>to help</strong></span></em></li>
				<li>Verbs followed by the non-finite -<em>ing</em> form (also called a 
				gerund).&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She avoided <span class="style_black">
				<strong>meeting</strong></span> me</em></li>
				<li>Verbs followed by <em>to</em> plus the <em>-ing</em> form.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They looked forward
				<span class="style_black"><strong>to staying </strong></span>at 
				the house</em></li>
				<li>Verbs followed by the bare infinitive.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She helped <span class="style_black">
				<strong>make</strong></span> the proposal</em></li>
				<li>Verbs followed by either the <em>to-</em>infinitive or the <em>-ing</em> 
				form with no change in meaning.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They started <span class="style_black">
				<strong>to work</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They started <span class="style_black"><strong>working</strong></span></em></li>
				<li>Verbs followed by either the <em>to-</em>infinitive or the <em>-ing</em> 
				form but with a change in meaning.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I regret <span class="style_black">
				<strong>to say</strong></span> that he can't be here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I regret <span class="style_black"><strong>saying</strong></span> 
				that he can't be here</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Nearly all verbs which naturally catenate fall into one of the 
			first two categories so they are the ones which should receive the 
			most focus, especially at early stages of learning.<br />
			We can include the verbs in point 5. at any stage because it really 
			doesn't matter which form the learner selects.</p>
			<p>(One important verb is alleged to catenate with the past 
			participle form as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We got lost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she got sacked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary got investigated<br />
			</em>but a better analysis of this construction is the use of <em>
			get</em> as a dynamic passive, so you will see no more of it here.)</p>

				</table>
			<p>A difficulty we shall encounter here is the function of the verb.&nbsp; 
			In some analyses, people prefer to use the term 
			<span class="style_black">-<em>ing</em> form</span> to 
			describe the catenating verb in many of the examples below.&nbsp; In 
			others, the term <span class="style_black">gerund</span> is freely used.&nbsp; 
			In others, a distinction is made between a verbal noun, a deverbal 
			noun and a gerund 
			(although the borderlines are somewhat fuzzy).</p>
			<p>Technically, both a gerund and a verbal noun may be defined as <span class="style_black">
			<em>a verb form which functions as a noun</em></span>, but that is slightly 
			misleading because there is a cline between the use of a 
			word as a verb and its use as a noun derived from the verb so, for 
			example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is flying to Scotland tomorrow</em><br />
			is clearly the use of <em>flying</em> as a verb.<br />
			and in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is flying cheaper?</em><br />
			the use of <em>flying</em> is much more like a noun because it can be 
			modified by the adjective <em>cheaper</em>.&nbsp; It cannot, 
			however, be preceded by an adjective or made plural as most nouns 
			can.&nbsp; It is also rare to see it modified by a determiner so 
			both:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the flying</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the excellent flying</em><br />
			are vanishingly rare and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *her flyings</em><br />
			is plain wrong.<br />
			In these examples, the -<em>ing</em> form is a verbal noun rather 
			than a gerund because gerunds may be modified by adverbs and the 
			form <em>flying</em> cannot be modified that way.&nbsp; We cannot, 
			for example, use:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *cheaply flying</em><br />
			as a modified noun phrase.<br />
			However, in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> The beautiful furnishings in the house</em><br />
			the word <em>furnishings</em> is clearly a noun because it is modified by the 
			definite article and the adjective <em>beautiful</em> as well as being made 
			plural in the normal way.&nbsp; It is, nevertheless, also derived by 
			adding the suffix -<em>ing</em> to the verb <em>furnish</em>.&nbsp; 
			In this case we are dealing with a noun derived from a verb which is 
			fully noun-like in all regards so it is a deverbal noun.<br />
			Almost any verb can be used with the -<em>ing</em> form in some way.&nbsp; 
			The question is to see whether the word is acting more as a verb or 
			more as a noun.&nbsp; It is not always an easy choice.</p>
			<p>So, the difference between a gerund, a verbal noun and a deverbal 
			noun lies in the 
			fact that gerunds retain verb-like qualities partially lost in a verbal noun 
			and lost altogether in deverbal nouns.&nbsp; 
			Like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Gerunds retain verbal characteristics even when they are 
				acting as pseudo-nouns so:<ol class="auto-style31">
					<li>They may be used with possessive determiners so we 
					allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My confessing the truth solved the 
					matter</em></li>
					<li>They can take direct objects so we can have, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John's telling her was a mistake</em><br />
					where <em>her</em> acts as the direct object of the gerund.</li>
					<li>They are modified by adverbs just a true verbs are so we 
					can have, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Driving quickly was dangerous<br />
					</em>in which the gerund is modified by the adverb <em>
					quickly</em> and we cannot have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Quick driving was dangerous</em></li>
					<li>Gerunds form at best uncountable pseudo-nouns and are 
					not pluralised so we cannot have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *His frequent drivings to London</em></li>
					<li>Gerunds are only formed by the addition of the<em> -ing</em> 
					suffix.&nbsp; For this reason, <em>deciding</em> is 
					classifiable as a gerund but <em>decision</em> cannot be.&nbsp; 
					Both are, however, nouns clearly derived from the verb.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Verbal nouns occupy a midway position taking on many of the 
				characteristics of gerunds plus some more noun-like qualities.<ol class="auto-style31">
					<li>They are noun-like insofar as they can form the subject 
					or object of a verb, just like gerunds so we get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swimming is enjoyable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dislike waiting</em></li>
					<li>They may be modified by adjectives rather than adverbs 
					as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slower driving is usually safer</em></li>
					<li>They do not take direct objects so we do not allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *His building 
					the house took time</em></li>
					<li>They are uncountable mass concepts and cannot be 
					pluralised so we do not allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *His many drivings to London</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Deverbal nouns act as nouns in all respects and they often 
				carry the sense of the verb's completion, so:<ol class="auto-style31">
					<li>They cannot take a direct object because they are not 
					verbs so we do not allow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*His painting the village looked awful</em><br />
					and need to insert a prepositional phrase to get the same 
					meaning as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His painting of the village looked 
					awful</em></li>
					<li>They are modified by adjectives, not adverbs so, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did some necessary washing</em><br />in which the -<em>ing</em> form may not be modified 
				adverbially so:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I did some slowly washing<br />
					</em>is not allowed.</li>
					<li>They can form countable nouns and can, therefore, 
					be pluralised in the normal way of nouns as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fittings in the house were expensive</em></li>
					<li>Deverbal nouns may be formed in other ways from verbs and 
					not only with the -<em>ing</em> suffix so we can have, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discovery</em> as a noun from the verb <em>discover<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finish</em> as a noun from the verb <em>finish</em> with no 
					changes (a process of simple conversion)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carriage</em> as a noun from the verb <em>carry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refusal</em> as a noun from the verb <em>refuse<br />
					</em>and so on (for more examples of how nouns are formed 
					from verbs, see the guide to nouns, linked below).&nbsp; All the resulting nouns are fully noun-like 
					in behaviour and carry little verbal force.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here's a handy, cut-out-and-keep summary of noun-like verbs:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="summary" height="534" src="../../imagesgraphics/gerund_vs_verbal_noun.png" width="620" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>It is not always as simple as this suggests because there is a 
			cline from purely verbal uses of a word to purely nominal uses <em>via</em> 
			gerunds which have characteristics of both verbs and nouns up to 
			verbal and deverbal nouns.&nbsp; We can summarise this cline like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="gerunds etc." height="304" src="../../imagesgraphics/gerund.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>This issue will soon become apparent when we consider the 
			difference between, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not permitted to smoke in the room by 
			the hotel</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hotel did not permit smoking in the room</em><br />
			In the first case, we have a catenative structure with <em>permit</em> 
			followed by the infinitive with <em>to</em> and that is analogous 
			to, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hotel did not permit me to smoke in the 
			room</em><br />
			In the second case, the form is analogous to:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hotel did not permit pets in the room<br />
			</em>and that is evidence that we are dealing with a verb, <em>
			permit</em>, and its direct-object noun, <em>pets</em>.&nbsp; If 
			<em>pets</em> is clearly a noun then, by analogy, we should also consider <em>
			smoking</em> a noun in the same environment.&nbsp; But <em>pets</em> 
			is a plural and there is no plural of <em>smoking</em>.</p>
			<p>Another noun-like quality of -<em>ing</em> forms is their ability 
			to act as classifiers, a grammatical role usually considered the 
			domain of nouns.&nbsp; For example, just as we can have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pet passport</em><br />
			we can also have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a flying lesson<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a smoking area<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the furnishing department<br />
			</em>and so on.</p>
			<p>The upshot of all this is that it is not always enough simply to 
			state that such and such a verb is followed by the gerund or an 
			infinitive.&nbsp; We have to make a decision about whether the -<em>ing</em> 
			form is really a verb or actually a verbal or deverbal noun derived from a verb acting 
			as the subject or object of another verb.<br />
			Two more examples will help to show the difference.</p>
			<ol class="auto-style31">
				<li>In:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope to fly early tomorrow</em><br />we have a case of verb catenation with the verbs 
				<em>hope</em> and
			<em>fly</em> linked together.&nbsp; So, therefore:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *I hope flying early tomorrow</em><br />is malformed and unacceptable.<br />However, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope flying will not be too expensive</em><br />we have a 
				verbal noun acting as the object of 
			the verb <em>hope</em> and that is not a case of catenation.</li>
				<li>In:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He decided to race on Sunday<br />
				</em>we have catenation again, with the verbs <em>decide</em> and 
				<em>to race</em> 
				following each other directly.&nbsp; So, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He decided racing on Sunday<br />
				</em>is not acceptable because <em>decide</em> is a prospective 
				verb which takes, as is conventional, the infinitive with <em>to</em>.<br />
				However, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched the exciting racing<br />
				</em>we do not have a case of catenation because <em>racing</em> 
				is clearly a noun (albeit a verbal noun) preceded by 
				the definite article and an adjective which also break the chain.&nbsp; It is, 
				however, not fully noun-like because it cannot be preceded by 
				the indefinite article or made plural, so both<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a racing<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the racings<br />
				</em>are not allowed.<br />
				It does have other noun-like characteristics, on the other hand, 
				because it can be classified by a noun and it can be modified by 
				an adjective as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched the horse racing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The motor racing was exciting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exciting formula one motor racing is what I watched<br />
				</em>etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For this reason, we distinguish below between a noun formed from a 
			verb and a verb with the -<em>ing</em> ending.&nbsp; The 
			term gerund will be confined to those 
			examples in which the insertion of a noun is possible without a 
			change in meaning of the verb so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate swimming</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swimming is enjoyable</em><br />
			both contain gerunds and can be replaced with other nouns not 
			derived from verbs so we can also have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate fish</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fish tastes awful</em><br />
			by analogy.<br />
			In other cases, the use of the term -<em>ing</em> form will usually be preferred.</p>

			<p>In nearly all cases, the use of the <em>to-</em>infinitive 
			signals that the event represented by the main verb takes place before that 
			represented by the following verb(s).&nbsp; 
			In other words, the use is prospective rather than retrospective.&nbsp; 
			This is not an absolute rule but is certainly the way to bet.<br />
			For example, if one says:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I agreed to come</em><br />
			then the agreeing clearly precedes the coming.<br />
			This rule of thumb applies even when the following action is 
			unfulfilled as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I declined to go with them</em><br />
			because even here, the declining precedes the not going.</p>
			<p>Incidentally, the prospective nature of the <em>to-</em>infinitive 
			also explains the use and meaning of the <em>going to</em> structure 
			(so called).<br />
			Coursebooks and many teachers (and many teacher trainers) are wedded 
			to the idea that <em>going to</em> is some kind of mysterious 
			structure confined to future intentionality.<br />
			It isn't, naturally, because it is simply the verb <em>go</em> 
			followed by a <em>to-</em>infinitive in the same way that verbs such 
			as <em>want, hope, expect, plan, aim, intend, mean </em>and many 
			more are used.<br />
			They all denote a prospective aspect in some way and are all 
			analysable in precisely the same way.<br />
			In other words, the structure is not:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>going to </em>+ the bare infinitive<br />
			it is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>going </em>+ the <em>to-</em>infinitive.<br />
			The upshot is that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm hoping to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm intending to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm meaning to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to go</em><br />
			are all more or less synonymous barring the strength of the 
			intention signalled by the verb.&nbsp; That consideration is 
			semantic not grammatical.</p>

			<p>There are three issues to consider:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first issue with the use of a <em>to-</em>infinitive 
				after a verb is distinguishing it from the so-called infinitive 
				of purpose, i.e., the <em>to</em> which forms part of a 
				complex marginal subordinator (<em>in order to) </em>linking a 
				main clause to a non-finite subordinate clause, 
				signifying purpose.&nbsp; The analysis in the guide 
				to such matters generally avoids the use of the term <em>infinitive of purpose</em> 
				because it is misleading.&nbsp; It is not the meaningless <em>
				to-</em> particle which forms part of the traditional infinitive 
				in English.<br />
				Essentially, the use of <em>to</em> is sometimes simply a 
				shorthand for the subordinator <em>in order to</em>, for example in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came to help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped to think<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She interrupted to ask a question</em><br />
				all the instances of <em>to</em> can be replaced by another 
				causal marker so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came so that she could help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped because he wanted to think<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She interrupted in order to ask a question</em><br />
				so these are not, in this analysis, examples of catenation 
				proper.<br />
				However, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expected to be asked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thought to congratulate her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They hoped to win</em><br />
				we do have real catenation because in none of these cases is it 
				possible to replace the <em>to</em> with the alternatives 
				suggested above.<br />
				We cannot have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I expected so that I would be asked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She thought because she wanted to congratulate her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They hoped in order to win</em></li>
				<li>Secondly, in the list that follows, it is usually possible to replace the 
			second verb with a noun of any kind providing the verb itself can be 
			or must be used transitively.&nbsp; In these cases, a gerund derived 
			from a verb is sometimes a possible alternative because it acts as 
			the direct object of the verb itself.&nbsp; Where this is possible, 
			it is noted.<br />
				Many verbs associated with permissibility appear to take an <em>
				-ing</em> form as a second verb but usually the case is that the 
				-<em>ing</em> form is acting as a noun (as is the wont of 
				gerunds) and is, therefore, not a verb but the direct object of 
				the first verb.&nbsp; This means that verbs such as <em>allow, 
				permit, forbid </em>and so on do not occur in the list which 
				follows as we analyse, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She allows smoking in the house</em><br />
				as akin to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She allows cigarettes in the house.</em></li>
				<li>Finally, because catenation with the <em>to-</em>infinitive 
				often refers to a prospective event, any adverbial will normally 
				be interpreted as applying to the second verb so, for example, 
				in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She promised to come today</em><br />
				the normal interpretation will be that it is <em>today</em> that 
				she will come, not <em>today</em> that she promised.&nbsp; Any 
				ambiguity can be removed by moving the adverbial and having, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, she promised to come</em><br />
				which only has one interpretation.<br />
				The verb <em>agree</em> also creates the ambiguous sense in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She agreed to start immediately</em><br />
				in which it is not clear whether the adverb modifies <em>agree</em> 
				or <em>start</em>.<br />
				Again, moving the adverb makes things clear so we can have 
				either:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She immediately agreed to start<br />
				</em>or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She agreed to start immediately</em><br />
				Naturally, if the adverbial itself signals future time, there is 
				no ambiguity so:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She expected to arrive next week</em><br />
				has only one possible meaning.<br />
				The possible ambiguity can arise with a number of the verbs in 
				the following list.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following are the most common of these verbs with some notes 
			where necessary.&nbsp; The list includes verbs which always take a 
			direct object and do not properly catenate because the object is 
			positioned between the verb and the non-finite form.</p>

			<p>These verbs consistently, not invariably, refer to past experience or to a 
			retrospective view of events.<br />
			For example, if one says:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; She admitted stealing the money</em><br />
			it is clear that the admission follows the theft and in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I hate standing in a queue</em><br />
			the clear implication is that the speaker has experience of standing 
			in a queue and hates it.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would hate to hurt his feelings</em><br />
			which is clearly a prospective use and the verb catenates with the 
			infinitive.<br />
			This is an unreliable rule of thumb and there are many exceptions.</p>
			<p>The other aid to memory is that the majority of verbs used with a 
			gerund can just as easily (often more naturally) be followed by a 
			direct noun object.&nbsp; As a gerund is often described as a form 
			of noun, this is unsurprising.&nbsp; In fact, in many cases below 
			where it is seen that the retrospective-prospective 'rule' is 
			abrogated, a better analysis may well be that the verb is being 
			followed by a noun-like direct object.&nbsp; That is often simpler 
			for learners to understand because they are familiar with, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I left the keys on the table</em><br />
			and it is a short step to the figurative use in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I left doing the cooking till later</em><br />
			Not listed here are phrasal and prepositional verbs because, with 
			rare exceptions they are always followed by the gerund.</p>
			<p>A source of difficulty here is that some transitive verbs 
			normally followed by the <em>to-</em>infinitive can also take a 
			verb with -<em>ing</em> as the direct object so, for example, 
			we see:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I omitted writing the label on the box<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I offered flying as an alternative to driving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They permitted smoking in the theatre<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He taught woodworking at the school</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			In these cases we have the -<em>ing</em> form acting only as a noun 
			phrase and all can be replaced with non-verbal nouns.&nbsp; It is a 
			gerund by the definition we have above.&nbsp; All 
			those verbs appear in the list above as being followed by the <em>
			to-</em>infinitive.<br />
			In many cases in this list, it is clear that the -<em>ing</em> form 
			is often acting as a simple noun complement and there is little 
			sense of true catenation.</p>

			<p>A few verbs are followed by <em>to</em> plus an -<em>ing</em>

			in the same way that we have a gerund following prepositional verbs

			<p>The verbs <em>come</em> and <em>go</em> are often, it is averred, 
			followed by the bare infinitive as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come have a drink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go take a seat at the front<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please come sit by me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should go see</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			However, these are not cases of simple catenation because they are, 
			in fact, examples of the ellipsis of a conjunction.&nbsp; All these 
			examples are, in the full form:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Come and have a drink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go and take a seat at the front<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please come and sit by me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should go and see</em><br />
			The reason for excluding these forms from cases of true catenation 
			is that the senses of the two verbs are not connected, they are 
			simply coordinated and could be expressed in separate sentences or 
			clauses.&nbsp; 
			We can equally well have, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please come in.&nbsp; Have a drink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the front and sit down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come over here and you'll be able to sit down by me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should go so that you can see</em></p>
			<p>The other part of explanation is that these two verbs do not, in 
			reality, catenate at all in the sense of the lists above.&nbsp; Both 
			are used with coordination expressions signifying purpose or 
			causality.&nbsp; We can, therefore, rephrase all the examples as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Come so that you can have a drink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go with the aim of taking a seat at the front<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please come in order to sit by me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should go so you can see</em></p>
			<p>The verbs <em>wait</em> and <em>see</em> and <em>come</em> and
			<em>look</em> are frequently 
			coordinated as in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must wait and see what the weather's like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come and look what I have found<br />
			</em>but with other verbs, <em>wait</em> and <em>come</em> take the <em>to</em>-infinitive 
			as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will wait to hear from her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I waited to eat until she arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came to help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came to believe him<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			The verb <em>try</em> is also frequently used colloquially 
			coordinated with others so we hear (but rarely read):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Try and help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try and see if you can come<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			but in more formal uses, in this meaning <em>try</em> is usually 
			catenated with the <em>to-</em>infinitive.</p>

			<p>We poured some doubt at the outset of this guide on the 
			assumption that verbs which do not form <strong>uninterrupted</strong> 
			chains are actually definable as catenative in the true sense.&nbsp; 
			However, some causative verbs are seen that way so they are included 
			here.</p>
			<p>Three, and only three, causative verbs catenate with the bare 
			infinitive: <em>have, let</em> and <em>make</em>.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had the boy re-do his homework<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She let the children go home early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They made the people wait too long</em><br />
			and that seems simple enough.<br />
			However, the direct object in these sentences breaks the chain.<br />
			There exists, however, a nasty colligation trap for the unwary which 
			does concern catenation.&nbsp; 
			In the passive, the case is altered and the <em>to-</em>infinitive 
			substituted for the bare infinitive with only two of these verbs (<em>have</em> 
			and <em>make</em> but not <em>let</em>) <em>and</em> that is wholly 
			non-intuitive, causing problems for learners.&nbsp; We get, 
			therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy was made <strong>to</strong> re-do 
			his homework<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children were let go home early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people were made <strong>to</strong> wait too long<br />
			</em>Moreover, <em>let</em> is different in allowing a passive 
			infinitive as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They let the dogs be walked by the neighbours<br />
			and neither <em>make</em> nor<em> have</em> can be used that way so 
			we do not allow:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They made the dogs to be walked by the neighbours<br />
			</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They had the dogs be walked by the neighbours.<br />
			</em>For more on the causative, see the guide, linked below.</p>

			<p>Again, the use of many of these verbs requires a direct object to 
			break the catenation so they are not <em>stricto sensu </em>
			catenating forms.&nbsp; However, ...</p>
			<p>There are a number of verbs, often lumped together in a single 
			group, unfortunately for learners, which refer to perception and 
			catenate with the bare infinitive in some cases.<br />
			Here's a non-exhaustive list:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>general perception</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>detect, discern, miss, note, perceive, sense, spot</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>seeing</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>catch (sight of), espy, examine, gaze (at), glimpse, 
				inspect, look (at), notice, observe, see, stare (at), view, 
				watch, witness</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>smell</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>smell</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>touch</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>feel</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>hear</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>hear, listen (to)</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The list is quite unbalanced, as you see / perceive / notice etc. 
			because most of our sensory perception is visual.<br />
			Added to the mix is that some, such as <em>listen, observe, examine
			</em>are active in the sense of purposeful but others such as <em>
			see, hear </em>and<em> smell</em> are often passive and 
			non-purposeful.&nbsp; The distinction is not always clear to 
			learners whose languages may differ.</p>
			<p>These verbs can take either a bare infinitive or, slightly more 
			formally, and irregularly, an -<em>ing</em> participle clause.<br />
			The key is often to whether reference is to the whole action or a part of 
			it, usually.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw him drink the beer</em><br />
			implies that I saw the whole action, from the full to the empty 
			glass, whereas:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw him drinking the beer</em><br />
			implies that I only saw a part of the action which started before 
			and finished after my observation.<br />
			Equally, there is a difference between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard her sing at the concert</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard her singing upstairs</em><br />
			in which the first implies that I watched the whole performance and 
			the second that I heard only part of her singing.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style133">
				<tr>
					<td><em>I detected John asking Mary</em></td>
					<td><em>We inspected the engine start / starting</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><em>I discerned food cooking</em></td>
					<td><em>They looked at the sun rise / rising</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><em>I missed the food cooking</em></td>
					<td><em>I noticed the ground move / moving</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><em>I noted the people come / coming</em></td>
					<td><em>They observed the team play / playing</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><em>She perceived the class misbehave / misbehaving</em></td>
					<td><em>We stared at the man cycling</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><em>I sensed the mood change / changing</em></td>
					<td><em>They viewed the bar open / opening</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><em>They spotted the earth shake / shaking</em></td>
					<td><em>We watched John paint / painting the picture</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><em>We caught sight of the tree falling</em></td>
					<td><em>I witnessed the accident happen / happening</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><em>They espied the cook leaving by the back door</em></td>
					<td><em>She smelled the food cook / cooking</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><em>We examined the class work / working</em></td>
					<td><em>They felt the house shake / shaking</em></td>

				<tr>
					<td><em>They gazed at the moon wax / waxing</em></td>
					<td><em>We heard the man move / moving</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><em>I glimpsed the door open / opening</em></td>
					<td><em>We listened to John play / playing piano</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>As with causative verbs, however, a fly resides in the ointment 
			because when we make any of the sentences passive, the option has to 
			be the <em>to</em>- infinitive not the bare infinitive or the 
			participle form.<br />
			So it is that we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were heard to move<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The food was seen to cook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was felt to shake</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			And not:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The cook was seen leave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The house was felt shake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The accident was witnessed happen</em><br />
			That is fully non-intuitive for learners, causes problems and needs 
			to be taught and practised.</p>

			<p>Teaching in this area is undeniably challenging especially when 
			one considers that many languages do not share the characteristics 
			of English either having no infinitive form at all (like Greek) or, 
			like French and many others, having only a single form of the 
			non-finite with no distinction between, e.g., <em>to smoke</em> and
			<em>smoking</em> in that sense.<br />
			Learners whose first language only has one non-finite form to choose 
			will often select the infinitive so we hear errors such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I dislike to do that</em><br />
			or they may settle on the -<em>ing</em> form as their sole choice 
			and say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I expected for going</em><br />
			A third possibility is that, in some despair, learners will choose 
			the form at random.</p>
			<p>There are some possible ways to help:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Aiding noticing of chunks:</strong></dt>
				<dd>Whenever a text is used, for whatever purpose, it is useful if 
				learners can be helped to notice chunks of language 
				which they can commit to memory and there are some obvious 
				examples in the lists above:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look forward to seeing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beg to differ<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chance to meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happen to see</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				It is also worth taking the time to check whether a verb is 
				catenative and what usually follows it.&nbsp; That way, verbs 
				which are followed by the <em>to-</em>infinitive can be taught 
				with <em>to</em> included in the chunk so, instead of teaching<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arrange, choose, deserve, expect<br />
				</em>as single words, teaching<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arrange to, choose to, deserve to, expect to</em><br />
				helps considerably.<br />
				This is similar to the ways in which one might approach phrasal 
				and prepositional verbs.<br />
				The danger with this approach is, however, that many of these 
				verbs are transitive and take a direct object so learning them 
				as chunks can lead to error such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *I arranged to a holiday</em><br />
				They may also be followed by a nominalised clause and, again, 
				there is no place for <em>to</em> in such constructions and the 
				approach may produce error, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I expect to she will be there.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Awareness-raising of the rule of thumb</strong></dt>
				<dd>We saw above that the <em>to-</em>infinitive generally is 
				prospective in nature so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I intend to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I plan to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arranged to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I determined to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I chose to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expected to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hoped to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I forgot to go</em><br />
				all refer to the future after the main verb.<br />
				The -<em>ing</em>, gerund form, is often used with verbs that 
				refer to past experience or to past events so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I forget talking to her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I regret upsetting her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I deny taking it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate waiting in queues<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I loathe eating out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dislike swimming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall seeing the film</em><br />
				all refer to the speaker's past experience or to events that 
				precede the main verb.<br />
				This is by no means an infallible rule and there are numerous 
				exceptions but it takes some of the guessing out of the 
				equation.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Awareness-raising of synonymy and antonymy</strong></dt>
				<dd>Verbs which are synonymous (or nearly so) or antonymous will 
				often share characteristics regarding catenation so, for 
				example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>hate, love, like, loathe, enjoy, detest, adore</em><br />
				are all followed by the -<em>ing</em> form<br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intend, mean, plan, arrange, promise, 
				swear, long, hope</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>compel, command, instruct, force, order, encourage, 
				forbid, permit</em><br />
				are all followed by the <em>to-</em>infinitive.<br />
				If a new verb is encountered and the meaning is similar to one 
				already known, it is often helpful to know that it is likely to 
				catenate in the same way.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Not being too technical</strong></dt>
				<dd>We saw above that true catenative verbs abut each other in 
				sequences with no intervening object so while, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I compelled him to stay</em><br />
				is not, technically, catenative because the object breaks the 
				chain<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was compelled to stay</em><br />
				is catenative because the verbs follow in sequence.<br />
				However, for teaching purposes, whether there is an intervening 
				object or not makes no difference to the basic structure of the 
				clause and can be ignored.<br />
				Nevertheless, when an intervening object is involved, especially if 
				it is a long one, we need to alert learners so that they can 
				notice the basic structure in for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_underline">asked</span> my brother, my two sisters and 
				myself <span class="style_underline">to come</span> to her party.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_underline">can't stand</span> the neighbours and their friends continually 
				<span class="style_underline">having</span> parties.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Using -<em>ing</em> form, noun formed from a verb or gerund</strong></dt>
				<dd>We saw above that there are times when verbs will combine 
				with a gerund or with an infinitive depending on how the 
				following word is seen.&nbsp; As a noun in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She forbade smoking in the room</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was forbidden to smoke in the room</em><br />
				In cases such as these, it may be better to tell learners that 
				we have a noun in the first example, formed from the verb and a 
				verb proper in the second.</dd>

			<p>By definition catenative verbs occur in connected speech so, 
			apart from the usual considerations of getting the pronunciation of 
			individual sounds right, it is worth considering what features of 
			connected speech may be present in any catenated clause.<br />
			There are no pronunciation issues which are unique to catenative 
			verb constructions but it is as well to be aware of what to teach in 
			this area if learners are to sound natural.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The weakened form of <em>to</em>.<br />
				The <em>to-</em>infinitive is almost always pronounced with a 
				weakened form of <em>to</em> so we get, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wanted to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They waited to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary expected to take the train</em><br />
				with <em>to </em>pronounced as /tə/ in all cases (/ˈwɒn.tɪd.tə.ɡəʊ/, 
				for example).</li>
				<li>Elision, gemination and twin sounds<br />
				If the first verb ends in a /t/ sound, there is a strong 
				tendency to elide one of /t/ sounds altogether and we get, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>hoped to be there</em><br />
				pronounced as<br />
				/həʊpt.ə.bi.ðeə/<br />
				there is a case to be made that in careful speech the sound may 
				be very slightly lengthened (that's gemination) so we get the 
				same phrase pronounced as<br />
				/həʊptː.ə.bi.ðeə/ with a slightly longer /t/ sound than is 
				normal.<br />
				Alternatively, and much less frequently, in careful speech, both 
				/t/ sounds are present as in:<br />
				/həʊpt.tə.bi.ðeə/</li>
				<li>Assimilation and elision<br />
				This is a common feature of connected speech certainly not 
				confined to catenative verbs.&nbsp; Even when the first verb 
				does not end in a /t/ sound but, as is frequently the case, with 
				a /d/, some assimilation or even full elision of the /t/ of <em>
				to</em> is noticeable so we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wanted to be there</em><br />
				pronounced as<br />
				/ˈwɒn.tɪd.ə.bi.ðeə/</li>
				<li>Catenation<br />
				This is, of course, the other use of the term as it applies to 
				connected speech phenomena and means that instead of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regret asking</em><br />
				being pronounced as<br />
				/rɪ.ˈɡret.ˈɑːsk.ɪŋ/<br />
				the /t/ may be shifted to the beginning of the second verb and 
				it sounds more like:<br />
				/rɪ.ˈɡre.ˈtɑːsk.ɪŋ/<br />
				This is not a common feature and probably not one on which to 
				dwell in the classroom.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Other features of connected speech may be present in any set of 
			catenative verbs that you are setting out to teach so checking for 
			such issues at the planning stage can avoid problems later.</p>
