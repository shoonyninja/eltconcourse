		<h1>Concord</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="handshake" height="207" src="../../images/handshake310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p>Concord can be defined as:</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><em>agreement between words 
		in gender, number, case, person etc. which changes the forms of words.</em></p>
		<p>The thing to be clear about is the direction of causality.&nbsp; 
		Concord determines which inflexion is appropriate, not the other way 
		around.<br />
		In the definition, <strong>concord</strong> is seen as synonymous with
		<strong>agreement</strong> and that's a reasonable position to take.&nbsp; 
		We will stick with <strong>concord</strong> here because we are mostly 
		dealing with verbs and pronouns but agreement also exists, for example 
		between determiners such as <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> which agree 
		only with singular nouns whereas <em>these</em> and <em>those</em> 
		define plural entities.</p>
			<p>English concord would, on the face of it, seem easy because English 
		lacks (mostly) gender and case considerations so we are left with 
		number.<br />
		In most tenses for most verbs, too, the verb in English is not inflected to show number 
		at all.&nbsp; This means that:<br />
		<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data appeared to confirm this</span><br />
		</em>will not alter whether you are using the noun <em>data</em> as a singular 
		mass concept or the plural of <em>datum</em> (which is what it is).&nbsp; 
		However, used with a verb like <em>be </em>or the present simple tense 
		that does alter to show number, then the speaker / writer must make a 
		choice.<br />
		Either:<br />
		<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data appear to confirm this</span></em><br />
		or<br />
		<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data appears to confirm this</span></em><br />
		and either:<br />
		<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data were hard to get</span></em><br />
		or<br />
		<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data was hard to get</span></em><br />
		Many other languages inflect the verb in all persons to show whether 
		the subject is singular or plural and speakers of these languages will 
		generally be quite clear and consistent in matching verb form to number.&nbsp; 
		In this respect, English may appear sloppy and inconsistent.<br />
			Furthermore, as far as the morphology of words is concerned, English 
			does not show gender on the noun or any modifiers.&nbsp; You are 
			probably aware that many other languages do so, for example, in 
			French:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an interesting man</em><br />
			translates as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; un homme intéressant</em><br />
			but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an interesting woman</em><br />
			as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; une femme intéressante<br />
			</em>and you can see that both the indefinite article and the 
			adjective have an added '<em>e</em>' so that they agree in gender 
			with the noun.&nbsp; The pronunciation of both items is different, 
			too.</p>
			<p>Most verbs in English:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>take only one change in the present simple to signal number 
				and person, the -<em>s</em> or -<em>es</em> inflexion on the 
				verb to show third-person singular:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She go<strong><span class="style_underline">es<br />
				</span></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He smoke<span class="style_underline"><strong>s</strong></span></em></li>
				<li>when regular, only make one change to the form, adding -<em>ed</em> 
				or <em>-d</em> to the base to signal the past tense, past 
				participle or adjectival forms:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They close<span class="style_underline"><strong>d</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has disappear<span class="style_underline"><strong>ed</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a finish<span class="style_underline"><strong>ed</strong></span> 
				job</em><br />
				when irregular cannot make more than two changes to signal past 
				form and past participle / adjective form with many making only 
				one change and some making no changes at all:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They d<span class="style_underline"><strong>u</strong></span>g 
				over the garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has br<span class="style_underline"><strong>ought</strong></span> 
				the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It cost a lot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the br<span class="style_underline"><strong>oken</strong></span> 
				part</em></li>
				<li>can take the -<em>ing</em> inflexion to form 
				present participles, gerunds and adjectives and there are no 
				irregularities in the system at all:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is go<span class="style_underline"><strong>ing</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some break<strong><span class="style_underline">ing</span>
				</strong>news<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They like fish<span class="style_underline"><strong>ing</strong></span></em></li>
			</ul>
		<p>So, verbs in English have only four possible forms: the base, e.g.,
		<em>arrive</em>, the third-person singular form, <em>arrives</em>, the -<em>ing</em> 
		form, <em>arriving</em>, and the <em>-ed /-en</em> form, <em>arrived</em>.<br />
		No other changes to most verbs are possible.<br />
		The verb <em>be</em> in English is very irregular.&nbsp; It has eight 
		variations determined by concord: <em>be, am, is, are, being, was, were, 
		been</em>.<br />
		In other languages verbs may have more than eight forms (sometimes many 
		more).&nbsp; In many other languages, German and French, for example, 
		all verbs typically have around 20 different forms signalling person, 
		tense, gender, mood and number.</p>
			<p>The only other inflexions in English, apart from in the pronoun 
			and determiner system, is the plural marking and the genitive <em>'s</em> 
			marking on nouns:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two computer<span class="style_underline"><strong>s</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the computer<span class="style_underline"><strong>'s</strong></span> 
			hard drive<br />
			</em>There are a few exceptions with some irregular or unmarked 
			plurals (<em>mice, sheep</em> etc.) but there are no irregular 
			genitive endings at all.<br />
			In other languages, nouns may be altered to show gender, case and 
			number and may have multiple possible inflexions.</p>
			<p>Pronouns and determiners also exhibit concord, of course, and in 
			this case English has reasonably well developed sets.&nbsp; Full 
			lists are available in the guides to pronouns so some examples will 
			do here:</p>
			<p>Pronouns and determiners are marked for person, number and gender 
			and must comply with the concord rules so we accept:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people brought their friends<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said her goodbyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The table fell on its side</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a pencil on the table.&nbsp; It is yours?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass me those plates</em><br />
			but we will not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Mary brought their friends </em>(unless the 
			friends were associated with someone else)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She said our goodbyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The table fell on these side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *There are a pencil on the table.&nbsp; Is they you?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Pass me that plates<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<p>A simple rule of thumb in English is</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><em> A subject which is not definitely marked for 
		plural requires a singular verb<br />
		</em><span class="auto-style19">(Quirk and 
		Greenbaum, 1973: 176)</span></p>
		<p>and that should be a simple rule teachable in 5 minutes.<br />
		But, as we shall see, the situation is not quite as clear as it might 
		seem.</p>

			<p class="style_brown">Before we discuss the individual issues, 
			there are two terms to get clear:</p>
			<dl>
	<dt><span class="style_brown"><strong>
			<a name="2" class="style_brown"></a>Notional concord</strong></span></dt>
	<dd><span class="style_brown">This is defined as  </span>  <em>
	<span class="style_black">The agreement of a sentence's number, person, 
	gender etc. with its meaning instead of what is grammatically (i.e. 
	prescriptively) correct</span><span class="style_brown"> </span> </em><span class="style_brown">(ODLT (n.d.)).<br />
	In other words, it is the <strong>idea</strong> in the mind of the speaker / 
	writer which overcomes the grammatical imperative to insert a singular or 
	plural verb.<br />
	Many of the sentences above which you may have marked correct but which are 
	technically 'wrong' fall into this category.&nbsp; For example, the 
	difference between<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jury are divided<br />
	</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jury is 
	unanimous<br />
	</em>is that in the first the speaker is considering the 
	jury as a number of individuals and in the second as a single entity.&nbsp; 
	In other words, it is the notion in the speaker / writer's head which 
	determines the grammar.<br />
	Compare, too, such things as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manchester United is 
	playing tonight<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manchester United are playing tonight</em></span></dd>
				<dt class="style_brown"><strong>Proximity concord</strong></dt>
				<dd class="style_brown"><span class="style_brown">ODLT defines this as </span> <em>
				<span class="style_black">When a verb agrees with the nearest 
				noun, rather than with the sentence's more distant subject</span>.<br />
				</em>So we get, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of my friends are here<br />
				</em>when 
				the strictly grammatical correct form would be (should be?)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of 
				my friends is here<br />
				</em>(<em>none</em> is singular normally).<br />
				In other words, the tendency in English is often to use a verb 
				form which agrees with the <span class="style_underline">nearest</span> 
				noun to the verb rather than agreeing with the verb's 
				grammatical subject.</dd>
</dl>
			<p>Look again at your list and you will probably see that around 
			half of the examples represent either notional concord (the idea in 
			the speaker's mind) or proximity concord (agreement with the nearest

						All of these are examples of <strong>proximity concord</strong>

						Strictly, the verb should be singular in all cases 
						because the verbs' subject are 
						<span class="style_red"><em>none</em></span> (i.e., 
						<span class="style_red"><em>not one</em></span>), 
						<span class="style_red"><em>neither</em></span> (i.e.

			<p>Or should that be 'rules'?<br />
			If we conceive of the term <em>proximity and notional concord</em> 
			as a single concept, then it should be treated as a singular subject 
			noun phrase.&nbsp; If we think of it as two subjects, then it's 
			plural.</p>
			<p>There are a few considerations of the times when strictly 
			grammatical concord is overruled by the effect of proximity and 
			notion.&nbsp; Here's the selection.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Group nouns<br />
				<img alt="huskies" height="133" src="../../images/animals_dogs_huskies200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>There is a technical difference between two sorts of group 
				nouns.<br />
				a <strong>
				collective</strong> noun (such as <em>army, family, audience, 
				congregation, jury </em>etc.) and nouns referring to a collection of people or objects 
				called <strong>assemblage</strong> nouns (such as <em>flock, 
				bunch, swarm</em> etc.) but it need not concern us in the 
				consideration of concord because the same considerations apply 
				to both.<br />
				For more on the difference, see the guide to nouns and that to 
				partitives, classifiers and group nouns, linked below.<br />
				Such nouns are 
				frequently combined with plural forms of the verb and pronouns, 
				especially in speech where the constraints of grammar are less 
				strongly felt.&nbsp; This is a form of notional concord.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The audience </em>
				<span class="style_underline"><em>were</em></span><em> delighted 
				by the performance and </em><span class="style_underline"><em>
				their</em></span><em> applause was prolonged<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The congregation </em><span class="style_underline"><em>were</em></span><em> 
				singing lustily and </em><span class="style_underline"><em>their</em></span><em> 
				pastor was pleased</em><br />
				However, when we conceive of the collective as a single entity, 
				then in both speech and writing, the choice will be singular.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The audience
				<span class="style_underline">was</span> small but
				<span class="style_underline">its</span> enthusiasm was obvious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The congregation <span class="style_underline">was</span> 
				told to get on <span class="style_underline">its</span> </em>(<em>their?) knees</em><br />
				are both possible and common, especially in writing.<br />
				Proximity concord also applies, especially to assemblage nouns 
				in which the nearest noun is generally in the plural and abuts 
				the verb so we can have both singular and plural verbs forms and 
				pronouns:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The band of musicians
				<span class="style_underline">have</span> arrived and
				<span class="style_underline">they</span> want to be paid<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The squad of players <span class="style_underline">was</span> 
				delayed and <span class="style_underline">they</span> apologised 
				for being late<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The herd of elephants <span class="style_underline">were</span> 
				threatening and <span class="style_underline">they</span> had to 
				be treated with care<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole herd of cows <span class="style_underline">was</span> 
				sold at auction and <span class="style_underline">it</span> got 
				a good price</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				We sometimes find a mix with a singular verb form followed by a 
				plural pronoun as in the second example above and, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The gang of criminals <span class="style_underline">was</span> 
				arrested and <span class="style_underline">they</span> all 
				admitted the theft</em><br />
				We do not, however, usually see the reverse ordering because 
				once a plural verb form is used the pronoun which follows agrees 
				with it so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The class of children
				<span class="style_underline">were</span> told to wait but
				<span class="style_underline">it</span> disobeyed</em><br />
				is not accepted.<br />
				The more formal the writing or speaking, the more likely it is that the 
				purely grammatical forms will be selected.<br />
				Conflict generally compels plural concord so while we have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The team has won again</em><br />
				which sees <em>the team</em> as a single, united entity, we will 
				also see:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The team are arguing among themselves 
				about the right tactics to use<br />
				</em>which sees the team as a divided group of individuals with 
				different views.</dd>
				<dt><strong>General collective terms<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="tea" height="133" src="../../images/classify_tea200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>In addition to restricted collective nouns such as <em>team, 
				family</em> and <em>jury</em>, there is (are?) also a range of 
				generalised terms frequently used with the <em>of-</em>construction including:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>array, 
				assortment, collection, group, majority, minority, number, raft, 
				range, series, set, string, variety</em></span><br />
				and so on which cause concord problems in English (especially 
				British English).<br />
				Although formal writing usually compels the use of a singular 
				verb form with such terms, there are times when the plural form 
				seems unavoidable when exemplification is inserted or when the 
				subject of the verb is recognisably plural, so we are happy 
				with, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A range of languages is identifiable 
				which ...</em><br />
				but when we insert more than one example, as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A range of languages, including Russian, 
				German, Dutch and Polish ...</em><br />
				the plural verb form (<em>do</em> not<em> does</em>) will 
				naturally follow and even without the examples, after<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A range of languages ...</em><br />
				most writers will happily insert a plural verb form to follow 
				because it is <em>languages</em> rather than <em>range</em> 
				which is (? <em>are</em>) the subject.<br />
				The words <em>minority</em> and <em>majority</em> are tricky 
				with respect to concord and writers will disagree concerning the 
				correct use even in formal texts.&nbsp; Both:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority supports the government</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority support the government</em><br />
				are seen and heard.<br />
				Pronoun use for these two nouns is also variable between <em>it</em> 
				and <em>they</em>.<br />
				The British National Corpus of 100 million words has frequent 
				examples such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However bad the situation, 
				the&nbsp;majority&nbsp;is&nbsp;unwilling to risk change.<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority is engaged in the service sector.<br />
				</em>but also has:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;majority&nbsp;are&nbsp;genuine cases of people struggling to make 
				ends meet<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;majority&nbsp;are&nbsp;unemployed<br />
				</em>When the term <em>majority</em> is used to refer to the 
				difference between the winning and losing result in a vote, it 
				is a normally a pluralisable common noun and follows simple concord 
				rules as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His majority is slim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their majorities were huge<br />
				Minority </em>is treated both as plural and singular with a 
				small advantage to the singular use.<br />
				In informal language proximity usually determines the concord so 
				we often hear (and read):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The range of possibilities are enormous<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An assortment of ideas have been put forward<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government is introducing a raft of new measures which 
				are aimed at the problem</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				One oddity here is that the term <em>list</em> which, on the 
				face of things appears to be similar to other collective terms 
				is invariably singular:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The list of groceries is in the kitchen</em><br />
				There is some evidence that determiner use has an effect with 
				the definite article governing singular use and the indefinite 
				article governing plural use so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A majority of the workforce support him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of the workforce supports him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of violent incidents is lower this year<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of violent incidents have occurred recently</em><br />
				but this is not close to being a reliable rule.<br />
				(In this respect, a major and widely respected British 
				newspaper, <em>The Times</em>, sets it style guide to the effect 
				that it:<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">... use[s] the singular verb with 
				corporate bodies (the company, the government, the council 
				etc.).&nbsp; But we prefer the plural use for couple, family, 
				music groups, and bands, the public and sports teams.&nbsp; 
				Thus, France (the country) is a top place for holidays but 
				France (the rugby team) are the Six Nations champions.</span><br />
				</em><span class="auto-style22">The Times, 26th March 2022</span>)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Pairs and <em>pluralia tantum<br />
				<img alt="trousers" height="133" src="../../images/trousers200.jpg" width="200" /></em></strong></dt>
				<dd>Pairs of items which take plural endings include:<br />
				Clothing items: <em>drawers, flannels, gloves, jeans, knickers, 
				pyjamas, pants, shorts, tights, trousers </em>etc.<br />
				Instruments: <em>bellows, binoculars, glasses, pincers, 
				scissors, secateurs, shears, spectacles, tongs, tweezers</em> 
				etc.<br />
				and these all take a plural verb form when used alone, as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your jeans are in the wash<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My spectacles are broken</em><br />
				However, when the are used with the expression <em>pair of</em>, 
				they strictly take a singular verb:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My new pair of jeans was expensive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pairs of spectacles has been found<br />
				</em>but proximity concord often overrides grammatical rules so 
				we also hear and see:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My new pair of jeans were expensive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pairs of spectacles have been found<br />
				</em>They also usually revert to the singular form when used in 
				compounds so we have, e.g.: <em>spectacle case, trouser pocket</em> 
				etc.<br /><em>Pluralia tantum</em> (the singular of which is <em>
				plurale tantum</em>) are nouns which only appear in the 
				plural or are used in the plural with a particular sense and 
				include, for example: <em>alms, amends, auspices, brains, contents, funds, 
				leftovers, means, remains, riches, surroundings, thanks</em> and 
				<em>wits</em>.<br />
				They are all used with plural verbs although the sense is often 
				of a mass noun which should, following the conventions in 
				English, be singular.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The money wasn't available<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The funds weren't available<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The financial means weren't available</em><br />
				which are more or less synonymous but grammatically different.<br />
				A longer list of such nouns is available in the guide to nouns, linked below.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Parenthetical subjects</strong><br />
				<img alt="adjacent" height="133" src="../../images/buildings_adjacent200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>When a subject is extended in some way parenthetically 
				either by using commas or brackets, it is ignored for 
				considerations of concord so, for example, we can allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man and the students </em><strong>
				<em>are</em></strong><em> in the class<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man, but not his students, is in the class.</em><br />
				when the parenthetical item is clearly meant to include the 
				subject, however, either form is heard so we encounter:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teacher (and her students) is in the 
				class<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teacher (and her students) are in the class</em><br />
				Formally, the singular is preferred if the addition is 
				parenthetical rather than extending the subject.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Coordinated subjects<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="link" height="133" src="../../images/link_chain200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Subjects consisting of two elements or more cause problems, 
				too.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your help and advice </em>
				<span class="style_underline"><em>was</em></span><em> 
				invaluable.&nbsp; Without </em><span class="style_underline">
				<em>it</em></span><em>, the job would have been impossible.</em><br />
				is common when the speaker's perception is that <em>help and 
				advice</em> form a single abstract entity.<br />
				The situation is less clear when the subjects are less closely 
				related.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your advice and the money you lent us
				<span class="style_underline">were</span> both important to us.&nbsp; 
				Without <span class="style_underline">them</span>, we'd have 
				been stuck.</em><br />
				and here the plural forms are preferred because the acts of 
				lending money and giving advice are less closely related in the 
				speaker's mind.<br />
				When the coordinated subjects are clearly independent entities, 
				the plural forms are preferred so we have, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your car and mine
				<span class="style_underline">are</span> similar.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_underline">They</span> both use too much 
				fuel.</em><br />
				When two or more subjects are in apposition, i.e., referring to 
				the same entity, only the singular form is possible so we have, 
				for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sense and Sensibility, that fine book and 
				great example of clarity in writing,
				<span class="style_underline">is</span> one of the triumphs of 
				British writing.&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">It</span> 
				should be on everyone's bookshelf.</em><br />
				where the singular is preferred because the title and the two 
				descriptions are co-referential.<br />
				When the determiner <em>both</em> is used, the plural form is
				<strong>always</strong> preferred as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Both your advice and your help
				<span class="style_underline">were</span> invaluable.<br />
				</em>because <em>both</em> always refer to a dual entity in 
				English.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Syllepsis<br />
				<img alt="3" height="133" src="../../images/three_females200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>This is related to the last point and refers to a situation 
				where there is a relationship between one word and a number of 
				others but agreement cannot be complete.&nbsp; In that way, it 
				is akin to zeugma (considered 
				in the guide to polysemy, linked below).<br />
				For example, 
				concord is simple with:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John knows and the children know</em><br />
				where we have two verbs agreeing with their respective subjects, 
				but in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure if Mary or the children 
				know / knows</em><br />
				it is unclear what the verb form should be.&nbsp; Usually, 
				speakers will opt for the nearest noun subject on the basis of 
				proximity but that is not a rule.<br />
				Similar problems arise with determiner concord so in a sentence 
				such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father and her mother each have / has 
				his / her / their own house</em><br />
				where the verb form and the pronoun are uncertain.<br />
				In formal language, such sentences are best  rephrased to avoid 
				too much clumsiness.<br />
				The verb <em>be</em> causes many syllepsis issues because it is so 
				irregular.&nbsp; While the syllepsis does not arise in, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I and the neighbours agree about the need 
				for the work</em><br />
				there is no problem because English does not mark the verb <em>
				agree</em> to 
				distinguish between first person singular and third person 
				plural subjects.&nbsp; However, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I and the neighbours am / are paying for

				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The neighbours and I am / are paying for

				there is a problem of syllepsis because the verb <em>be </em>is

				will opt for a plural form.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Quasi-coordinator prepositions<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="link" height="133" src="../../images/link200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>These include <em>as well as, along with, 
				together with, more 
				than</em> and <em>as much as</em> and the tendency is to make 
				the additive ones (as opposed to the exclusive ones such as <em>
				rather than, but not</em>) singular when they coordinate two subject elements or more 
				so we have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John, as well as his whole family,
				<span class="style_underline">is</span> renting a cottage this 
				summer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary, along with her sister, <span class="style_underline">is</span> 
				hosting the party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John, more than Peter, <span class="style_underline">is</span> 
				capable of fixing that PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harry, as much as I, <span class="style_underline">enjoys</span> 
				classical music</em><br />
				However, especially in written English, a plural form is often 
				used if the subjects both refer to the main verb so the first 
				and third examples above might be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John, as well as his whole family, are 
				renting a cottage this summer</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary, along with her sister, are hosting the party</em><br />
				When the two noun phrases do not equally 
				apply to the verb, the verb will remain singular in , e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As much as I enjoy rap music, Joan 
				appreciates jazz.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Relative pronouns</strong><br />
				<img alt="family" height="133" src="../../images/family200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Relative pronouns have antecedent nouns and it is to the 
				antecedent noun that concord attaches so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children who were asked to come early 
				are here</em><br />
				is acceptable because the antecedent of <em>who </em>is the 
				plural noun <em>children.<br />
				</em>However, in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>One of the parents who were asked has not arrived yet</em><br />
				a plural verb would be unacceptable although the antecedent is 
				still plural because it agrees with the subject and that is<em> 
				one</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Nominal adjectives</strong><br />
					<em>
					<img alt="old young" height="133" src="../../images/old_young200.jpg" width="200" /></em></dt>
				<dd><span class="style_black"><em>The old and the young.</em></span><br />
				Nominal adjectives appear to be singular but are always treated 
				as plural in English so we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rich are more fortunate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poor are always with us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unmarried have a good deal to think about</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>Either ... or<br />
				</strong></em>
				<img alt="2" height="133" src="../../images/birds_two_gulls200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This correlative coordinator presents problems.&nbsp; 
				It's simple when the elements are both singular, so we have, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either John or Mary is coming</em><br />
				and when the elements are both plural, the obvious choice is 
				plural verb forms:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either John and his sister or Mary and 
				her brother are coming</em><br />
				but a problem arises when one element is plural and the other 
				singular so both:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either your reasoning or your references
				</em><span class="style_underline"><em>are</em></span><em> 
				faulty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either your references or your reasoning </em>
				<span class="style_underline"><em>is</em></span><em> faulty</em><br />
				are possible
				and here, the tendency in English is for the verb to conform to 
				the number of the <strong>closest</strong> subject.&nbsp; In 
				other words, proximity rather than notion rules and whichever 
				noun phrase is nearest to the verb will determine its form.<br />
				Even with two singular coordinated elements, native speakers 
				will often ignore the grammatical rule and produce, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either she or you
				<span class="style_underline">need</span> to be 
				there.<br />
				</em>The same issue occurs with <em>or</em> standing alone.&nbsp; 
				We get, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tree or a shrub is needed here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trees or shrubs were planted here</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>Neither ... nor<br />
				</strong></em>
				<img alt="2" height="133" src="../../images/two_jigsaw_bench200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This is another correlative coordinator but in this case, native 
				speakers will often opt for the plural as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither Mary nor Peter are taking a 
				holiday</em><br />
				where<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither Peter nor Mary is taking a holiday</em><br />
				is the form preferred by grammarians and more likely in writing 
				but sounds rather formal.<br />
				When both choices are plural, the plural verb form is required 
				so we get, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Neither my glasses nor my mothers were strong enough<br />
				</em>When either entity is plural, the plural verb form is 
				conventional but there is some doubt.&nbsp; We may hear both:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither my cases not John's case are / is 
				here.</em><br />
				See above under syllepsis.<br />
				When <em>nor</em> is used alone, the same issue occurs:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You nor she is to blame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We nor they are to blame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?I nor they am / are to blame</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>Each</em> and <em>every </em>and other 
				indefinite pronouns and determiners<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="5" height="133" src="../../images/five_bottles200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>These determiner / pronouns present a few difficulties 
				because there is often a tendency to treat all occurrences as 
				plural.&nbsp; The rule, such as it is, is quite simple:<br />
				With a singular subject, stated or implied, the concord is a 
				singular verb form so, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each person in the office gets the same 
				holiday entitlement<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new students will arrive one by one and each gets a 
				welcome pack</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every child needs love</em><br />
				When the subject is plural, the concord works equally well:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John and Mary each have a new car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peppers are €0.20 each</em><br />
				However, when <em>each of </em>is used, the concord is singular 
				as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the peppers costs €0.20</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Each of the peppers cost €0.20<br />
				</em>This rule is often flouted because of proximity so, 
				informally one may encounter:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the houses were painted a different colour</em><br />
				but formal language requires singular treatment.<br />
				There is no possibility of using the <em>of-</em>formulation 
				with the determiner <em>every</em> so the issue never arises.<br />
				The pronouns <em>all, another, anybody, anyone, anything, 
				everybody, everyone, everything, nobody, nothing</em> and <em>
				one</em> are strictly speaking singular and take a singular verb 
				form although notion and proximity may affect things sometimes with <em>all</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the cake was eaten<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the apples were eaten<br />
				</em>The pronouns
				<em>everyone, everybody </em>and<em> everything</em> are 
				stubbornly singular in English.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>More than<br />
				<img alt="4" height="133" src="../../images/four_children_meditate200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></em></dt>
				<dd>This compound determiner follows the proximity rule, 
				regardless of the logic, so we have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than five people </em> <span class="style_underline">
				<em>have</em></span><em> 
				arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than one child </em> <span class="style_underline"><em>is</em></span><em> 
				playing truant<br />
				</em>While the first example is perfectly logical and 
				grammatical because the subject of the verb is at least six 
				people, the second example is quite illogical &ndash;
				<em>more than one </em><strong>must</strong> be plural and would 
				be treated that way in most languages which inflect the verb for 
				number.&nbsp; English will not even allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *More than one child are meditating<br />
				</em>however logical that is.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>None<br />
				</em></strong>
				<img alt="none" height="133" src="../../images/empty200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>The determiner and pronoun refers to both mass and count noun phrases and behaves 
				slightly quirkily in terms of concord.&nbsp; So we get, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The money was promised but none
				<span class="style_underline">has</span> materialised</em><br />
				where <em>none</em> stands for a mass noun so will always be 
				singular grammatically and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ordered the part but none
				<span class="style_underline">has</span> arrived</em><br />
				where <em>none</em> refers to a singular count noun so the 
				singular form is preferred but we will not usually wince at<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ordered the parts but none
				<span class="style_underline">have</span> arrived</em><br />
				where <em>none</em> refers to a plural count noun so invites the 
				plural form although grammarians will insist that it is singular.&nbsp; 
				It should, therefore, strictly, be:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
				<em>I ordered the parts but none
				<span class="style_underline">has</span> arrived</em><br />
				Proximity, however, often allows the plural verb form here.</dd>
				<dt><strong><a name="measure"></a>Quantifiers and measures (a 
				messy area)<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="measure" height="133" src="../../images/measure_pressure200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Quantifying determiners such as <em>most of, the majority 
				of, half of, 80% of </em>etc. follow a simple set of concord rules.<br />
				<ol class="auto-style21">
					<li>When the noun which is being quantified or limited is plural, 
				the verb takes a plural form, so we see, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80% of people are not aware of the problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half of the children were off sick<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of the workers were dissatisfied</em><br />
				etc.</li>
					<li>When the noun being quantified is singular, even if it clearly 
				applies to a plural group, the verb form is grammatically 
				singular so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80% of the population is not aware of the 
				problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half the class was off sick<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of the staff was dissatisfied</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Notional proximity often overrides grammatical purity in these 
				cases and many will opt for a plural verb in all cases where 
				there is plural number in mind.</li>
					<li>Words for specific numbers are always treated as plural although 
				they appear singular:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A score of people were there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dozen eggs were broken</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half a dozen neighbours were invited</em></li>
					<li>Quantifiers and measures for money and time are usually singular in terms of 
				concord, even though the subject is clearly plural.&nbsp; We 
				see, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $500 is a lot to pay for that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three years is too long to wait</em><br />
				etc.<br />
					However, if we are dealing with notions of the units rather 
					than the total amounts, plurality is common, but not 
					obligatory in many cases.&nbsp; we may encounter:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are only two dollars on the 
					table</em><br />
					because the speaker is considering the units, not the 
					amount.<br />
					The same considerations apply to time and distance so we 
					would normally expect singular concord as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty minutes was spent on this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two miles is too far for her to walk</em><br />
					but, again, if the units are being considered, the plural is 
					encountered as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the remaining 30 minutes , ten are 
					dedicated to a discussion of this.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two miles are marked by the side of the road.</em></li>
					<li>Science and mathematical calculations<ol class="auto-style23">
						<li>The outcomes of calculations are always singular even when 
				obviously plural:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 X 8 is 48</em></li>
						<li>Fractions<br />
						Quantities below 1<br />
						When a number is cited as being below one, then the 
						assumption is that it should be plural because we are 
						referring to the unit, not the total and the unit is 
						pluralised but not the verb.&nbsp; So, we get:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.76 inches is not enough<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.36 litres of the solution is added later</em></li>
						<li>Other fractions<br />
						For these we follow the rule that if the noun itself is 
						plural, we use plural concord and <em>vice versa</em> so 
						we get:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half the sugar is wet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three-quarters of the people don't enjoy that</em></li>
						<li>Science<em><br />
						</em>The convention in scientific writing is to use 
						singular concord for all measures, whether units are 
						mentioned or not so we see:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six millilitres was added to the solution<br />
						</em>not<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Six millilitres were added to the solution<br />
						</em>The differences above concerning percentages still 
						applies.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>An oddity is the quantifier <em>one</em> which is clearly 
				singular but notion and proximity may override the use so we 
				see:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One in ten of the class is late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One in five are late</em><br />
				etc.</li>
					<li>We saw above that <em>every</em> is generally considered 
					a singular concept in English but with quantities, the 
					situation is not always very clear so we may encounter both:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every 5 gallons qualifies you for a 
					free bonus reward</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every 5 gallons qualify you for a 
					free bonus reward.</em></li>

				<dt><strong><em>There is</em> and <em>There are<br />
				</em></strong>
				<img alt="unicorn" height="133" src="../../images/animals_unicorn200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>The existential <em>there </em>causes some concord issues in 
				especially (but not solely) informal language.<br />
				The grammatical rule is clear that <em>there is</em> precedes a 
				singular or mass noun phrase and <em>there are </em>precedes a 
				plural one.&nbsp; We should have, therefore, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a unicorn in the garden</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are unicorns in the garden</em><br />
				However, in informal, especially spoken, language, the concord 
				rule is often ignored so we may encounter:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's lots of people here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's the children to consider<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's good reasons for his behaviour</em><br />
				Generally, in written English, concord rules will win over 
				casual use but <em>there is</em> is certainly commonly used for 
				plural entities.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Pronoun concord and sexist language<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="gender" height="133" src="../../images/sign_gender200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>An anguished area of English usage is the avoidance of <em>he</em> 
				as an unmarked pronoun in a sentence such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone thinks he knows better</em><br />
				where <em>he</em> acts as an unmarked form and includes both 
				sexes.<br />
				The presumption is that we should prefer a form such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone thinks he or she knows better</em><br />
				which is clumsy,
				or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone thinks they know better</em><br />
				which breaks the concord rule by having a plural pronoun to stand for the singular <em>everyone</em>.<br />
				The same issue arises with the indefinite pronouns combining <em>
				some, any, no</em> with <em>-body</em> or <em>-one</em>.&nbsp; 
				We get, then, sentences such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Does anyone not know their student number?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody brought their laptops<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somebody has lost their wallet<br />
				</em>The pronoun <em>whoever</em> joins in the fun here so we find 
				sentences such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever refuses to pay will have the 
				money taken from their account<br />
				</em>All these examples fly in the face of logical concord but 
				are frequent in spoken, informal English.<br />
				There are times when the use of <em>they, their, them</em> etc. to refer 
				to a singular entity is almost unavoidable.&nbsp; For example, 
				it is difficult to see how:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person who told you that has got
				<strong>their</strong> facts wrong<br />
				</em>can be successfully rephrased to conform to the rules of 
				concord.<br />
				In formal and/or written English, there is no obvious way out 
				of the difficulty so most writers prefer to  rephrase  entirely 
				to avoid either causing offence to female readers or causing 
				offence to grammatically sensitive readers (or both).<br />
				For a little more, including non-binary uses of <em>they, them, 
				their </em>etc. to refer to single individuals, see the guide to personal pronouns, 
				and the guide to gender linked 
				below.<br />
				The use of <em>they, their </em>and <em>them</em> to refer to a 
				singular entity whose sex is not known or irrelevant is attested 
				in English from at least the 14th century.&nbsp; Only when 
				Latin-influenced grammarians rose to prominence did the 
				insistence on the non-marked use of <em>he</em> arise.&nbsp; The 
				use of the plural pronouns is making something of a comeback 
				because of social pressures.</dd>

					<p>American (and to some extent Canadian and Australian

					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The administration is</em> (not <em>are</em>)<br />

					Other varieties of English, New Zealand, Australian etc.,

					concord for singular entities.<br />
					However, notional concord can sometimes occur in

						<dt>number</dt>

			<p>Learners crave rules and concord is, unfortunately, an area where

			considerations.&nbsp; When in doubt:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The grammatically 'correct' formulation will usually be 
				acceptable, even if it may sound unnatural to a native speaker's 
				ear.&nbsp; So, prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither John nor Mary is coming</em><br />
				over<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither John nor Mary are coming</em><br />
				and prefer<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either you or I is the person to do it</em><br />

&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Either you or I are the people to do it</em></li>
				<li>In writing, following strict grammatical concord rules is 
				usually preferred.&nbsp; So, prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your help and advice were invaluable</em><br />
				over<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your help and advice was invaluable</em><br />
				Additionally, avoid awkward and ungrammatical uses of pronouns and verbs 
				in an effort to use non-sexist language and rely instead on 
				 rephrasing, so prefer:<br />

				over<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his or her first day every student

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group are playing tonight</em><br />

			<p>Concord is messy, especially in British English where 
			considerations other than grammatical form often override logical 
			verb and pronoun use.&nbsp; It is, however, important to remember 
			that concord in English applies almost solely to verb forms (and not 
			in all tense forms) and to pronoun use.</p>
			<p>The simplicity of the ways that verbs conjugate and nouns 
					decline in English may well confuse some learners because 
					they expect agreement and may, therefore, produce errors 
					such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He cans<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He lefts<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*The greens pullovers</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					Word order, too, may cause problems because English does not 
					alter its articles to show case.&nbsp; Word order is often 
					the only way to determine which is the subject and which the 
					object.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The delay caused a problem<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A problem caused the delay<br />
			</em>are only distinguished in meaning by the ordering of subject 
			and object.<br />
			Other languages, which do denote case with 
					changes in the determiners or the nouns themselves, have, 
					accordingly, freer word orders because the forms signal 
					case.&nbsp; For example, in German:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog bit the man<br />
			</em>is<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Der Hund biss den Mann</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man bit the dog<br />
			</em>is<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Der Mann biss den Hund</em><br />
					Note the single letter change to the determiner: <em>der</em> 
					to <em>den</em>, subject to object.<br />
					But if the noun phrases are reversed, the meaning is still 
					clear:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Den man biss der Hund<br />
			</em>still means<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog bit 
					the man<br />
					</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Den Hund biss der Mann<br />
			</em>still means<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man bit the 
					dog</em>.<br />
					although the object has been fronted for effect.<br />
					In English, reversing the noun phrases reverses the meaning:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man bit the dog<br />
			</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog bit the man</em>.<br />
			Other languages (such as Czech) may make changes to the verb form or 
			endings on the nouns (as in Russian) to distinguish between subjects 
			and objects.</p>
