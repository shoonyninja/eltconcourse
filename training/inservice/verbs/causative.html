		<p>English has a number of ways to express the fact that the subject of 
		a verb causes a change to the object.&nbsp; Here are some examples and they are all ways of 
		saying something caused something to happen in English.</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="3"><em>The key opened the box</em></li>
			<li><em>They have widened the street</em></li>
			<li><em>Her antagonism irritated him</em></li>
			<li><em>The sun warmed the air</em></li>
			<li><em>The police marched the suspect in and stood him against the 
			wall for a photograph</em></li>
			<li><em>She's walking the dog</em></li>
			<li><em>We liquefied the gas</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Some of the causative verbs in these examples can be used 
		both transitively (taking an object) and intransitively (with no 
		object).&nbsp; We can have<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The box opened </em>(3)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The air 
		warmed </em>(6)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suspect marched in and stood against the wall
		</em>(7)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog is walking </em>(8)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gas liquefied</em> (9)<em>.<br />
		</em>When they are intransitive, they cannot, by definition, be 
		causative because causation directly implies an object.<br />In other cases, we can't do this and have to use an alternative 
		verb or rephrase the idea:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The street got wider<br />
		</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The street was widened </em>(4)<br />and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He became irritated<br />
		</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was irritated by her 
		antagonism</em> (5).<br />
		When we use the passive (the second realisations), the sense of 
		causation is maintained because causative verbs like these may be used 
		in both active and passive voice clauses.</p>

				</td>

		</table>
		<p>Other languages handle transitivity in very different ways.&nbsp; 
		This matters because, by their nature, causative verbs are transitive.</p>
		<p>In some, verbs may take what is called the ergative case, in which 
		the ostensible grammatical subject is semantically the object of the 
		verb, when used 
		intransitively and the verb and the noun (and adjective and article, often) will be 
		marked to show the case so those languages can produce<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He irritated </em>(to mean <em>became irritated</em>)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog walked</em> (to mean
		<em>was walked</em>)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door opened<br />
		</em>and so on.&nbsp; The last of these is an ergative clause in English 
		but the language does not signal case on any nouns or verbs so it is identical to an 
		active sentence.&nbsp; We have the same phenomenon operating with, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water boiled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book sold well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The potatoes overcooked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trousers tore</em><br />
		which are superficially illogical because we do not normally allow 
		inanimate subjects to do these things.</p>
		<p>In other languages, such as Malay, a verb can be the same in both transitive and 
		intransitive uses but will take a suffix or other change to show whether 
		it is being used transitively or intransitively.<br />
		English does not vary the verb form but shows transitivity by word 
		order, structure or rephrasing with a different verb.&nbsp; For example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I washed the car </em>vs. <em>The car was washed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone 
		broke the window</em> vs. <em>The window got broken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His hand rose </em>  
		vs.<em> He raised his hand<br />
		</em>etc.<br />
		Occasionally, as we saw, English can 
		make a kind of ergative with something like<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glass broke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The picture faded</em><br />
		etc.</p>
		<p>English can, like many languages, also make a transitive verb 
		appear intransitive by using a reflexive pronoun as a dummy object as in, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem solved 
		itself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house shook itself to pieces<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car drives itself<br />
		</em>etc.<br />
		Lots of languages do that much more extensively than English.</p>

		<p>This all matters because the idea of transitivity is fundamental to 
		understanding the verb structures of any language and that includes the 
		ability to signal causative events.&nbsp; Without knowing 
		about it, it is hardly possible to use verbs accurately at all.&nbsp; 
		Speakers of many languages which can use the same word in both 
		transitive and intransitive ways will, therefore, make errors such as:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="10"><em>*He angered </em>(for <em>became angry</em>)</li>
			<li><em>*He fell the glass </em>(for <em>dropped the glass</em>)</li>
			<li><em>*The bad weather died the flowers</em></li>
			<li><em>*He rose his hand</em></li>
			<li><em>*I reminded </em>(to mean <em>I remembered</em>)</li>
			<li><em>*I interested</em> (to mean <em>I became interested</em>)</li>
			<li><em>*We'll meet us<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
		</ol>
			<p>There is a good deal more below under the section on teaching 
			this area which considers how a causative sense is realised in other 
			languages but first, we need to see how it is done in English.</p>

		<p>There is an important distinction between:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em>the causative </em><strong><em>verbs</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>such as the ones in the examples above, which express the fact 
			that the subject has caused a change in the object as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They let her go home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She made me do it again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had her repeat the presentation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They forced her to resign</em><br />
			etc.&nbsp;and</dd>
			<dt><em>the causative </em><strong><em>structures</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the car washed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			They had their house broken into<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got her arm broken<br />
			</em>and so on, which express the 
			fact that the subject caused another to do something 
			<span class="style_underline">or</span> something 
			was done to the subject which was unwelcome or unfortunate.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>The distinction in terms of meaning is this:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em>the causative </em><strong><em>verbs</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>focus on <span class="style_underline"><strong>who</strong></span> 
			is affected by the actions of the subject of the verb.<br />
			This means a passive version of the clause is usually available so 
			we can have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was made to re-do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man was allowed out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was asked to repeat the question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was forced to resign<br />
			</em>etc.</dd>
			<dt><em>the causative </em><strong><em>structures</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>focus on <span class="style_underline"><strong>what</strong></span> 
			is affected by the verb in the participle form and they are, 
			therefore already passive structures of a kind so no additional 
			passive clause is usually available.</dd>
		</dl>
			<p>An alternative way to analyse the structures and verbs is to call the 
		causative verbs active causatives and the causative structures passive 
		causatives.&nbsp; That way, a handy dichotomy can be set up like this:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style57"><strong>Active causative</strong></td>
				<td class="auto-style58"><strong>Passive causative</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style51" style="border-left-color: #000080; border-left-width: 1px"><em>He had me do it again</em></td>

				<td class="auto-style56" style="border-left-color: #000080; border-left-width: 1px"><em>I got John to paint the house</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style53"><em>I got the house painted by John</em></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>This makes some kind of sense but only works with those verbs which 
		appear regularly in causative structures (<em>have</em> and <em>get</em>, 
		see below).&nbsp; This kind of neat distinction does not work with other 
		causative verbs because there is no 
		passive causative for, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She obliged me to do the work</em><br />
		because we can only make a simple passive as in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was obliged to do the work (by her)</em><br />
		and we can't have a causative passive such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She obliged the work done by me</em></p>

		<h3>Three common causative verbs: <em>let, make, have</em></h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Three of the most 
		common causative verbs, <em>let, have </em>and<em> make</em>, present problems 
		so, while<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They let me open the present</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She made me do the washing up</em><br />
		and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had me clean up my room</em><br />
		are fine,<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was let open the present</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was made do the washing up</em><br />
		and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was had clean up my room</em><br />
		are not acceptable.<br />
		The verb <em>let</em> <strong>can</strong> be used in the passive when 
		there is no following verb but an adverb or adverb phrase instead so we 
		allow, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The dogs were let out</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was let in</em><br />
		but not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The dogs were let play</em><br />
		The verb <em>make</em> does allow a passive so we can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She made me clean up my room</em><br />
		and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was made <span class="style_underline"><strong>
		to</strong></span> clean up my room</em><br />
		with the added complication that the passive demands the <em>to-</em>infinitive 
		and the active the bare infinitive.<br />
		The verb <em>have</em> does not allow a passive-voice formulation at all 
		so:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*I was had clean up my room<br />
		</em>is, as we saw above, not acceptable.</p>
		<p>This guide distinguishes between causative
		<strong>verbs</strong>, which may or may not be used actively or passively in the 
		normal way, and causative <strong>structures</strong> which are 
		considered a sub-set of the passive in English.<br />
		There is, however, some crossover because both <em>get</em> and <em>have</em> 
		are causative verbs in their own right as in, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had him do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got him to do it</em><br />
		which are parallel to:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made him do it</em><br />
		and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I forced him to do it</em><br />
		but they also appear in causative structures and take on different 
		characteristics in terms of how the elements are ordered in the clause 
		and the verb forms which follow the verbs themselves.</p>

		<p>The three causative verbs in particular with which learners have a certain amount 
		of trouble have been analysed above.&nbsp; Here are some more examples of them 
		in action:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="17"><em>I <span class="style_black">had</span> him explain it to me</em></li>
			<li><em>I <span class="style_black">made</span> him explain it to me</em></li>
			<li><em>I <span class="style_black">let</span> him explain it to me</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Why should learners have trouble with these?&nbsp; 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'list1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click 
		here when you have an answer</a>.</p>
		<ul class="redbullet" id="list1" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
			<li><strong>Form</strong><br />
			<img alt="form" height="133" src="../../images/form_forge200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			These three verbs take the bare infinitive 
			only.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			<span class="style_black">asked</span> him <span class="style_black">to</span> come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			<span class="style_black">forced</span> him 
			<span class="style_black">to</span> tell me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			<span class="style_black">arranged for</span> them 
			<span class="style_black">to</span> come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			<span class="style_black">intended</span> him 
			<span class="style_black">to</span> hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			<span class="style_black">allowed</span> him 
			<span class="style_black">to</span> speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_black">got</span> them
			<span class="style_black">to</span> come on time<br />
			</em>etc. which are all causative 
			verbs and, like most of them, require the infinitive with <em>to</em>.<br />
			As we saw above, however, the verb <em>make</em> demands the <em>to-</em>infinitive 
			in the passive but the bare infinitive in the active form:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They made me go</em><br />
			vs.<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was made <span class="style_underline">
			<strong>to</strong></span> go</em><br />
			That is not intuitive and, to make matters worse, the antonym (in 
			some senses),<em> let</em>, does not conform to the rule and takes 
			the bare infinitive in both voices:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She let him go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was let go</em><br />
			As we saw above, the verb <em>let</em> is very rarely used in the 
			passive voice with a verb complement although its use with an 
			adverbial complement in the passive is quite common as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were let in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was let down the mountain on a rope</em><br />
			etc..<br />The verb <em>have</em>, as we saw, does not appear in the passive at 
			all.<br />
			For more, see the guide to catenative verbs and the guide to the 
			passive voice linked in the list of related guides at the end.</li>
			<li><strong>Meaning</strong><br />
			<img alt="meaning" height="133" src="../../images/meaning_woman200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			An issue with meaning concerns the authority of the subject of the 
			causative verb vis-&agrave;-vis the indirect object.<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>have</em> sounds rather formal and implies that the 
				speaker is in a position of authority of some kind.&nbsp; It is 
				common in work and formal study situations.&nbsp; For example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I had her resubmit the essay<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The boss had them 
				re-write the report</em>.<br />
				It is rare to use this verb when the 
				first person is the object:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				?He had me resubmit the essay.<br />
				</em>There is, however, a rather informal use in things such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He had me running around after him all day</em>.</li>
				<li><em>make</em> is polysemous to some extent and implies two 
				different forms of causation:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>it implies the application of psychological, 
				moral or physical force, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				We have ways of making you 
				talk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police officer made him take a test</em></li>
					<li>it refers to cause without compulsion as in, for 
					example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The film made me cry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story made the audience laugh</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><em>let</em> implies no compulsion but still carries the 
				sense that the subject is in some sort of position of authority &ndash; 
				it has the sense of <em>allow to</em> and that, too, implies 
				authority.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teacher let the children go early</em></li>
				<li>There are variations in the strength of obligation (or its 
				lack) which depend on the role relationships between people and 
				their intentions.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have, oblige, make, force</em> etc.<br />
				all betoken strong 
				obligation and imply an unequal power relationship.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persuade, encourage, convince<br />
				</em>betoken hortation rather 
				than obligation and imply no <em>a priori</em> power difference.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let, allow, permit </em>etc.<br />
				betoken the removal of any 
				obligation but also imply an unequal power relationship<br />
				So, for example, we may have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss made her take a pay cut<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She convinced the boss to give her a pay rise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss let her go earlier</em></li>
				<li>Speakers of languages, such as the Chinese languages, which 
				make distinctions concerning the willingness of the affected 
				person to do something, may have difficulty selecting the 
				correct verb to use because their language does not distinguish 
				formally between the concepts of <em>let</em> and <em>make</em>.<br />
				In German, too, the causative verb of choice, <em>lassen</em>, 
				translates as <em>let</em> but it may also carry a sense of 
				obligation rather than permission so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the garage repair the car</em><br />
				which in English implies some form of authority would in German 
				usually be rendered as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ich ließ das Auto von der Garage reparieren</em><br />
				(literally: <em>I let the car from the garage repair</em>).<br />
				German does have a verb, <em>zwingen</em>, which translates as
				<em>force</em> that is usable in causative statements when a 
				sense of strong obligation is required.</li>

		</table>
			<p>There are also issues to do with what direct object of a 
			causative verb is permitted.</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Some verbs allow both animate and inanimate object so, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I forced the wood to bend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I forced her to re-write it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made the car start<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made her ask the question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I let the car roll<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I let her do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got her to do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the lawnmower to start<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I allowed the engine to stall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I allowed her to leave</em><br />
				are all acceptable.</li>
				<li><em>have</em> is more restricted and allows animate but not 
				inanimate objects so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had her do the work</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the dog fetch the stick</em><br />
				are acceptable but:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I had the car start</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I had the bottle break</em><br />
				are not.</li>
				<li>Other verbs live on the borderline and, while they are 
				normally used with animate direct objects, can be used somewhat 
				fancifully with inanimate objects so we might allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I persuaded the car to start<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I obliged the photocopier to work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I convinced the machine to stop</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				Nearly always, such uses imply that the speaker / writer is 
				investing inanimate objects with animate qualities (the 
				so-called pathetic fallacy).&nbsp; The verb <em>have</em> as a 
				causative verb can never be used this way.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A set of verbs in English which show that something has been 
			placed in a new or different category or that it has been changed in 
			some way are called factitive verbs and they take object 
			complements.&nbsp; In that sense, these factitive verbs are 
			causative.<br />
			The verbs listed elsewhere on this site that fall into this category 
			are: <em>announce, appoint, assess, believe, call, 
				choose, consider, declare, deem, designate, dye, elect, find, judge, 
				label, make, name, nominate, opt for, paint, proclaim,

			</p>
			<p>We noted in this section that factitive verbs are causal <em>in 
			that sense</em> because there is, in fact a distinct difference 
			between the verbs.<br />
			Causative verbs, properly defined, require a secondary action so we 
			get, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had her re-write the letters</em><br />
			in which there are two actions: <em>had</em> and <em>re-write</em>.<br />
			Factitive verbs require no secondary actions and are sufficient in 
			themselves so there is a distinct difference between, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They made her the manager </em>(factitive use)<br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They made her stay late at the office</em> (causative 
			use).</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>enlighten</em> (with no free morpheme <em>enlight</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>embolden</em> (with no free morpheme <em>embold</em>)<br />
			Usually, these verbs are derived directly from Latin bases or from 
			Old French or Old English, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>truncate</em> from <em>truncatus</em> (Latin)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>desiccate</em> from <em>desiccare</em> (Latin)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>modify</em> from <em>modifier</em> (Old French)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>clarify</em> from <em>clarificare</em> (Latin)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>enlighten</em> from <em>inlihtan</em> (Old English)<br />
			Many BrE users prefer the -<em>ize</em> endings on these verbs 
			because etymologically that makes sense.<br />
			For more on morphology, consult the guide, linked below.</p>
			<p>These verbs are frequently encountered in non-agentive passive 
			expressions in which the formation of an active-voice equivalent is 
			problematic when it is possible at all.&nbsp; For example, from:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The area has been gentrified<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The population has been terrorised<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results have been substantiated</em><br />
			and so on, it is difficult to form active clauses because the agent, 
			if there is one, is obscure.&nbsp; Such structures are, 
			incidentally, often referred to as agentless passives.&nbsp; For 
			more on that, see the guide to the passive voice, linked below.</p>

			<p>To identify a lexical verb which is causative, or can be in some 
			meanings, there's a simple test of acceptability which depends on 
			the meaning of a clause.&nbsp; For example, it is possible to 
			accept:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary threw the book but it remained unharmed<br />
			</em>but not:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Mary burnt the book but it remained unharmed<br />
			</em>and the reason is simple: when a verb is causative, or used 
			causatively, it must change the object in some way.<br />
			The test can be summarised as:<br />
			if:<br />
			<em class="styleblackbold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject + Verb + 
			Object + but the object remained unchanged</em><br />
			is unacceptable, then we have an instance of causative verb use but 
			if the sentence so formed acceptable, we do not.</p>
			<p>There are a limited number of causative verbs in any language.&nbsp; 
			English contains at least the following:</p>

			<p>There are three provisos:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Not all of these verbs are always causative because we can 
				allow, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pushed the boat but it didn't move</em><br />
				implies no change in the object so no causative sense.<br />
				Most are, however, causative in that the object is altered in 
				some way by the action signalled in the verb.</li>
				<li>If the verb is introduced with something like <em>tried to 
				... but </em>or <em>attempted to ... but</em> then the sense may 
				still be of a causative verb but the causation has failed for 
				some reason.</li>
				<li>It is possible, and often attempted, to divide the list into 
				those which only affect people and other sentient beings and 
				those which can affect inanimate objects as well.&nbsp; However, 
				the division is not usually sustainable.&nbsp; It is the case, 
				for example, that <em>provoke</em> usually takes an animate, 
				sentient object but it also possible to have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sunlight provoked the plant to flower<br />
				</em>although that is an unusual sense.</li>

		<p>Now that we know a bit about causative verbs, we can look at causative 
		structures.<br />
		The two verbs we shall consider here are confined to <em>have</em> and
		<em>get</em> as they appear in the structures and other causative verbs 
		do not.<br />
		These two verbs are acting in these structures as <strong>primary</strong> 
		auxiliary verbs.<br />
		The distinction is that the direct object of a causative verb is the 
		person or object on which the obligation rests.&nbsp; Causative 
		structures, on the other hand, mark the object of the action in the main 
		verb.<br />
		As we noted above: a causative verb is focused on <strong>who</strong> 
		is affected, the causative structures focus on <strong>what</strong> is 
		affected.</p>
		<p><a name="2"></a>Here are six examples:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="20"><em>I'm having the house painted</em></li>
			<li><em>I'm getting the car serviced by the people who sold it to 
			me</em></li>
			<li><em>He got his wallet stolen by someone on the train</em></li>
			<li><em>She got her hand caught in the lift doors</em></li>
			<li><em>She got the shop burned down</em></li>
			<li><em>I got the work done at last</em></li>
			<li><em>I had the painting nearly 
			finished</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>In all these cases we have the direct objects as:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="20"><em>the house</em></li>
				<li><em>the car</em></li>
				<li><em>his wallet</em></li>
				<li><em>her hand</em></li>
				<li><em>the shop</em></li>
				<li><em>the work</em></li>
				<li><em>the painting</em></li>

		<p><strong>Meaning</strong><br />
		There are six things to notice about 
		meaning</p>
		<ul class="redbullet">
			<li>The meaning is commonly that of arranging for someone else to do 
			something for you (examples 20 and 21).</li>
			<li>The other common meaning is that of suffering an unpleasant 
			experience (examples 22 and 23).</li>
			<li>A third meaning is that of arranging for an unfortunate incident 
			fraudulently (example24).&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got her car stolen for the insurance 
			money<br />
			</em>When this meaning is intended, the verb may well be used as an 
			active causative as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She got her brother to burn down the shop<br />
			</em>The use of the second object (making the verb causal rather than the 
			structure) is not allowed unless some sort of fraudulent act is 
			suspected.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She got someone to steal her car</em> (for the insurance 
			money)<br />
			in which a fraudulent act is the only interpretation, with<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got her car stolen</em><br />
			which may be interpreted as referring to an unpleasant incident, not 
			fraud.<br />
			The use of <em>have</em> when a fraudulent act is intended is much 
			rarer.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had her car stolen</em><br />
			will almost always be interpreted as just a misfortune but is 
			possible in the fraudulent sense, given a context.<br />
			When the <em>by</em> formulation is inserted a fraudulent 
			understanding may be made clear:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She had the shop set on fire by her friends</em></li>
			<li>There is a difference between <em>get</em> and <em>have </em>in 
			that <em>get </em>can imply a short action or event, and <em>have
			</em>can imply a state in being (and is <strong>not</strong> causative).&nbsp; 
			Compare for example<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got her foot trapped between the rocks</em> 
			(an accidental event)<br />
			with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had her foot trapped between the rocks</em> (an unfortunate state).<br />
			Only <em>get</em> can be 
			used in the sense of a <strong>sudden</strong> unfortunate incident.</li>
			<li>A further difference between <em>get</em> and <em>have</em> is 
			that the uses of <em>get</em> meaning <em>oblige</em> and <em>get</em> meaning <em>
			persuade</em> blur slightly.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the teacher to explain it to me</em><br />
			implies <em>persuade</em> because of the power relationships between the 
			participants, in which the teacher can only be persuaded, not 
			compelled, whereas<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The teacher got the child to clean the board</em><br />
			implies no sense of <em>persuade</em> for the same reason.<br />
			When power relationships are equal, either sense can be intended so, 
			for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her colleagues got Mary to give the 
			presentation</em><br />
			means either that they arranged the presentation this way or that 
			they persuaded Mary to give it.&nbsp; Which meaning is understood 
			will depend entirely on context.<br />
			The verb <em>have</em> does not exhibit this blurring of meanings 
			so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her colleagues had Mary give the presentation</em><br />
			can only imply obligation, not persuasion.</li>
			<li>Finally, examples 25. and 26. show that the verbs <em>get</em> 
			and <em>have</em> can be used in the sense of accomplish something 
			and, although the structure is parallel, the verbs imply no 
			causative meaning at all.<br />
			For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just getting my report finished when I 
			was interrupted<br />
			</em>does not imply that the speaker / writer was requiring someone 
			else to finish the report.&nbsp; It signals that the report writing 
			was nearly accomplished.<br />
			Some ambiguity may be present.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to get the car washed for the wedding<br />
			</em>can mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to wash the car for the wedding<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to have the car washed for the wedding<br />
			</em>and only context and co-text can disambiguate the senses.<br />
			The verb <em>have</em> is less common in this sense so, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the report almost finished when I was 
			interrupted<br />
			</em>does not imply any sense of causality.&nbsp; It means only that 
			the report was in an almost finished state.<br />
			These uses of ostensibly causative structures when no causal effect 
			is implied is non-intuitive and confuses learners easily.<br />
			The ambiguity arises because English does not distinguish the form 
			of a participle used verbally and one used adjectivally.&nbsp; 
			Compare, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go the kitchen floor swept and mopped by 
			six o'clock<br />
			</em>which almost certainly refers to the speaker's achievement, 
			with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the kitchen floor swept and mopped by 
			the maid<br />
			</em>which is clearly causative.<br />
			No ambiguity can arise, therefore, when the adjective is not derived 
			from a verb so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the figures right<br />
			</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the figures right<br />
			</em>are unambiguous, but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the figures worked out<br />
			</em>and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I had the figures worked out<br />
			</em>are both ambiguous.</li>

			<h3><a name="summarymeaning"></a>A summary of the meanings of 
			causative structures.</h3>
			<p>The issues of meaning can be summarised 
			like this with the cells in red being unavailable to express the 
			intended meaning and those in orange denoting more formal or less 
			common uses:<br />
			<img alt="meanings summary" height="498" src="../../imagesgraphics/causative_meanings.png" width="775" /></p>
			<p><a href="#top" style="color:#ff3300">-top-</a></p>
			<p><strong><a name="formstructure"></a>Form</strong><br />
			There are also things to notice about form.</p>
		<ul class="redbullet">
			<li><strong>Complexity</strong><br />
			The form is complex because the verbs are used transitively 
			(taking an object) and ditransitively (taking two objects).<br />
			In the first case we have Subject – Object – Verb (and that's an 
			unusual word ordering in English which is normally SVO not SOV).<br />
			In the second case we have three possibilities:<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>we can use the<em> by-</em>structure  
				revealing the causative to be a form of passive construction.&nbsp; 
				We can use the <em>by-</em>structure with both <em>get</em> and
				<em>have</em>.&nbsp; In both cases (passive and causative), the
				<em>by</em>-structure has the agent of the main verb as its 
				complement.&nbsp; The structure is parallel with both verbs:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got the house painted by the man down 
				the road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had the house painted by the man down the road</em></li>
				<li>we can rearrange the sentence to make the verb an active 
				causative rather than a passive structure and insert the second 
				object but there are complications.<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>When we use <em>get</em> we usually 
				insert the <em>to-</em>infinitive before the second object.&nbsp; 
				Very rarely, we can use the bare infinitive.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm getting the people who sold me 
					the car service it<br /></em>but <strong>the </strong><em>
					<strong>to-</strong></em><strong>infinitive is always 
					correct</strong> and generally seen as more natural:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm getting the people who sold me 
					the car <strong>to</strong> service it</em></li>
					<li>The <em>to</em>-infinitive cannot be used with<em> have</em> 
					which always takes the bare infinitive in its causative-verb 
					use.&nbsp; We allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
					had the driver drop me at the corner</em><br />but not:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I had the driver to drop me at the 
				corner</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In summary, there are three possible clause structures (see 
				below under teaching suggestions for a combined table with examples):<br />

			<li><strong>Questions and negatives</strong><br />
			In all cases, the verb <em>have</em> is almost always treated as 
			a main verb in causative structures and when it operates as a 
			causative verb so, for example:<br />
			The question forms are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you have the house painted?</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you have him do it again?</em><br />
			and the negative forms are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't have the house painted.</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't have him do it again.<br />
			</em>More rarely, this verb can be treated as an auxiliary (the 
			function it performs in perfect tense forms) in the interrogative so 
			we can also allow a questionable and certainly formal use such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Had you the house painted?<br />
			</em>but in the negative the verb is always treated as a main verb 
			so:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I hadn't the house painted<br />
			</em>is not allowed.<br />The verb <em>get</em> is always treated as a main verb, 
			although here it is performing an auxiliary function, so the issue does 
			not arise.</li>
			<li><strong>Confusion between aspects</strong><br />
			In British English the unnecessary and meaningless <em>got</em> is 
			routinely inserted when <em>have</em> means something like <em>
			possess. receive</em> or <em>suffer from</em> as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got a cold</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hadn't got the email on my computer</em><br />
			which are examples of a present and past simple forms showing a continuous aspect with the 
			stative use of the verb <em>have.<br />
			</em>The issue for learners is that the form of <em>got</em> in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got her to agree</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She'd got the workmen to make less noise</em><br />
			is not the same because here it functions as a causative verb in its 
			own right and the forms are present and past perfect, respectively.</li>

				<p>There are a few issues to consider.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<ol>
				<li>When it is acting as an auxiliary verb, <em>have</em> is 
				conventionally contracted to one of its forms as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I've seen that</em> (/aɪv.ˈsiːn.ðæt/)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He'd already left</em> (/hid.ɔːl.ˈre.di.left/)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We've finished</em> (/wiv.ˈfɪ.nɪʃt/)<br />
				and so on.<br />
				However, when it is forming a causative structure, this does not 
				occur so:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had John fix the tap</em><br />
				cannot be contracted to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'd John fix the tap.</em></li>
				<li>Even when the full form of the verb is used in the perfect 
				aspect, the /æ/ sound is often weakened to /ə/ so, for example<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen that</em><br />
				is pronounced as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈaɪ.həv.ˈsiːn.ðæt/<br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had seen that</em><br />
				as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈaɪ.həd.ˈsiːn.ðæt/<br />
				but this does not occur with causative structures so the 
				pronunciation retains the full form in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the car washed on Wednesdays</em><br />
				as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (/ˈaɪ.hæv.ðə.kɑː.wɒʃt.ɒn.ˈwenz.deɪz/)<br />and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had her nails done<br />
				</em>as<br />(/ʃi.hæd.hə.neɪlz.dʌn/)<br />etc.</li>
				<li>The final 't' in <em>got</em> is frequently elided, 
				especially when followed by a consonant sound.&nbsp; When it is 
				followed by a vowel, it is often converted to a glottal stop.&nbsp; 
				So, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got John to do it</em><br />
				is pronounced as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈaɪ.ˈɡɒ.dʒɒn.tə.duːwɪt/<br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got him to do it</em><br />
				as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈaɪ.ˈɡɒt.ɪm.tə.duːwɪt/<br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈaɪ.ˈɡɒʔ.ɪm.tə.duːwɪt/<br />

			<p>A key area to consider before embarking on the teaching of 
			causative structures is how your learners' first languages encode 
			the concepts. &nbsp;All languages are capable of expressing the concepts, 
			of course, and some do it by implication while others are very 
			explicit about the type of causation and the nature of the object of 
			causality.<br />
			Here's a very short list.</p>

		</table>
			<p>The way that causative structures and causative verbs are used in 
			languages other than English is very variable and very complex.&nbsp; 
			Some examples will suffice here but you need to rely on your own 
			research to determine whether the learners you are dealing with will 
			have difficulties understanding the concept in English.&nbsp; Almost 
			all learners will have problems with the structure because it is a 
			complex area.</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>Romance languages (such as Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, 
				French, Italian and Romanian) will usually deploy a verb which 
				roughly translates as <em>make</em> so, instead of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have the work done</em><br />
				the direct translation is more likely to be something like<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make the work done</em></li>
				<li>Germanic languages are variable with German and Dutch using 
				a verb which translates approximately as <em>let</em> in English so the 
				example will directly be translated as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the work done.</em></li>
				<li>Scandinavian languages, excluding Finnish use a verb similar 
				to the English <em>have</em>, although Danish and Norwegian use 
				a verb more like <em>get</em> more frequently.</li>
				<li>Many languages (such as Greek and Korean) really have no equivalent 
				structure at all and rely on context and co-text do 
				differentiate between<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the work<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have the work done</em></li>
				<li>Some languages (such as Hungarian) have an instrumental case 
				which may be used to signal causative senses and Finnish, 
				another Uralic language, relies on suffixation on the verb.</li>
				<li>When we venture beyond European languages the complexities 
				multiply and many languages (such as Japanese) use 
				morphological changes to the verb form to signal the causative.&nbsp; 
				Japanese also distinguishes by case changes between causatives 
				in which the person doing the action is willing or unwilling to 
				do so.</li>
				<li>Some, such as Arabic may simply double a consonant to signal 
				a causative structure and others, such as Lithuanian may change 
				the internal structure of the verb.</li>
				<li>Some languages, such as Tagalog, rely on prefixing the verb 
				to signal a causative.</li>
				<li>Hebrew makes complex changes to the verb stem itself.</li>
				<li>Chinese languages have a range of causative verbs but one of 
				them, <em>ràng</em>, the most common, translates in English as
				<strong>either</strong> <em>make</em> or <em>let</em> because 
				Chinese distinguishes by context how willing or unwilling the 
				person affected is.&nbsp; Chinese speakers will not, therefore, 
				be accustomed to having to select the correct verb and may do so 
				randomly.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and the list could go on for some time.<br />
			The moral of this is that you should not assume that either the 
			concept or the form of the causative in English will be familiar or 
			accessible to speakers of other languages and this is a source, 
			naturally, of difficulty and error for learners.</p>

		<p>There is a range of related difficulties for learners in this area:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The forms, especially in terms of word order, are complex, 
			unusual and 
			difficult to remember.&nbsp; We have both:<ol class="auto-style69">
				<li>SV<sub><span class="auto-style68">A</span></sub>OV<sub><span class="auto-style68">P</span></sub> (Subject&nbsp;&ndash; 
				Auxiliary verb&nbsp;– Object&nbsp;– Verb participle) as in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had my house painted</em></li>
				<li>SV<sub><span class="auto-style68">A</span></sub>O<sub><span class="auto-style68">I</span></sub>V<sub><span class="auto-style68">P</span></sub>O<sub><span class="auto-style68">D</span></sub> 
				(Subject&nbsp;– Auxiliary verb&nbsp;– Indirect object&nbsp;– Verb participle –&nbsp; 
				Direct object) 
				as in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had Mary write my essay</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>We saw above that other languages handle transitivity and 
			causative verbs very differently from English so there are many 
			possibilities for confusion.&nbsp; This leads to errors such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I 
			cut my hair at the salon<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I stolen my car</em>.</li>
			<li>There are complex issues with meaning: arrangement, misfortune 
			and fraud.&nbsp; Learners may misinterpret what they hear or produce 
			unintended meanings.&nbsp; The difference between, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got someone to steal her car</em><br />
			(i.e., fraudulently) and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got her car stolen by someone</em><br />
			(i.e., probably just unfortunately)<br />
			is subtle and non-intuitive.</li>
			<li>There are complexities of form with ordering of two objects and 
			the use of the <em>to</em>-infinitive.&nbsp; This leads to errors such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*I am 
			getting him painted my house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is having him to do it<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>The variations in strength in terms of the use of causative 
			verbs (rather than causative structures) are quite subtle so the 
			difference between, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She persuaded him to do the work</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got him to do the work</em><br />
			are not immediately obvious.<br />
			The issue is one of hortation (suasion) and obligation (deontic 
			modality).&nbsp; See the guide to suasion linked at the end for more 
			in this area.</li>
			<li>There may be confusion with perfect tense forms.&nbsp; The 
			distinction between, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had my house painted</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had painted my house</em><br />
			or between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have the car repaired</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have repaired the car</em><br />
			or between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have my eyes tested</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tested my eyes</em><br />
			relies solely on the ordering of the constituents of the clauses and 
			learners may either produce or understand the perfect aspects where 
			a simple aspect causative meaning is intended.</li>
			<li>Because of 1, 2, 3 and 4, learners often avoid the structures 
			and rely on unnatural circumlocutions such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My car was repaired
			</em>(when <em>I had the car repaired</em> is intended)<br />
			or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hairdresser cut my 
			hair</em>.</li>

			Some comparative work with perfect aspect tense forms is probably 
			appropriate so learners are alerted to the difference between<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have my hair cut</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have cut my hair</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			Beware the complex tense forms until the simple forms and the 
			word ordering have been mastered.&nbsp; Forms such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had been having his old shoes repaired for years before he 
			bought a new pair<br />
			</em>are not at all easy to unpack.<br />
			Use sentence re-ordering exercises but not by getting learners to 
			re-order all the individual words.&nbsp; It is the constituents of 
			the clause which they need to notice, not the individual words which 
			make up phrases.<br />
			So do not set an exercise such as:<br />
			<table cellspacing="0" class="auto-style63" style="width: 291px">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style65" colspan="9">Put the words in the

					<td class="auto-style64" style="width: 33px">has</td>

			<br />
			but prefer the idea of getting the constituent <strong>phrases</strong> 
			in the right order:<br />
			<table cellspacing="0" class="auto-style63">

			<br />
			Try Dictogloss techniques to get the learners to reconstruct the 
			forms.&nbsp; A short text such as:</dd>
			<dd class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em><strong>I went to town yesterday to 
			have my eyes tested at the opticians and while I was there I got my 
			shoes repaired and had the barman at the pub make me a wonderful 
			cocktail.&nbsp; I went shopping too but my back's painful so I had 
			my shopping taken to the car by the boy in the supermarket.</strong></em></span></dd>
			<dd>is a suitable vehicle once the learners are familiar with the forms 
			they are trying to get right.<br />
			(There are some other ideas for drilling and dictation in 
			the 
			teacher development guide to techniques, linked below.)<br />
			For pronunciation practice, simple 
			drilling of the form isn't enough.&nbsp; You need to <strong>explain</strong> where 
			the weak forms are and how the stress patterns work across the 
			sentence or clause.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Transitivity issues</strong></dt>
			<dd>Make sure you have some idea of how your students' languages 
			handle the concept.&nbsp; Ask them if you aren't sure because a 
			little comparative language work often pays dividends.<br />
			Concept checking has to be done continually when teaching the area.&nbsp; Students' understanding of who is doing what to whom with what has 
			to be made <strong>overt</strong>.<br />
			For a sentence such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Mary is having the garage fix her moped<br />
			</em>questions such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is being fixed?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who owns the moped?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Mary fixing it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is fixing the moped?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What has Mary arranged?</em><br />
			etc. are 
			vital for understanding and <span class="style_underline">checking</span> 
			understanding.<br />
			And you need to check with individuals rather than be satisfied with 
			the strongest calling out.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Meaning</strong></dt>
			<dd>Keep to one verb at a time initially because the shades of 
			meaning between <em>have</em> and <em>get</em> are very difficult to 
			grasp.<br />
			Start with <em>have</em> for arrangements only.&nbsp; Insert <em>get</em> 
			later with the same meaning (and make it clear that it is 
			stylistically less formal, usually) and only later 
			introduce the idea of misfortune.<br />
			Much later, if at all, introduce the idea of fraud.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Two objects and the use of the <em>to</em>-infinitive</strong></dt>
			<dd>Don't introduce a second object until the form and meaning of 
			causative structures with a single object has been mastered.<br />
			Focus on one verb at a time (usually <em>have</em>) because the use 
			of the bare infinitive works fine with <em>make</em> and <em>let</em>, 
			too, the verbs are probably familiar and the concepts are allied.<br />
			Introduce the <em>get </em>+<em> to-</em>infinitive in combination 
			with <em>ask to, arrange to, want to</em> etc. because the forms are 
			familiar and parallel.&nbsp; It's a short structural and conceptual 
			jump from <em>I want him to go</em> and <em>I got him to go</em>.<br />
			(See the guide to other catenative (chain forming) verbs which 
			follow this pattern linked in the list of related guides at the end.)</dd>
			<dt><strong>Avoidance</strong></dt>
			<dd>Set up a clear context in which the forms are required, not 
			optional.<br />
			Example 1<br />
			Having a street plan and the names of shops and services on it can 
			be used to exemplify and practice.&nbsp; Get the learners to follow you 
			around town on the map while you relate the events.&nbsp; E.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			First I'm having my hair done</em> (students number the 
			hairdresser's as '1')<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then I'm getting my clothes cleaned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then I'm having my shoes repaired<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then I'll try to get my 
			laptop sorted out<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			When they have followed you around by 
			the prompts, they can follow each other using similar prompts.<br />
			<span class="auto-style10">((This idea is from Obee, 1999:101.)</span><br />
			Example 2<br />
			Choose a topic of someone temporarily disabled by a broken arm, for 
			example, and focus on what 
			that person currently must have or get done by someone else that they would normally do 
			for themselves:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			wash the car<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			do the shopping<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			tie shoelaces<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			change a light bulb</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			You may like to introduce this with some speculation about how the 
			person got his or her arm broken, of course.</dd></dl>
