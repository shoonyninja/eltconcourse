		<p>What follows is <em>one way </em>of analysing 
		multi-word verbs.<br />
		There are other ways to do the analysis which are summarised here.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>One analysis recognises a word class called <em>particles</em> which are neither adverbs 
		nor prepositions (although they look like them).&nbsp; Particles are 
		function words, like conjunctions, prepositions etc., which have no 
		lexical meaning in themselves and need to combine with other words to 
		make any meaning.&nbsp; For example, <em>on</em> standing alone means 
		nothing but in a phrase such as <em>get on the bus</em>, it forms part 
			of a prepositional phrase which modifies how 
		we understand the verb <em>get</em>.&nbsp; And no, in this sense the 
			combination of <em>get</em> plus <em>on</em> is not a phrasal or 
			even a multi-word verb.<br />
			It really doesn't matter too 
		much for teaching purposes whether you use the term 'particle', 
		'preposition' or 
		'adverb'.&nbsp; Here, we'll use the adverb-preposition distinction, 
		reserving the term 'particle' for either of them.&nbsp; We will not 
			follow this sort of analysis because, for teaching purposes, it is 
			too vague a definition and disguises many differences in the 
			ordering of the constituents of a clause which are important as well 
			as leaving the nature of adverbs, adverb particles and prepositions 
			unclear.<br />
			It also leads to a situation in which virtually any adverb following 
			a verb may be classed as a phrasal verb and that, in its turn, leads 
			to an unacceptable learning load.&nbsp; It is perfectly possible to 
			understand, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She got on the bus</em><br />
			by analogy with<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put it on the table</em><br />
			because in both cases, the particle on is acting as a preposition of 
			movement to a place above ground level.&nbsp; And, naturally enough,
			<em>get off</em> carries the opposite meaning.</li>
			<li>In other analyses of multi-word verbs, you will discover that all of 
		them are lumped together as 'phrasal verbs'.&nbsp; This is not the 
		approach taken here but it makes some kind of sense &ndash; multi-word 
		verbs are, by definition, phrases, so why not call them by that name?&nbsp; 
		Analyses which take this line may distinguish between particle verbs, 
		prepositional verbs and particle-prepositional verbs.&nbsp; Roughly 
		speaking, these categories are similar to the ones used here.<br />
			We will not be using this analysis either because the distinction 
			between an adverb particle and a prepositional particle is necessary 
			for teaching purposes in order that the major patterns can be 
			discerned and taught independently.</li>
			<li>A now slightly unfashionable analysis is to call all verb + 
			particle structures phrasal verbs (whether the particle is an adverb 
			or a preposition) and then to divide them into four types.&nbsp; 
			This is the approach taken in many course books and can be helpful 
			in the classroom but we will not be using this analysis here because 
			it overcomplicates the issues.&nbsp; The four types, incidentally, 
			are:<ol class="auto-style39">
				<li>Type 1: intransitive phrasal verbs consisting of a verb plus 
				an adverb particle such as <em>Come on!</em></li>
				<li>Type 2: transitive separable phrasal verbs consisting of a 
				verb + a preposition <strong>or</strong> adverb such as <em>Put 
				it away!</em></li>
				<li>Type 3: transitive non-separable phrasal verbs consisting of 
				verb + a preposition such as <em>Look after the children!</em></li>
				<li>Type 4: verbs containing two or more particles, the first an 
				adverb and the second a preposition such as <em>Stick up for 
				him</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>There are sound reasons for using any of these three ways of 
		classifying and analysing multi-word verbs and you should use 
		the one that makes the most sense to you.&nbsp; However, this analysis 
		will use three categories of multi-word verbs and discuss them 
		individually.&nbsp; These categories are:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style39">
			<li>Phrasal verbs which contain a verb plus an adverb such as <em>
			cut up</em>.&nbsp; In this analysis, these verbs are separable, if 
			they are transitive, so 
			one can have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cut it up</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cut up the tree</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cut the tree up<br />
			</em>but not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cut up it</em></li>
			<li>Prepositional verbs which contain a verb plus a dependent 
			preposition such as <em>rely on</em> and which are not separable, 
			the object always following the preposition, so one can have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I relied on her help</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I relied on it</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I relied her help on<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I relied it on</em></li>
			<li>Phrasal-prepositional verbs which contain a verb followed by an 
			adverb and a preposition are a subset of prepositional verbs.&nbsp; 
			These are also inseparable so we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lived up to his name</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He lived his name up to</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He lived up his name to</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>This analysis leaves an indeterminate class of multi-word 
		verbs: those which are inseparable but which are variably opaque in 
		meaning and often quite idiomatic such as <em>care for, look after</em> 
		or <em>go without</em>.&nbsp; In this category we can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cared for his patients</em><br />
		or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cared for them</em><br />
		but not<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He cared his patients for</em><br />
		or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He cared them for.</em><br />
		In what follows this, we analyse these verbs in the same way that it we 
		analyse prepositional verbs (category ii. above) because they follow the 
		same patterns in terms of grammatical structure (i.e., they are not 
		separable and the object 
		follows the particle).&nbsp; For teaching purposes, therefore, they can 
		be dealt with in the same way and should not form a separate 
		category (usually referred to as intransitive phrasal verbs) 
		because that simply muddies the water and overloads learners.<br />
		The argument here is that they are simply another set of prepositional 
		verbs which often have slightly figurative or metaphorical uses of 
		prepositions.&nbsp; When the particle is an adverb, combining with the 
		verb to form a distinctly new meaning, they will be referred to as 
		phrasal verbs.</p>
		<p>Here's a summary of the four main ways of analysing this area of 
		English.&nbsp; You will encounter all of them at some time, probably, so 
		need to decide which to follow.&nbsp; Mixing them up is a recipe for 
		confusion.&nbsp; What follows adheres to Analysis #4.</p>

		</table>
		<p>This is the first thing we need to do because we can't begin to 
		analyse multi-word verbs until the distinction between a particle as a 
		preposition and a particle as an adverb is clear.<br />
		The immediate problem is that nearly all the words can function as both 
		adverbs and prepositions, depending on the grammar.<br />
		There's a test.&nbsp; To see it work, consider this sentence:</p>
		<h4 class="auto-style28"><span class="style_blue"><em>John is standing</em></span>
		<span class="style_red"><em>in</em></span><span class="style_brown"><em>
		</em></span><span class="style_black"><em>for</em></span><em><span class="style_brown"> </span>
		<span class="style_blue">me</span></em></h4>
		<p><span class="style_black">Prepositions <strong>in black</strong></span>,
		<span class="style_red">adverbs <strong>in red</strong></span> in what follows.</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Prepositions</strong></dt>
	<dd>take a complement (not, in this analysis, an object although that is a 
	legitimate description).<br />
	The word <span class="style_black"> <em><strong>for</strong></em></span> is a 
	preposition because it has a complement, <span class="style_brown"> <em>me</em></span>, which can be altered 
	without changing the sense of the verb.&nbsp; So, we can have <em>
	<span class="style_black"><strong>for</strong></span><span class="style_brown"> Mary, </span>
	<span class="style_black"><strong>for</strong></span><span class="style_brown"> the moment,
	</span><span class="style_black"><strong>for</strong></span><span class="style_brown"> the 
	time being, </span><span class="style_black"><strong>for</strong></span><span class="style_brown"> 
	the boss of the company</span></em> and so 
	on.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Adverbs</strong></dt>
			<dd>do not take a complement.&nbsp; In the clause above, 
			<span class="style_red"> <em><strong>in</strong></em></span> 
			is an adverb, not a preposition.<br />
			If we give it a complement 
			such as <span class="style_brown"> <em>the house, the water, the garden</em></span> etc., 
			it will be a preposition and the meaning will alter.<br />
			For example, the sentence<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is standing </em> </span>
			<span class="style_black"><em><strong>in</strong></em></span><span class="style_brown"><em> the 
			garden<br />
			</em></span>clearly contains the preposition <em>
			<span class="style_black"><strong>in</strong></span>.</em>&nbsp; It is not a phrasal 
			verb or even a multi-word verb.<br />
			If you change the particle when it really is an adverb, however, the 
			verb meaning changes.&nbsp; So we can have<span class="style_brown"><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He is standing </em> </span><span class="style_red"><em><strong>up</strong></em></span><span class="style_brown"><em>
			</em>
			</span><span class="style_black"><em><strong>for</strong></em></span><span class="style_brown"><em> 
			her<br />
			</em></span>meaning <em>support</em> or <em>back</em> someone.&nbsp; We can 
			also use <span class="style_red"><em><strong>for</strong></em></span> as an adverb 
			as in<em><span class="style_brown"><br />
			</span>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">I won't stand </span>
			<span class="style_red"><strong>for</strong></span><span class="style_brown"> his 
			behaviour<br />
			</span></em>and that is a different verb with 
			a completely different meaning (<em>tolerate</em>).</dd>

		<p>The title of this section includes the term 'adverb particles' rather 
		than 'adverbs' for a 
		good reason.<br />
		We should be careful to distinguish between an adverb particle as part 
		of a phrasal verb and a one-word adverb functioning to modify the verb.&nbsp; 
		For example, the clause:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked me up</em><br />
		contains the adverb particle <em>up</em> and is a phrasal verb 
		because changing the particle to, say, <em>down, away, in</em> etc. 
		creates nonsense.&nbsp; In fact, the verb alone is intransitive so:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked</em><br />
		is meaningless unless what he looked at or for is clear.<br />
		When it is a phrasal verb, as in the first example, it is transitive and 
		means either <em>visited</em> or <em>found in a reference text</em>.<br />
		It is not possible to omit the particle and 
		retain the verb's meaning.<br />
		We can, of course, have<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked me over suspiciously</em><br />
		and, by changing the adverb particle, we have changed the sense of the 
		verb.</p>
			<p>However, in the clause:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rang me back</em><br />
		the situation is not so clear cut because a number of other one-word 
		adverbs could be inserted instead of <em>back</em>, without altering the 
		meaning of the verb <em>ring</em> at all so we can have<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rang me soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rang me again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rang me yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rang me frequently</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		We can also have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He rang me</em><br />
		with no adverb and an unaltered sense of the verb.<br />
		With a phrasal verb proper, omitting the particle is usually not 
		possible so, for example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; He looked up the word in a dictionary</em><br />
		cannot be rendered as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He looked the word in a dictionary<br />
			</em>because it is the combination of the verb and the adverb which 
			supplies the meaning.&nbsp; The adverb <em>up</em> does not modify 
			the verb, in other words, it contributes to the meaning of the whole 
			phrase.&nbsp; That is why it is called a phrasal verb.</p>
		<p>So, by this analysis, the phrase <em>ring back</em> (or <em>call back)</em> 
		does not constitute a phrasal verb as such although it may be treated 
		that way in many course books, internet-derived lists and classrooms.<br />
		Assuming always that single-word adverbs must be parts of phrasal verbs 
		is unhelpful because it adds an additional learning load which is simply 
		not necessary.&nbsp; You do not need to learn<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; text back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ring back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; write back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talk back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shout back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; email back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phone back</em><br />
		and so on as phrasal verbs once the meaning of the adverb <em>back</em> has been 
		learned.&nbsp; They aren't phrasal verbs at all because 
		the sense of the verb is being modified but not fundamentally altered by the adverb.&nbsp; 
		In all cases, the particle can be omitted without creating nonsense.</p>
		
		<p> Combinations which are transparent in meaning of a verb with an 
		adverb are sometimes referred to as <strong>transparent phrasal verbs</strong> 
		and there is some value in doing so as the combinations often act 
		grammatically in the same way as phrasal verbs proper.&nbsp; For 
		example, they are variably transitive and almost always separable.<br />
		However, to consider all examples of transparent meaning combinations of 
		verbs and adverbs as phrasal verbs adds an enormous and wholly 
		unnecessary learning load.<br />
		If learners understand the meaning of the verb and the meaning of the 
		adverb particle, there is no need to burden them with the need to learn 
		the combination as a language chunk.<br />
		For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took my pen out</em><br />
		merely requires one to understand the prototypical meaning of the adverb
		<em>out</em> (from the inside to the outside).&nbsp; Suggesting that <em>take out </em>is a 
		phrasal verb in this case is unnecessary.<br />
		Even if we accept that transparent phrasal verbs are phrasal verbs at 
		all, rather than just verbs modified by adverbs, there is no need to 
		mystify them and certainly no need to require learners to learn each 
		one separately.</p>

				In which the <span class="style_black">adverb</span> serves to 
				say how the speaker / writer perceives the verb operating and 
				that includes, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came <span class="styleblackbold">back</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went <span class="styleblackbold">there</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car drove <span class="styleblackbold">past</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came <span class="styleblackbold">quickly</span> over the road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They went <span class="styleblackbold">happily</span> to the beach<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car drove <span class="styleblackbold">noisily</span> up the hill</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				In these cases, the adverb is mobile so we allow, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car drove up the hill
				<span class="styleblackbold">noisily</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="styleblackbold">quickly</span> came over the 
				road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Back</span> he came</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				In other words, the <strong>constituents of the clause</strong> 
				are:<br />
				<span class="styleblackbold"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject 
				noun phrase (<em>he, she, the car </em>etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verb phrase (<em>came, went, drove </em>etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adverbial or adverb phrase (<em>back, there, past, quickly</em> 
				etc.)</strong></span><br />
				and we can go on adding adverbial phrases of one kind or another 
				virtually indefinitely.</li>
				<li>Adverb <strong>integration</strong><br />
				In which the adverb functions as part of
				<span class="style_black">a verb's meaning</span> and that 
				includes, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car <span class="styleblackbold">wore 
				out</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="styleblackbold">talked</span> her
				<span class="styleblackbold">round</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="styleblackbold">broke</span> it
				<span class="styleblackbold">down</span> to make it simple<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="styleblackbold">get up</span> at 9<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="styleblackbold">came to</span> in hospital<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss <span class="styleblackbold">put off </span>her meeting<br />
				</em>In these cases, when the verb is transitive, the adverb may 
				be separated from the verb by the object so we allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss put her meeting 
				<span class="styleblackbold">off</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss put it <span class="styleblackbold">off</span></em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss put <span class="styleblackbold">off
				</span>her meeting</em><br />
				but we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The boss put off it</em><br />
				because a defining characteristic of separable phrasal verbs is 
				that any object pronoun must come between the verb and the 
				adverb particle.<br />
				In other words, <strong>the constituents of the clause</strong> 
				are:<br />
				<strong>
				<span class="styleblackbold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject 
				noun phrase (<em>the car, they, she </em>etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verb phrase (<em>wore out, talked round, broke down, get up</em> 
				etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Object noun phrase (</span></strong><span class="styleblackbold"><em>it, 
				her meeting</em></span>)<br />
				and we can go on adding adverbial phrases of one kind or another 
				virtually indefinitely to arrive at, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss put off her meeting yesterday 
				afternoon to her great disappointment because he thought ...</em></li>

						Here,

				If you change it, you change the meaning of the verb:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He 
				pulled <strong>through</strong> the trick<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He pulled 
				<strong>up</strong> the trick</em><br />
						etc.<br />
						By our definition, this is a transitive phrasal verb 
						with the object <em>the trick</em> and it means <em>
						succeed in doing something</em>.<br />
						The prototypical meaning of the verb <em>pull</em> 
						(something like <em>drag</em> or <em>tow</em>) does not 
						include the sense of success, of course so the phrasal 
						verb is quite opaque in meaning.</div>

						Here we have two bits to consider, 
						<em> 
				<strong>up</strong> </em>and<em> <strong>to</strong>.<br />
						</em>Changing 
						<em> <strong>up</strong> </em>will alter the meaning of the verb 
						or make it nonsense.<br />The word<em><strong> to </strong> </em>takes a complement,<em> her</em>, and the whole 
				phrase can be substituted or even omitted.&nbsp;

				So we can have, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						He opened 
				<strong>up</strong> <strong>to</strong> the group about what 
				was worrying him<br />
						</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						He opened <strong>up</strong> <strong>with</strong> me 
						because I'm his friend<br />
						</em>in which we have changed the preposition but kept the 
						adverb intact.<br />
				We can also just say:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						He finally opened 
				<strong>up</strong><br />
						</em>retaining the 
				meaning of<em> open <strong>up</strong>.<br />

						</em>So, in this example, <em> <strong>up</strong> </em>is an adverb and 
				<em> 
				<strong>to</strong> </em>is a 
				preposition.<br />Phrasal verbs are 
				often followed by prepositional phrases and it is important to 
				identify where the verb stops and the prepositional phrase 
				begins.<br />
						In this case the verb <em>open</em> has retained its 
						prototypical meaning of <em>expose </em>or<em> make 
						unclosed</em> but it is used metaphorically when it 
						combines with the adverb <em>up</em>.<br />
						The verb can be used with a prepositional phrase as in, 
						e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is open to the public</em></div>

						<em> 
				<strong>on</strong> </em>without 
				changing the meaning, if only slightly:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						They moved 
				<strong>along</strong><br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						They moved <strong>away</strong><br />

						They 
				moved <strong>on</strong> <strong>by</strong> considering the last item<br />
						</em>etc<em>.<br />

						</em>So,
						<em> <strong>on</strong></em> is an adverb and 
						<em> 
				<strong>to</strong></em> is a 
				preposition.<br />
						(Incidentally, the confusion between <em>onto</em> (a 
						single-word preposition) and <em>on to</em> (an adverb

						The words can only be combined when they are both

						The meaning is, however, at least semi-transparent if 
						one understands the usual meaning of the adverb <em>up</em>.<br />
						The problem with the verb <em>get</em> is a separate 
						issue because it is notoriously polysemous, having a 
						range of connected but distinct meanings.&nbsp; Here, it 
						carries the very common meaning of <em>move one's 
						position</em> so it also appears in:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get out</em><br />
						(both verb + adverb)<br />

				the complement <em>the service</em>, and the whole prepositional 
						phrase is the complement of the 
				verb <em>complain</em>.&nbsp; The verb <em>complain + about</em> 
						is a prepositional, not phrasal, verb.<br />
						<em>The service</em> is the not object of the verb, it 
						is the complement or object of the preposition<em> about</em> because <em>complain </em>
						is 
						intransitive.&nbsp; When used with no complement, the 
						preposition is dropped, so we get, for example:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I complained loudly</em><br />
						We can change the preposition but the meaning of <em>complain</em> is unaltered:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They complained to the manager<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They complained at reception<br />
						</em>and we can drop the prepositional phrase altogether and 
						have just:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She complained<br />
						</em>To repeat a little, the preposition may change 
						without altering the meaning of the verb:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She complained of a pain in her back<br />
						</em>This, therefore, is a verb with a dependent 
						preposition or, in this analysis, a prepositional verb, 
						not a phrasal verb.</div>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is actually a test not for any multi-word verb but for 
			phrasal verbs in particular.&nbsp; There's a good deal more about 
			how to distinguish between a prepositional verb and a phrasal verb 
			below.&nbsp; For now, this example will do:<br />
			If we replace the particle in a sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran back</em><br />
			and change it to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran ahead</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran about</em><br />
			it is clear that the meaning of the verb is unchanged.&nbsp; It 
			means <em>go quickly on foot</em> in all three sentences.<br />
			However, if we try the same trick with a sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned up</em> <em>later</em><br />
			and change it to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned away later</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned aside</em> <em>later</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			it is clear that in the first sentence the verb, <em>turn up</em>, 
			means <em>arrive</em> but in the others it means something much more 
			literal (change attitude).&nbsp; The verb's meaning <strong>contains</strong> 
			the sense of the particle in the first sentence but not in the other 
			sentences.<br />
			So, the verb <em>turn up</em> passes this test for a multi-word 
			verb.&nbsp; It is, in fact, and intransitive phrasal verb.&nbsp; The 
			expressions <em>turn away</em> and <em>turn aside</em> are not 
			multi-word verbs; they are simply verbs modified by a following 
			one-word adverb phrase.</p>
			<p>Incidentally, Henry Sweet (1845-1912) referred to verbs whose 
			parts combined to make a new and distinct meaning (such as <em>turn 
			up</em> in our example) as <strong>group verbs</strong> because the 
			meaning depended on the grouping rather than the individual 
			constituents.&nbsp; That definition has rather fallen out of fashion 
			so we won't be using it here.&nbsp; It remains, however, a useful 
			distinction to draw.</p>

			<p>You can't say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The lane was turned down<br />
			</em>but you can say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
	offer was turned down<br /></em>You often cannot make a passive with prepositional phrases but you can with 
	many transitive phrasal verbs.<br />
			Here's another example:<br />
			We can have either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked up the word<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word was looked up<br />
			</em>because the verb is <em>look up</em>.<br />
			However, it is often much more questionable when we try to make a 
			passive form with a verb plus a prepositional phrase so, while:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked up the chimney<br />
			</em>is the active form, many would not accept:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The chimney was looked up<br />
			</em>This is not, however, a particularly firm rule because some 
			prepositional phrases can be manipulated in this way and we might 
			allow, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The house was driven past<br />

				first part with, e.g., <em>drove</em>, or even <em>manoeuvred</em> 
				and we can replace the second part with something like <em>in</em> 
				or <em>along</em> or <em>at</em> (although the sense of 
				direction changes a little).&nbsp; We cannot, however, replace 
				both parts at once with a single word.<br />With a sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_underline">turned 
				down</span> the offer</em><br />it is possible to replace the underlined section with a single 
				verb so we could have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She refused the offer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She declined the offer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She rejected the offer</em><br />with very similar meanings.</p>
			<p>Above and elsewhere in this guide, we 
				define <em>into</em> as a preposition because it is always 
				followed by a complement (or object if you prefer).&nbsp; This 
				means, in effect that combinations such as <em>turn, change, 
				make</em> etc. with <em>into</em> are not phrasal verbs at all 
				but a verb plus a prepositional phrase with the preposition 
				indicating a change of state rather than a change of position.<br />In that analysis, 
			<em>turn into</em> is a pseudo-copular verb 
				which indicates a change of state and is in the same category as
				<em>grow, become, get, end up</em> and more.<br />
			This test is not always definitive and it is true that some verb 
			plus preposition combinations can be replaced by a single word.&nbsp; 
			For example, the verb 
			<em>turn into</em> can be replaced with a single verb:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She 
			<span class="style_underline">turned 
				into</span> a dictator = She <span class="style_underline">became</span> a dictator</em><br />
			but it does not make it a phrasal verb.</p>

			<p>This is related to Test 7 (<em>What is the question</em>) and concerns how we analyse 
			meanings embedded in the 
				clause.<br />The question to ask is<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>Is the structure<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verb + 
				prepositional phrase<br /></em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verb + direct object</em>?</strong></span><br />The test is to insert a complement (or object, if you prefer).&nbsp; 
				Prepositions take complements (or objects), adverbs do not. So, 
				for example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She turned down the road</em><br />is a case of a preposition, 
			<em>down</em>, taking the complement 
				(or object), <em>the road</em>, to form a prepositional phrase 
				and we could also have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned into the driveway<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned round the corner</em><br />Here the structure is:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verb + prepositional phrase</strong></span>.<br />
			So the verb is simply <em>turn</em>.</p>
			<p>However, when we consider:<br />&nbsp; 
			<em>&nbsp; She turned down my idea</em><br />we have <em>down</em> functioning as an adverb because the 
				structure is:<br /><span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phrasal verb + direct object</strong></span><br />and in this case, the verb is not 
			<em>turn</em>, it is <em>turn 
				down</em> as can immediately be seen if one replaces the adverb 
				with another:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned over my 
			idea in her mind</em><br />where the adverb is combining with the verb to make new meanings 
				(<em>consider</em>).</p>
			<p>(The verb <em>turn</em> is often combined with the preposition, <em>
			into</em>, to make a pseudo-copular verb as in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned into a princess</em><br />The combinations of 
			<em>turn + into</em> along with <em>change</em> 
				and <em>make + into</em> are not phrasal verbs because 
				the preposition <em>into</em> happens to have one meaning (among 
				others) of indicating a change of state.&nbsp; See below for 
				more on the meanings of <em>into</em>.)</p>

					Yes, replacing the particle changes the meaning of the

					<li><strong>Can you make a passive?</strong><br />
					Yes, we can make a passive as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was sorted out</em></li>
					<li><strong>Can you stress the particle or use a weak form?</strong><br />
					Yes, the stress can be placed on <em>out</em> and the verb will 
					take equal stress usually.</li>
					<li><strong>Can you move the phrase around?</strong><br />
					No, we cannot move the phrase around and allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Out the house they sorted<br />
					</em>There is also no way that we can produce a cleft 
					sentence such as:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It was out that they sorted the house.<br />
					</em>so the verb fails this test.</li>
					<li><strong>What is the question asking?</strong><ol class="auto-style30">
						<li><strong>Does the question ask what or who?</strong><br />Yes, it asks<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did they sort out?</em><br />and the answer is 
						<em>the house</em>.<br />
						Equally, we can allow:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who sorted the house out?<br />
						</em>and that will be answered by:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They did.</em></li>
						<li><strong>Does the question ask where or when?</strong><br />No.&nbsp; 
						We cannot make the question as:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *When did they sort?<br />
						</em>or<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Where did they sort?<br />
						</em>because both are unanswerable.&nbsp; The verb fails

					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Is the particle part of the question?<br />
					</strong>Yes, the particle is part of the question which is:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did they sort out?</em><br />
					not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *What did they sort?</em></li>
					<li><strong>Can you insert an adverb?</strong><br />
					No, we cannot easily insert an adverb between the verb

					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They sorted eventually out the house</em><br />
					is not acceptable and the verb fails this test.</li>
					<li><strong>Can we discover a one-word alternative?</strong><br />
					Yes, there is a one-word alternative.&nbsp; The verb <em>sort out</em> can be replaced with 
					<em>organised </em>or <em>tidied</em>.</li>
					<li><strong>What actually is the verb?</strong><br />
					Here we need to think about meaning.<br />
					Intuitively, we can say that the verb is <em>sort</em>, of 
					course, but a little thought reveals that the meaning is 
					encapsulated in the phrase <em>sort out </em>which has a 
					rather different and extended meaning.&nbsp; There is a 
					difference, albeit small, between:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sorted the books<br />
					</em>and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sorted out the books<br />
					</em>because the first refers to setting things in a 
					particular classified order and the second to tidying.</li>

				</li>
				<li><em><strong>She </strong><span class="style_underline">
				<strong>drove on</strong></span><strong> to the supermarket</strong></em><ol>
					<li><strong>Does replacing the particle change the meaning

					Yes, replacing the particle changes the meaning of the 
					verb.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove off to the supermarket</em><br />
					is a different meaning because it implies she started not 
					continued the journey.</li>
					<li><strong>Can you make a passive?</strong><br />
					No, we cannot make a passive because the verb is intransitive.&nbsp; 
					The verb doesn't fail this test because the test simply 
					cannot be applied to a verb with no object.</li>
					<li><strong>Can you stress the particle or use a weak form?</strong><br />
					Yes, the stress can fall on <em>on</em> quite naturally.</li>
					<li><strong>Can you move the phrase around?</strong><br />
					Just possibly, although most people will suspicious of:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; ?O<span class="auto-style107">n t</span>o the supermarket she drove<br />
					</em>and, although it is an unusual form, we can move the 
					prepositional adverbial phrase and allow, grammatically, at 
					least:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the supermarket, she drove on<br />
					</em>We can also not allow a cleft sentence so, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It was on that she drove</em><br />
					is not permitted.</li>
					<li><strong>What is the question asking?</strong><ol class="auto-style30">
						<li><strong>Does the question ask what or who?</strong><br />Yes, it asks:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did she do?</em><br />and the answer is 
						<em>drove on</em>.<br />The alternative question could be:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who drove on?<br /></em>and that will evince:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She did.</em></li>
						<li><strong>Does the question ask where or when?</strong><br />Not really.&nbsp; The question could be:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did she drive?</em><br />but that will not get the answer:<br />

						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When did she drive?<br /></em>does not allow the answer<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *On</em><br />at all.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Is the particle part of the question?</strong><br />
					Yes, the particle is part of the question which asks:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did she drive on to?</em><br />
					not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did she drive?</em><br />
					and the answer is <em>the supermarket</em>.</li>
					<li><strong>Can you insert an adverb?</strong><br />
					No, we cannot easily insert an adverb between the verb

					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She drove eventually on</em><br />

					<li><strong>Can we discover a one-word alternative?</strong><br />

					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She continued<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She motored<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove</em><br />
					without much change in meaning.</li>
					<li><strong>What actually is the verb?</strong><br />
					Here again we need to think about meaning.<br />
					Intuitively, we can say that the verb is <em>drive</em>, of 
					course, but a little thought reveals that the meaning is 
					encapsulated in the phrase <em>drive on</em> which has a 
					rather different and extended meaning.&nbsp; There is a

				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em><strong>Mary </strong><span class="style_underline">
				<strong>walked around </strong></span><strong>the village for a while</strong></em><ol>
					<li><strong>Does replacing the particle change the meaning 
					of the verb?</strong><br />
					No, replacing the particle does not change the meaning 
					of the verb, because:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary walked to the village</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary walked past the village<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary walked towards the village</em><br />
					still mean that the verb is <em>go on foot</em>.&nbsp; 
					Changing the preposition has no effect on the meaning of the 
					verb.</li>
					<li><strong>Can you make a passive?</strong><br />
					No, we cannot make a passive and most people will not accept:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The village was walked around for a while by Mary</em></li>
					<li><strong>Can you stress the particle or use a weak form?</strong><br />
					No, the stress would not usually fall on <em>around</em>. 
					unless we have a good reason to emphasise the preposition 
					(by, for example, contrasting it with <em>to</em>).</li>
					<li>Can you move the phrase around?<br />
					Yes.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the village Mary walked for a while</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a while Mary walked around the village<br />
					</em>and we can also produce a cleft sentence to get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It was around the village that Mary walked.</em></li>
					<li><strong>What is the question asking?</strong><ol class="auto-style30">
						<li><strong>Does the question ask what or who?</strong><br />No.</li>
						<li><strong>Does the question ask where or when?</strong><br />Yes, it asks<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did Mary walk</em><br />or<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long did Mary walk?</em><br />and the answers are<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; around the village<br />
						</em>and<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for a while</em>.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Is the particle part of the question?</strong><br />
					No, the particle is not part of the question.&nbsp; The question would usually be:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did Mary walk?</em><br />
					not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Where did Mary walk around?</em></li>
					<li><strong>Can you insert an adverb?</strong><br />
					Yes.&nbsp; We can insert any number of adverbs:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary walked happily around the village for a while<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary walked around the village lazily for a while<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary walked curiously around the village for a while</em><br />
					and so on.</li>
					<li><strong>Can we discover a one-word alternative?</strong><br />
					Not easily.&nbsp; We can replace the verb and have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary sauntered / strolled / ran / galloped around the village</em><br />
					and we can replace the preposition and have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary walked all over / into / to / past the village for a 
					while</em><br />
					but there is no one-word replacement for <em>walk around</em>.</li>
					<li><strong>What actually is the verb?</strong><br />
					Here again we need to think about meaning and when we do, 
					it's clear that the only action being described is <em>walk</em>.&nbsp; 
					Everything else in the clause is simply telling us where and 
					when.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em><strong>Peter <span class="style_underline">abstained 
				from</span> the vote</strong></em><ol>
					<li><strong>Does replacing the particle change the meaning 
					of the verb?</strong><br />
					Yes, replacing the particle actually makes an ungrammatical 
					clause because the only preposition which is possible is 
					from.&nbsp; If we replace it, we get nonsense as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Peter abstained to the vote.</em></li>
					<li><strong>Can you make a passive?</strong><br />
					No, we cannot usually make a sensible passive with this sort 
					of combination.&nbsp; Most would not accept, therefore:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The vote was abstained from by Peter</em><br />
					This test is not definitive with many verbs of this nature, 
					however because we may, for example, accept:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?My help was relied on<br />
					</em>although it somewhat unusual and clumsy.</li>
					<li><strong>Can you stress the particle or use a weak form?</strong><br />
					No, so this test is failed.&nbsp; We would not normally 
					stress the preposition <em>from</em> in our example sentence 
					and the preposition (for that is what it is) would take its 
					weakened form and be pronounced as /frəm/ rather than /frɒm/.</li>
					<li><strong>Can you move the phrase around?</strong><br />
					Just possibly, although most people will suspicious of:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; ?From the vote Peter abstained<br />
					</em>and with other verbs like this, although it is an 
					unusual way to phrase the clause, we can move the 
					prepositional adverbial phrase and allow, grammatically, at 
					least:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?On my help, everyone relied<br />
					</em>We can also allow a cleft sentence so, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was on my help that everyone 
					relied</em><br />
					is permitted.<br />
					This doesn't always work, however, because few would accept:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?It was from the vote that Peter 
					abstained.</em></li>
					<li><strong>What is the question asking?</strong><ol class="auto-style30">
						<li><strong>Does the question ask what or who?</strong><br />Yes, it asks:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did he abstain from?</em><br />and the answer is 
						<em>the vote</em>.<br />The alternative question could be:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who abstained from the vote?<br />
						</em>and that will evince:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter did.</em></li>
						<li><strong>Does the question ask where or when?</strong><br />No.&nbsp; The question could be:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did Peter abstain?</em><br />but that will not get the answer:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The vote.<br /></em>And the question:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When did Peter abstain?<br />
						</em>does not allow the answer:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The vote</em><br />at all.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Is the particle part of the question?</strong><br />
					Yes, the particle is part of the question which asks:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did Peter abstain from?</em><br />
					and the answer is<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the vote</em>.<br />
					But we cannot ask<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; What did Peter 
					abstain?</em></li>
					<li><strong>Can you insert an adverb?</strong><br />
					Perilously.&nbsp; We could, perhaps accept:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Peter abstained reluctantly from the 
					vote</em><br />
					but we would probably prefer:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter abstained from the vote 
					reluctantly.</em></li>
					<li><strong>Can we discover a one-word alternative?</strong><br />
					No.&nbsp; There is no one-word equivalent of <em>abstain 
					from.</em></li>
					<li><strong>What actually is the verb?</strong><br />
					Here again we need to think about meaning.<br />
					Intuitively, we can say that the verb is <em>abstain</em>, 
					of course, but we saw above that the question will contain 
					the preposition <em>from</em>.&nbsp; The preposition 
					actually adds nothing to the meaning of the verb at all 
					(unlike examples A and B) but the collocation is very 
					strong.&nbsp; In response, for example, unless the object is 
					known and assumed, a statement such as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter abstained<br />
					</em>will commonly evince<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From what?<br />
					</em>as a response.</li>

			<h4>Conclusions:</h4>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em><strong>sort out</strong></em> is a multi-word verb.&nbsp; It is, in 
				fact, a separable, transitive phrasal verb.</li>
				<li><em><strong>drive on</strong></em> is also a multi-word verb.&nbsp; It is, in 
				fact an intransitive (and, therefore, inseparable) phrasal verb.</li>
				<li><em><strong>around the village</strong></em> and <em>
				<strong>for a while</strong></em> are 
				both adverbial adjuncts.&nbsp; In this case, they are 
				prepositional phrases which do not affect the meaning of the 
				verb.&nbsp; There is no multi-word verb <em>walk around</em>.&nbsp; 
				That is just a verb post-modified by an adverbial.</li>
				<li><strong><em>abstain from</em></strong> meets some of the 
				tests for a multi-word verb but not all of them so it seems to 
				occupy a rather uncomfortable zone between a true multi-word 
				verb such as <em>sort out</em> and verb plus a prepositional phrase 
				adverbial such as <em>walk around XXX</em>.<br />
				It is, in fact, a form of multi-word verb but it is not a 
				phrasal verb.&nbsp; In this guide it will be analysed as a 
				prepositional verb but others will call it a verb with a 
				dependent preposition.</li>

		<p>For 
		example, one site describes <em>walk into a trap</em> as a phrasal verb.&nbsp; 
		Another site describes <em>run after the bus</em> as a phrasal verb.<br />
		These are not examples of phrasal verbs.&nbsp; They aren't even prepositional verbs.&nbsp; They are simply 
		the verbs <em>walk</em> and <em>run</em> followed by a prepositional phrase (<em>into a 
		trap, after the bus</em>).&nbsp; This may be a slightly metaphorical use of <em>walk </em>
		but that's another matter altogether.&nbsp; 
		Many particles can be either prepositions or adverbs and therein 
		lies the source of much confusion.<br />
		We can change the prepositions without affecting the basic meaning of 
		the verb in any way.<em>&nbsp; </em>For example, we can have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walk 
		along the path<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walk around the town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walk into a room<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walk over a hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run behind the bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run in front of the bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run 
		alongside the bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run past the bus<br />
		</em>etc.</p>
		<p>Other examples from a website for learners which claims to explain 56 
		common phrasal verbs (some of which are not at all common and some of 
		which are not phrasal verbs) are<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fall down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go ahead<br />
		</em>and<em><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		log into<br />
		</em>The first and second of those are simply verbs 
		being modified by adverbs and we can just as easily have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drop down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; climb down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walk down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stroll down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run ahead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drive ahead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throw ahead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look ahead</em><br />
		and so on where the adverb is not altering the meaning of the verb.&nbsp; 
		Even the expression:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead!</em><br />
		meaning<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please continue<br />
		</em>is simply a slightly figurative use of 
		the adverb which needs no special treatment once the meaning of the 
		adverb <em>ahead</em> has been grasped.<br />
		The third example, <em>log into</em>, is even worse because it is just a 
		verb followed by a preposition which needs a complement such as <em>the 
		site</em>.&nbsp; Even when we make the preposition into an adverb and 
		just have <em>log in</em> or <em>log on</em>, it remains a simple verb plus adverb 
		combination so we can also have:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; log out<br />
		</em>or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; log off<br />
		</em>without changing the 
		meaning of the rather unusual verb.&nbsp; In fact, the word <em>into</em> is a preposition 
		and is so defined in dictionaries.<br />
		None is a phrasal verb so the site's admonition to learners to remember 
		these expressions as if they were phrasal verbs is unhelpful and 
		confusing, not to say time wasting, careless and borderline 
		irresponsible.</p>
		<p>By the same token, something like<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John ran in</em><br />
		is not a phrasal verb, it is simply a verb modified by an adverb of 
		place so we could equally well have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John ran out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John ran away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John ran by</em><br />
		all with simple adverb modifiers which do not affect the meaning of <em>
		run</em> at all.&nbsp; We can also, incidentally, have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John ran yesterday</em><br />
		and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John ran often</em><br />
		or just<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John ran</em><br />
		<br />
		However, when we encounter<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The police ran in John</em><br />
		or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police ran John in</em><br />
		it is clear that the meaning of <em>run</em> has been radically altered 
		(to mean <em>arrest and take into custody</em>) by the adverb particle 
		and we are, therefore, dealing with a phrasal verb because changing <em>
		in</em> or removing the particle will change the meaning of <em>run</em>.&nbsp; 
		We cannot say<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police ran over John</em><br />
		and retain the same meaning of <em>run.</em><br />
		We can apply our test 9 here.&nbsp; The question is, 
		can we find a one-word equivalent for the meaning?<br />
		To some extent we can so, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John <span class="style_underline">ran away</span></em><br />
		could be replaced by<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John <span class="style_underline">fled</span></em><br />
		but the sense of <em>run</em> is lost.<br />
		Replacing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>John <span class="style_underline">ran out</span></em><br />
		with a single-word alternative is not possible, however and we need to 
		resort to something like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>John left, running<br />
		</em>However, with:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police ran John in</em><br />
		we can replace the verb and produce<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police arrested John</em><br />
		and retain the meaning (but not the style).</p>

			<p>Don't believe everything you read.</p>
		<p>Here are some other bits of misinformation from around the web.&nbsp; 
		You may encounter phrases such as these analysed, if that's the word, as 
		phrasal verbs:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>I tried to do the crossword but <strong>got 
		stuck<br /></strong></em>No<em>.&nbsp; </em>That's the verb <em>get</em> used as a copular verb to 
			connect the subject to the adjective <em>stuck.&nbsp; </em>Compare, 
			e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got lost.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They got angry.</em></li>
				<li><em>I'm trying to </em><strong><em>get 
		rid</em></strong><em> of this cold<br /></em>No.&nbsp; That's similar with the verb 
				<em>get</em> again meaning <em>become</em> and the adjective <em>rid</em>.&nbsp; The adjective is 
			derived from the verb <em>rid</em>, incidentally because it was 
				originally an irregular verb which did not change its form when 
				used as a past participle.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have got free of debt.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are rid of visitors.</em></li>
				<li><em>He<strong> is about to</strong> phone her now<br /></em>No.&nbsp; This is the marginal modal auxiliary verb 
				<em>be about </em>which is 
			followed by the <em>to-</em>infinitive.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She means to see the doctor.</em></li>
				<li><em>She <strong>got in touch</strong> with me<br /></em>No.&nbsp; This is the verb 
				<em>get </em>meaning<em> become, move </em>or<em> 
			achieve </em>followed by a prepositional phrase.&nbsp; Compare, 
			e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got in contact with me.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got in the bath.<br />
				</em>In this case, too, we can replace the preposition <em>in</em> 
				with <em>into</em> (which is always prepositional and not 
				adverbial).<br />
				The use of the verb <em>get</em> in this case is metaphorical 
				but metaphor is not a marker of a multi-word verb.</li>
				<li><em>The party </em><strong><em>takes place</em></strong><em> 
		on Thursday<br /></em>No.&nbsp; This is a slightly tricky idiom but the word 
				<em>place</em> 
			is a noun, not an adverb or preposition.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's swap places.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The investigation is in place</em>.<br />etc.</li>
			</ol>
		<p>They aren't phrasal or prepositional verbs, of course.&nbsp; Only one, the fourth, even contains a 
		prepositional phrase and none contains an adverb.</p>

			<p>You may be thinking that this is all very complicated and 
			difficult, but there is a key.&nbsp; It is to analyse the 
			expressions carefully and decide if we are dealing with a 
			combination of verb plus particle which represents a single verbal 
			process or whether we are dealing with a verb modified by an adjunct 
			(either an adverb or a prepositional phrase).<br />
			To labour the point, because it is an important one, here are some 
			more examples:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>She ran up a huge bill</strong></em><br />
				Here we are dealing with a single verbal process expressing her 
				behaviour.&nbsp; We cannot remove the particle and we cannot 
				remove the object because the verb is stubbornly transitive.&nbsp; 
				It is a true transitive multi-word verb and, more specifically, 
				a phrasal verb.<br />

				</li>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>She ran up the hill</strong></em><br />
				Here we are dealing with a verb + a prepositional phrase which 
				acts as an adjunct, modifying how we see the verb <em>run</em>.&nbsp; 
				We can remove the adjunct and leave a sensible and well-formed 
				clause.&nbsp; We can also replace it with a huge range of other 
				adjuncts, prepositional and adverbial to produce:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran down the road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran frantically<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran home<br />

				<li><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The butterfly sucks up the nectar 
				from the flowers</strong></em><strong><br />
				</strong>This is more difficult because, on the face of things we have an 
				adjunct but a moment's thought reveals that the process is the 
				verb <em>suck up</em> and <em>the nectar</em> is the object of 
				the verb.&nbsp; We do have an adjunct in the phrase <em>from the 
				flowers</em>, of course.&nbsp; This is a phrasal verb, albeit 
				one whose meaning is reasonably transparent because of the 
				simple meaning of the adverb <em>up.<br />
				</em>It may be analysed as:<em><table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">

				</em>In this case, it is difficult to 
				discover a one-word equivalent for the phrasal verb, 
				incidentally.</li>
				<li><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I slept in this morning</strong></em><strong><br />
				</strong>In this case, it is tempting to see <em>sleep in</em> as an 
				intransitive multi-word verb.&nbsp; However, it is actually a 
				verb plus an adverb adjunct, <em>in</em>.&nbsp; It could be 
				replaced with a small range of other adverbs such as <em>deeply, 
				late</em> 
				or <em>soundly</em> which collocate with <em>sleep</em> but the 
				verb itself will remain untouched in terms of basic meaning.<br />

				<li><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They set up the new system</strong></em><br />
				Here, we just need to look for the process and it is clear that 
				it is the phrasal verb <em>set up</em> which means something 
				like <em>establish</em> (or, in other environments, <em>build</em> 
				or <em>erect</em>).&nbsp; The question would be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did they set up?</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did they set?<br />

				</li>
				<li><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They dropped out of the team</strong><br />
				</em>This is a more complicated case because we have both 
				systems operating together.<br />
				Firstly, we have a phrasal verb, <em>drop out</em>, meaning 
				something like <em>abandon</em> or <em>stop participating in</em>.&nbsp; 
				It is a true phrasal verb because it will remain in part of any 
				question and it is possible to find a one-word equivalent.&nbsp; 
				It passes the nine tests we set up above.<br />
				We can compare it to, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She dropped it out of the window</em><br />
				which is the stand-alone verb <em>drop</em> plus a prepositional 
				phrase adverbial adjunct <em>out of the window</em>.&nbsp; The 
				fact that the preposition consists of two words (<em>out of</em>) should not 
				disturb us.<br />
				Secondly, we have the prepositional phrase, <em>of the team</em>, 
				which is an adjunct modifying the verb <em>drop out</em>.&nbsp; 
				The verb collocates very strongly with the preposition <em>of</em> 
				so we can classify the whole multi-word unit as constituting a 
				phrasal-prepositional verb and those are analysed below.<br />
				It may be analysed as:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style216" style="width: 33%">Subject</td>

					</tr>
				</table>
				</li>
				<li><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They talked about their 
				experiences<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They talked over the problem</em><br />
				</strong>Here, we have two examples of different kinds on verb 
				uses<br />
				The clauses can be analysed like this:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style216" style="width: 33%">Subject</td>
						<td class="auto-style243" style="width: 33%">Verb phrase</td>
						<td class="auto-style237" style="width: 33%">Adverbial</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style125" style="width: 33%"><em>They</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style129" style="width: 33%"><em>talked</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style130" style="width: 33%"><em>about 
						their experiences</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				and it's clear that we can insert other prepositional phrases 
				with altering the meaning of the verb so we could also have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They talked in French<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They talked of their ambitions</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				However, with the second example, we have encountered a phrasal 
				verb because the verb <em>talk</em> and the adverb <em>over</em> 
				have combined to form a new meaning.&nbsp; The analysis is, 
				therefore:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style216" style="width: 33%">Subject</td>
						<td class="auto-style243" style="width: 33%">Verb phrase</td>

			<p>Poor analysis often results in inflating the category of multi-word 
		verbs to the point where extremely long lists can be produced which 
		contain some legitimate examples but many others which do not belong.&nbsp; 
		This means that learners become intimidated and teachers become 
			overloaded by the need (so it is perceived) to teach and learn an 
		enormous number of language chunks which are much more easily handled by 
		taking a more analytic approach and breaking things down logically.</p>
			<p>One well-known website intended to help learners of English lists 
			170 combinations which, the poor students are told, are the <strong>minimum</strong> 
			they need to learn for successful communication.&nbsp; A brief 
			analysis of the list shows, in fact, that only around half are 
			really multi-word verbs at all and the rest are mostly combinations 
			of verbs and one-word adverbs which do not affect the verb's 
			meaning.&nbsp; Some are prepositions, too, and one or two, such as
			<em>look forward to </em>are idiomatic expressions which are phrases 
			but not phrasal verbs.</p>
			<p>You may think this is just a minor problem because lots of people 
			can't do very good language analysis and that's true but bad 
			analysis like this has implications for learners which are not good.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It means that learners are misled about what constitutes a 
				learnable phrase and what constitutes just a verb plus an 
				adverb.<br />
				If as a learner of English you encounter, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put the fire out</em><br />
				you would be right to think something like:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; This 
				means that <em>put</em> plus <em>out</em> takes on a new meaning 
				(something like <em>extinguish</em></span>)<br />
				and you would be wholly correct and quite wise to try to learn 
				the verb <em>put out</em> as having something to do with <em>
				fire</em> and <em>flames</em>.<br />
				If, on the other hand, you come across:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put the cat out</em><br />
				you would be unwise to try to learn <em>put out</em> as a verb 
				which has anything to do with cats.&nbsp; You would be much 
				wiser to realise that <em>put</em> has its normal meaning and 
				the adverb <em>out</em> simply tells us where the cat was put.<br />
				(Of course, if the cat in question was on fire ...)</li>
				<li>The second problem follows on and is to do with loading 
				learners with unnecessary problems and memorisation tasks.<br />
				If you tell students that <em>walk back, walk away, walk out, 
				talk about, talk in</em> 
				etc. are all phrasal verbs, then they will try to remember them 
				separately (as you should with real phrasal verbs) but you will 
				be wasting your time because you already know the meaning of <em>
				walk</em> and <em>talk</em> and the meanings of <em>ba<span class="auto-style11">ck, 
				about, in, 
				away</span></em> and <em>out</em> so there is nothing new to 
				learn and you can get on with learning something useful.<br />
				Equally, if you tell your students that a verb + any prepositional phrase, any 
		adverb or 
		any particle (or, even, an adjective) is a 
		phrasal verb, they will think they have to learn it as a unit.&nbsp; They will 
		then be 
		stuck with learning lots of 'verbs' which aren't verbs at all but simply 
		combinations of verbs and prepositional phrases or verbs modified by 
		adverbs.&nbsp; It's like teaching people 
		that <em>turn right</em> and <em>turn left</em> are examples of two different verbs 
		or <em>eat butter</em> and <em>spread butter </em>contain examples of two 
		different nouns.<br />
		You will be denying the learners the opportunity properly to analyse 
		what they are learning and notice how prepositional phrases and adverbs are used in 
		English.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Misleading learners is not forgiveable and made worse if 
			the misleading results in an extra and unnecessary learning load.</strong></p>
			<p>That is not to say that learning a collocating language chunk such as <em>run away</em>, 
		meaning <em>flee</em>, is not useful but it bears repeating that any 
		common combination of verbs and modifiers is not necessarily a phrasal 
		or multi-word verb.&nbsp; The word <em>lots</em>, for example, 
		collocates very strongly with the preposition <em>of</em> and so <em>
		lots of </em>is a useful, learnable language chunk but it is not in 
		itself a determiner.&nbsp; If it is treated as such then the category of 
		determiner becomes inflated to include <em>less of, little of, few of, 
		many of, some of, none of, all of</em> and so on.&nbsp; That would be an 
		unacceptable analysis which will overload learners uselessly.</p>

				<h2>Clause constituents</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table><p>Briefly, if the term is unfamiliar to you, clause 
			constituents are phrases or single lexemes within a clause that 
			perform a single, identifiable grammatical function.</p>
			<p>So, for example, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John changed money yesterday</em><br />
			we have four constituents:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style39">
				<li><em>John</em>: a single proper noun performing the 
				grammatical role of subject</li>
				<li><em>changed</em>: a past form of a verb performing a verb's 
				usual function of denoting an event or state</li>
				<li><em>money</em>: a single mass noun performing the 
				grammatical role of object</li>
				<li><em>yesterday</em>: a single common noun performing the 
				grammatical role of adverbial time adjunct</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Equally, we can have a sentence such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;John, the manager, and his elderly mother will have 
			changed a considerable amount of money by this time tomorrow</em><br />
			and we still have only four clause constituents:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style39">
				<li> <em>John, the manager, and his elderly mother</em>: a noun 
				phrase with the first noun in apposition to another and the second noun pre-modified by an adjective performing the grammatical role of subject</li>
				<li><em>will have changed</em>: a verb phrase with two auxiliary 
				verbs and a main verb performing a verb's usual function of 
				denoting an event or state</li>
				<li><em>a considerable amount of money</em>: a noun phrase 
				pre-modified by a quantifying expression and post modified by a 
				genitive<em> of</em> phrase performing the grammatical role of 
				object</li>
				<li><em>by this time tomorrow</em>: an adverbial phrase of time 
				performing the grammatical role of adverbial adjunct</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Identifying clause constituents in the realm of multi-word verbs 
			is a helpful way of identifying what part of the clause is doing 
			what and helping us not to fall into the traps we have discussed 
			above.&nbsp; It works like this:</p>
		
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="1" height="67" src="../../../gfx/1red.png" width="100" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style27">
				<h3>What is <span class="style_underline"><em>not</em></span> a 
				multi-word verb phrase</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>These three sentences do not contain multi-word verbs:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="1" height="94" src="../../imagesgraphics/mwv_not1.png" width="465" /><br />
			so, <em>arrive at</em> is not a multi-word verb and the preposition
			<em>at</em> is not part of the verb phrase.&nbsp; It is part of the 
			prepositional-phrase adverbial.<br />
			<img alt="2" height="95" src="../../imagesgraphics/mwv_not2.png" width="465" /><br />
			so, <em>call back</em> is not a multi-word verb and the adverb <em>
			back</em> is not part of the verb phrase because it is an 
			independent constituent of the clause modifying the verb <em>call</em> 
			whose base meaning is not altered.&nbsp; It can be omitted and still

			so, the adverb <em>back </em>may be moved but still is not part of

			and left out altogether as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man complained<br />

			<p>The following are, indubitably examples of multi-word verbs, 
			however:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="5" height="94" src="../../imagesgraphics/mwv_phrasal_intrans.png" width="465" /><br />
			because the adverb <em>off</em> is an integral part of the 
			verb-phrase constituent.&nbsp; If it is omitted, the sentence 
			carries no meaning and is ungrammatical.<br />
			<img alt="6" height="105" src="../../imagesgraphics/mwv_phrasal_trans.png" width="620" /><br />
			because the adverb <em>up</em> is part of the verb-phrase 
			constituent.&nbsp; If it is omitted, the sentence carries no meaning 
			and is ungrammatical.<br />
			<img alt="7" height="100" src="../../imagesgraphics/mwv_phrasal_trans2.png" width="620" /><br />
			because even when it is split from the first part of the phrase, the 
			adverb <em>up</em> remains part of the verb-phrase constituent.&nbsp; 
			If it is omitted, the sentence carries no meaning and is 
			ungrammatical.<br />
			<img alt="8" height="100" src="../../imagesgraphics/mwv_phrasal_trans3.png" width="620" /><br />
			and it does so again here because the only change is to use a single 
			pronoun to stand for <em>the number</em>.&nbsp; Nothing else has 
			changed.<br />
			<img alt="9" height="93" src="../../imagesgraphics/mwv_phrasal_prepositional.png" width="465" /><br />
			because we clearly have an integrated verb and adverb forming the 
			verb phrase followed by a simple prepositional phrase.&nbsp; The key 
			here is that the preposition <em>to</em> belongs with <em>the truth</em> 
			not with the verb-phrase constituent.<br />
			However, as with prepositional verbs, the preposition <em>to</em> is 
			very strongly associated with the phrasal verb <em>face up</em> and 
			the expression <em>face up to</em> is a learnable chunk.&nbsp; That 
			does not influence the analysis, because we are talking about a 
			teachable unit not clause constituent analysis.</p>

		<p>This nasty expression refers to the fact that it is sometimes quite 
		difficult to pin down a word's word class.&nbsp; We can rarely tell by 
		looking at a word in isolation which word class it belongs to so, for 
		example, <em>bank</em> is a verb in<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bank in the High Street</em><br />
		and a noun in<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went to the bank</em><br />
		and the same phenomenon is apparent with thousands of other words in 
		most languages.</p>
		<p>The phenomenon is particularly noticeable with particles in 
		multi-word verbs and that leads to the difficulties looked at in the 
		last section because many common adverbs are also prepositions in other 
		environments and <em>vice versa</em>.<br />
		The eleven most common particles in multi-word verbs are:</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><strong>around, at, away, down, in, off, on, out, 
		over, round, up</strong></p>
		<p>and all bar the preposition <em>at</em> and the adverb <em>away</em> 
		may be prepositions or adverbs depending on their grammatical function 
		in a clause.&nbsp; Like this:</p>

		<p>The words <em>into</em> and <em>onto </em>do not appear in this list because 
		they never 
		function as adverbs.&nbsp; They are prepositions.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He brushed the paint on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pushed the drawer in</em><br />
		and the words <em>on</em> and <em>in</em> are functioning as adverbs 
		telling us a bit about the verb.<br />
		We can also have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He brushed the paint onto the door frame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pushed the drawer into the desk</em><br />
		and the words <em>onto </em>and <em>into</em> are prepositions.<br />
		However, we cannot have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He brushed the paint onto<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He pushed the drawer into</em><br />
		because neither word can function adverbially.</p>
			<p>The list of words which some describe as prepositional adverbs 
			(i.e., those that can perform both functions) is:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">aboard, about, above, across, after, against, 
			along, alongside, around, before, behind, below, beneath, besides, 
			between, beyond, by, down, for, in, inside, near, notwithstanding, 
			off, on, opposite, outside, over, past, round, since, through, 
			throughout, under, underneath, up, within, without</p>
			<p>and they can all modify a verb without, necessarily, producing a 
			phrasal verb.<br />
			In some analyses, the distinction between adverbs and prepositions 
			is not maintained in this way.&nbsp; In that view, the words in the list above 
			are simple intransitive prepositions (or prepositions which allow 
			intransitive use).&nbsp; This is a defensible analysis because it is 
			consistent with defining the noun phrase as the object of the 
			preposition rather than its complement.</p>
			<p>A test to see which grammatical function a word is performing is to 
		add a complement (or object, if you prefer) to the word.&nbsp; If it's 
		possible to do so, you have probably identified a preposition because 
		adverbs do not take complements or objects.&nbsp; So for example, we can 
		have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He came over</em><br />
		and that's an adverb modifying the verb<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came over the road</em><br />
		and that's a preposition with its complement / object <em>the road</em> telling us where 
		he came.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to phrasal verbs as we shall see, the 
		picture is not so clear so while in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;He gave up the job</em><br />
		it looks as if we have a preposition, <em>up</em>, with a complement,
		<em>the job</em>, but that is not the case because here the word is an 
		adverb which combines with the verb <em>give</em> to form a new verb <em>
		give up</em> (meaning <em>abandon</em>) and <em>the job</em> is the 
		object of the verb <em>give up</em>, not a complement or object of a preposition.<br />
		In our analysis, this is a key factor in assigning verbs to the 
		categories of phrasal verbs (verbs combining with adverbs) and 
		prepositional verbs (verbs followed by prepositions).</p>
		<p>Another key test is to try replacing the particle with a different one or 
		removing the particle altogether to 
		see if the sense of the verb has altered.&nbsp; If it has, we are 
		dealing with an adverb combining with the verb to form a phrasal verb.&nbsp; 
		If it hasn't, the particle is prepositional.&nbsp; So, for example, 
		changing the particle in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked slowly up the stairs</em><br />
		to make<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked slowly down the stairs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked slowly along the stairs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked slowly by the stairs</em><br />
		etc. has no effect at all on the meaning of <em>walk</em>.<br />
		However, changing the particle in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put off the meeting</em><br />
		to make<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put down the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put into the meeting</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He put along the meeting</em><br />
		or leaving the particle out to make:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He put the meeting</em><br />
		etc. either changes the meaning of the verb or makes nonsense.</p>
			<p>A final test is to spot the stressed forms.&nbsp; Adverbs are 
			usually stressed but prepositions are not.&nbsp; We get, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He talked of his childhood</em><br />
			in which <em>of</em> is unstressed and pronounced as /əv/ but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did he talk of?</em><br />
			in which <em>of</em> is in its full form and stressed as /ɒv/.</p>
		<p>There are times when two or more adverb particles are possible 
		without a change in meaning so we can have, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They fell around laughing</em><br />
		or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They fell about laughing<br />
		</em>and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They set off early</em><br />
		or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They set out early</em><br />
		with little discernible difference in meaning although in both cases the 
		particles are adverbs.<br />
		Fortunately, this is quite rare.</p>

		</table>
			<p>Now we are ready to begin the analysis proper.&nbsp; The 
			following summarises the story so far and more detail follows.</p>
			<ol>
			<li><strong>Phrasal verbs</strong><br />
			The adverb particle changes the meaning of the verb and the change 
			is often non-literal, i.e., idiomatic.&nbsp; For example, adding the adverb <em>
			down</em> to the verb <em>turn</em> produces the new meaning of <em>
			decline</em> (an offer).&nbsp; 
			Prepositions do not do that.<br />
			Nor, as we saw above do all adverbs.&nbsp; Only adverb particles 
			vary the meaning of the verb.&nbsp; We saw above, and will see 
			again, for example, that the adverb <em>back</em> does not always change the 
			meaning of the verb it follows.&nbsp; Nor, incidentally does an 
			adverb like <em>away</em> which simply means <em>to a distance from</em>.&nbsp; 
			So, although:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked away</em><br />
			looks like a phrasal verb, it is not because the adverb is just 
			telling us the direction in which he walked and not interfering with 
			the meaning of <em>walk</em> at all.&nbsp; By the same token, we can 
			have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They strolled away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It flew away</em><br />
			and many more examples of a one-word adverb modifying but not 
			changing the meaning of the verb.&nbsp; If we call all these 
			examples phrasal 
			verbs, we will be adding hundreds if not thousands of verbs 
			to a list which is long enough to depress many learners and teachers 
			already.<br />
			Even a metaphorical use of the verb does not magically result in a 
			phrasal verb so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked away with first prize</em> (<em>won 
			easily</em>)<br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran away with the game</em> (<em>became 
			unbeatable</em>)<br />
			are not really phrasal verbs but are, as we shall see, metaphorical 
			uses of a verb plus an adverb.<br />
			However, when the meaning of the verb changes, we have encountered a 
			real phrasal verb so, while, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave the money away</em><br />
			is comprehensible by understanding the meaning of <em>away</em> as 
			and adverb meaning <em>movement to a more distant place</em>, so it 
			is not a phrasal verb.&nbsp; It is possible in this case, to find a 
			one-word alternative (using test 9) so we could have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He donated his money</em><br />
			but that does not carry quite the same sense because the verb is 
			usually followed by a prepositional phrase complement (such as <em>
			to charity</em>).<br />
			If we try to do that with<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave the secret away</em><br />
			we can see that the meaning of the verb has changed
			because the meaning of <em>give</em> and the meaning of <em>away</em> 
			have combined to make a new meaning (<em>revealed</em>).&nbsp; That 
			is a real phrasal verb.</li>
			<li><strong>Prepositional verbs</strong><br />
			Prepositions link the verb to a noun phrase but the choice of 
			preposition is strongly determined by the verb (which is why they 
			are sometimes called verbs with dependent prepositions).&nbsp; They do not 
			change the meaning of the verb.<br />
			For example, adding the 
			preposition <em>about</em> to the verb <em>hear</em> does not change 
			the nature of the verb:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard about the disaster<br />
			</em>and changing the preposition will leave the verb's meaning 
			unchanged<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard of the disaster<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard from his parents<br />
			</em>Some of these verbs allow of only one preposition as is the 
			case, for example, with:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She relied on his help<br />
			</em>in which no other preposition is possible.<br />
			Some of these verbs, as we shall see, require complementation and 
			cannot stand without a prepositional phrase.</li>
			<li><strong>Phrasal-prepositional verbs</strong><br />
			The adverb particle changes the meaning of the verb <strong>and</strong> 
			the preposition links the verb to a noun phrase.&nbsp; For example, 
			adding the adverb <em>up </em>and the preposition <em>with </em>to<em> 
			put</em> changes the meaning of the verb <strong>and </strong>links 
			it to the noun phrase:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He couldn't put up with their noise any 
			longer<br />
			</em>(verb + adverb, making a phrasal verb, followed by 
			a prepositional phrase)<br />
			Later, some doubt will be cast on whether this is a real category or 
			a phrasal verb followed by a strongly collocating preposition.</li>
			</ol>
		<p>Here's a summary of that with examples:</p>

		<p>If the multi-word verb isn't a prepositional verb then it's either a phrasal 
		verb or a phrasal-prepositional verb.&nbsp; To know which it is, we need 
		to look at how it's used.<br />
		<a name="4"></a>In this area, we need to consider 5 constituents of the 
		clause:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>The subject (either a pronoun or a noun phrase such as <em>She</em> 
			or <em>The old man</em>)</li>
			<li>Verb phrases such as <em>pushed</em></li>
			<li>The particle, which can be an adverb or a preposition, such as <em>
			up, for, away, over </em>etc.</li>
			<li>Object nouns such as <em>the lever, the boat </em>etc.</li>
			<li>Object pronouns such as <em>it, them </em>etc.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For our purposes, we can ignore the subject.<br />
		Given that we place the subject and the main verb first in the clause, there are, 
		in English, only 4 possible arrangements of particles and objects 
		to finish the clause.<br />
		See if you can arrange the following to make a well-formed English 
		sentence:<br />
		<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He + the + lever + up + 
		pushed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He + it + for + pushed<br />

			<p>Before we get too excited about the fact that a pronoun 
			must be placed between the verb and the adverb particle, we need to 
			consider that this is not something unusual or unique to phrasal 
			verbs.&nbsp; Pronouns frequently appear in this medial position when 
			a verb is modified by an adverb.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove the car quickly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove it quickly<br />
			</em>but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She drove quickly it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He writes emails frequently<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He writes them frequently<br />
			</em>but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He writes frequently them<br />
			</em>We can see the same pattern with hundreds of other perfectly 
			normal adverbs modifying transitive verbs.&nbsp; Not even the 
			wildest websites will suggest that <em>drive quickly</em> and <em>
			write frequently</em> are phrasal or multi-word verbs.</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>Simply noticing the fact that the 
			pronoun must come between the verb and the adverb does not mean that 
			you have found a phrasal verb.</strong></p>
			<p>However, a better test is possible by looking at the ordering of 
			constituents of a clause.<br />
			So, for example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style180" colspan="4">Verb + modifying 
					adverb</td>
				</tr>

			<p>And you can see that a phrasal verb, properly understood, allows 
			pattern 3. whereas a simple verb + modifying adverb normally does 
			not.<br />
			If we apply this test to a range of verbs + adverbs we discover, for 
			example, that an expressions like <em>call back, move about, drive 
			ahead, push under, pull over </em>etc. cannot be seen in 
			pattern 3. so are not phrasal verbs <em>per se</em> because:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She called back the garage</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She moved about the furniture<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He drove ahead the car</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He pushed under the suitcase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He pulled over his scarf</em><br />
			are not available, but <em>call off</em> is a phrasal verb because 
			we can happily form:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She called off the meeting.</em></p>
			<p>This is not, we hasten to add, a defining characteristic of the 
			two forms but it is a clear indication.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, of course, simple verbs plus prepositional phrases 
			such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got on the bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They fell over the carpet</em><br />
			etc. can also be used in pattern 3.
			but this does not mean that <em>get on</em> and <em>fell over</em> 
			are phrasal verbs.&nbsp; They aren't; they are verbs followed by 
			prepositional adverbial phrases and we can just as well have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She climbed on the bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stepped onto the bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They tripped over the carpet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They stumbled over the carpet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got off the bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got in front of the bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They fell onto the carpet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They fell across the carpet</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			You can see, too, that <em>on</em> in all cases can be replaced with
			<em>onto</em> and that word is <strong>only</strong> prepositional.</p>
			<p>Now we can go on to look at which patterns are associated with which 
		forms of multi-word verbs.</p>

		<p>This guide uses the term prepositional verbs for this category of 
		multi-word verbs.&nbsp; Others may refer to them as verbs with dependent 
		prepositions because the verbs are normally associated with particular 
		prepositions.&nbsp; Others still may call these verbs strongly 
		collocating verb-preposition pairs.</p>
			<p>We need to be careful to distinguish between a verb followed by a 
			prepositional phrase in the normal way of English syntax and those 
			which are, so to speak, primed to accept only one preposition (or, 
			at most, a very limited range) in the syntax of the language.<br />
			This is a facet of a phenomenon called <strong>colligation</strong> 
			to which there is a guide on this site (linked below).<br />
			We can, for example have both:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He flew from London</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He suffered from a cold</em><br />
			but a moment's thought reveals the difference because</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We can analyse the first sentence as:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subject (<em>he</em>) + verb (<em>flew</em>) and 
				prepositional phrase (<em>from London</em></span>)<br />
				but the second sentence can only be analysed as:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subject (<em>he</em>) + verb (<em>suffered) </em>+ 
				dependent preposition (<em>from</em>) + object (<em>a cold</em>)</span>.</li>
				<li>We can also have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He flew to London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He flew over London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He flew across London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He flew into London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He flew at six<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He flew before six</em><br />
				and many more adverbial prepositional phrases saying where and 
				when he flew.<br />
				Indeed, we can omit the complement altogether and just have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He flew</em><br />
				However, the verb <em>suffer</em> cannot be used in the same way 
				because, if we want to have a preposition after it, our choice 
				is limited to <em>from</em>.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He suffered at a cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He suffered before a cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *he suffered over a cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He suffered across a cold</em><br />
				are all unacceptable.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>What all this means is that some verbs are particularly primed to 
			co-occur with certain prepositions before their objects.&nbsp; Hence 
			the term dependent preposition.&nbsp; The prepositional choice is 
			dependent on the verb <em>suffer</em> in a way that is different 
			from the way we use prepositions with other verbs.</p>
		<p>To start the analysis, which of the following are acceptable English?</p>
		<ol class="auto-style30">
			<li><em>He longed for a holiday</em></li>
			<li><em>He longed for it</em></li>
			<li><em>He longed a holiday for</em></li>
			<li><em>He longed it for</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Sentences c. and d. are wrong.&nbsp; Prepositional verbs (<em>long 
		for </em>in this case) can only follow patterns 1 and 2.</p>

				<p>Other examples of prepositional verbs are:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em>rely on</em> (meaning <em>trust</em>)</dt>
				<dd>We can have:<br />
				Pattern 1: <em>He relied his aging parents for money</em><br />
				Pattern 2: <em>He relied on them for money</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				Pattern 3: <em>*He relied his aging parents on</em><br />

				Pattern 4: <em>*He relied them on</em></dd>
				<dt><em>break into </em>(meaning <em>enter by force</em>)</dt>

				<em>She broke into the house<br />
				She broke into it</em><br />

				<em>*She broke the house into</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>*She broke it into<br />
				</em>(It actually makes more sense to define the combination of
				<em>break</em> and <em>into</em> as simply a verb followed by a 
				prepositional phrase with the preposition indicating change of 
				position, as it often does.)</dd>
				<dt><em>keep at</em> (meaning [more or less] <em>persist</em>)</dt>
				<dd>We can have:<br />
				<em>They kept at the work<br />
				They kept at it</em><br />

				<em>*The kept the work at</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>*They kept it at</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Prepositional verbs can, as we have shown, only follow patterns 1 and 2.<br />
			That does not mean, incidentally, that you are free to classify them 
			as inseparable phrasal verbs.&nbsp; That way madness lies because 
			they are not phrasal verbs at all.</p>

		<p>There is quite a strong argument to made that what are 
		called prepositional verbs should not be considered multi-word verbs at 
		all because they do not exhibit any particular difficulties or 
		specialised grammatical structures.&nbsp; A better way to analyse them 
		may be as strongly collocating verb + prepositional patterns and treat 
		them as learnable chunks because they are never separable.<br />
		An alternative we shall shortly encounter is to treat some of them as 
		verbs which require complementation with a prepositional phrase just as, 
		for example one cannot say:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I put it</em><br />
		without saying where.<br />
		The verb <em>put</em> therefore counts as a PP complement verb because 
		it must have, rather than may have, a prepositional phrase complement.&nbsp; 
		Equally, therefore, one cannot say:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I relied</em><br />
		without saying on what I relied.<br />
		Only the so-called transitive prepositional verbs fall into this 
		categories and others, such as <em>abstain, conform, connive</em> etc. 
		can stand alone with no complement.</p>
		<p>For example, a verb followed by (and modified by) a prepositional 
		phrase such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at her paper</em><br />
		can be expressed as<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at it</em><br />
		but not<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She looked it at</em><br />
		or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She looked the paper at</em><br />
		but the prepositional phrase can be variously changed without changing 
		the meaning of the verb but modifying the way the looking was done so we 
		might have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked through her paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked over her paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked for her paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked round her paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked in her paper</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked under her paper</em><br />
		and even<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked after her paper</em><br />
		and so and these all follow the same pattern of either<strong><span class="style_black"><br />
		</span> <span class="auto-style107">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> 
		<span class="style_black">verb + prepositional phrase including an object noun<br />
		</span></strong>or<span class="style_black"><br />
		</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<span class="style_black"><strong>verb + prepositional phrase including an object pronoun</strong></span>.<br />
		The expression <em>look at</em> is often described as a prepositional 
		verb or, even less accurately, as a phrasal verb.&nbsp; It is neither.&nbsp; 
		There is nothing about a sentences such as<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at the paper</em><br />
		which cannot be explained by the normal rules of English syntax, i.e., 
		subject + verb + prepositional phrase adverbial.&nbsp; The preposition
		<em>at</em> frequently means <em>in the direction of</em> and is not 
		mysterious.<br />
		Equally, we can keep the prepositional phrase intact and use a range 
		of different verbs for it to modify and have, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She glared at her paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She pointed at it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stared at her paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She slapped at i<span class="auto-style107">t</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spat at her paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She screamed at it</em><br />
		and so on and they all exhibit exactly the same two possible structures.</p>
		<p>A whole host of other examples can be used to illustrate the same 
		phenomenon:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They talked about / over / through / around the 
		problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We cut across / through / around the traffic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked over / about / of the music</em><br />
		and so on.</p>
		<p>In summary, the argument is that although certain verbs often have 
		predictable associated prepositions (i.e., they strongly collocate), the preposition adheres to the 
		verb and the combination is a learnable language chunk.<br />
		This is, however, a teaching point, not analysis of the language.<br />
		Another 
		way of saying this is that the verb is <strong>pivotal</strong>, in the 
		sense that it determines the preposition or limited range of 
		prepositions, with which it collocates.<br />
		Yet another way is to call the preposition dependent on the verb.</p>

			<p>There are some issues to note for teaching purposes:</p>
			<div id="mwv2" style="visibility: hidden">
				<ol>
					<li>Type A always take the prepositional complement phrase 
					so we can analyse them in two ways but whichever we choose, 
					they are accurately described as verbs with 
			dependent prepositions.&nbsp; Here is the choice although for 
					teaching purposes it does not matter which analysis you 
					favour:<ol class="auto-style39">
						<li>They are 
			always transitive so the clause is verb + dependent preposition followed by 
						the object.</li>
						<li>They are intransitive but 
						<span class="style_underline"><strong>require</strong></span> complementation 
						with prepositional phrase adverbial so the clause is 
						verb + obligatory adverbial complement prepositional 
						phrase.&nbsp; (This puts them in the class of what are 
						called <strong>PP complement verbs</strong>, which 
						also require complementation with an 
						adverbial.&nbsp; Others in that class are verbs such as <em>
			<span class="style_black">keep, lay, place, position, put, 
			rest, set, site, situate, stick</span></em>, none of which may be 
						used without a complement prepositional phrase although 
						they are, in fact, all stubbornly transitive.)</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Type B verbs do not require complementation but may be 
					followed by a prepositional phrase.</li>
					<li>
					
					Many of these verbs are, of course, polysemous and may 
					behave differently in different meanings.&nbsp; For example:
					<ul class="greybullet">
						<li>the verb <em>deal</em> can mean <em>distribute cards</em> 
						and can, in the sense intended here mean <em>manage</em> 
						or <em>handle</em></li>
						<li><em>dwell</em> can mean <em>inhabit</em> but in the sense intended 
						here means <em>think, speak </em>or<em> write at length</em></li>
						<li><em>conceive</em> can mean <em>create an embryo</em> but here it means 
						<em>imagine</em></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Many of the Type B verbs can also appear transitively without the 
			preposition, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I protected the file<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspected the girl in black<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thanked his father</em><br />
			Most of the others are not so accommodating and always require the 
			prepositional phrase complement.<br />
			You can <em>abstain</em> or you can <em>abstain from something</em>.&nbsp; 
			You can <em>account for something</em> but you can't simply <em>
			account.</em></li>
					<li>There is an argument that some verbs in the Type B columns are, in 
			fact, always complemented because the prepositional phrase is understood even when 
			it is not present.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He offered me a cigarette but I refrained<br />
			</em>appears to be an intransitive use of the verb <em>refrain</em> 
			but the preposition plus the object complement (<em>from one</em>) is understood even when 
			not present.</li>
					<li>Some of the ostensibly transitive verbs can be used ditransitively so we can 
			have, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She protected her children from his influence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They admitted his children to the university<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspected the children of the damage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thanked me for my efforts<br />
			</em>It is these verbs which are noted above as being able to be 
			used transitively without the preposition.<br />Here, however, it may be argued that the verbs are not actually 
			prepositional but simply verbs which are followed by a direct object plus a prepositional 
			phrase.&nbsp; The test of moving the prepositional phrase allows 
			marked forms such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From his influence she protected the children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the concert, they admitted only ticket holders<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the damage, I suspected the children<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my efforts, she thanked me<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			and allows us to classify such uses as simply verb + prepositional 
			phrase rather than prepositional verbs <em>per se</em>.</li>
					<li>When a prepositional verb is used pseudo-transitively or with 
					an obligatory complement, it can only 
			follow Patterns 1 and 2.&nbsp; That is to say:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>verb + preposition + object noun<br />
					OR<br />
					verb + obligatory prepositional phrase complement:</strong></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He longed for the summer<br />
			</em>or<strong><br class="style_black" />
			</strong><span class="style_black"><strong>verb + preposition + object pronoun<br />
					OR<br />
					verb + obligatory prepositional phrase complement</strong></span>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She complained about it<br />
			</em>They cannot follow patterns 3 and 4:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*They depended you on<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*We talked the film of.<br />
					</em>There is, of course a good reason for this and it lies 
					in the fact that <em>on you </em>and<em> of the film</em> 
					are both simply prepositional phrases and form a constituent 
					of a clause which cannot normally be separated.</li>
					<li>We have used terms such as <em>ostensibly transitive</em> 
					and <em>pseudo-transitive</em> above and there's a good 
					reason for this.<br />
					An alternative analysis worth considering for its simplicity 
					is that all such verbs are actually intransitive because 
					none takes a direct object <strong>in the meanings we are 
					considering</strong> without an intervening preposition.&nbsp; 
					Thus, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;She abstained from voting</em><br />
					is directly equivalent to the more familiar<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived at the hotel</em><br />
					because we can also have simply:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She abstained</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived.<br />
					</em>There are, in other words, two way of analysing the 
					verbs which insist on a prepositional complement and both 
					are sustainable (and teachable):<ol class="auto-style30">
						<li>as verb plus object:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
							<tr>
								<td class="auto-style131"><em>Mary</em></td>

						</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>The preposition <em>to</em> can be superficially 
					troublesome because it acts as a preposition proper and as 
					a grammatical adjunct to the infinitive in which role it is 
					meaningless.&nbsp; To see which it is, we need to try 
					inserting a bare infinitive, so:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I conformed to the general feeling of 
					the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I listened to the symphony on the radio<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He reacted negatively to the idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has adjusted to her new operating system</em><br />
					etc. are all acceptable uses with<em> to</em> acting 
					prepositionally but we cannot have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I conformed to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I listened to play<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He reacted to enjoy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She has adjusted to operate</em><br />
					They can all, as is the way with prepositions, be followed 
					by an -<em>ing</em> form gerund or verbal noun so we may also 
					encounter:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She conformed to wearing a uniform<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I listened to her playing the guitar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He reacted badly to being offered less money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has adjusted to using a new operating system</em></li>
					<li>The verb <em>agree</em> crosses boundaries.&nbsp; It can 
					be:<br />
					catenative (and not prepositional):<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agreed to go</em><br />
					prepositional:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agreed to the plan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agreed to having lunch on the terrace</em><br />
					It also takes a variety of prepositions:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agreed about the problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agreed on t<span class="auto-style107">he need for </span>
					another meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She agreed with the idea</em></li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p>
			As we saw above, there is a strong case to argue that these sorts of 
			verbs are not truly multi-word verbs at all but examples of varying 
			strengths of <strong>verb + preposition </strong>collocation.<br />
			It is even more easily argued that we have here a case of 
			colligational patterning with some verbs being primed to coincide 
			with certain prepositions.&nbsp; There are meaning patterns here, 
			too, with verbs have similar meanings frequently taking the same 
			prepositional complement.&nbsp; For a little more, see the guide to 
			colligation.<br />
			While it is difficult to select any preposition other than <em>on</em> 
			to follow a verb like <em>depend</em>, other verbs in the lists 
			normally used of prepositional verbs are more flexible so we can 
			have, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She complained about the service<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She complained of a pain in her back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They reacted to the news badly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They reacted against the idea immediately<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He talked of the accident<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He talked about the accident<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They laughed at the idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They laughed about the idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They laughed over the idea</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			The point being demonstrated here is that the verbs simply collocate 
			in predictable ways rather than having to be considered (and 
			learned) as multi-word lexemes.<br />
			There is no doubt a good case for teaching and learning the very strongly 
			collocating combinations as single lexemes so, for example, <em>
			depend on, connive at, hang around, conceive of, decide on</em> etc. 
			can all be considered very strongly collocating items learned and 
			produced as prefabricated chunks but that is 
			not the case for other verbs in the list.</p>
			<p>
			Objects of prepositional verbs do not need to be nouns 
			(although they frequently are).&nbsp; They can also be:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>-<em>ing</em> forms<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He abstained from voting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She concentrated on finishing the work</em></li>
				<li><em>wh-</em>clauses<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That coincides with what she said<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She relied on what she had been told</em></li>
				<li>pronouns<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They focused on those<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We argued about the latter</em></li>
			</ul>

				<td class="auto-style27">
				<h3><em>that- </em>and infinitive clauses with prepositional 
				verbs</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>
			The object of a prepositional verb cannot, however, be a <em>to-</em>infinitive 
			or a <em>that-clause</em>, so we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They complained about to be kept waiting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She relied on that I said it would be OK<br />
			</em>The reason is simple: <em>that-</em>clauses and <em>to-</em>infinitive 
			clauses can never be the complements (or objects) of prepositions.<br />
			This restriction adds weight to the correctness of analysing some of 
			these patterns as intransitive verbs taking preposition-phrase complements.</p>
			<p>
			When prepositional verbs are used with <em>that- </em>or <em>to-</em>infinitive 
			clauses they lose their prepositions.&nbsp; For example</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>He asked for silence → He asked that we be silent</em></li>
				<li><em>She complained about the noise → She complained that it 
				was noisy</em></li>
				<li><em>He decided on going → He decided to go</em></li>
				<li><em>I am convinced of the truth → I am convinced that it is 
				true</em></li>
				<li><em>I persuaded her of the need for me to have more time → I 
				persuaded her to give me more time</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			As we noted above, the <em>to-</em> constructions are sometimes better 
			considered as examples of verb catenation but only when the word <em>
			to</em> is acting as a syntactical rather than semantic unit.<br />
			This is not intuitive and learners who have understandably decided 
			or been persuaded to learn the items as lexical chunks may produce 
			errors like:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>*He complained about that it was noisy</em></li>
				<li><em>*She was surprised at that he was my father</em></li>
				<li><em>*They decided on to go</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			See below for a discussion of why prepositional verbs are sometimes 
			confused with phrasal verbs and called inseparable phrasal verbs.</p>

		</table>
			<ol>
				<li>There are those who would like to include common collocations such 
			as <em>thank for </em>and<em> protect from </em>as prepositional 
			verbs but a moment's consideration reveals the fact that the verb
				<em>thank</em> is frequently followed by the preposition <em>for</em> 
			+ a noun phrase and the verb <em>protect</em>, because of its meaning, is 
			often followed by the preposition <em>from</em>.&nbsp; In other 
			words, they are simply verbs with a modifying adverbial 
			prepositional phrase.&nbsp; That is revealed by moving the phrase so 
			we can have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He thanked her for her patience<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He protected the machine from the rain</em><br />and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For her patience, he thanked her<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the rain, he protected the 
				machine</em><br />We also separate the preposition from the verb and that is not 
			something we can do with a real prepositional verb.<br />We cannot have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He abstained the vote from<br /></em>because 
				<em>abstain from</em> is prepositional<br />but we can have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He protected the child from danger<br />
				</em>because <em>protect from</em> isn't a prepositional verb.</li>
				<li>A further source of confusion for learners is to include, for 
			example, <em>persuade to, help to, remember to</em> as prepositional 
			verbs.&nbsp; They are not, they are examples of catenative verbs 
			forming chains of meaning and the grammatical particle <em>to </em>
				belongs with the <strong>following</strong> not <strong>
				preceding</strong> verb, so while we can have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I persuaded her to come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I helped them to win<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered to post the letters</em><br />
			etc., we cannot follow them with noun-phrase complements so, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I persuaded to it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I helped to the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I remembered to the war.</em><br />
			are not possible.<br />
			There are prepositional verbs with <em>to</em> which are real 
			examples, of course, such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I agreed to the suggestion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stuck to my argument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It conformed to the rule</em><br />
			etc.<br />
				See point 7. above.</li>
				<li>Even worse and even more commonly, there are those who like 
				to lump all prepositional verbs into the general category of 
				phrasal verbs and that way more madness lies.<br />
				Trying to do this means that prepositional verbs, which have their 
				own characteristics as we have seen, get confused with phrasal 
				verbs proper and that leads to all kinds of avoidable (and 
				teacher-induced) errors such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I adhered it to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We longed the rain for</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				In an effort to dig themselves out of a hole excavated by poor 
				analysis, some will be tempted to tell their learners that such 
				verbs are simply inseparable phrasal verbs.&nbsp; They aren't.</li>

				<h3>A note about pronouncing the preposition</h3>

			<p>
			The pronunciation of multi-word verbs has its own section towards 
			the end of this guide but it is worth pausing to consider how the 
			prepositional nature of these verbs is revealed by their 
			pronunciation in connected speech.</p>
			<p>
			It was noted above under other tests for multi-word verbs that 
			adverb particles are usually given their full pronunciation while 
			prepositions are often weakened.&nbsp; This is evident with these verbs and their dependent prepositions.<br />
			So, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I laughed at his shirt</em><br />
			is pronounced as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈaɪ.lɑːft.ət.ɪz.ʃɜːt/<br />
			with the weakened form of
			<em>at</em> (/ət/).<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It amounted to £5</em><br />
			is pronounced as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ɪt.ə.ˈmaʊn.tɪd.tə.faɪv.paʊndz/<br />
			with the weakened 
			form of <em>to</em> (/tə/).<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you account for the difference?</em><br />
			is pronounced as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈhaʊ.də.ju.əˈk.aʊnt.fə.ðə.ˈdɪ.frəns/<br />
			with the 
			weakened form of <em>for</em> (/fə/)<br />
			and so on.<br />
			Weak forms cannot, of course, be stressed so the main stress with 
			prepositional verbs falls on the verb rather than the particle.</p>
			<p>
			By contrast, when these particles are adverbs forming part of a 
			phrasal verb proper, they are usually 
			pronounced in full (/æt/, /tuː/ and /fɔː/ respectively).&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came to after the operation</em><br />
			is pronounced as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /hi.keɪm.ˈtu.ɑːf.tə.ði.ˌɒ.pə.ˈreɪʃ.n̩/<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He kept at his work</em><br />
			is pronounced as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /hi.kept.ˈæt.hɪz.ˈwɜːk/<br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not stand for his behaviour</em><br />
			is pronounced as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈaɪ.wl̩.nɒt.ˈstænd.fɔːr.ɪz.bɪ.ˈheɪ.vjə/<br />
			and the adverb is often (not always) stressed.<br />
			</p>
			<p>
			With phrasal-prepositional verbs (see below), the second particle is 
			a preposition and also usually weakened while the preceding 
			adverbial particle retains its full-form pronunciation.</p>

			<p>Here are some more examples of separable phrasal rather than

				Pattern 1: <em>He pushed around the smaller kids<br />
				</em>Pattern 3: <em>He pushed the smaller kids around<br />

			<p>However, not all transitive phrasal verbs are separable 
			and not all the separable ones insist on the placement of the 
			pronoun like this.&nbsp; Most, however, are like this.&nbsp; More 
			below.</p>
			<p>The other point to note has already been mentioned.&nbsp; Placing 
			a pronoun in the medial position between the verb and the adverb 
			particle is not a characteristic only of phrasal verbs.&nbsp; For 
			example, we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found the reason very quickly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found it very quickly<br />
			</em>but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I found very quickly it<br />
			</em>and nobody has ever suggested that <em>find very quickly</em> 
			is a phrasal verb.<br />
			In these cases, however, the object must not be separated from the 
			verb by the adverb phrase whether it is a pronoun or a noun proper.&nbsp; 
			That is a general rule for all adverb modifiers: they <span class="style_underline"><strong>never</strong></span> 
			come between the verb and the object.&nbsp; We also cannot have:<br />

				aggressive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put off anything non-urgent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dropped off everyone who needed to get a train home</em></li>
				<li>The pronoun <em>one</em> also prefers the medial position as 
				in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I left one off<br />
				</em>but again, lengthening the noun phrase may result in 
				end-positioning the object as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I left off one of the most important figures in the accounts 
				I presented.</em></li>
				<li>It is also suggested that pronouns must invariably come 
				between the verb and the adverb particle so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I picked it up on the grapevine</em><br />
				is allowable, but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I picked up it on the grapevine</em><br />
				is not.<br />
				True so far.&nbsp; However, when the pronoun forms part of a 
				noun phrase or group, this rule does not apply.&nbsp; We can 
				therefore allow, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I picked most of it up on the grapevine</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I picked up most of it on the grapevine</em><br />
				We can also allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I threw him out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put it off</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I threw out him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I put off it</em><br />
				but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I threw out only him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put off all of it</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put off half of them</em><br />
				are all allowable because the pronoun is part of a noun phrase.</li>

			<li><strong>End weighting and end focus<br />
			<img alt="weight" height="133" src="../../images/weight200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			</strong>An observable tendency in English is to place heavy phrases, 
			i.e., those which are longer and more complex, towards the end of 
			the sentence and that accounts for the way in which long noun phrases 
			are handled.<br />The heavier the noun phrase is, the less 
			likely is separation.&nbsp; We can have<em>:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put the meeting off<br />
			</em>but to many<em>:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?She put the meeting to decide the future of the 
			museum and its curators off<br /></em>is not or doubtfully acceptable 
			and they would prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She put off the meeting to decide the future of the 
			museum and its curators</em>.<br />
			Some verbs are conventionally separated by the object, whether it is 
			a noun or pronoun, but as soon as the object phrase gets too long, 
			it is shifted to final position so, while:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He messed the meeting about</em><br />
			is preferred to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?He messed about the meeting</em><br />
			we would prefer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He messed about all the people who had come 
			to the meeting expecting a decision</em><br />
			and not:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?He messed all the people who had come to the 
			meeting expecting a decision about</em><br />
			and although:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't tell the twins apart</em><br />
			is preferred to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?I can't tell apart the twins</em><br />
			we may prefer<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't tell apart John's twin daughters 
			when they are wearing the same school uniform</em><br />
			over<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<em>?I can't tell John's twin daughters when they are wearing the 
			same school uniform apart</em><br />End focus is an allied 
			phenomenon and refers to the fact that the most important or newest 
			information is also likely to come towards the end of an utterance 
			so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put the meeting off</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put off the meeting</em><br />
			are not simple alternatives because the speaker has decided in the 
			second case that it is the meeting which is the new or important 
			information and placed the object at the end.<br />
			(There is a 
			guide to <em>there</em> and <em>it</em> on this 
			site linked in the list of related guides at the end which considers 
			other aspects of end weight and end focus.)</li>
			<li><strong>Always (?) separated</strong><br />
			<img alt="separate" height="133" src="../../images/transfer_flowers_hands200.jpg" width="200" /><br />It is averred by some 
			that a few phrasal verbs
			<strong>must</strong> 
				be separated and cannot be used any other way so any noun or 
			pronoun object must be interposed between the verb and the adverb.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked her mother into the idea<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked her into the 
			idea<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked her into it<br /></em>are all acceptable but it is not possible to have<em>:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She talked into her 
			mother the idea<br /></em>We have discovered that the word <em>into</em> 
			is always prepositional, never adverbial, so this is really a verb 
			followed by a preposition signifying change of state 
			(compare <em>turn into</em> and <em>make into</em>, for example).&nbsp; 
			The word <em>into</em> is confined to prepositional use 
			only.&nbsp; If it were a phrasal verb, it would be an example of a ditransitive verb which 
			cannot be monotransitive at all and there are no such verbs in 
			English.&nbsp; We could not have, therefore:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *She talked her into</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She talked into the idea</em><br />
			and this betrays the fact that the construction should be analysed 
			as the verb <em>talk</em> plus a simple prepositional phrase so not 
			a phrasal verb at all.<br />
			A related, approximately synonymous form, <em>talk round</em>, works 
			similarly although it can also be monotransitive:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked her mother round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked her round to the idea</em><br />
			but not:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She talked round her mother to the idea</em><br />
			although<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked round her mother</em><br />
			is probably acceptable.<br />
			A little corpus research reveals that <em>talk round</em> is used 
			both unseparated as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He talked round his cabinet colleagues<br />
			</em>and separated as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked her friend round to the idea<br />
			</em>Again, the analysis can be that this is an incidence of the verb <em>
			talk</em> with a prepositional phrase so it can be compared to, 
			e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mother came round to the idea</em><br />
			</li>
			<li><strong>Usually separated</strong><br />
			<img alt="two" height="133" src="../../images/two_people_doors200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			Most other examples are ones in which separating the verb and its 
			adverb particle is strongly preferred but not fully obligatory.<br />
			They include:<br />
			The verb<em> bring down</em> (as in <em>depress</em> 
			or <em>discourage</em>):<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her criticisms really brought John down<br />
			</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her criticisms really brought him down</em><br />
			are possible but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Her criticisms really brought down John</em><br />
			is probably not.<br />
			The verbs <em>ask over / round / back / out</em>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask the neighbours over</em><br />
			but why not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Ask over the neighbours</em>?<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked my brother out</em><br />
			but not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; ?She asked out my brother</em><br />
			However, in both these cases, it is reasonable to analyse the 
			structure simply as a verb post-modified by a normal adverb 
			construction because we can also have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She called me across<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked me in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They invited us round</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was invited over</em><br />
			etc. and in these cases, we simply have a verb plus adverbial 
			construction because we can also have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She called me to her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked me politely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The invited us yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was invited without hesitation</em><br />
			The verbs <em>help on</em> and <em>help off</em> are similarly 
			analysable as just a verb post-modified by an adverb:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I helped the lady on with her coat<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I helped my brother off with his coat</em><br />
			And in both cases, we have a verb plus a 
			post-modifying adverb which is transparent in meaning followed by a 
			prepositional phrase.<br /><br />The verbs 
			<em>call back </em>and <em>ring back</em> are also sometimes called 
			phrasal verbs but they aren't.&nbsp; It is suggested that we can 
			have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll call my brother back<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll ring the garage back</em><br />
			but
			not:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?I'll call back my brother<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?I'll ring back the garage</em><br />An argument, previewed above, with these two verbs is that they are 
			not in fact phrasal verbs at all but verbs plus adverbial 
			modifiers and we could equally have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll call / ring my brother soon / again / 
			tomorrow / next week / presently<br /></em>etc.<br /><br />It is true that the separated form is often more natural and more 
			frequently encountered (according to a little corpus research) but 
			not everyone would disallow the non-separated forms.<br />One reason, not often noted, for the separated form of a phrasal 
			verb to be preferred is the possible confusion with a parallel form 
			which may have a different interpretation.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked the neighbours round</em><br />can only be interpreted as meaning<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He invited the neighbours to his home</em><br />but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked round the neighbours</em><br />could mean the same but could also mean<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked the same question of all his 
			neighbours.</em><br /><br />You may also come across lists of 
			so-called inseparable phrasal verbs which include, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He left his money to his daughter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put the question to me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He kept the truth from us</em><br />etc. 
			with the suggestion that <em>leave to, put to</em> and <em>keep from
			</em>are phrasal verbs.&nbsp; They are transparently not phrasal 
			verbs at all.&nbsp; They are, in fact, not even multi-word verbs; they are simply 
			verbs followed by prepositional phrases and we can change the 
			preposition to have, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He left his money in trust<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put the question before the meeting<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He kept the truth to himself</em><br />etc.<br />Calling them multi-word verbs at all simply confuses your learners.&nbsp; 
			Calling them phrasal verbs is plain nonsense.</li>
			<li><strong>Ergative uses</strong><br />
			<img alt="worn out" height="133" src="../../images/worn_out_machine200.jpg" width="200" /><br />The ergative case applies to the times in which the direct 
			object of a transitive verb has the same form as the subject of an 
			intransitive verb.&nbsp; Verbs that allow both uses are common in 
			English and are sometimes referred to as labile or ambitransitive 
			verbs.&nbsp; In other words, the ostensible grammatical 
			subject is semantically the object of the verb.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They wore the engine out</em><br />is a transitive use of the phrasal verb and can be separated or not 
			with the full object but must, as is the rule, be used separably 
			with a pronoun object.&nbsp; It can, however, also be used 
			intransitively as in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The engine wore out<br />
			</em>Other examples of phrasal verbs which can be used ergatively 
			include <em>boil over, blow up, break down, break up, hold up, light 
			up, open up, push off, run out, topple over, twist up</em> and more.&nbsp; 
			A complication with some is that they have slightly different or 
			metaphorical meanings when used ergatively rather than transitively 
			with a conventional object.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bulb lit up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lit up the room<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bus broke down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They broke down the figures</em><br />
			and so on.</li>
		</ol>
		
		
		
		
		<p><strong>A teaching clue:</strong><br />
		It is not possible to know by looking at a verb whether it is separable 
		or not.&nbsp; However, treating them all as inseparable when the object 
		is a noun and separable when it is a pronoun will usually be acceptable unless it is one of the 
		very rare and debatable cases which are always separated (as 
		we saw in point c, above).</p>

				<h3>Ditransitive phrasal verbs</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		<p>We saw above when looking at transitive and intransitive 
		prepositional verbs that some may be used with two objects although 
		doubt was cast there on whether the verbs qualify as a special form of 
		multi-word verb or are simply verbs followed by prepositional phrases or 
		post-modifying adverbs.&nbsp; The doubt persists in this section.</p>
		<p>Slightly rarely, some verbs are ditransitive, i.e., they can 
		take both a direct and an indirect object.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed up the tools</em><br />
		could be analysed as a simple phrasal verb (<em>passed up</em>) with a single direct 
		object (<em>the tools</em>) and, in the normal way, it can be  rephrased 
		as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed the tools up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed them up</em><br />
		but not, of course:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She passed up them</em><br />
		because Pattern 2 (<span class="style_black"><strong>verb + adverb + 
		pronoun object</strong></span>) is not allowed.<br />
		However, because the sense of the adverb <em>up</em> is obviously 
		derivable from the preposition, it is arguable whether in this case the 
		combination is a phrasal verb at all.&nbsp; If we compare, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed up the opportunity</em><br />
		then we can see that this is a phrasal verb proper because it cannot be 
		understood from the sense of <em>up</em> meaning <em>to a higher place</em>.</p>
		<p>Notwithstanding our doubts concerning the status of <em>pass up</em> 
		in this case, when we have a ditransitive use as in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed John up the tools</em><br />
		we have two objects: the direct object (<em>the tools</em>) and the 
		indirect object (<em>John</em>).<br />
		The phrase ordering is:<span class="style_black"><strong><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		verb + indirect object + adverb + direct object</strong></span>.<br />
		The same sense can be expressed as:<br />
		<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verb + indirect object + direct object 
		+ adverb</strong></span>:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed John the tools up</em><br />
		or, less naturally but possibly<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed John them up</em><br />
		The complications occur because either or both objects of the verb may 
		be replaced by pronouns so we can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed John them up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed him them up.</em><br />
		The ordering cannot, however, be:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She passed the tools John up</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She passed them John up</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She passed them him up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She passed the tools him up</em><br />
		because, in English, the indirect object precedes the direct object.&nbsp; 
		Compare an obviously non-phrasal verb such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told the children a story</em><br />
		in which the ordering of objects is the same and English disallows:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She told a story the children.</em><br />
		It is possible to alter the ordering of objects by using the <em>to-</em> 
		structure (the so-called dative shift or alternation) so we allow:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told a story to the children</em><br />
		and the same tactic may be used with phrasal verbs so we allow:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed the tools up to John<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed them up to John<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed the tools up to him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed them up to him.<br />
		</em>but not, of course:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She passed up them to him</em></p>
		<p>Other examples of ditransitive phrasal verbs include:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They handed the teacher over their homework<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They handed him over their homework<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked her colleagues through the process<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked them through the process<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave the children out their test papers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave them out their test papers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked the old lady over the road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked her over the road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They made the man out a liar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They made him out a liar</em><br />
		But in all cases bar the last two examples, the constructions are 
		analysable more simply as verbs post-modified by adverbs with 
		transparent meanings (<em>over, through, out </em>etc.).
		In none of these cases is it possible to insert the pronoun after the 
		adverb, of course, <strong>whichever</strong> object it replaces.&nbsp; 
		They are possibly separable transitive phrasal verbs and the rule applies as one 
		would expect, so:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They handed over their homework him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They handed their homework over him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She talked through the process them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She talked the process through them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She gave out the children them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She gave the children out them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She walked over the road her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She walked the road over her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They made out a liar him</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They made out him a liar</em><br />
		etc. are all disallowed.<br />
		It may be possible to use the <em>to-</em>formulation to produce, for 
		example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They handed it over to him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked through the process to them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave them out to them</em><br />
		etc. but such formulations are often clumsy and, in fact:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked her over to the road</em><br />
		has a significantly different meaning because the preposition <em>to</em> 
		will be understood as meaning <em>towards</em>, i.e. direction to a 
		destination.<br />
		No such reordering is possible with the last example at 
		all except as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The made him out to be a liar</em><br />
		which is, in any case, probably the preferred expression of the meaning.</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><strong>Only the direct object, whether 
		it is a noun or a pro-form, can separate the two parts of a phrasal 
		verb.</strong></p>
		<p>The moral of this little story is to be wary of introducing a 
		ditransitive phrasal verb until the learners are fully comfortable 
		dealing with monotransitive verbs.&nbsp; It's a topic to deal with only 
		at advanced levels (and arguably avoidable even then).</p>

		<p>By some 
		traditional analyses some transitive multi-word verbs are described as inseparable phrasal verbs.&nbsp; 
		That is a legitimate classification because of their idiomatic nature 
		and opaqueness of meaning in many cases.&nbsp; It is also legitimate 
		because in many cases, the particle is an adverb, not a preposition, so 
		including them in the category of phrasal verbs is consistent with the

		<p>This is nearly a full list and such verbs are rarer than separable 
		phrasal verbs.&nbsp; They are classed in many analyses as phrasal verbs 
		because the particle cannot always be replaced without altering the 
		meaning of the verb and the meanings are not always derivable from an understanding of 
		their constituents.&nbsp; That is an acceptable analysis but leads 
		to a certain looseness of categorisation.<br />
		Many of these verbs fall equally satisfactorily into the category of 
		prepositional verbs encountered above.&nbsp; The verb <em>
		count on</em> is listed as prepositional, above, for example, but is 
		also in this list.<br />
		All those verbs marked <span class="style_black">*</span> in this list, 
		about half of them, are arguably prepositional rather than phrasal in 
		meaning because the meaning is transparent from an understanding of the 
		particle and the particle is functioning grammatically as a preposition.&nbsp; 
		All verbs followed by <em>into</em> are not phrasal at all because <em>
		into</em> is stubbornly prepositional in nature.<br />
		The remaining 16 verbs which are transitive, opaque in meaning and 
		inseparable form an identifiable teaching unit.<br />
		They are:</p>

		</table>
		<p>Some of these verbs are undeniably phrasal verbs, and are also 
		undeniably inseparable.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black">came across </span>an 
		old diary the other day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll <span class="style_black">lay off </span>trying to get

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black">came by </span>this old book in 
		the market<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_black">hit on</span> just the solution<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll <span class="style_black">see about</span> the problem 
		you are having</em><br />
		etc. no alteration of word ordering is possible and the verb and its 
		adverb cannot be split.<br />
		A few verbs are left rather in limbo so, although the verb <em>strike up</em> 
		is in this list, not everyone would dismiss:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_black">struck</span> a 
		conversation <span class="style_black">up</span></em><br />
		although the verb's inseparable use is more common.</p>
		<p>There are gradations of opaqueness in meaning, too, from the rather 
		obvious:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They heard of the accident on the radio<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lives on very little money</em><br />
		<em>via</em> the slightly metaphorical:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She touched briefly on the topic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He kept at / stuck to his work</em><br />
		to the almost fully opaque<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm counting on you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They came across an old man.</em></p>
		<p>In this analysis, they aren't all really teachable as phrasal verbs at all, in fact, 
		even though they consist of a verb combining with an adverb in many 
		cases, because:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Grammar</strong><ol class="auto-style30">
				<li>They all work grammatically exactly like prepositional verbs.&nbsp; So we get, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They joined in the 
			party<br /></em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They joined in it<br />
				</em>but we cannot have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They joined the party in<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They joined it in<br />
				</em>The verbs follow Patterns 1 
			and 2 only just as prepositional verbs do.<br />Some can be used without the particle: 
				<em>join in the game / 
			join the game</em>.</li>
				<li>As we saw above, many of these verbs do not allow the 
				formation of passive sentences as separable transitive phrasal 
				verbs do, so while we can allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The patients were cared for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem was got around<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A solution was hit on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child was picked on</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				we do not naturally allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The issue was borne on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was counted on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The work was kept at<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The problem was seen about</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The money was gone without</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The accident was heard of</em><br />
				etc.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Meaning</strong><ol class="auto-style30">
				<li>In some cases the particles are just part of prepositional 
				phrases following verbs.&nbsp; So we have 
			pairs such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get on the bus<br />
				</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get off the bus<br />
				</em>which is simply the verb <em>get</em> (meaning <em>move 
				position</em>) used with prepositional phrases and not 
			even a multi-word verb.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get to school<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get over the wall</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get out of danger</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Something like <em>run against</em> is 
			clearly a verb (meaning <em>compete with</em>) which determines the preposition 
				and is a prepositional verb like <em>complain about.&nbsp; </em>
				It also falls into the first category of such verbs (see above) 
				and can be used intransitively:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He decided not to run<br />
				</em>or with a prepositional phrase, or two:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran against me in the election</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
				didn't run in the election / for the position / in the race</em><br />The issue is one of polysemy; many verbs can have 
				two or more 
			<strong>related</strong> meanings.&nbsp; For example, <em>hear </em>can mean<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perceive with the ear<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be told of / learn about</em>.<br />
			In such cases, the preposition can be replaced 
				by another with little change in meaning: <em>hear of/about, learn 
			of/about </em>etc.&nbsp; With proper phrasal verbs, that's not 
			possible.&nbsp; By this definition, <em>hear of</em> and <em>learn of
				</em>are not 
				phrasal verbs at all.&nbsp; They are prepositional.<br />
				Similar considerations apply to a verb such as <em>join in</em> 
				where the preposition is determined by the meaning of <em>join</em>.</li>
				<li>Some are metaphorical extensions of either the verb's meaning or 
			the locative use of the preposition.&nbsp; For example, <em>fall 
			behind</em> is a metaphorical use of the verb and preposition and so 
			is <em>lean on</em>.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He leant on the bar</em><br />
				contains
				a simple prepositional phrase telling us where he leant, but:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He leant on his brother until he agreed</em><br />
				contains
				a metaphorical use of the prepositional phrase meaning <em>
				oppress</em> or <em>urge</em>.&nbsp; It is arguably a phrasal verb 
				because we cannot replace the particle without changing the 
				meaning and:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He leant across his brother</em><br />
				is simply a verb plus a prepositional phrase with a different 
				meaning.<br />
				However, whether and to what extent the meaning of the verb has 
				been changed by the addition of <em>on</em> in the case of a 
				metaphorical use of <em>lean on</em> is a debatable point.<br />
				<br />
				With <em>break into a conversation</em> 
			we have a metaphorical use based on the idea of breaking into 
			something physical like a house.&nbsp; The verb often has the sense 
				of <em>interrupt</em> and so we can replace the particle with a 
				number of others:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He broke off the conversation to 
				answer his phone<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school broke up for the holidays<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They broke into song</em><br />The verb 
				<em>touch</em> is another good example of extending the sense 
				of the verb (<em>meet, contact, handle</em> etc.) and using it 
				metaphorically to mean <em>briefly refer to</em>.&nbsp; A 
				metaphorical use does not magically turn the verb into any kind 
				of phrasal verb at all.<br />(For more on metaphor and polysemy, refer to
				the guide to polysemy and homonymy linked in the list of related guides at the end.&nbsp; 
				There is also a brief section below which may explain a little 
				more.)</li>
				<li>Many of the verbs in this category are, or can be described as, 
			delexicalised verbs which take their 
			meanings from the context in which they are used.&nbsp; Examples 
				are:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>do | have | get | go | make | put | set | 
			take</em></span><br /><em>get</em>, for example, 
			can mean: <em>receive, experience, contract, attain, 
			fetch, prepare, find, travel by, obtain, contact, reach.</em><br />Many of them do form real phrasal verbs but many will also function 
			with prepositions and take their meaning from the prepositional 
			phrase which follows them.<br />For example, the verb <em>go,</em> 
				normally intransitive<em>, </em>can be followed by an adverb and 
				an object to change its meaning from <em>depart </em>as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I must 
			go now<br />
				</em>to <em>manage</em> as in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She goes without breakfast<br />
				</em>and it is the particle, arguably a preposition, which determines the meaning of
				<em>go.</em>&nbsp; If we compare:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They left without breakfast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived without her family</em><br />
				etc. the prepositional nature of the particle in <em>go without</em> 
				becomes more apparent.<br />
				Because delexicalised verbs take their meaning primarily from 
				the particle and contribute little meaning themselves, it is 
				quite doubtful whether any of the combinations with such verbs 
				should be analysed as phrasal verbs at all.<br />
				(For more on delexicalised verbs, refer to 
				the guide to the Lexical Approach linked in the list of related guides at the end.)<br />
				Other verbs, not usually considered delexicalised, may also take 
				their meaning from the adverb with which they collocate so, 
				for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They picked out the best student</em> 
				(selected)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They picked on the best student </em>
				(bullied)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They lived on seafood and vegetables</em> 
				(ate)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They lived by fishing</em> (earned a 
				living)</li>
				<li>Meaning may be almost fully opaque rather than obviously 
				metaphorical.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran into Mary yesterday</em><br />
				is often described as an inseparable phrasal verb because the 
				meaning is clearly metaphorical and does not mean physically 
				contact necessarily.&nbsp; The same phenomenon can be seen with, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bumped into him quite by chance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked after his children</em><br />
				These verbs are not phrasal in our analysis because the 
				particles are prepositions, not adverbs.&nbsp; We can use other 
				prepositions with these verbs to arrive at different meanings:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran by Mary yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked for his children</em><br />
				and these are clearly different meanings but not of the main 
				verbs <em>run</em> and <em>
				look</em>.&nbsp; The verb <em>bump</em> can also be used with 
				other prepositional phrases such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bumped the car into the wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bumped the bicycle over the kerb</em><br />
				The words <em>into</em> and <em>after</em> are prepositional in 
				nature and not adverbial as they cannot stand alone.&nbsp; We 
				allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went afterwards </em>(the adverb)<br />but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I went after</em> (the preposition which 
				demands a complement)<br />and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked in 
				</em>(adverbial)<br />but not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I walked into</em> (prepositional 
				requiring a complement)<br />
				So a better analysis is that we have metaphorical uses of the 
				verbs <em>run, look</em> and <em>bump</em> combining with 
				prepositional phrases.&nbsp; If that is the case, they are 
				neither prepositional nor phrasal verbs proper.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It is possible to teach all these so-called inseparable phrasal verbs <strong>as if</strong> they were phrasal verbs, 
		even when they aren't, but they 
		don't share grammatical structures or semantic phenomena with real phrasal verbs (even if metaphorical meaning needs to be 
		found).&nbsp; They are better treated in the classroom along with 
		prepositional verbs with which they share fundamental sentence 
		structures or simply as verbs 
		which happen to collocate with or are followed by a limited range of prepositions 
		or adverbs.</p>
		<p>By this analysis is it perfectly acceptable to classify all so-called 
		inseparable transitive phrasal verbs as prepositional verbs and treat 
		them that way in the classroom.</p>

		<p>There is some confusion concerning the distinction between the 
		expressions as two words and as single words which can be 
		treated here.<br />
		We saw above that neither <em>into</em> nor <em>onto</em> can be adverbs 
		so they cannot, by definition, form part of a phrasal verb.&nbsp; Both, 
		can, however, be prepositional.&nbsp; This means that we cannot allow 
		either:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *John ran into<br />
		</em>or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Mary put it onto<br />
		</em>because prepositions cannot exist without a stated or implied 
		complement or object.</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>When they are two words, the first is often an adverb and the 
			second part of a prepositional phrase as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave in to his demands</em><br />
			in which we have the phrasal verb <em>give in</em> followed by the 
			prepositional phrase <em>to his demands</em>, or:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plane came in to Frankfurt an hour late</em><br />
			in which we have the verb <em>come</em> followed by an adverb, <em>in</em>, and then a 
			prepositional phrase, <em>to Frankfurt</em>.&nbsp; We can test 
			this by considering the opposite as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the plane flew out to London even later</em><br />
			where <em>out</em> is clearly just the opposite of <em>in</em> not 
			the opposite of <em>in to</em>.<br />
			The same phenomenon occurs with the words <em>on </em>and<em> onto</em>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They took him on to the payroll</em><br />
			is the verb <em>take</em> modified by the adverb <em>on</em> 
			followed be the prepositional phrase <em>to the staff</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They promoted him onto the board</em><br />
			is the verb <em>promote</em> followed by a prepositional phrase.<br />
			</li>
			<li>When used as one word, <em>into</em> is prepositional and 
			has a number of related meanings:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
				<li><em>towards, concerning</em> or <em>entering</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The road leads into London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fell into the water<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an investigation into the reasons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six goes into 18 three times</em></li>
				<li><em>change of state</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The witch turned him into a frog<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made the caravan into a hen house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cut the cheese into small pieces<br />
				</em>(The expressions <em>make into</em>, <em>change into</em> 
				and <em>turn into</em> are often described a phrasal verbs but
				<em>into</em> can also be analysed in these expressions as a 
				preposition (which is, in most dictionaries, its sole word 
				class).&nbsp; All three verbs signifying a change of state with
				<em>into</em> are robustly transitive by one definition or 
				simply the verbs followed by a prepositional phrase by another.)</li>
				<li><em>hit forcefully</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car ran into the gatepost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked into a glass door in the shopping centre<br />
				</em>(The expression <em>bump into</em> is often referred to as 
				a phrasal verb.&nbsp; It is not by this definition but it is a 
				slightly figurative use of the verb <em>bump</em>.)</li>
				<li><em>divide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six into twelve equals 2</em></li>
				<li><em>show great interest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's never been into opera<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's really into Star Wars movies</em></li>
				<li><em>result</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was pushed into a decision<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was persuaded into going</em></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The word <em>onto</em> is also polysemous and has metaphorical 
			and literal meanings:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
				<li>It is a simple preposition of movement meaning <em>to a 
				position on</em> as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tossed my keys onto the table<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She moved her laptop onto her knees</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>A related figurative use of the word means <em>with a view 
				to</em> or <em>in the direction of</em> as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window looks onto the garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That gate opens onto the road</em></li>
				<li>Particularly after the verb <em>hold</em> it has the sense 
				of <em>keep</em> as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I don't need it urgently so hold onto the book as long as 
				you like</em></li>
				<li>It carries the sense of <em>contact</em> or <em>talk to</em>  
				as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I forgot to get onto the gardener about 
				the roses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran from the scene but the police were soon onto him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put him onto a good travel agent</em></li>
				<li>After the verb <em>be</em> it carries the sense of <em>
				discover</em> as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He tried to trick me but I'm onto him</em></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>When <em>into </em>refers to movement from one place to another, 
			it is often replaceable by <em>
		in</em> (as a preposition):<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put it in / into my pocket</em><br />
		However, when <em>in</em> means placed and not moving, it cannot be 
		replaced with <em>into</em>:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I left it in my pocket</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I left it into my pocket</em></li>
			<li>The preposition <em>onto</em> is confined, however, to movement 
			from one place to another so while we can have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put it onto my shoulders<br />
			</em>it cannot be used when there is no transfer of position so we 
			can only have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I carried it on my shoulders<br />
			</em>and not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I carried it onto my shoulders.</em></li>

		</table><p>They are, of course <strong>always</strong> <strong>inseparable</strong>&nbsp;by 
		virtue of the fact that they have no objects to do the separating.&nbsp; 
		Interposing other adverbs is perilous but sometimes possible:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's worn 
		completely off<br />
		</em>but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>?He's growing slowly up<br />
		</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Has he woken yet up?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He dropped at ten o'clock by</em><br />

		</em>(<em>visited</em>)<br />with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dropped off at 10 </em>(<em>fell asleep</em>)</p>

		and<br />

		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't let on that she was in town</em><br />

		It is for this reason that they are probably better learned and taught 
		as chunks rather than word combinations.</p>
		<p>A few intransitive phrasal verbs can operate as copular verbs linking 
		the subject directly to an attribute.&nbsp; For example:<br />

		<p>These verbs are <strong>always transitive</strong> or, using an 
		alternative analysis, <strong>always require a prepositional complement

		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked hard to catch up</em> (intransitive phrasal verb)<br />
		and often transitive, separable phrasal verbs, too:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked hard to catch the class up</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked hard to catch them up</em><br />
		vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		He worked hard to catch up with the class<br />
		</em>(transitive 
		inseparable [of course] phrasal-prepositional verb)<em>.</em></p>
		<p>The same considerations apply to these verbs as applied above to 
		prepositional verbs concerning whether they truly form a set of 
		identifiable multi-word verbs.<br />
		Arguably, they don't because they can with equal confidence be analysed 
		as phrasal verb + prepositional phrase.&nbsp; However, in these cases, 
		teaching most of them as single lexemes pays off because the 
		collocational strength of the phrasal verb + preposition is great.&nbsp; 
		That is not invariably the case because we can have, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My time is taken up <span class="style_underline">
		with</span> these questions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My time is taken up <span class="style_underline">by</span> 
		all these questions<br />
		</em>Both those sentences are, by the way examples of how the passive 
		works with phrasal-prepositional verbs and that will be dealt with 
		in the next section.<br />
		In particular, the preposition
		<em>with
		</em>is so common in prepositional phrases that it appears frequently 
		following intransitive phrasal verbs and does so no fewer than eleven 
		times in the 24 examples above.</p>

		<p>There are four related issues:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>It is possible to insert an adverb between the adverb and the preposition because the verb + 
		adverb constitutes the core meaning.&nbsp; This is, however, often  
		better avoided:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have run completely out of milk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look forward greatly to helping<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran away immediately with the idea<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?He looks down often on foreigners<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		?I'll catch up eventually with them</em></li>
			<li>It is also possible to insert an adverbial prepositional phrase in 
		the same position, between the adverb and the preposition but sometimes 
		results in questionably correct sentences, especially with place 
		prepositional phrases:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He fell out at the end of the year with his parents<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her time was taken up right up to Christmas with her book<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?They faced up at the meeting to the facts</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?They ran out at the hotel of parking spaces</em></li>
			<li>Inserting other adverbs between the verb and the adverb particle is occasionally 
		acceptable but always avoidable and often wrong:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		*I can catch quickly up with them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I look greatly forward to helping<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?He went immediately in for golf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?My time is taken wholly up with the work<br />
		</em>and inserting prepositional phrase adverbials in this position is 
		always disallowed:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She can catch over the holidays up with the work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He looks at all times down on foreigners<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They fell at the party out with her</em></li>
			<li>The prepositional-phrase part of the clause 
		is mobile in a way that a true multi-word verb does not allow so, for special, i.e., 
		marked, emphasis, notably in cleft sentences, we can allow, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With her, I have fallen out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On such poor grammar, he always looks down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's only on some foreigners that he looks down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W<span class="auto-style107">hat we need to face up to is the 
		facts</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is to the lack of money that we have to face up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was with the a daftest ideas that they ran away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only with me that she fell out</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>A trap for the unwary is to assume that if there are two particles, 
		we must be dealing with a phrasal-prepositional verb.&nbsp; That is not 
		always the case because some prepositions consist of two words and not 
		an adverb plus a preposition so, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He ran ahead of the clock</em><br />
		is simply a verb (<em>ran</em>) plus a prepositional phrase (<em>ahead 
		of the clock</em>) and the preposition is the complex preposition <em>ahead of</em>.<br />
		However, in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled away from the other runners</em><br />
		we have a true phrasal-prepositional verb consisting of the phrasal verb 
		(<em>pull away</em>) and the prepositional phrase (<em>from the other 
		runners</em>).<br />
		A further example is:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled out of the garage</em><br />
		in
		which the words
		<em>out of</em> constitute a complex preposition, not an adverb plus a 
		preposition.&nbsp; It is not an example of a phrasal-prepositional verb, 
		in other words.</p>
		<p>A further trap to avoid is mistaking a prepositional phrase for a 
		prepositional verb.&nbsp; So, for example, although<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They drove off up the hill</em><br />
		appears to be a prepositional verb (<em>drove off</em>) plus another preposition (<em>up</em>), 
		that is a false analysis.&nbsp; It is in fact an intransitive phrasal 
		verb (<em>drive off</em>) followed by a prepositional phrase (<em>up the 
		hill</em>).<br />
		The prepositional phrase can be moved around and it can be replaced by 
		any number of other phrases such as <em>in a hurry, down the road, 
		towards the car park</em> etc. without in any way affecting the meaning 
		of the verb <em>drive off</em>.</p>
		<p>It may be argued, in fact, as we saw above that all so-called 
		phrasal-prepositional verbs can be analysed as a phrasal verb plus a 
		prepositional phrase.&nbsp; The fact that a separate category is usually 
		identified for these expressions has more to do with the strong 
		collocational aspect of the preposition with the phrasal verb than any 
		systematic grammatical feature.</p>

		<p>Transitivity implies the possibility of passive-voice use, of course.&nbsp; 
		The presence of the particle may make the forms difficult for learners 
		to acquire, however, and many choose to avoid them altogether.&nbsp; 
		That is a pity because the form is simple and only one arrangement of 
		verb and particle is possible.</p>
			<p>Making a passive structure requires the verb and its particle to remain 
		unseparated and the adverb particle follows the past participle directly 
		so we allow, for example, with a phrasal verb:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was cut off by the floods</em><br />
		but not:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The house was cut by the floods off<br />
		</em>and, with a prepositional verb (which does not allow the separation 
		in any case) we can only have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was interfered with by the woman<br />
		</em>not, of course:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The work was by the woman interfered with<br />
		</em>Because transitive phrasal verbs are real examples of a verb's 
		meaning being significantly dependent on the adverb particle, all 
		separable transitive phrasal verbs can be framed in the passive voice.&nbsp; We can have, 
		therefore:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting was put off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flowers were picked up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wedding was called off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fool was thrown out</em><br />
		and so on.</p>
		<p>Some multi-word verbs resist any use of the passive at all.&nbsp; In 
		particular, we cannot have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Her mother was taken after by her daughter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The tie was gone with the suit</em><br />
		and only the active forms are allowable:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The daughter took after her mother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tie went with the suit<br />
		</em>This is not a phenomenon confined to multi-word verbs because some 
		verbs, such as <em>resemble</em>, cannot be used in passive clauses at 
		all.&nbsp; For more on that, consult the guide to the passive, linked 
		below.</p>
		<p>With ditransitive phrasal verbs, two passive structures are possible 
		but, again, the adverb particle must follow the past participle directly 
		so we can have with a phrasal verb:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The delegates were given out their badges at the 
		beginning</em><br />
		However, with ditransitive verbs the <em>to-</em> structure (or dative 
		shift) for the 
		indirect object is all that is usually allowed:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The badges were given out to the delegates at the 
		beginning</em><br />
		not:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The badges were given out the delegates at the 
		beginning</em></p>
		<p>Rarely, the <em>for</em>-structure for the indirect object, which 
		denotes that something is the beneficiary rather than the target of the 
		action, is possible so we can encounter:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The badges were given out for the delegates</em><br />
		or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The food was brought in for me.</em></p>
		<p>Ditransitive prepositional verbs only allow a passive with the 
		direct object.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was thanked for her efforts</em><br />
		but we can't have<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Her efforts were thanked to her for</em></p>
		<p>Prepositional verbs as we saw above are sometimes classified as transitive or 
		intransitive although there is a sustainable argument that they are all 
		intransitive because none takes a direct object without the intervening 
		preposition.<br />
		Because the preposition is not separable from the verb, the 
		pseudo-passive structure is simpler for learners to understand and produce.&nbsp; 
		However, only some of these verbs naturally make passive structures at 
		all so we can allow, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The service was complained about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children were protected from the weather<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain was longed for</em><br />
		and many others but we do not usually allow:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *£100 was amounted to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The cake was consisted of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The shopping mall was hung around<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *?The rules were conformed to</em><br />
		and more.<br />
		We can draw an analogy with verbs which are undeniably intransitive so 
		we allow, for example, a pseudo-passive construction such as the 
		transformation of<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We arrived at a final figure</em><br />
		into<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A final figure was arrived at</em><br />
		and it is clear that <em>arrive</em> is not a prepositional verb at all 
		but simply one which often takes a prepositional-phrase adverbial 
		modifier.<br />As with all intransitive verbs however, the pseudo-passive 
		constructions is not universally available.&nbsp; We can allow:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guests went into the garden</em><br />
		but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The garden was gone into<br />
		</em>is at best unlikely.<br />The acceptable pseudo-passive transformations do, of course, result in the 
		trailing or stranded preposition much beloved of grammar pedants.&nbsp; So be it.</p>
		<p>Phrasal-prepositional verbs are analysed above.&nbsp; 
		Here it is enough to note that they suffer from the same inconsistencies 
		as those affecting prepositional verbs (of which they form a subset).&nbsp; 
		We allow, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His time was taken up with it</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The law was done away with</em><br />
		and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was looked down on</em><br />
		and possibly a few more.<br />
		For many, the existence of two particles in these verbs means that the 
		verbs are disallowed in the passive so most speakers do not allow:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Murder was got away with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The concert was looked forward to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The truth was faced up to</em><br />
		and almost nobody would allow:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They were caught up with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Golf was gone in for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The idea was run away with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The rudeness was put up with</em></p>
		<p>One of the tests, as we saw above, to determine whether we are 
		dealing with a multi-word verb at all is the ability to make a passive 
		from the active form.&nbsp; Many verbs which are often described as 
		multi-word verbs (or even, perilously, as inseparable phrasal verbs) 
		fail the test so we do not allow:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The bus was got on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The train was got off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The food was managed without<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The book was come across</em><br />
		and many other examples including those given above in the section on 
		inseparable phrasal verbs.</p>
		<p>When an expression is formed by a slightly metaphorical use of 
		the preposition, the passive is allowed so we can have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The matter was gone into thoroughly</em><br />
		or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problems can be lived with</em><br />
		However, literal use of the verb + a prepositional phrase cannot be used 
		in the passive voice so:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The house was gone into</em><br />
		or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *I am lived with by her</em><br />
		are not allowable.</p>

			<p>It is frequently averred that phrasal verbs are examples of

			<ol>
				<li>They exhibit fixedness: we cannot alter either the verb or

				<li>They exhibit non-compositionality: the meaning is opaque and

				constituent parts.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>However, that is not completely true in the case of opacity.<br />
			When considering the meaning of the particle in phrasal verbs we 
			need to distinguish between:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>the <strong>prototypical meaning</strong></li>
				<li>the <strong>extended or metaphorical meaning</strong></li>

				<h3>Three types of meaning</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The key is understanding that there are three sorts of meaning 
			that an adverb may have.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Transparent / prototypical meaning</strong><br />
				It was made clear above that the combination of a verb and an 
				adverb is not always usefully defined as a phrasal verb because 
				that leads to many tens of thousands of possible combinations 
				being construed as lexical chunks which need to be individually 
				learned.<br />
				For example, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put on my hat</em><br />
				we have the verb followed by the adverb representing its 
				prototypical meaning.&nbsp; The adverb <em>on</em> and the 
				preposition <em>on</em> both carry the sense of placement in the 
				normal way and we can compare the prepositional use in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put it on my head</em><br />
				and the adverbial use in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put my hat on</em><br />
				There is no mystery here and learners are not served well by 
				being told that <em>put on</em> is a phrasal verb in this case.<br />
				For teaching purposes, it is naturally quite easy to start with 
				those phrasal verbs that have a clear transparent meaning 
				because then you can focus on the structural issues of which 
				patterns (1 to 4, above) are allowable.&nbsp; Later, when the 
				patterns are mastered, the focus can shift to idiomatic meaning.<br />
				Transparent phrasal verbs do not have to be learned as chunks at 
				all but the structural characteristics do need to be learned.</li>
				<li><strong>Idiomatic, extended or metaphorical meaning</strong><br />
				However, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looks confident but he's only putting 
				it on</em><br />
				we have a metaphorical use of the adverb and in this case, even 
				though some learners may be able to deduce the meaning of the 
				phrase by thinking about the prototypical meaning of the adverb, 
				it does make some sense to analyse <em>put on</em> as a phrasal 
				verb to mean <em>simulate</em> or <em>feign</em>.<br />
				Similarly, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lost my car keys but I am sure they will turn up</em><br />
				we have a real intransitive phrasal verb, <em>turn up</em>, with 
				an opaque idiomatic meaning of <em>appear</em>.&nbsp; Phrasal verbs 
				like this often have one-word equivalents and knowing the 
				meaning of the verb and the adverb individually cannot usually 
				lead one to understanding the meaning.<br />
				The issue is one of non-compositionality and it makes teaching 
				sense to treat the combinations as chunks to be learned because 
				analysis of the elements is often fruitless.</li>
				<li><strong>Aspectual meaning</strong><br />
				There are two sorts to consider (because English has two 
				particular aspects to signal).<ol class="auto-style30">
					<li>With some adverb particles, most usually <em>up, out 
					</em>and<em> 
				down</em>, a <strong>completed</strong> aspect of the verb is signalled.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used up all the food<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She filled out the forms<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The battery ran down</em><br />all denote that the verb is to be understood as perfective or 
				completed in some way (<em>the food is finished, the form is 
				completed </em>and <em>the battery is exhausted</em>).<br />In this respect, the adverbs 
					<em>up</em> and <em>down</em> often 
				carry the same meaning, because it is aspectual not semantic.&nbsp; 
				So, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shut the house up = They shut the 
				house down</em></li>
					<li>The adverb particle <em>on</em>, on the other hand, denotes an 
				uncompleted, <strong>progressive</strong> or ongoing event as in, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They played on in the rain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please go on with your explanation</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We worked on until nightfall</em><br />etc.<br />Alerting learners to the aspectual meanings of some particles 
				can be helpful.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Dividing meaning so neatly into these categories is superficially 
			attractive but, of course, there is a cline between wholly 
			transparent meanings and those which are partially or fully opaque.&nbsp; 
			The cline looks like this with some examples using the adverb <em>on</em>:<br />
			<img alt="cline" height="93" src="../../imagesgraphics/mwv_transparency.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>Aspectual meaning is placed towards the transparent end of the 
			cline because, once alerted to the aspect of the verb implied by <em>
			on, up, out, down</em>,<em> </em>learners are often able to see the 
			meanings immediately of phrases such as <em>write on, work on, use 
			up, tidy up, run out, fade out, nail down, track down </em>and 
			others, providing only they are aware of the meaning of the main 
			verb.</p>
			<p>Reference has been made quite frequently in this guide to the fact 
		that the meanings of (especially) phrasal verbs cannot 
		be extracted by understanding their constituent parts.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He fell out with his family<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came through the operation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project ran into problems</em><br />
		are either wholly opaque in meaning or require a leap of imagination to 
		see how the verbs and associated adverbs or prepositions are being used 
		in an extended or metaphorical sense.<br />
		This will lead some to class the third example above as a phrasal verb 
		when, in fact, it is simply a figurative use of the verb <em>run</em> to 
			mean <em>encounter</em> followed by a prepositional phrase.<br />
		Many other examples are transparent in meaning and require no particular 
		effort of imagination or guesswork to arrive at their meanings 
		especially when there are co-textual clues, so, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked us carefully through the process<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He touched on the topic briefly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They ran over the safety regulations again</em><br />
		are all comprehensible with a little thought.<br />
		The problem for learners is that this does not work in the other 
		direction.&nbsp; Although a prepositional or phrasal verb may have a 
		meaning which is transparent, it is difficult to guess which 
		adverb or which preposition one should use to express the meaning one 
		intends.</p>
		<p>It is often asserted for these reasons that the meanings of the particles are somehow 
		random and that we can't teach them.&nbsp; However, there are 
		patterns if we look carefully enough.&nbsp; If we do not consider 
		patterns of meanings carefully, we will inflate the list of phrasal 
		verbs in English to the point at which learners will be bewildered and discouraged.<br />
		Here is an example of what is meant.<br />
		The verb <em>clean off</em> is a transitive phrasal verb insofar as we 
		can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cleaned it off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cleaned the mud off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cleaned off the mud</em><br />
		but not<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I cleaned off it</em><br />
		The sense of <em>off</em> here combines with the verb to form the 
		meaning of <em>remove</em>.<br />
		That's fine so far but to teach all such forms as individual phrasal 
		verbs which have to be learned separately is a waste of your and your 
		learners' time because we can equally well have:</p>
		<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder" style="width: 452px">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style138" style="width: 113px"><em>brush off<br />
				chip off<br />
				chop off<br />
				cut off<br />
				dust off<br />
				hack off</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style139" style="width: 113px"><em>knock off<br />
				polish off<br />
				rub off<br />
				scour off<br />
				scrape off<br />
				scratch off</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style140" style="width: 113px"><em>scrub off<br />
				slice off<br />
				sponge off<br />
				sweep off<br />
				wash off<br />
				wipe off</em></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>and the sense of the particle combines with the verb to produce 
		exactly the same sort of meaning.&nbsp; The adverb here follows its 
		prepositional counterpart in, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took the mud off the object.<br />
		</em>Once a learner is familiar with the sense of the verb <em>take off</em> 
		meaning <em>remove</em> as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took the mud off<br />
		</em>the rest will follow.<br />
		It will also allow learners to comprehend and produce intransitive 
		phrasal verbs such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked off with my money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran off immediately<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They hurried off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She raced off</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They sauntered off casually</em><br />
		etc. because the sense here is of <em>removing oneself</em> and 
		is unchanged.<br />
		With some imagination, this may even allow learners to comprehend 
		(although probably not produce) figurative uses of the verbs such as<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked off his headache</em><br />
		or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran off her cramp</em><br />
		because the sense of <em>remove</em> is still apparent.</p>
		<p>The same kind of exercise can be undertaken with many other common 
		adverbs such as: <em>(a)round, away, down, in, off, on, out, over </em>
		and <em>up</em>.</p>
		<p>The fact that 
			some prepositions also function as adverbs explains much about 
			phrasal-verb meaning.&nbsp; For example, using <em>up</em> as a 
			preposition in something straightforward such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I passed the book up to him</em><br />
			leads quite naturally to unpacking the meaning of the adverb 
			particle in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I brought up the subject of money</em><br />
			and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wrote his address in the box at the top</em><br />
		allows one very readily to understand<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He filled in the form</em>.<br />
			Many other ostensibly opaque meanings of particles in phrasal verbs 
			can be explained by reference to what the word means when it is used 
			as a preposition and employing a little imagination to see how the 
			meaning is more or less the same or slightly extended, but not fundamentally altered.</p>
		<p><em><a name="3"></a></em>Think about the meanings 
		of <em>in, out, off, on, up </em>and <em>down</em> using the technique 
		of thinking of the prepositional meaning and then extrapolating it to 
		make reasonable assumptions about the adverb particle meaning or the 
		extended meaning of the preposition in, for 
		example:</p>
		<ul class="greenbullet">
			<li><em>He broke in to ask a question</em></li>
			<li><em>I can't make out the number</em></li>
			<li><em>Turn off the heat</em></li>
			<li><em>Shall we move on?</em></li>
			<li><em>I want to take up the point he made</em></li>

				<h2>Polysemy and the meaning of the verb</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Polysemy (the phenomenon of a word having different but connected 
			meanings) is a source of confusion and error with multi-word verbs 
			because the uses of an item may, depending on the possible meanings, be 
			variable.&nbsp; You will have seen above that it has often been 
			necessary to define the sense in which a verb is being used in the 
			examples.</p>
			<p>An allied issue is that people will often disagree concerning 
			whether one use of a verb is in fact a distinct meaning from 
			another.&nbsp; For example, some will suggest that there are two 
			meanings of <em>go down</em> in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The submarine went down</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The price went down</em><br />
			despite the fact that in both cases, the verb just means <em>move lower</em>.<br />
			Whether this is an example of polysemy is slightly debatable.&nbsp; 
			If it's polysemy, we need to teach two separate but related meanings but if it's 
			hyponymy, it's a word with two unrelated meanings.&nbsp; The latter 
			does not seem a sensible course to follow.<br />
			It is pointed out in the guide to polysemy, linked below, that:</p>
			<p class="indentpara" >
			the problem of distinguishing between 
			homonymy and polysemy is, in principle, insoluble.<br />
			<span class="auto-style106">Lyons, cited in Laufer, in Schmitt and 
			McCarthy (1997:152)</span></p>
			<p>When we have cases of undeniable polysemy, the effect is fourfold:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A verb may change category (from verb + prepositional 
				phrase, prepositional to phrasal 
				and the reverse).&nbsp; For example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li><em>She got off the boat</em> (a verb 
					followed by a prepositional phrase) which cannot be 
					separated:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*She got it off</em><br />
					<em>She got off the paint</em> (a phrasal verb meaning <em>
					remove</em>) which does allow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She got it off</em></li>
					<li><em>He looked up the tree </em>(a prepositional verb 
					meaning <em>look upwards</em>) which does not allow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He looked it up</em><br />
					<em>He looked up the tree on Google</em> (a phrasal verb 
					meaning <em>find in a reference source</em>) which does 
					allow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He looked it up on Google</em></li>
					<li><em>He won't stand for her interference</em> (an 
					inseparable phrasal verb meaning <em>tolerate</em>)<br />
					<em>He won't stand for chairman</em> (a prepositional verb 
					meaning <em>present oneself for election</em>)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>A verb may remain in the same category but have multiple 
				senses.&nbsp; For example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li><em>She took off the stamp carefully</em> (a phrasal 
					verb meaning <em>remove</em>)<br />
					<em>She took off her boss </em>(a phrasal verb meaning <em>
					ridicule by imitation</em>)</li>
					<li><em>She put on her coat</em> (a transparent phrasal verb 
					meaning <em>don</em>)<br />
					<em>She put on an air of innocence</em> (an idiomatic 
					phrasal verb meaning <em>feign</em>)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>A verb may be transitive in one meaning and intransitive in 
				another (i.e., the verb has different colligational 
				characteristics in different 
				senses).&nbsp; For example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li><em>They carried on with the meeting</em> (a transitive 
					or intransitive prepositional verb meaning <em>continue</em>)<br />
					<em>They are carrying on</em> (an always intransitive 
					phrasal verb meaning <em>have an affair</em>)</li>
					<li><em>The sandpaper wore off the paint</em> (a transitive 
					phrasal verb meaning <em>erode</em>)<br />
					<em>The anaesthetic wore off</em> (an intransitive 
					phrasal verb meaning <em>diminish in 
					strength</em>)</li>
					<li><em>The plane took off </em>(an intransitive phrasal 
					verb meaning <em>begin to fly</em> but also used 
					figuratively to mean <em>leave quickly</em>)<br />
					<em>I took the label off</em> (a transitive phrasal verb 
					meaning <em>remove</em> which has a range of near synonyms 
					including <em>scrape off, wash off, clean off, cut off</em> 
					and so on)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>A phrasal verb may be separable in one sense and inseparable 
				in another.&nbsp; For example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li><em>The company laid the workers off</em> (a transitive, 
					separable phrasal verb meaning <em>made redundant</em>)<br />
					<em>I decided to lay off cigarettes for a week</em> 
					(a transitive, inseparable phrasal verb meaning <em>desist 
					from </em>or <em>stop</em>)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Certain verbs (often referred to as delexicalised) exhibit a good 
			deal of confusing polysemy.&nbsp; For example, the verb <em>get </em>can be:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A simple verb followed by a prepositional phrase meaning <em>
				move into a large vehicle</em> (so not an 
				example of a multi-word verb at all) as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got on the bus</em></li>
				<li>A phrasal-prepositional transitive verb meaning <em>continue</em> as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me get on with my work</em></li>
				<li>An intransitive phrasal verb with a similar meaning, 
				e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to get on</em></li>
				<li>An intransitive phrasal verb meaning <em>make progress
				</em>as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is he getting on?</em></li>
				<li>Another intransitive phrasal verb with the allied meaning of
				<em>form a relationship </em>as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They got on well together</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Polysemy naturally affects transparency of meaning so, for example, 
			the verb&nbsp;<em>drive</em> is transparent in meaning when followed by a 
			prepositional phrase (so not functioning as a multi-word verb at 
			all) as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;They drove up the hill</em><br />
			but is less transparent in meaning when it functions as part of a 
			phrasal verb as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; A car drove up and the driver called me over</em><br />
			in which both <em>drive up</em> and <em>call over</em> are phrasal verbs, 
			the first intransitive, the second transitive.<br />
			Similarly, the verb <em>take on</em> can be a separable, transitive 
			phrasal verb as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; She agreed to take on the work</em><br />
			in which the meaning is quite easily guessed or an intransitive 
			phrasal verb with an obscure meaning as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't take on so!</em></p>
			<p>We saw above that the adverb particles can represent a range of 
			meanings (although the assertion was that meaning is not random, 
			often being inferable from the meaning of the preposition).&nbsp; 
			This adds to the issue of polysemy, of course.<br />
			The following makes no claims to be complete but exemplification 
			usually helps.&nbsp; Below are some of the most troublesome phrasal 
			verbs which have more than two common meanings.<br />
			All of these are transitive and separable except those shaded as 
			follows:<br />

				<h3>Style and multi-word verbs</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It is often asserted that multi-word verbs are informal, 
			colloquial and to be avoided in all formal writing and speaking.<br />
			Here's an example from the web:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Phrasal verbs are more informal and are found 
			in informal texts and in spoken language.<br />
			<span class="auto-style106">Lindsay Clandfield<br />
			https://www.onestopenglish.com/vocabulary-lesson-plans/phrasal-verbs-introduction-/144986.article</span></p>
			<p>That is, along with much else we find in this area, half true at 
			best.</p>
			<p>It is, of course, the case that many phrasal verbs are informal, 
			but then again, so are many other lexemes in English.&nbsp; We would 
			not, naturally, expect to find phrasal verbs such as <em>bump into, 
			knock off, pop out </em>and <em>scrub out </em>in formal texts .&nbsp; 
			Nor, of course, would we expect to find lexemes like <em>junk, bug, 
			shilly-shally, ratty</em> and so on in formal writing and speaking 
			but the truth is that most phrasal verbs are neutral in style and 
			some multi-word verbs, especially prepositional verbs, are actually 
			often more formal than we might expect.&nbsp; Expressions such as
			<em>embark on, account for,
				coincide with,
				conceive of,
				consist of, map out, narrow down</em> and so on are neutral at 
			least and some are considered quite formal.<br />
			Even some undeniable phrasal rather than prepositional verbs are 
			actually rather formal in nature.&nbsp; They include:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carry out </em>(an experiment, a survey etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>point out </em>(identify, note)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>follow up</em> (findings, research etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>phase in </em>(innovations, systems etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>set up</em> (experiments, meeting etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>go ahead </em>(proceed)<br />
			and many more.<br />
			Some phrasal, prepositional or phrasal-prepositional verbs such as <em>switch on, 
			slow down, take off (clothes), deal 
				with, consist of, die off, go through with, take to</em> and others actually do not 
			have a more formal Latinate equivalent at all or, if they do, have 
			equivalents which are rare words like <em>decelerate</em>.<br />
			The prepositional verbs which are stubbornly transitive or 
			stubbornly require a complement such as <em>
			acquaint with, rely on</em> and <em>account for</em> are also cases 
			where it is not easy to find a one-word equivalent.</p>
			<p>Just like everything else lexical, multi-word verbs need handling 
			on a case-by-case basis and it is unhelpful (and slightly 
			unprofessional) to give learners the idea that all multi-word verbs 
			are less formal than the one-word equivalents, even when such things 
			exist.</p>

			<h2><a name="summaries"></a>Summaries</h2>
			<p>We can summarise MWVs in three ways: by type, by separability and 
			by transitivity.<br />
			If you would like these summaries as a PDF document,
			<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_multi-word_verbs_summaries.pdf" target="_blank">
			click here</a>.</p>
			<h3>Summary 1: by type, for the big picture</h3>
			<p>
			<img alt="summary" height="454" src="../../imagesgraphics/mwv_summary.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>
			It is as well to treat phrasal-prepositional verbs as a subset of 
			prepositional verbs because the structural characteristics are 
			parallel.<br />
			Intransitive phrasal verbs are very simple in structure and can be 
			taught at low levels because they are often common, and have 
			transparent meanings.<br />
			The problem, as we have seen is that transitive but inseparable 
			phrasal verbs appear in a different section of the analysis but 
			structurally behave like prepositional verbs.&nbsp; We have cast a 
			good deal of doubt in this guide concerning whether in fact the 
			category of inseparable phrasal verbs really exists.<br />
			By the same token, however, this factor complicates the following 
			two summaries because phrasal verbs make multiple appearances.</p>
			<h3>
			Summary 2: by separability:</h3>
			<p>
			<img alt="summary 3" height="400" src="../../imagesgraphics/mwv_sep_insep.png" width="620" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			By our analysis only phrasal verbs are separable.&nbsp; It is one of 
			the tests for adverb <em>vs</em>. prepositional particles.&nbsp; A few verbs 
			are always separated but the vast majority are optionally separable 
			by a noun phrase, obligatorily by a pronoun.</p>
			<h3>
			Summary 3: by transitivity</h3>
			<p>
			<img alt="summary 4" height="385" src="../../imagesgraphics/mwv_trans_intrans.png" width="620" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			Only phrasal verbs can be intransitive multi-word verbs in our 
			analysis.&nbsp; We have argued that prepositional verbs are 
			intransitive but have dependent prepositions which leads some to 
			refer to them as two-part transitive verbs.&nbsp; While it may be 
			the case that, for pedagogical purposes, we treat them as learnable 
			items with their prepositions, that does not alter the analysis.<br />
			It is just as simple and more consistent to treat them as strongly 
			collocating verb + preposition pairs and teach them that way.</p>
			<h3>
			Summary 4: clause constituents</h3>
			<p>
			This is a summary of the diagrams above all in one place to see how 
			clauses with verbs really work in terms of what grammatical function 
			the constituents perform.</p>
			<h4>
			Not multi-word verbs or prepositional verbs / verbs with dependent 
			prepositions</h4>
			<p>
			<img alt="not mwvs" height="414" src="../../imagesgraphics/mwv_not_or_prepositional.png" width="620" /></p>

			Phrasal or phrasal-prepositional verbs</h4>

			<p>
			The guide to teaching MWVs, linked in the list of related guides at 
			the end, contains lists of the core verbs that learners need to 
			know.&nbsp; Go there if you need a summary of the most important 
			verbs and want to select what to teach.</p>

				<h2>The pronunciation of multi-word verbs</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			It is sometimes averred that the pronunciation of phrasal and 
			prepositional verbs is stable and straightforward.&nbsp; The rule of 
			thumb is that the second element receives the stress.<br />
			It's a workable rule of thumb but unfortunately not always 
			a reliable one.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Prepositional verbs</strong></dt>
				<dd>Because these are simply verbs with prepositions, we can use 
				the familiar rule and leave the preposition unstressed and, 
				often, as a weak form realisation of the word.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He cared for his aging parents </em>&rarr; /hi ˈkeəd fə ɪz ˈeɪdʒ.ɪŋ 
				ˈpeə.rənts/<br />
				in which the preposition <em>for</em> is pronounced /fə/ and the 
				stress falls on the verb.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He looked at the moon </em>→ /hi ˈlʊkt ət ðə ˈmuːn/<br />
				in which the preposition <em>at</em> is pronounced /ət/ and the 
				stress again falls on the verb.<br />
				In fact, one test of whether we are dealing with a preposition 
				or an adverb is the fact that prepositions may be realised 
				as unstressed or weak forms but adverbs rarely are.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Phrasal verbs</strong></dt>
				<dd>Here the rule of thumb is more reliable.&nbsp; The main 
				stress will usually fall on the adverb particle and the verb 
				will receive a secondary stress.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I found out the reason </em>→ /ˈaɪ ˌfaʊnd ˈaʊt ðə ˈriː.zən/<br />
				where the main stress falls on the particle <em>out </em>and a 
				secondary stress falls on the verb.<br />
				Even when the particle is separated from the verb, the rule 
				applies:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I found the reason out </em>→ /ˈaɪ ˌfaʊnd ðə ˈriː.zən ˈaʊt/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I found it out </em>→ /ˈaɪ ˌfaʊnd ɪt ˈaʊt/</dd>
				<dt><strong>Verbs with noun-phrase objects</strong></dt>
				<dd>However, there is a difference, as the examples show, 
				depending on whether the separation of the verb is made with a 
				noun phrase or a pronoun.<br />
				In the former case, the noun retains the stress, especially if 
				it is seen as important as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Look the price up </em>→ /lʊk.ðə.ˈpraɪs.ʌp/<br />
				but when the pronoun does the separation, it is not stressed so 
				we get<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Look it up </em>→ /lʊk.ɪt.ˈʌp/<br />
				When there is no separation, the adverb particle can maintain 
				its stress (albeit as a secondary stress in most cases) so we 
				get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked up the word</em> → /ˈaɪ.lʊkt.ˌʌp.ðə.ˈwɜːd/<br />
				but, again, if the word is unexpected or carries a marked 
				meaning, the noun carries the main stress:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked up the proverb</em> → /ˈaɪ.lʊkt.ʌp.ðə.ˈprɒ.vɜːb/<br />
				Here's another example of this in action.<br />
				Although <em>put 
				off</em> is a phrasal verb, in a sentence such as:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; You can't put off the meeting</em><br />
				the pronunciation may well be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ju kɑːnt ˌpʊt ɒf ðə ˈmiːt.ɪŋ/<br />
				with the stress back on the verb and its object rather than on 
				the particle because the emphasis the speaker wishes to 
				communicate is the importance of the meeting.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Phrasal-prepositional verbs</strong></dt>
				<dd>Here the rule still applies and the adverb is stressed while 
				the preposition is unstressed.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She'll make up for it </em>→ /ʃil ˌmeɪk ˈʌp fər ɪt/<br />
				with the stress on the adverb <em>up</em> and the preposition,
				<em>for</em>, is produced as a weak form with a secondary stress on the verb.<br />
				If the object is a noun phrase, we may mark it if we choose by 
				stressing it.&nbsp; This is slightly uncommon but normal enough 
				to be teachable.&nbsp; We could have, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll make up for my stupidity</em><br />
				as either:<br />
				/aɪl.ˌmeɪk.ʌp.fə.maɪ.stjuː.ˈpɪ.dɪ.ti/<br />
				where the verb carries secondary stress and the noun phrase 
				carries the main stress, or<br />
				/aɪl.ˌmeɪk.ˈʌp.fə.maɪ.stjuː.ˌpɪ.dɪ.ti/<br />
				where the verb retains the secondary stress but the adverb is 
				stressed with only secondary stress on the noun.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Weak forms</strong></dt>
				<dd>One of the tests for a phrasal rather than prepositional 
				verb or verb followed by a prepositional phrase is the avoidance 
				of weak forms on adverb particles but their frequent use when 
				the particle is prepositional.&nbsp; We have therefore, for 
				example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He came <strong>to</strong> the house</em><br />
				as verb + prepositional phrase pronounced as:<br />
				/hi.keɪm.<strong>tə</strong>.ðə.ˈhaʊs/<br />
				but as an intransitive phrasal verb in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came <strong>to</strong> after the 
				operation</em><br />
				the pronunciation of <em>to</em> is usually the full form and it 
				may be stressed:<br />
				/hi.keɪm.ˈ<strong>tu</strong>.ˈɑːf.tə.ði.ˌɒ.pə.ˈreɪʃ.n̩/<br />
				and in a phrasal-prepositional verb, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He faced up <strong>to</strong> the issue</em><br />
				the weak form of <em>to</em> is again in evidence and is not 
				stressed:<br />
				/hi.feɪst.ˈʌp.<strong>tə</strong>.ði.ˈɪ.ʃuː/<br />
				This is not a fully reliable rule and will not work with 
				two-syllable particles such as <em>about, away</em> or <em>
				across</em> in which the first vowel is almost always /ə/.<br />
				It is also the case that many particles such as <em>down, by</em> 
				and <em>off</em> do not have weakened forms.</dd>

				<dt><strong>Making nouns</strong></dt>
				<dd>Phrasal verbs, in particular, are a rich source of nouns.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The car broke down on the motorway → I had a breakdown on 
				the motorway<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disease broke out → There was an outbreak of disease</em><br />
				When we make the nouns, the normal stress pattern is disturbed 
				and the stress usually falls on the first element, <strong>
				regardless of whether it is the particle or the verb</strong>:<br />
				/ˈbreɪk.daʊn/<br />
				/ˈaʊt.breɪk/<br />
				Simple verb + modifying adverb constructions are also a source 
				of noun formations so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We don't want anyone to come back to us 
				on this → We don't want any comebacks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told ev<span class="auto-style107">eryone how to log on 
				to the site</span> → She gave everyone their logons</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Making adjectives</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is a similarly rich source.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He cheered her up → She felt cheered up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They closed the site down → The site appeared closed down</em><br />
				We have chosen here to use pseudo-copular verbs, <em>feel </em>
				and<em> appear</em> but we can make the same forms with the real 
				or colourless copula, <em>be</em> and then the sentences appear in the 
				passive:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cheered her up → She wa<span class="auto-style107">s</span> cheered up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They closed the site down → The site wa<span class="auto-style107">s</span> closed down<br />
				</em>In these cases, the use of the verb is not adjectival but 
				passive so the usual rule of stress on the 
				particle is followed.&nbsp; Even when the word is used more 
				certainly as a predicative adjective, the rule applies, so, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kid seemed very mixed up</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The colour was washed out</em><br />
				the stress will usually fall on the particle as in:<br />
				/ʃi.ə.ˈpɪəd.ə.bɪt.tʃɪəd.ˈʌp/<br />
				/ðə.ˈkɪd.siːmd.ˈver.i.mɪkst.ˈʌp/<br />
				/ðə.ˈkʌ.lə.wəz.wɒʃt.ˈaʊt/<br />
				When the adjective is used attributively (before the noun), 
				stress tends to be more even:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a burnt-out house in a run-down 
				area.</em><br />
				in which the verb and the particle carry even stresses:<br />
				/ɪt wəz ə ˈbɜːnt ˈaʊt ˈhaʊs ɪn ə ˈrʌn.ˈdaʊn ˈeə.riə/<br />
				A few verb + adverb structures can also be used to form compound 
				adjectives as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to turn this around quickly → We 
				need a quick turnaround time</em><br />
				Very informally, a few multi-word verbs can form adjectives with 
				the <em>-able</em> suffix, e.g., <em>unputdownable </em> to mean <em>
				gripping, getatable</em> to mean <em>
				accessible</em> or <em>lockupable</em> to mean <em>securable</em>.</dd>
