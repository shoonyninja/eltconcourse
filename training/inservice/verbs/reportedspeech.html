		<p>On the left we have the direct speech &ndash; the words uttered.<br />
		On the right we have reported or indirect speech &ndash; how the message 
		is passed on.</p>
		<p>On the face of it, there's nothing terribly difficult about this 
		idea.&nbsp; The tense shifts back one (from, e.g., <em>was</em> to <em>
		had been, </em>from <em>can</em> to<em> could</em>)<em>.&nbsp; </em>At the same 
		time, <em>I</em> changes to <em>he</em>,<em> we </em>changes to <em>they

			<p>Of course, not all changes are always appropriate (but using the 
		changes will usually be correct).<br />
		If we are reporting something virtually simultaneously, then we often 
		don't change the tense or time expressions.&nbsp; If we are reporting 
		something in the same place, then we don't change the place expressions.</p>
		<p>So we might get:<br />
		<span class="auto-style8"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: I'm going there now.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		B: What did he say?<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		C: He said he's going there now.</em></span></p>
		<p>If an utterance remains true, we often don't change the tense so we 
		get, e.g.,<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm from South Africa = </em> <span class="auto-style8"><em>He said he's from 
		South Africa</em></span><em><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		I love the countryside = </em> <span class="auto-style8"><em>She said she loves 
		the countryside</em></span></p>
		<p>Try this <a href="../../initial/grammarl2/reportedhp.htm">matching exercise</a> 
		to make sure you have understood so far.</p>
		<p>Did you notice the changes, particularly with time and place 
		expressions but also with the verb <em>come</em> (which changed to <em>go</em>)?</p>
		<p>If you have followed so far, this will be 
		familiar:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tablebrownborder">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style61" style="width: 25px" valign="top">1</td>
				<td class="auto-style62" style="width: 221px" valign="top"><em>"I was in London,"

		<p>It's clear that we have examples of direct speech and indirect speech 
		here in sentences 1, 4, 2 and 5 but <strong>Sentence 6 </strong>is what is called a hybrid form because the first part follows the 
		'rules' but the second part actually changes only the pronoun, from <em>
		you</em> to <em>I</em>.<br />
		If the sentence followed the reported speech 'rules', it should be<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said I was welcome to come and asked 
		if I would like to bring Mary<br />
		</em>which is another possibility, of course, but sounds quite formal.</p>

		<p>Closed questions are those which require a Yes or No response and 
		they are usually reported with <em>if</em> or <em>whether</em>.&nbsp; We 
		get, therefore, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Are you going to the cinema?</em><br />
		reported as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked her if she was going to the cinema</em><br />
		There is a bit more to it, however.</p>
		<p><em><a name="1"></a> </em>Consider <strong>
		what direct speech</strong> is being reported in the following.</p>
		<ol start="7">
			<li><em>I asked whether there were any good recipes in it.</em></li>

		<p>Open questions are usually phrased using <em>wh-</em>words: <em>who, 
		what, why, where, how</em>.&nbsp; They cannot be predicted to have a 
		Yes-No-Maybe answer.<br />
		Questions formed in this way cannot be reported with <em>if</em> or <em>
		whether</em>.&nbsp; The reporting is done by embedding the questions.</p>
		<p>Embedding is often associated with polite questioning so, instead of 
		the direct:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the station?</em><br />
		we form polite embedded questions such as <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Can you tell me where the station is?</em></p>
		<p>So it is with reported questions.&nbsp; Thus:</p><table class="auto-style32" style="width: 85%">

			</table>
			
		<p>The tense chosen will often conform to the time and place of the 
		reporting using the common-sense rules discussed above although 
		back-shifting tenses where possible is common even when the reporting is 
		virtually simultaneous.</p>
		<p>The big issue for learners with this kind of reporting is the 
		ordering of the subject and verb.&nbsp; Most language will lead learners 
		to produce errors such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Can you tell me when is the film beginning?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Do you know who is the lady there?</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		And this will also carry over to reported questions so we get:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She asked me where is the zoo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They enquired what time did the train leave</em><br />
		and so on.</p>
		<p>Other reporting verbs such as <em>explain, clarify, complain, 
		mention, remember</em> and <em>state</em> will produce similar errors 
		because the structures are parallel to reported questions in English but 
		not paralleled in many other languages.&nbsp; We may encounter, 
		therefore:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She explained how did the machine work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They clarified what did they need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I remembered where was I going</em></p>

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John tells me there was a nasty accident 
				here / there last night.<br />
				</em>(Note that <em>last night</em> 
				does not change because the reporting is of a recent 
				utterance.)</li>
				<li>If the validity of what was said still holds.&nbsp; For

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

			<p>It's an important phenomenon in this area because the use of 
			deixis neatly explains a lot of the so-called anomalies of indirect 
			speech.&nbsp; Because meaning is dependent on the point of view, 
			time, location and place of the speaker / writer we are 
			obliged (or not) to change, e.g., <em>bring </em>to<em> come, come
			</em>to<em> go </em>(and<em> go </em>to<em> come</em>)<em>, this
			</em>to<em> that, here </em>to<em> there, yesterday </em>to<em> the 
			previous day, now </em>to<em> then, bring </em>to<em> take </em>and 
			so on.<br />

			providing the learners have a grasp of the tense forms and pronoun 
			systems but one does need to address different forms separately or it all 
			becomes a mass of data that bewilders learners.<br />
			A sensible approach is to apply the analysis as above, focusing on 
			reporting declarative statements, yes-no questions, open, <em>wh-</em>questions, 
			exclamations, orders and so on separately before making any attempt 
			to combine ideas.</p>
		<p>Here's an idea for teaching indirect speech and still applying the 
		common-sense rules.</p>
		<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
		Use a little task sheet like this:<table class="auto-style49">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style51" colspan="3"><em>Write three things 
				which are true about you now:</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style51">Your name: ________________</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style50">Always true</td>
				<td class="auto-style50">Example: <em>I like reading</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style50">Your sentence:</td>
				<td class="auto-style50">____________________________________</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style50">The past</td>
				<td class="auto-style50">Example: <em>I studied Italian at 
				school</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style50">Your sentence:</td>
				<td class="auto-style50">____________________________________</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style50">Tomorrow</td>
				<td class="auto-style50">Example: <em>I am having lunch at home 
				tomorrow</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style50">Your sentence:</td>
				<td class="auto-style50">____________________________________</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		Now collect all the papers and store them away for at least two days.<br />
		<strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
		Distribute the papers randomly but making sure the learners don't get 
		their own.<br />
		Now we come to the crux:<br />
		Statements like<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy classical music</em><br />
		can be reported in two ways (both correct):<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheena wrote that she enjoyed classical music</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheena wrote that she enjoys classical music</em><br />
		Other statements will need to be amended according to the rules of 
		deixis in English so we might get:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raoul wrote that he was going to the cinema the next day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michel wrote that he had eaten macaroni for lunch that day</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		Obviously, this is contrived and artificial to some extent but it is 
		personalised and situates the language temporally and spatially.&nbsp; 
		It is certainly better than meaningless sentence-transformation 
		exercises.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="what was the question" height="133" src="../../images/talk_to_statue200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h3>The word-order issue: what was the question?</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Because the word order when reporting questions and using a 
			number of the reporting verbs is a common source of error, it is 
			worth practising separately.&nbsp; Fortunately, the use of 
			back-shifting, even for virtually simultaneous reporting, is also 
			common so there is less need to set up delayed reporting.</p>
		<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
		Focus on an area in which it will be natural to ask lots of questions.&nbsp; 
		Focusing on the teacher's life experiences is a good way to begin so 
		that might evince questions like<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did you go to school<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you decide to be a teacher?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where have you taught?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you enjoy teaching?</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		Depending on the level of the learners a list of 20 or so things they 
		want to know about the teacher is not too ambitious.<br />
		<strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
		Once the learners, in pairs or individually, have their lists of things 
		they want to know and have properly formed questions they can ask them 
		in open class.&nbsp; Unfortunately, at this point, the teacher becomes 
		somewhat deaf and is forced to ask another student what the question was 
		so we get, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Petra: <em>Where did you train to be a teacher?</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher: <em>I didn't get that.&nbsp; What was the question, 
		Maria?</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria: <em>She asked you where you trained.</em><br />
		and so on.<br />
		<strong>Step 3:</strong><br />
		Now, in groups of three, the learners play the same game, deciding on 
		what things they want to know about the others in their group and having 
		one questioner, one slightly deaf responder and one reporter in each 
		trio.&nbsp; They all get a turn at playing each role.<br />
		Note that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You have to teach the forms before you can launch into this kind 
			of practice and </li>
			<li>The questions may well be mixes of <em>wh-</em>questions and 
			closed questions so the reporting will include formulations such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked you why you became a teacher</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked you if / whether you enjoy teaching</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can set up the task to exclude one or other type of question, of 
		course, but that's a lot less natural.</p>
