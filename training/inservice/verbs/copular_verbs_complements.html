			If you have followed
			<a href="../../initial/grammar_essentials/copular_verbs_essentials.html" target="_blank">
			the initial plus guide to this section</a> (new tab), which is much 
			simpler, you will be familiar with:</p>
		<p class="auto-style12"><em><span class="auto-style13">
		I say, I say, I say.&nbsp; My dog's got no nose.</span><br />
		<span class="auto-style14">No nose?&nbsp; How does he smell?</span><br />
		<span class="auto-style13">Terrible!</span></em></p>
		<p>Ha, ha.&nbsp; But there's an important language point buried in the 
		old joke.&nbsp; The joke, if there is one, relies on the fact that the 
		verb <em>smell</em> sometime operates as a lexical and sometimes as a copular verb.<br />
		Here we are dealing with the copular or linking use of the verbs in 
		question.<br />
		If that confuses you, try the simpler guide to this area first.</p>

				<img alt="define" height="166" src="../../images/dictionary250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style16">
		<h2>Definition</h2>

				<em>copulae</em> or <em>copulas</em> (pl.)<br />
				<em>copular</em> (adj.)</h4>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Traditionally, a copula is defined as an item which links the subject 
		of a clause with its predicate, like this (subject underlined, copula in
		<span class="style_black"><strong>bold black</strong></span> and 
		predicate in blue):<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">The book</span>
		<span class="style_black"><strong>is</strong></span> on the shelf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">The car</span>
		<span class="style_black"><strong>is</strong></span> enormous<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">Peter</span>
		<span class="style_black"><strong>is</strong></span> a musician<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">That</span>
		<span class="style_black"><strong>is</strong></span> what I need</em><br />
		and so on.<br />
		In English, the linkage is achieved with verbs of one kind or another 
		but that need not be the case.</p>
			<p>Some languages use a pronoun or set of pronouns to achieve the 
			link and in others (such as Korean) there may be a suffix which does 
			the same job.&nbsp; Some languages, such as most forms of Arabic, do 
			without a copula altogether and speakers of those languages may do 
			so in English, producing, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He teacher<br />
			</em>which is, of course, perfectly comprehensible.<br />
			Japanese has a particle, <em>da</em> or <em>desu</em>, which 
			follows the predicate performing a copular function.<br />Romance languages (excluding French and Romanian) generally have 
			two copulas, one for permanent states and another for temporary 
			conditions so the translations of, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary is happy<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary is a teacher<br />
			</em>will be different with different forms of the verb <em>be</em> 
			in each case.<br />There may, incidentally, be some disagreement among native 
			speakers of such languages concerning what constitutes a permanent 
			rather than temporary state but most get it right most of the time.<br />
			Languages which share this characteristic include Italian, Spanish, 
			Catalan, Portuguese and more.<br />
			Speakers of these languages may, at first, be slightly confused that 
			there is no distinction in the verb use in English between:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book is old<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book is in my car</em></p>
			<p>In many analyses a distinction is made between <strong>the</strong> 
			copula in English, the verb <em>be</em> and all other verbs which serve to 
			link the subject and the predicate such as <em>appear, seem, look, grow</em> and so on which are referred to as semi- or 
			pseudo-copular verbs.<br />
			In this guide we will shortly see why that should be the case.</p>
			<p>In other analyses, these sorts of verbs are referred to as 
			intensive verbs because they can only take one clause 
			structures when acting as copulas.&nbsp; That structure is: SVC 
			(Subject &ndash; Verb – Complement) although we can, as is the case 
			with all clauses add an adjunct adverbial to get SVCA.</p>
			<p>At the outset, we should make it clear that the <strong>complement</strong> of a 
			copula is not an adjunct.&nbsp; An adjunct is an omissible extra 
			piece of information in a verb structure.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John waited at the bus stop<br />
			</em>the adverbial<em> at the bus stop</em> is an adjunct and can be 
			omitted to leave a well-formed sentence.<br />
			However, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was at the bus stop<br />
			</em>we cannot omit the adverbial prepositional phrase because that 
			would leave a non-sentence in English.<br />
			For more, see the guide to adverbials, linked below.</p>

		<h2>The colourless central copula and quasi-copular verbs</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The verb <em>be</em> is the least meaningful but most flexible of the 
		copular verbs in English.<br />
		It is the least meaningful, i.e., colourless, because unlike verbs such as <em>taste, 
		appear, turn, grow</em> or <em>become</em>, it serves purely to link subject to 
		complement and carries little intrinsic meaning.<br />
		It is, however, also the most flexible and can be followed by more types 
		of complement than the semi- and pseudo-copular verbs.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>subject noun complement<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is <span class="style_black">the boss</span></em></li>
				<li>adjective complement<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was <span class="style_black">unhappy</span> with that</em></li>
				<li>a subject noun complement linked with the preposition like 
				to show comparison<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are like <span class="style_black">their parents</span></em></li>
				<li>prepositional phrase complement<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been <span class="style_black">in London</span></em></li>
				<li>adverb complement<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will be <span class="style_black">here</span></em></li>
				<li>non-finite <em>to-</em>infinitive clause complement<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His ambition had always been <span class="style_black">to make lots of money</span></em></li>
				<li>non-finite clause with an -<em>ing</em> form of the verb<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His aim was <span class="style_black">making lots of money</span></em> 
				(another )</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We shall see later how these seven types of complementation 
			affect which verbs can be used as copulas.</p>
			<p>The pseudo-copular verbs fall into two categories.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Verbs which indicate the current state of something<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She felt unwell</em></li>
				<li>Verbs which indicate a change in state which are known as 
				inchoate verbs (the term inchoate means <em>not fully formed</em>).&nbsp; 
				You may also see them described as inceptive verbs.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She became unwell</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Like this:</p>

			† the verb <em>represent </em>is polysemous and for example in:<br />

			it is not a copula but in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This figure represents the amount we have to

			<p>The inchoate verbs allow a range of modification, especially with

			<p>Current state verbs are subject to modification in other ways,

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She definitely appeared unhappy<br />

		<p>There is a guide to dynamic and stative 
		uses of verbs on this site, linked from the list of related guides at 
		the end, but the distinction bears treatment here 
		because it is often stated that we do not use copular verbs dynamically.&nbsp; 
		We do not, therefore, say:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is being unhappy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Jane is appearing sad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I am remaining content<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is smelling vile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They are seeming clever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is tasting good</em><br />
		etc.</p>
		<p>As a rule of thumb, that's true, but we do use a range of copular 
		verbs dynamically, especially if:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>We need to emphasise a temporary condition.&nbsp; We can have, 
			therefore:<ol class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>He is stupid</em> (permanent condition)<br />
				vs.<br /><em>He is 
				being stupid</em> (current, non-permanent condition)</li>
				<li><em>They felt sick </em>(and remained that way for an 
				unstated period)<br />
				vs.<br /><em>They were feeling sick</em> (a 
				temporary state)</li>
				<li><em>It is kept in that cupboard</em> (permanently)<br />
				vs.<br /><em>It is being kept in that cupboard</em> (for the moment but that 
				may change)</li>
				<li><em>Margate lies on the coast</em> (permanent location)<br />
				vs.<br /><em>She is 
				lying on the lawn </em>(temporary location)</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>We need to express the inchoate nature of an event (column 
			two, above):<ol class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>I am becoming uneasy</em> (changing from <em>calm</em>)</li>
				<li><em>She is turning aggressive</em> (changing from <em>peaceful</em>)</li>
				<li><em>it's getting cold</em> (changing from <em>warm</em>)</li>
				<li><em>I am growing old</em> (changing from <em>young</em>)</li>

		<p>This is the simplest and most common way that copular verbs appear in 
		the language and the verb <em>be</em> is the most frequent way the 
		effect is achieved.<br />
		They are called subject complements because they refer solely to the 
		subject of the verb.&nbsp; Below, we consider the rarer object 
		complements.</p>
			<p>There are two sorts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Adjective phrase complements</li>
				<li>Noun phrase complements</li>
			</ol>

		</table>
			<p>The predicative use of adjectives is generally achieved in 
			English with the use of copulas and the most common is <em>be</em>.<br />
			Almost any adjective can be used in this way although there are some 
			restrictions which are discussed in some length in the guide to 
			adjectives.&nbsp; The restrictions include the intensifiers such as
			<em>entire, mere, sole, outright </em>etc. which can never be used 
			predicatively and non-inherent adjectives as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary is an old friend<br />
			</em>which cannot be rephrased as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend Mary is old<br />
			</em>and carry the same meaning.<br />
			For more, see the guide to adjectives, linked below.</p>
			<p>However, the form of the complement is quite variable and takes a 
			little learning and practice.&nbsp; In particular, the preposition 
			which follows the adjective is unpredictable.&nbsp; Additionally, as 
			we note below, the use of a participle adjective often gives the 
			copular verb construction the sense of a passive.&nbsp; We get, 
			therefore:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><em>about</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was happy about the result<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was annoyed about the interruptions<br />
				</em>When used with a participle adjective, <em>about</em> can 
				form a quasi-passive agent phrase and carry the same meaning as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was annoyed by the interruptions</em></li>
				<li><em>at<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was good at chess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were pleased at the result<br />
				</em>When used with a participle adjective, <em>at</em> can form 
				a quasi-passive agent phrase and carry the same meaning as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were pleased by the result</em></li>
				<li><em>in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was unfortunate in losing so narrowly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are mistaken in believing that</em><br />
				This preposition does not act in a quasi-agentive construction 
				although the expressions <em>interested in</em> gets close as 
				in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was interested in the lecture<br />
				vs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was interested by the lecture</li>
				<li><em>of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was certain of her facts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was convinced of the advantages</em><br />
				The preposition <em>of</em> is very rarely part of a 
				quasi-agentive phrase.</li>
				<li><em>on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was keen on science at school<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figures were based on last year's</em><br />
				The preposition <em>on</em> does not act in a quasi-agentive 
				construction.</li>
				<li><em>to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am answerable to my employers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am opposed to the idea</em><br />
				The preposition <em>to</em> does not act in a quasi-agentive 
				construction.</li>
				<li><em>with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was sick with worry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were enchanted with the play</em><br />
				When used with a participle adjective, with frequently forms a 
				quasi-passive agent phrase and carries the same meaning as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were enchanted by the play</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <em>be</em> copula can, as we see, link any of these 
			adjectives with the noun subject and form a predicative adjective or 
			quasi-passive structure because it carries no semantic information.<br />
			The pseudo-copulas <em>seem, appear, sound, taste, feel, look, 
			become, end up, get, grow </em>can be used with any appropriate 
			adjective complement.<br />
			However, the pseudo-copulas do not all function in all cases for 
			semantic reasons or because they imply that the adjective is being 
			used dynamically and is under the control of the subject in some way.</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>The verbs <em>keep</em> and <em>turn</em> work with few adjective 
			complements and with no participle adjectives.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They kept happy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She kept annoyed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John turned nasty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *John turned disappointed</em></li>
				<li>The verb <em>remain</em> can only be used with dynamic adjectives such as 
				<em>annoyed, happy, mistaken</em> etc.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He remained frustrated<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She remained tall</em></li>
				<li><em>Semantically, too, the following are not allowed:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They proved pleased<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stayed good at chess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He felt keen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned unfortunate</em></li></ul>

			<h3><em>that</em>-clauses</h3>
				<p>Copulas with adjective complements can also be followed by 
				<em>that</em>-clauses so we get:</p>
				<ul class="redbullet">
					<li>With an indicative finite clause:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am surprised that you were so late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They seemed unhappy that she was disappointed</em></li>
					<li>With the verb in the subjunctive mood:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy that he be invited<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They appeared happy that she go alone</em></li>
					<li>With the putative <em>should</em>:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am astonished that he should be so 
					angry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary grew apprehensive that she should be alone in the house</em></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Dummy <em>it</em> constructions</h3>
				<ul class="redbullet">
					<li><em>It is sure to rain</em></li>
					<li><em>It is obvious he has no money</em></li>
					<li><em>It is possible that he will pay</em></li>
					<li><em>It seems he's quite happy</em></li>
					<li><em>It's getting late</em></li>
					<li><em>It appears she's going to be late</em></li>
				</ul>
				<p>For more on dummy <em>it</em> constructions, see the guide to 
				existential <em>it</em> and <em>there</em> clauses, linked 
				below.</p>
			<h3>Infinitive constructions as adjective complements</h3>
			<p>These constructions are somewhat rarer.&nbsp; Here are some 
			examples:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><em>You are kind to offer</em></li>
				<li><em>She seems hard to disagree with</em></li>
				<li><em>That man appeared too quick to anger</em></li>
				<li><em>She was livid to learn about it</em></li>
				<li><em>I became reluctant to take him with me</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Below, we consider how infinitive constructions can form 
			complements on their own.</p>
		
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="unicorn" height="133" src="../../images/animals_unicorn_white200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style22">
		<h2>Noun-phrase complements</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style23">
				<em>Can that be a unicorn?</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style22">
				&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Again, the colourless copula can be used with any appropriate 
			noun phrase so we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is a pilot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was an engineer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That man could be a spy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program has been a great help</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dog is an idiot</em><br />
			and so on, and on.</p>
			<p>The pseudo-copulas are not so obliging.</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>The state copulas <em>appear, seem, feel, keep, lie, look, 
				smell, sound, stand, taste</em> cannot take a noun-phrase 
				complement so we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She seemed a doctor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They sounded a prayer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They tasted a house</em><br />
				When such verbs are used with noun phrase objects, they lose 
				their copular function so:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tasted the meal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sounded a bell</em><br />
				are both dynamic verbs, not copulas, of course.<br />
				The inchoate copulas are restricted so we do not encounter:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *She got a surgeon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They went a millionaire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Mary turned a doctor</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Five of these verbs can take a noun-phrase complement as in, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She acted the part<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He proved a good teacher<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He remained a pessimist all his life<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stayed a teacher until he retired<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This represents a huge increase</em></li>
				<li>Two inchoate copulas are also more useful in this respect.&nbsp; 
				We allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She became a professor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ended up a prisoner</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>English is slightly unusual (at least among European languages) 
			in requiring the article with common noun complements so we do not 
			allow, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He became engineer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was barman<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I stayed amateur player<br />
			</em>The exception is with some proper nouns for positions or when 
			the noun is unique (much the same thing) so we can 
			allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He became President<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ended up Mayor of the town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be mother<br />
			</em>The article use is uncommon so learners will often forget to 
			include it.</p>
			<h3><em>like </em>+ perception verbs</h3>
			<p>We saw above that <em>be</em> and pseudo-copular sense verbs can 
			be used with adjectival complements so we encounter, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She appears delighted with her results<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cloth felt very soft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked really miserable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed expensive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That smelt terrible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tastes delicious</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very sweet</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			However, when we want to use these verbs with a noun complement we 
			need to insert the preposition <em>like</em> to link the verb and 
			the complement.&nbsp; We do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He looks a teacher<br />
			</em>but we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looks like a businesswoman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They appeared like difficult customers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It felt like velvet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might seem like a high price<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It smelt like a farmyard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It tasted like ice cream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is like honey<br />
			</em>etc<em>.<br />
			</em>Occasionally, <em>appear</em> and <em>seem</em> can be used 
			without the preposition as in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed a difficult job<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appeared the best method<br />
			</em>The other pseudo-copulas cannot do that and the safest bet is 
			to include the preposition.<br />
			The verb <em>be</em> can do almost anything so a noun-phrase without
			<em>like</em> implies identity and one with <em>like</em> implies 
			similarity.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a plate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was like a plate</em></p>

			<p>There is a small class of verbs which bear a close resemblance to 
			copulas insofar as they link the subject to the complement and cannot 
			have no complement at all and make sense.<br />
			The difference with these verbs is that part of the complement forms 
			the object of the copula.<br />
			They all imply some kind of naming or making and in that respect 
			they are causative verbs.<br />
			The (possibly complete) list is:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">

			<p>They have parallel constructions with subject complements which

			<p>There is also a small class of verbs which require adverbial 
			complementation and they, too, because the complement is obligatory, 
			are copulas of a sort.&nbsp; They include:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>keep, lay, place, plonk, position, 
			put, rest, set, site, situate, stay, stick, stuff</em></span>.<br />
			Elsewhere on this site, these verbs are referred to a PP complement 
			verbs because they <strong>must</strong> take a complement adverbial 
			whereas most verbs of this sort take an <strong>optional</strong> 
			adverbial complement.<br />
			We cannot for example, allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I put the book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I sited the house</em><br />
			etc. without providing an adverbial to say where.<br />
			In a way similar to the list above, they have parallel constructions 
			which make the meanings clear:</p>

			<p>Unlike most copular verbs, these can all be used in the passive 
			voice (because they have an object):<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was made Queen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ship was called The Queen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting was set for six o'clock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suitcase was stuffed under the bed</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			Although the complement is sometimes ellipted, it is always 
			understood so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We elected him<br />
			</em>is only understandable if the nature of the complement is 
			assumed.<br />
			With the second group, because the complement is an adverbial (often 
			a prepositional phrase) it cannot be omitted if the clause is to 
			retain any sense.</p>

			<p>The colourless <em>be</em> copula routinely links the subject and 
			an adverbial complement so we see:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is at school<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have been in the garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are in debt</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			(A small ambiguity arises with the prefect aspect forms of the verb
			<em>be</em> in these sorts of clauses because the verb is also 
			routinely used as the past participle form of <em>go</em> in which 
			case it means something like <em>go and return</em> as in, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been to Margate</em><br />
			In the example above of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have been in the garden</em><br />
			the interpretation could be that the verb is copular, linking the 
			subject and the adverbial complement, but it could also imply that 
			the people in question have visited the garden and returned.<br />
			In the latter case the verb is not a copula.)</p>
			<p>Pseudo-copulas cannot do this so easily.&nbsp; Some can, so we 
			allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He kept out of sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She remained in the college<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They stayed under the bedclothes<br />

			way.<br />
			That is not a restriction which is intuitively obvious, of course, 
			and it doesn't apply to the verbs in the previous section which 
			always require adverbial complementation.<br />
			If we want to use the other pseudo-copulas <em>appear</em> and <em>
			seem</em> in this way, the trick is to insert the <em>be</em> copula as in, 
			e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She appears to be out<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May aim is helping you to understand</em></p>
			<p>The subject of the copula in this case has to be an abstract noun 
			of some kind such as <em>hope, ambition, joy, disappointment, aim</em> etc.</p>
			<p>Only a few of the pseudo-copulas work with non-finite clauses at 
			all.&nbsp; We may see:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; His aim remained to see his property returned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His aim remained seeing his property returned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His ambition became training as a concert pianist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His ambition became to train as a concert pianist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ended up taking a third degree at university</em><br />
			Of these, the last only works with the -<em>ing</em> form because of 
			the nature of the preposition, <em>up</em>.&nbsp; We cannot have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She ended up to take a third degree at 
			university</em></p>

		<p>The problem with copular verbs is not so much with the form and 
		structure but with the types of complement that the verbs can take.<br />
		This section repeats in part but with some additions what has been said in the initial plus guide to 
		this area.&nbsp; If you have already followed that guide you don't need 
		most of it, but you do need to bear in mind that whenever a copula is the focus 
		of teaching, that you consider carefully what kinds of complement it can 
		take and alert your learners to any restrictions.&nbsp; As we have seen, 
		there are lots of them.</p>
			<p>One issue for learners is that the same distinctions do not apply 
		universally across languages so they may be tempted to use adverbs with 
		copular verbs and produce sentences such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I feel badly.<br />
		</em>Because there are so many verbs in English that act as copulas, 
		learners may become confused and fail to recognise them.&nbsp; However, 
		the range is also a resource which can be used to make texts more 
		interesting and vivid.</p>

		<p>Here's an example which can be adapted for 
		a lesson on the area at any level.</p>
		<p><strong>Text 1</strong>: using only <span class="style_black"> <em>to be</em></span> as the copula, <span class="style_black">
		<em>in black italics</em></span>.</p>
		<p class="auto-style31"><a name="copula2"></a>Tom <span class="style_black"><em>was</em></span> late at the 
		restaurant and Mary <span class="style_black"><em>was</em></span> 
		unhappy because she <span class="style_black"><em>was</em></span> alone 
		at the table for an hour.&nbsp; Tom <span class="style_black"><em>was</em></span> 
		apologetic but excused himself by saying he <span class="style_black">
		<em>had been</em></span> late at work because the job
		<span class="style_black"><em>was</em></span> more difficult than he 
		expected.<br />
		Mary <span class="style_black"><em>was</em></span> unimpressed and said 
		she <span class="style_black"><em>would not be</em></span> so forgiving 
		next time.</p>
		<p>Now replace the copular uses of <span class="style_black"><em>be</em></span> 
		with more interesting alternatives to see what effect it has on the 
		text.<br />
		<a href="#copula2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'copula2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Then click here for a 
		suggestion</a>.</p>
		<div id="copula2" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">
		<p><strong>Text 2</strong>: using more interesting verbs as the copulas 
		(one twice in slightly different meanings).</p>
<p class="auto-style31">Tom <span class="style_black"><em>turned up</em></span> late at the 
		restaurant and Mary <span class="style_black"><em>appeared</em></span> unhappy

		Mary <span class="style_black"><em>remained</em></span> unimpressed and said she

		<p>You can, naturally, make the exercise less 
		challenging by providing a list of pseudo-copulas that you want the 
		learners to use.<br />
		You can select from the list given above.<br />
		This exercise, incidentally, mixes choate and inchoate verbs and that 
		may, at least at first, be something you want to avoid.<br />
		One way to alert learners to the difference is to take the second text 
		and insert adverbs which may or may not be allowable.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			<p class="auto-style68">In this text, there are some
			<span class="style_blue"><strong><em>adverbs</em></strong> </span>
			which may or may not be correct.&nbsp; Find the incorrect ones and 
			correct them with something more appropriate:</p>
<p class="auto-style31"><em>Tom <strong>gradually</strong> turned up late at the 
		restaurant and Mary <strong>quickly</strong> appeared unhappy 
		because she <strong>slowly</strong> ended up alone at the 
		table for an hour.&nbsp; Tom <strong>rapidly</strong> grew 
		apologetic but excused himself by saying he had <strong>reluctantly</strong> stayed late at work because the job
		<strong>quickly</strong> proved more difficult than he 
		expected.<br />
		Mary <strong>stubbornly</strong> remained unimpressed and said she
		would not <strong>slightly</strong> prove so forgiving next 
		time.</em></p>
			<p>The exercise alerts people to the two forms of pseudo-copulas.</p>
