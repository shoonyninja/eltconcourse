			<p>And that means we are already alerted to a potential problem.&nbsp; 
			There is, as you are aware, no doubt, no one-to-one relationship 
			between form and function in any language so we have to be careful 
			to approach a loosely defined function such as <em>asking</em> by 
			being a bit more precise about what we mean.<br />
			In many other languages, the translation of the word <em>ask</em> in 
			these sentences will be different in every instance.&nbsp; In some, 
			only the first two will differ from the last two, in others, the 
			last will differ from the first three, in a few, the second will 
			differ from all the others, in some the verb will be different in 
			all four cases and in some other languages, the same verb will 
			suffice, as it does in English, for all four functions.<br />
			French will use the same verb in all instances, German will use the 
			same verb for examples 2, 3 and 4 but a different one for example 1, 
			Russian, Spanish and most Chinese languages will use the same verb 
			for examples 2 and 3 but a different one for example 1 and a 
			different one again for example 4 and so on.<br />
			If nothing else had altered us to the issue, that should because if 
			any language sees fit to have a different verb for <em>ask</em> in
			<strong>any</strong> of the examples, then it is clear that people 
			see some at least as functionally different.</p>
			<p>We will look at all four of these functions, consider them in the 
			context of the grammatical structures we may use to realise them and 
			then look at how they fit in with other functions and what the 
			adjacency pairings might reveal.</p>
			<p>In this guide, we will not focus too much on the really 
			straightforward ways of making requests such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like that, please</em><br />
			because such a realisation of a request, although it is heard, is 
			actually quite rare.&nbsp; Teaching in this area is often, 
			unaccountably, confined to unnatural expressions like this.</p>
			<p>(In what follows, there is no attempt to provide an exhaustive 
			list of possible exponents because we are not taking a phrase-book 
			approach but endeavouring to analyse the functions and their 
			realisations in general terms.<br />
			We will also focus for the most part on spoken language but the 
			function and the example exponents can just as well be expressed in 
			writing including, naturally, any appropriate response routines.)</p>

		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				<img alt="horses" height="166" src="../../images/three_horses250.jpg" width="250" /></td>

			<p>But first, we need to get an important functional concept clear.<br />
			Often, when the concern is the realisation of a function, the focus 
			is, as it should be, on the head or central speech act which the 
			function signals.&nbsp; However, if it remains only there, the 
			result can be slightly abrupt and unnatural language.<br />
			For example, the function of introducing oneself is realised by 
			something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is John Smith</em><br />
			but, standing alone, that is an unlikely thing to say and would more 
			likely be realised as something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; My name's John.&nbsp; How do you 
			do?</em><br />
			or whatever.<br />
			You may be familiar with the concept of heads and pre-heads etc. in 
			the analysis of phrases so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man in the corner</em><br />
			is a noun phrase with <em>man</em> as the head (because that is the 
			defining characteristic of a noun phrase) and a pre-head modifier (<em>the 
			old</em>) along with a post-head modifier (<em>in the corner</em>).</p>
			<p>We can apply the same kind of consideration to speech acts so, 
			for example, starting with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help me</em><br />
			which is the head speech act containing the request, we can have a 
			pre-head to show some deference such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you ...</em><br />
			and a post-head giving some detail of what's being asked for such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with this table</em><br />
			and that provides the entire utterance as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you help me with this table?</em></p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">It is, naturally, not necessary to burden learners with the 
			meta-language of the analysis but teaching only the imperative head 
			forms:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show me</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			is clearly inadequate and will result in overly direct imperatives.<br />
			Softening the language with a politeness phrase such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if I can ask you to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be nice if you could ...</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			will provide the necessary level of deference but that alone will 
			not result in much response unless there is a post-head phrase 
			giving some detail of what's required such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... a hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... with this case<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... how to do it</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			This three-part structure is, arguably, not a target for direct 
			teaching because most languages work in the same way (although in 
			many the bare imperative is not impertinent or too direct) but it is 
			noticeable that unless learners have at least been <strong>alerted</strong> 
			to the functions of the language, they are often tempted to omit the 
			pre- or post-heads or both.<br />
			A simple boarded chart such as:</p><table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style32">Pre-head: politeness signal</td>
					<td class="auto-style25">Head: request</td>
					<td class="auto-style33">Post-head: detail</td>

			</table>
			<p class="auto-style44">helps the noticing along and thereafter, once that is clear, you can 
			get the learners to break down the language of similar functions 
			such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me the way to the station?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you please call me if a room becomes vacant?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if you can come with me to help with the furniture</em><br />
			into the three constituents and that reinforces the point.<br />
			This also gives you, the teacher, the opportunity quickly and 
			accurately to correct and enhance the learners' output so that they 
			can form appropriate requestives.</p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">The same kind of analysis for teaching purposes can, of course, 
			be applied to a host of other functions realised in language such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh dear, I really am sorry if I disturbed you this morning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That looks heavy &ndash;&nbsp;can I help you get it in the 
			house?</em><br />
			etc. which might look like this although the content and nature of 
			the pre- and post-head acts will alter depending on the 
			circumstances and the intentions of the speaker.</p>

				<h2>Factual elicitation</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>This is the simplest place to start because eliciting information 
			is the primary use of the verb <em>ask </em>from which all other 
			meanings derive.</p>
			<p>The structural realisations of this function are accordingly 
			rather simple although politeness routines in English are sometimes 
			neglected.&nbsp; It is vanishingly rare, for example, to approach a 
			complete stranger and say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the post office?</em><br />
			although such a formulation between friends, acquaintances, family 
			members and colleagues is common and inoffensive.<br />
			Other cultures are more direct and in many the bald question does 
			not carry the sense of abruptness or discourtesy which it does in 
			English.<br />
			English users will normally opt for an indirect question form in all 
			circumstances involving strangers and will often do so even when 
			there is no social imperative to be distant and polite.</p>
			<p>Common realisations include:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>Do you (happen to) know ... ?</em></li>
				<li><em>Could you tell me ... ?</em></li>
				<li><em>Can you tell me ... ?</em></li>
				<li><em>Can I ask you ... ?</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>and there are more which a few minutes' thought can identify.<br />
			The key teaching point with this function is the nature of the 
			indirect question form in English because all the above may be 
			followed by no inversion of subject and verb or use of the <em>do-</em>operator so would finish as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... what time the bus leaves?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... where the station is?</em><br />
			rather than the more logical:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... *what time does the bus leave?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... *where is the station?</em><br />
			Even at quite high levels of mastery, many learners will produce the 
			superficially logical rather than grammatically accurate form.<br />
			See the guide to indirect questions, linked below for more.</p>
			<p>A separate, and separably teachable, form of information 
			elicitation concerns the use of <em>if</em> and <em>whether</em> as 
			they apply to alternative events.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you tell me whether this train stops at 
			Margate?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you happen to know if this is the right place to get a 
			ticket?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if you know whether this is the right road to 
			Portsmouth</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			The distinction here, naturally, is that the question is aimed at a 
			<em>yes-no</em> response rather than an open-ended piece of information.&nbsp; 
			Hence the use of the <em>if / whether</em> formulations.<br />
			For more on that, see the guide to indirect questions, linked below.</p>

			<p>Responses are, likewise, reasonably simple and there are only 
			three functions forming the corresponding half of the adjacency 
			pair:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Preferred positive response:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li><em>Yes, at ten past six</em></li>

					etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>

			dispreferred responses is an important communicative skill.</p>

		</table>
			<p>The second function identified at the outset was that of asking 
			for action but there are two significantly different ways to do 
			this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Cohortation</strong><br />
				which concerns getting people to cooperate with us in doing 
				something.</li>
				<li><strong>Exhortation</strong><br />

				<td class="auto-style22">
				<h3>Cohortation</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p><strong>Cohortative requests</strong> are nearly always in the 
			first person plural by their nature because they are aimed at 
			evincing joint actions of the speaker and hearer.</p>
				<p>In English, the most common way is the <em>let’s</em> construction which contains the only example of the 
				abbreviated <em>us</em> in English.&nbsp; To use the full form,
					<em>let us</em>, is considered formal and mostly reserved for 
				written language or prepared statements and speeches.<br />
					The contracted <em>let’s</em> construction is always 
				cohortative.&nbsp; If you say it in full, it usually becomes an 
				imperative.&nbsp;
				Compare:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us go<br />
				</em>usually meaning <em>Release us!<br />
				</em>It is possible to 
				use this full form as a cohortative but it sounds odd and may be 
						ambiguous.<br />
						In writing, it is more common, especially as a form of 
					conjunct in, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us now go on to consider ...<br />
					</em>etc. with:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s go<br />
				</em>meaning <em>I am encouraging 
				you to cooperate in leaving now</em></p>
			<p>An alternative, in British English, is the use of the modal 
			auxiliary verb <em>shall</em> which has died out in its use as a 
			future marker but retained for its cohortative use as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shall we get this finished before we take a 
			break?</em></p>
			<p>A third way is <em>via</em> the use of a quasi-suggestion along 
			the lines of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How about ... + -ing?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would(n't) it be better if we ... ?</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shouldn't we ... ?</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			We called these quasi suggestions because they are not intended to 
			put forward an idea but to elicit cooperative action from the 
			hearer(s).<br />
			When the function is really to make a suggestion, the choice usually 
			falls on third-person forms.</p>
			<p>Again, for teaching purposes, simply taking a phrase-book 
			approach to the area is inadequate because cohortation requires 
			pre-head language to signal some deference or understanding of 
			troublesomeness and a post-head expression which often signals a 
			reason for the hortation.<br />
			We get, therefore, for example, as pre-heads:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm getting tired so ...</em> (expressing 
			personal weakness and relieving the other of responsibility)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's getting late so ...</em> (expressing a 
			reason for a subsequent request for cooperation)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a lovely evening so ...</em> (expressing 
			an environmental cause exterior to both parties)<br />
			and post-heads such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... when we are fresher </em>(expressing a 
			consequence of an action)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and finishing in the morning</em> 
			(expressing a positive consequence)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and see if Mary and John are there</em> 
			(expressing a positive possibility following the action)<br />
			Putting all those together, we get the more natural and less direct 
			utterances such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm getting tired so how about taking a break 
			and coming back to it when we are fresher?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's getting late so how about stopping now and finishing in 
			the morning?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a lovely evening so let's go down to the pub and have a 
			drink in the garden and see if Mary and John are there</em></p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">Referring to the tabular three-part structure of such 
			realisations which was provided above can help learners sound 
			considerably more natural although the language is simple enough.&nbsp; 
			It would appear something like this:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">

				<td class="auto-style22">
				<h3>Exhortation</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Exhortation can be achieved (as above) with a simple imperative 
			in English, such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help me with this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me the way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show her how to do it</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain the way to do this</em><br />
			etc. but the use of the imperative mood is actually quite rare and 
			usually confined to two ends of the social spectrum: those in 
			authority to people with less power and people in close 
			relationships who are unlikely to be offended and have equal 
			authority.<br />
			Even in customer-server relationships in English, imperatives are 
			routinely softened with at least a <em>please</em> and <em>thank you
			</em>but that is not universal across cultures.<br />
			In most other cases, the imperative needs to be carefully softened 
			if it is not to offend.<br />
			There are many ways to do this, but this is not a phrase book, so a 
			few examples will suffice:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please can you ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask you to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if you have time to ...</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			(Hunt the web for sites run by those who like to collect phrases for 
			more.)</p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">All the softeners exemplified here are pre-heads of course but 
			exhortative expressions also frequently contain post-heads 
			expressing a reason for the request to soften it further and show 
			that the asker understands that the request might prove troublesome.&nbsp; 
			They might include:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... because I'm not sure I can manage alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... because I'm a bit lost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... because you are the expert</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... although I know you are busy</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Thus, we arrive at the whole exhortative requestives of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please can you help me with this because I'm 
			not sure I can manage alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you tell me the way because I'm a bit lost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask you to show her how to do it because you are the 
			expert<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if you have time to explain the way to do this 
			although I know you are busy<br />
			</em>which are all far more likely to result in a positive, 
			preferred response than bare imperatives will.<br />
			Again, a little three-part analysis will often help things along:</p>

				<h2>Requiring things</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>You do not have to be too perceptive to note that the elicitation 
			of information often involves nominalised clauses of one kind or 
			another.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know when the train leaves?<br />
			</em>contains the clause <em>when the train leaves</em> functioning 
			as the object of the verb <em>know</em> so the clause itself is made 
			into a noun in terms of its grammatical, rather than communicative, 
			function.&nbsp; The structure of the sentence is akin to:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Do you know the time?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know the way to London?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know her brother?<br />
			</em>etc. in which the objects are more familiarly simple noun 
			phrases.</p>
			<p>Requiring things is actually simpler than enquiring about 
			information because the object of the request usually <strong>is</strong> 
			a noun phrase rather than a nominalised clause or phrase.&nbsp; We 
			could say, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me the papers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass me that hammer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transfer the money to me</em><br />
			and so on in which the clause structure is extremely simple.&nbsp; 
			Most learners even at quite low levels can deal with a simple Verb + 
			Object structure of that sort, albeit with the added complication of 
			the indirect objects <em>(me</em> in all cases)<em>.<br />
			</em>However, a moment's thought reveals that most requests for 
			things are not couched in such direct terms and that, even between 
			participants with very different amounts of authority, bald 
			imperatives of this sort are rare and when used, often offensive.<br />
			Getting things, therefore, rather than information or cooperation 
			often requires even more attention to pre-head politeness stratagems 
			and post-head justifications for the demand.<br />
			Here are some examples:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>Please let me have your answer so I can get on and book 
				the tickets</em></li>
				<li><em>Can you pass me the salt?</em></li>
				<li><em>Would it be possible for you to let us have the money 
				tomorrow so we can deliver the stuff promptly?</em></li>
				<li><em>If you can let us have an address for this we'll get the 
				materials to you</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.<br />
			There are, of course, some things to note:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The expression frame:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please / Can you </em>+<em> let </em>+ 
				indirect object +<em> have </em>+ direct object<br />
				is a widely used, polite and simple way of requiring things that 
				is seldom taught but extremely versatile.&nbsp; It is difficult 
				to think of an object noun with which its use would not be 
				appropriate and inoffensive.&nbsp; It can be used freely with 
				physical entities such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some more butter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two coffees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two glasses</em><br />
				and with abstract concepts such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your decision<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a little more time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your help and support</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Even between people who are close and in an informal 
				setting, the bare imperative is often softened by an 
				introductory <em>Please</em> although a post-head justification 
				is rarely needed.</li>
				<li>Conditional structures are extremely useful because they do 
				two things:<ol class="auto-style36">
					<li>they add a sense that the hearer may reject the request 
					without offence because they sound tentative and modest</li>
					<li>they explicitly connect the request to the reason for it 
					so providing a neat way to state the justification normally 
					put in the post-head with <em>so, because, in order to </em>
					etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>All the verbs so far used in our examples are ditransitive 
				because we wish not only to refer to the direct object but also 
				to state openly who is the indirect object of the request.&nbsp; 
				Not all ditransitive verbs are likely to appear in requests for 
				things but a surprising number are and they form a teachable 
				unit.&nbsp; Here's a list:<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style41">bring<br />
						buy<br />
						call<br />
						draw<br />
						email</td>
						<td class="auto-style42">get<br />
						give<br />
						hand<br />
						lend<br />
						loan</td>
						<td class="auto-style42">order<br />
						pass<br />
						post<br />
						pour<br />
						promise</td>
						<td class="auto-style42">provide<br />
						read<br />
						reserve<br />
						sell<br />
						send</td>
						<td class="auto-style40">show<br />
						spare<br />
						tell<br />
						text<br />
						throw</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				and every one of these verbs can be fitted into a structure 
				which includes a softening pre-head (<em>please, can you, could 
				you</em> etc.) + the request (verb + indirect object + direct 
				object) and a post-head justification if one is needed.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please can you buy me some apples if you 
				pass the fruiterer?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please draw me a map so I don't get lost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you give me a few minutes?&nbsp; I need to think<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please post me the results<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you spare Peter a little time later?</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Please send my son the address because he needs to know 
				where to go</em><br />
				and, of course, the structure with <em>let ... have</em> fits 
				into the same sentence frame.<br />
				It is possible, with this simple structure, to generate hundreds 
				of perfectly grammatically correct and perfectly appropriate 
				requests for things and abstract entities and that can be done 
				at almost any level.<br />
				Once the structure is even partially automated, few errors will 
				be made and the focus can shift to the post-head justification 
				and other issues of, e.g., intonation and tone.<br />
				It is also the case that the simple elicitation of information 
				pattern which we saw above such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you tell me when the train leaves?</em><br />
				also falls into this patterns although the direct object is 
				normally a nominalised clause so it should be reasonably 
				familiar.<br />
				Some verbs, particularly, <em>give, show, send </em>and<em> tell</em>, 
				almost require the statement of the indirect object unless it 
				has been made clear from the context and co-text.</li>

			inviter holds all the cards and does not need to trouble to save the 
			face of the invitee or to be terribly polite and deferential.&nbsp; 
			The inviter has little to lose.<br />
			Of course, if this function is lumped in with the other forms of 
			requests we have outlined here, because there are obvious structural 
			parallels, then the speaker can sound too polite and deferential and 
			that will result in some confusion at least, suspicion at worse.</p>
			<p>Even here, however, most Anglophone cultures still persist in a 
			softening pre-head although it is often confined to an unelaborated
			<em>please</em> rather than the convoluted expressions with <em>
			I
			wonder if ..., could you see your way clear to ...</em> etc. which are often the pre-heads 
			of requests.&nbsp; We do not often find, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come with us to the park<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take some more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stay a while</em><br />
			etc. because even in this circumstance, bald imperative statements 
			are often felt to be too direct so we often prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Would you like to come for dinner?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please help yourself to more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you manage to stay a bit longer?<br />
			</em>etc.</p>

			<p>The issue with invitations is that the inviter is opening up to 
			the possibility of losing face should the invitation be rejected.&nbsp; 
			For this reason, among others, the invitation is often couched in 
			terms which imply a different form of request altogether, so, for 
			example, we may find:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if you have time to come for a drink 
			this evening? </em>(dressing an invitation as an elicitation of 
			information)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you spare the time to visit?</em> 
			(dressing an invitation as a request for action)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's take you to the pub this evening</em> 
			(dressing an invitation as a cohortation)<br />
			and, of course, the form of an invitation often parallels that of an 
			exhortation as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please stay for a bit</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			Teaching the language of invitation is also straightforward because 
			it is unlikely that any invitation, even one badly phrased will 
			cause any offence or be rejected because of its form.&nbsp; Any of 
			the kinds of expressions we have exemplified above will work 
			reasonably well.</p>

				<h3>Responding to invitations</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Responding to invitations is straightforward when the response 
			falls into the first, positive and preferred category.&nbsp; At other 
			times, it is exceedingly difficult to strike the right note and 
			learners of English may inadvertently cause offence.</p>
			<p>Preferred responses are straightforward and can be taught as 
			pre-fabricated chunks such as:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>I'd love to</em></li>
				<li><em>Yes, please.&nbsp; What time should I come?</em></li>
				<li><em>That sounds lovely</em></li>
				<li><em>Yes, of course.&nbsp; That's very kind of you</em></li>
			</ul>and so on.<p>However, care should be taken to make learners aware that 
			invitations differ from other forms of requests and that, therefore, 
			other positive responses appropriate elsewhere do sound odd or even 
			offensive so they should be careful to avoid, e.g.:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>Yes of course</em></li>
				<li><em>Yes, I will</em></li>
				<li><em>Of course, I will</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>all of which are responses to other sorts of requests.</p>
			<p>It is with dispreferred responses that the greatest care needs to 
			be taken because rejecting an invitation is, in many cultures, 
			including Anglophone ones, a serious face-threatening act.</p>
			<p>Outright rejection is quite rare and <strong>always, always</strong> 
			includes a reason for the rejection, however flimsy the excuse may 
			be.&nbsp; It is extremely rare to find, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry I can't come</em><br />
			and almost impossible to encounter<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, thanks, I don't want to come</em><br />
			better formulations include:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>I'd love to but I'm afraid I have to stay home because 
				I'm expecting a call from my sister</em></li>
				<li><em>Oh what a shame!&nbsp; I'm sorry.&nbsp; I'd love to but 
				I have to work late on Thursday</em></li>
				<li><em>Well, it's a lovely idea but I'm afraid I'm a bit old 
				for horse-riding!</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>such formulations will almost always include:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style36">
				<li>an expression of dismay such as <em>What a shame, What a 
				pity, Oh dear </em>etc.</li>
				<li>an apology such as <em>I'm afraid, I'm really sorry but ..</em> 
				etc.</li>
				<li>a reason for the rejection such as the ones above.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Points 1 and 2 can be taught as pre-fabricated language chunks 
			but point 3 requires a little imagination.</p>
			<p>Temporising responses are probably as common if not more common 
			than outright rejections and they need some attention because 
			getting the tone and language right is challenging even for native 
			speakers.&nbsp; They might include:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>Thursday's really difficult.&nbsp; Can we make it 
				another time?</em></li>
				<li><em>I'm not sure what my schedule is.&nbsp; Can I let you 
				know later in the week?</em></li>
				<li><em>I'll have to check my timetable for the month.&nbsp; 
				I'll call you back</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.<br />
			A key advantage of many temporising statements is that they prepare 
			the ground for a later rejection because the invitee has signalled 
			that there may be a problem and the inviter is prepared and 
			reconciled to that.&nbsp; Indeed, skilful speakers will often use a 
			temporising response in the knowledge that there will be a need for 
			a later outright rejection as a way of softening the latter.</p>

			<p>This has been a brief guide focusing only on four types of 
			requests but it is clear (or should be by now) that the different 
			forms that requests take: asking about, asking for, asking to and 
			inviting, require different structural and lexical realisations.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first moral, therefore, is to focus on each type in turn and 
			be thorough in teaching that before moving on.&nbsp; Jumbling the 
			types up will result in confusion and inappropriate language and 
			runs the risk of unnecessary offence being given.</li>
				<li>A phrase-book approach is rarely helpful but breaking the 
				area down into pre-head, head and post-phases is 
				often helpful.</li>
				<li>The next moral is to focus on both sides of the adjacency 
			pairings.&nbsp; There is little point in knowing, for example, how 
			to ask whether someone knows something unless one can also 
			understand what the response signifies.</li>
				<li>Being able to respond to a requestive is also a key communicative skill 
			in its own right but one needs to know how to form and deliver dispreferred 
			as well as preferred responses.</li>
				<li>Response types vary with request types, as we have seen, and 
				what is appropriate in one case is unlikely to be in another so, 
				while the acquisition of some language chunks is a very useful 
				thing to focus on, learners also need to be aware of the types 
				of requestives in which the chunks should be contained and the 
				response types in which they can be deployed.</li>
