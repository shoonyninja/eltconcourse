			<h2>Why is the skill important?</h2>
			<p>The ability to relate a story, tell an anecdote or explain what 
			has happened in life is useful for a number of purposes.<br />
			Think of three reasons why someone might want to relate an 
			experience
			<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'list1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			and then click here</a>.</p>
			<ol class="style_brown" id="list1" style="visibility:hidden">
				<li><strong>To oil the wheels of social interaction</strong>.&nbsp; 
				It has been suggested that almost half of all social interaction 
				consists of the relation of anecdote.&nbsp; Not to be adept at 
				doing so excludes people.</li>
				<li><strong>To illustrate a point of view</strong>.&nbsp; We 
				often use personal experience as exemplification for an opinion 
				we are putting forward.&nbsp; Often, the experience is explained 
				in terms of a story or anecdote.</li>
				<li><strong>To offer excuses and justification</strong>.&nbsp; 
				For example, excuses for lateness often require the relating of 
				why one is late and the justification or explanation for present 
				actions or states also often relies on relating what led up to 
				them.</li>

			<p>In a recount, we are simply setting out what happened.&nbsp; In a 
			narrative, we are following more closely the structure of fiction 
			which normally involves some kind of crisis or problem and sets out 
			its resolution.&nbsp; The latter is frequently the structure of 
			anecdote; the former of justification, explanation and illustration 
			of a point.</p>
			<p>Let's be clear: <strong><em>There is no point at all in teaching 
			the language and structures we typically use in relating stories 
			unless your learners know how to structure the tale.&nbsp; Their 
			first languages may well do it differently.</em></strong></p>
			<h3>Raising structural awareness</h3>
			<p>There are a number of ways to do this but one effective solution 
			is to take a genre approach to speaking / writing and analyse an 
			example before asking learners to construct a text.&nbsp; Here's a 
			way.</p>
			<p>Match the stages to the text by drawing arrows between 
			them.&nbsp; Click on the story when you have an answer.</p>
			
			<img id="img1" alt="narrative 1" height="399" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'../../imagesgraphics/narrative2.png')" src="../../imagesgraphics/narrative.png" width="749" />

				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>The focus on language in this area is often confined to the use 
			of what are referred to (somewhat loosely) as narrative tenses.&nbsp; 
			That is less than half the story but an important part of it.</p>
			<h3>tenses</h3>
			<p>There are separate guides to tense forms on this site that you 
			may like to look at.</p>
			<h4>the dramatic present</h4>
			<p>Usually narratives and recounts are set in the past with 
			past-tense forms being used.&nbsp; However, especially in spoken 
			English, the dramatic present can be used to add punch and 
			immediacy.&nbsp; For example, the speaker here could have said</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li><em>Suddenly a policeman appears and takes me out of the 
				queue.</em></li>
				<li><em>My girlfriend is waiting on the other side.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is quite easy to handle and may be appropriate, especially 
			at lower levels, because it allows learners to use familiar tense 
			forms naturally.</p>
			<h4>perfect aspects</h4>
			<p>Despite its usefulness, the <strong>past perfect </strong>is not 
			commonly used except for causally related events.&nbsp; However, 
			some skilful speakers might choose to orientate the listener 
			retrospectively with something like</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li><em>We had taken the ferry from Spain.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Notice that in this story the causal relationship is pointed out 
			with</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li><em>I was really upset because my girlfriend had already 
				passed through.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In stories intended to justify or excuse a present action or 
			state, the <strong>present perfect</strong> is common to set the scene.&nbsp; It is 
			also routinely used to set the scene in news reports (both written 
			and spoken) and is followed by a normal recount in the past.&nbsp; 
			It is not appropriate for our example story here, but we often get 
			sentences like</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li><em>I know I'm late but I've had a terrible time getting 
				here.</em></li>
				<li><em>Three men have been arrested following a police raid.&nbsp; 
				The arrests took place in ...</em></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>future in the past</h4>
			<p>At the complication stage of a narrative, when saying what the 
			problem was, the future in the past is common so we could get</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li><em>My girlfriend would have been in Morocco alone.</em></li>
				<li><em>If the barber hadn't arrived, I wouldn't ...</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note the use of speculative third conditional forms.&nbsp; It's 
			reasonably common in anecdotes.</p>
			<h4>past tenses</h4>
			<p>Most events are related in past simple because that is what they 
			are: finished past events.&nbsp; The finite is common, therefore.&nbsp; 
			In the example above, almost all the verbs are in the <strong>past 
			simple</strong>.<br />
			For background, we may use the <strong>progressive aspect</strong> 
			of the tense and could get, for example</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>
				<p class="redbulletlist"><em>The sun was shining brightly and it 
				was really hot.</em></p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this story, we <strong>do</strong> have</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">
				<p class="redbulletlist"><em>We were standing in the hot sun.</em></p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The second of these refers to progressive actions, the first to a 
			continuous event.</p>
			<h4>what goes where?</h4>
			<p>It is important to distinguish which tense forms are likely to 
			occur at which stage of the story.&nbsp; This means that you can 
			devote teaching time to each stage and really focus.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Orientation:</strong><br />
				present perfect &ndash; <em>I've had a terrible time this 
				morning ..., Customs officers have discovered ...<br />
				</em>past progressive &ndash; <em>I was sitting on the train 
				this morning when ..., We were travelling through France last 
				year and ...</em><br />
				past simple (event) &ndash; <em>This happened when I was in 
				Germany., She took the train this morning but ...</em><br />
				past simple (state) &ndash; <em>I was on holiday in Russia when 
				..., We were at university together and ...</em></li>
				<li><strong>Situations and events:</strong><em><br />
				</em>past simple<em> &ndash; A friend got on the bus.&nbsp; 
				Someone called to me.<br />
				</em>past perfect (causal)<em> &ndash; I recognised him because 
				..., I was frightened because the man had taken my passport.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Complications and problems:</strong><em><br />
				</em>future in the past<em> &ndash; I knew there would be a 
				problem because my visa was invalid.&nbsp; I thought the 
				policeman would arrest me.<br />
				</em>past simple (events) <em>&ndash; He stole my money.&nbsp; I 
				lost my wallet.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Coda:</strong><em><br />
				</em>Past simple (states)<em> &ndash; I felt ..., I thought ...</em></li>
			</ol>
			<h3>verb types</h3>
			<p>There is
			<a href="../verbs/verbalprocesses.html" target="_blank">a 
			separate guide to verbal processes</a> on this site which will 
			explain further.&nbsp; Briefly, because texts of this sort are used 
			to describe what happened, what people did and what they said about 
			it, we need to deploy and understand:</p>
			<ol class="redbulletlist">
				<li>MATERIAL processes (<em>the ferry docked, the policeman 
				pulled me out of the line</em> etc.)&nbsp; Events and states.</li>
				<li>BEHAVIOURAL processes (<em>I was upset, she was waiting</em> 
				etc.)&nbsp; How participants felt.</li>
				<li>VERBAL processes (<em>the police officer said </em>etc.)&nbsp; 
				Who said what to whom.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For the coda at the end, the personal comment on the story, we 
			also need to use a MENTAL process verb such as <em>I thought, I felt
			</em>etc.</p>
			<h3>circumstances</h3>
			<p>There is also
			<a href="../lexicogrammar/circumstances.html" target="_blank">a 
			separate guide to circumstances</a> on this site.&nbsp; The 
			important ones for our purposes here are:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style9" style="width: 70%">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style10"><strong>Circumstance</strong></td>
				<td class="auto-style10"><strong>Examples from the text</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style15">EXTENT</td>
				<td class="auto-style10"><em>for what seemed like a very long 
				time<br />
				in the end</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style15">LOCATION</td>
				<td class="auto-style10"><em>to the front of the queue<br />
				in the 70s</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style15">CAUSE</td>
				<td class="auto-style10"><em>to make myself respectable<br />
				as my girlfriend had already passed through</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style15">ACCOMPANIMENT</td>
				<td class="auto-style10"><em>with my girlfriend<br />
				in the queue</em></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Learners need to be able to handle these before they can relate 
			effectively.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="teaching skill" height="166" src="../../images/form_potter250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style22">

			<p>Here's a summary.</p>
			
			<img alt="teaching relating experiences" height="319" src="../../imagesgraphics/narrativeteaching.png" width="649" />
			<p>The ordering of events may depend on you, your class and their 
			needs.&nbsp; However, make sure that at least the learners know how 
			a typical text is staged and structured (steps 1 to 3) before you go 
			on to the rest or the outcomes will be disappointing (for everyone).<br />
			At lower levels in particular, you need to break the story down into 
			its stages and teach the language that is required for that stage 
			only.&nbsp; You should not expect learners to produce the whole 
			story from scratch in one lesson (or even one day).</p>
