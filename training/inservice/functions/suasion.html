			<h1>Suasion and Hortation</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="suasion" height="207" src="../../images/mousetrap310.jpg" width="310" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>There is also <a href="../discourse/semantics.html" target="_blank">a guide 
			to semantics</a> which covers some of the differences between 
			sentence meaning and utterance meaning.&nbsp; Here we are concerned 
			with utterance meaning.<br />
			There is also <a href="../modality/mood.html" target="_blank">a 
			guide to mood</a> in general on this site which covers some of the 
			more theoretical aspects of of how language is used to express 
			wishes and unreal states rather than indicating current reality.</p>
			<p>Here are some examples of what this guide is about:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>I wish it would rain.</em></li>
				<li><em>If only it would rain.</em></li>
				<li><em>Leave me alone, dammit!</em></li>
				<li><em>You shall leave now.</em></li>
				<li><em>Long may it last.</em></li>
				<li><em>Dogs are to be carried on the escalators.</em></li>
				<li><em>Don’t you dare talk to me like that!</em></li>
				<li><em>Let’s go.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>All of these sentences are intended to affect the behaviour of 
			others or to express a hope that the world were different.&nbsp; They advise, oblige or suggest at variable levels of 
			intensity.&nbsp; A mouse trap is designed to affect the behaviour of 
			mice.&nbsp; We can do this linguistically, too.</p>
			<p>You may not be familiar with the term <strong>suasion</strong>; 
			few are, to be honest.&nbsp; It was defined by Wilkins as<em>:</em></p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>the category of utterance designed 
			to affect the behaviour of others</em><span class="smallfont"><br />
			<span class="auto-style17">(Wilkins, 1976: 46)</span></span></p>
			<p>Other analyses speak of hortatory sentences.&nbsp; That's the 
			line taken here.<br />
			(Lots of course materials and teaching guides chop this 
			area up into misty concepts such as s<em>uggesting, requesting </em>
			and<em> demanding</em>.&nbsp; That is too vague for our purposes.)</p>
			<p><strong>Hortative</strong> derives from the Latin <em>hortatorius</em> 
			meaning <em>encouraging</em> or <em>cheering</em> (think gladiators, 
			Ben Hur and chariot races and you have the idea).<br />
			In some languages (such as Japanese and early European languages 
			like Ancient Greek) a special grammatical tense form or modal 
			category is reserved for what is known as hortative sentences.&nbsp; 
			However, most modern languages have lost the special case reserved 
			for such things.&nbsp; These days, we prefer just to talk about the 
			function and the word for it is <strong>suasion</strong> – i.e., 
			persuading and dissuading.<br />
			<span class="auto-style13">(The topic of suasion gets a section to 
			itself in the Council of Europe publications which are available on 
		the web:<br />

			<p>The divisions set out here are not the only possible way to analyse

					<h2>1. The 
					optative</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The optative expresses wishes and hopes.&nbsp; Usually, the 
			optative is directed at things or situations we cannot personally affect or 
			change.&nbsp; In this respect, it is not really an example of 
			suasion but it belongs in this area.<br />
			However, it is in any case not always a straightforward matter to 
			distinguish between optative statements addressed to hopes about the 
			world at large and and hortative ones addressed to individuals or 
			groups.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish you wouldn't do that</em><br />
			is actually hortative (i.e., intended to persuade others to alter 
			their behaviour) but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish he wouldn't do that</em><br />
			is optative insofar as it is not addressed to the person involved 
			(who may not even be present).<br />
			It's easy to see that changing the person of the pronoun from second 
			to third (<em>you</em> to <em>he / she / it / they</em>) or vice 
			versa <em>(he /she / it / they</em> to <em>you</em>) may make the 
			utterance shift between hortative (<em>you</em>) and optative (<em>he 
			/ she / it / they</em>).</p>
			<p>English does this in a 
			number of ways.&nbsp; Can you think of two ways to express wishes 
			and hopes in English?<br />

			<ol id="optative" class="style_brown">
				<li>The most obvious one is <strong>using the words </strong> <em>
				<strong>wish</strong></em><strong> or </strong> <em>
				<strong>hope</strong>.<br />
				</em>Some languages (including yours or your students'?) don’t distinguish the 
				ideas of <em>
				hope </em>and<em>
				expect </em>but English does.<br />
				The forms are slightly tricky.&nbsp; English often uses the verb 
				<em>will</em> and its past tense form, <em>would</em>, after these optative verbs 
				and that causes some trouble because <em>would</em> has two different 
				functions:<ol class="auto-style9">
					<li>As an expression of a wish concerning the (usually 
					immediate) future that is unlikely to be fulfilled, 
				for example:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish it would get warmer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish you were coming to my party<br />
					</em>In this sense, the use parallels the form of unreal 
					conditionals such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it were warmer, we could eat in 
					the garden</em></li>
					<li>To express an unfulfilled wish in the past tense, where 
					<em>would</em> is the 
					past of <em>will</em>.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished the rain would stop</em><br />
					Here are some more examples.&nbsp; All the clauses here can be 
				connected using <em>that</em>:<ul class="redbullet" >
						<li><em>I wish (that) it would rain<br /></em>present tense of 
						<em>wish</em> + 
					<em>would</em> clause to express the speaker's view that rain 
						is unlikely but desired</li>
						<li><em>I hope (that) it rains<br /></em>present of <em>hope</em> + present tense clause 
						to express slightly more certainty that it will in fact 
						rain</li>
						<li><em>I hope (that) it'll rain</em><br />present tense of 
						<em>hope</em> plus <em>will</em> clause to express 
						slightly more certainty that it will in fact rain</li>
						<li><em>I wished (that) it would rain<br /></em>past of 
						<em>wish</em> + 
					<em>would</em> 
					clause to set the desired event / state in the past</li>
						<li><em>I hoped (that) it would rain<br /></em>past of 
						<em>hope</em> with a 
					<em>would</em> clause to set the desired event / state in the past</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The use of the word <em>wish</em> is also slightly 
				anomalous.<ol class="auto-style9">
					<li>When used with actions or events, the convention is to 
					follow it with <em>would</em> as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish he would stop talking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish you would listen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish you would be more sensitive</em><br />
					etc.&nbsp; The last example, incidentally, is the dynamic 
					use of the verb <em>be</em>, not its use to refer to a state 
					so it is akin to an action.</li>
					<li>When the verb is used to refer to states, then the 
					subjunctive form of the verb <em>be</em> is conventional as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish it were warmer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wishes he were ten years younger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish she were here</em><br />
					etc. and often, in colloquial speech, the subjunctive form 
					can be replaced by the indicative so we also allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish it was warmer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wishes he was ten years younger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish she was here</em><br />
					although this usage is avoided in formal writing and speech.</li>
					<li>When the verb is used to express a forlorn hope (i.e., 
					one which the speaker / writer does not think will be 
					fulfilled), the verb <em>wish</em> is usually followed by 
					the past form as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish you studied harder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish she came more often<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish she was working with me</em></li>
					<li>The progressive form of the verb follows <em>wish</em> 
					when the speaker wants to emphasise an alternative to the 
					present but the simple form is used when we are thinking of 
					an habitual state or condition that we want fulfilled.&nbsp; 
					We get, therefore:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I lived in a larger house</em><br />
					i.e.,<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would prefer to live permanently in 
					a larger house</em><br />
					vs.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I were living in a larger 
					house</em><br />
					i.e.,<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be convenient at the moment 
					if my house were larger</em></li>
					<li>When the verb itself is in the past, two forms are possible:<ol class="auto-style12">
						<li>past tenses, the subjunctive or <em>would</em> 
						express the fact that the thing wished for and the 
						wishing happened at the same time:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished he studied harder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished she came more often<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished she was working with me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished the rain would stop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished she were here<br />
						</em>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He wished he were ten years 
						younger<br />
						</em>These uses refer to a state or event in the past 
						that the speaker / writer perceives as impossible or 
						highly improbable.</li>
						<li>past perfect forms express that the wish is for an 
						event which did not occur before the wish was expressed:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished he had studied harder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished she had come more often<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished she had been working with me<br />
						</em>The reference, here, is to events which the speaker 
						/ writer knows are impossible because they are in the 
						past.<br />The form is, however, not usually available to refer to 
						states so:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?I wished it had been warmer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?He wished he had been ten years younger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?I wished she had been here<br />
						</em>are all rare to the point of non-existence.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>The </strong> <em><strong>if only</strong></em><strong> structure</strong> is common:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only it 
				would rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only the sun would shine<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				For states, rather than actions, the subjunctive form is 
				preferred as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only he were wealthier</em><br />
				When the sense is negative, as it often is, in for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only it weren't so cold</em><br />
				the mood is called imprecative (wishing for something not to 
				occur).&nbsp; (The term is also, incidentally, applied to any 
				sentence containing a swear word.)<br />
				See below under the subjunctive for more examples.<br />
				This structure can also be employed in the past to express 
				regret or that a wish was not fulfilled as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only I hadn't been so rash<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only the sun had shone</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>More formal expressions with old uses of <strong>the modal 
				auxiliary verb
				</strong> <em><strong>may</strong></em> such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				May the force be with you.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				May he live a 
				thousand years</em>.<br />
				This is poetic or formal (hence the 
				use in Star Wars, by the way, to give the impression of ancient 
				knights going out to defend the kingdom and so on).&nbsp; A 
				similar form occurs regularly in many other languages and in 
				songs in English (see the footnote for an example).<br />
				The verb cannot be used in the past in this meaning to express 
				regret or unfulfilled hopes so we do not allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *May the food have arrived before us</em></li>
				<li>A formal expression with <em><strong>let</strong></em>, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let it 
				rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the sun shine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let it be light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him be promoted<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				This is rare 
				and a subjunctive use of the main verb.<br />
				It cannot happily be used to refer to unfulfilled past wishes 
				and hopes so we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Let him have been promoted</em></li>
				<li><strong>The subjunctive</strong>:<ol class="auto-style5">
					<li>We have some leftover phrases from Old English using the 
					present subjunctive as in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God save the Queen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long live Che 
					Guevara<br />
					</em>and so on.&nbsp; You can tell it’s the present 
					subjunctive by the missing ‘-s’ inflexion on the verb.&nbsp; 
					There's
					<a href="../modality/subjunctive.html" target="_blank">a 
					guide to the subjunctive</a> on this site.</li>
					<li>We sometimes use the past subjunctive after <em>if only</em>, 
					e.g.<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only he left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only she didn’t talk so much<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					If only I were clever<br />
					</em>It is more common to use 
					<em>would</em> (see 1.) but <em>would</em> cannot be used 
					for states so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *If only I would be clever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *If only he would be here</em><br />
					are not available and we use the subjunctive after <em>if 
					only</em> as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only I were clever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only he were here<br />
					</em>Unlike the use of the subjunctive after <em>wish</em>, 
					the replacement with the indicative is rarer and:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only I was clever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only he was clever<br />
					</em>are less acceptable, even in informal speech.</li>
					<li>We also have an odd past subjunctive which is much like 
					the <em>wish</em> construction.&nbsp; For example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would 
					that it rained<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the rain only came<br />
					</em>etc.<br />
					It’s also quite rare.</li>
					<li>Less rare is the use of the subjunctive to refer to past 
					hopes (usually unrealised) as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would that he had asked before he 
					went<br />
					</em>expressing regrets.</li>
					<li><em>wish</em> itself is often followed by the 
					subjunctive as we saw above as in, e.g.<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish he were here</em>.</li>

			</table>
			<p>The hortative is the name given to utterances which attempt to

			<ol>
				<li>We encourage someone else to do something.<br />
				This is 
				called the <strong>exhortative</strong>.</li>
				<li>We try to get someone to cooperate with us in doing 
				something.<br />
				This is called the <strong>cohortative</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Can you think of a few of the ways we do this in English?&nbsp;
			<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'hortative',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have a note</a>.</p>
			<ol class="style_brown" id="hortative" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
				<li><strong>Exhortative:</strong> i.e., encouraging someone else 
				to do something.&nbsp; The uses are almost always in the second 
				person.<br />
				In English we frequently use modal auxiliary verbs of 
				obligation as in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should try the dark beer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must try 
				the dark beer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You ought to try the dark beer<br />
				</em>and so on.<br />
				These uses of modal auxiliary verbs are not imperatives in this case but 
				variations in the strength of encouragement.<br />
				Many other modal auxiliary verbs are possible:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might try ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Could you (please) ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Would you mind ...</em><br />
				All of these uses of modal auxiliary verbs can be described as
				<strong>deontic</strong> insofar as they refer to some form of 
				obligation.<br />
				We also use 
				the bare imperative form as in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try the dark beer!<br />
				</em>and 
				sometimes soften it with <em>just</em> as in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just try the 
				dark beer!</em></li>
				<li><strong>Cohortative:</strong> i.e., encouraging cooperative 
				behaviour.&nbsp; These uses are almost always first person 
				plural.<br />
				In English, the most common way is the <em>let’s</em> construction which contains the only example of the 
				abbreviated <em>us</em> in English.&nbsp; To use the full form,
					<em>let us</em>, is considered formal and mostly reserved for 
				written language or prepared statements and speeches.<br />
					The contracted <em>let’s</em> construction is always 
				cohortative.&nbsp; If you say it in full, it usually becomes an 
				imperative.&nbsp;
				Compare:<ol class="auto-style9" >
					<li><em>Let us go</em> 
				(usually meaning <em>Release us!</em>).&nbsp; It is possible to 
				use this full form as a cohortative but it sounds odd and may be 
						ambiguous.<br />
						In writing, it is more common, especially as a form of 
						conjunct in, e.g., <em>Let us now go on to consider ... </em>
						etc.</li>
					<li><em>Let’s go</em> (meaning <em>I am encouraging 
				you to cooperate in leaving now</em>)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Other constructions are possible:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall we ... ?
				</em>(only cohortative)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					How about ... ? </em>(cohortative and exhortative)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					What about ... ? </em>(cohortative and exhortative)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Why don't we ... ? </em>(cohortative but exhortative when we 
				change the pronoun to <em>you</em>)<br /><em></em>and they carry varying strengths of persuasive force.&nbsp;
					<em>How about ... </em>and <em>What about ... </em>are the 
					weakest of them.&nbsp; The exhortative expression <em>Why 
				don't you ...</em> can carry a strong imperative sense.</li>
				<li>Hortative verbs:<br />
				These verbs are sometimes dealt with as verbs followed by a <em>
				to</em>-infinitive and fall into the realm of catenative verbs.&nbsp; 
				That is not the line taken on this site because the insertion of 
				the indirect object often breaks the chain.<br />
				There is a range of verbs, almost all of which are to do with 
				suasion of some kind which take a direct nominalised clause with 
				the <em>to-</em>infinitive as the object.<br />
				The structure they conform to is:<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">

				* This verb is only used with a negative clause as its object.<br />
				As we saw, none of these verbs is properly catenative in the 
				active voice but all may be seen that way in the passive.&nbsp; 
				We get, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was compelled to leave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was persuaded to come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were paid to go</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				For our purposes, these are analysed as verbs taking nominalised
				<em>to-</em>infinitive clauses as their objects rather than as 
				catenative verbs <em>per se</em>.</li>

			<p>The imperative is the form we use to oblige someone else to do 
			something, and it also comes in four main flavours.<br />
			Can you think of two ways we oblige other people to do, or not to 
			do, things in English?<br />
			<a href="#3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'imperatives',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have a note</a>.</p>
			<ol  class="style_brown" id="imperatives" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
				<li><strong>The imperative</strong> itself, of course.&nbsp; The form of the 
				imperative is very simple in English and its effect can 
				range from an absolute demand to a mild suggestion or polite 
				request (i.e. a 
				hortative).&nbsp; Examples are:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Leave me alone, dammit!<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Get 
				off my land!<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Give me a moment to think, please.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Just wait a 
				moment.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Don’t drink that!<br />
				</em>and so on.<br />
				We soften imperatives with words like <em>kindly, please</em>, <em>just</em> 
				etc. or make them more demanding by using intonation and 
				swearing.<br />
				Adding a question tag (with rising intonation and greater 
				stress) often has the effect of intensifying the imperative:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just do it, will you?</em><br />
				Three notes:<ol class="auto-style9">
					<li>There is in English no progressive imperative 
				(you can’t say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be going!<br />
					</em>for example) as is possible in 
				some languages.</li>
					<li>The negative imperative in English uses the <em>do</em> 
					operator as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't go there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please don't ask</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>The omission of the subject is somewhat unusual in that 
					a finite clause in English usually needs a subject.&nbsp; 
					However, it can be inserted for emphasis as in e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You stop now</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					Because this is an emphatic use, it cannot be softened in 
					any way so, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Please you don't do it</em><br />
					is unavailable.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Modal auxiliary verbs</strong> of obligation (deontic uses):<br />
				These include:<ol class="auto-style9">
					<li>The obvious <em>must</em> and <em>have to</em> forms as 
					in, e.g.,<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must not let him come.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					You have to arrive before 9.</em></li>
					<li>Depending 
				on context and intonation, other modal auxiliary verbs can express obligation 
				as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should attend the examination at 09:00</em> (which is not 
				advice)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shall leave now.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					You will not write.<br />
					</em>The last two of these uses are rare and very formal.</li>
					<li>A less frequently noted modal in this respect is <em>dare</em> as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t you dare talk to me like that!<br />
					</em>It is only possible to use <em>dare</em> as a 
					negative imperative as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't you dare try that!</em><br />
					and the positive imperative, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Dare do it</em><br />
					is not available in English.</li>
					<li>In question forms, other 
				modal auxiliary verbs appear as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you stop that please?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Would you come here a minute?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Would you mind opening the window?<br />
					</em>These uses of <em>can </em>and<em> would </em>as 
					imperatives often depend on the relationship between speaker 
					and hearer, i.e., who is in 
				authority.&nbsp; The greater the power gap between speakers, the 
					greater will be the imperative force.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The lexical or main verb <em><strong>need</strong></em> is used to 
				soften imperatives by reducing the threat that a simple 
				imperative would imply.&nbsp; The verb is often used in the 
				passive in this case or in a way which implies an external 
				constraint or demand.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get these figures to the manager today, 
				please</em><br />
				threatens the face of the hearer because the speaker is assuming 
				or exercising authority but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; These figures need to be given to the manager</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manager needs these figures</em><br />
				reduce the threat to the hearer's face, although the force of 
				the imperative may not be weakened.</li>
				<li><strong>The </strong> <em><strong>if only</strong></em><strong> structure 
				</strong>can be used as an imperative, too, as 
				in, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only you would shut up<br />
				</em>but it’s uncommon.</li>
				<li><strong>The present tense of </strong> <em><strong>be</strong></em>.<br />
				This is generally reserved for 
				notices and very formal statements such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children are not to 
				run in the corridors.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Dogs are to be carried on the escalators<br />
				</em>and so on.<br />
				It is equivalent in strength to the use of <em>must</em>.<br />
				There is a rather odd use in the past tense, e.g.<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You 
				were to come at 6 o’clock<br />
				</em>which is a rare instance 
				of a past imperative in English and usually implies a complaint 
				that the obligation was not fulfilled.</li>
				<li>On notices and commands, English uses a very simple form – 
				<strong>the word </strong> <em><strong>no</strong></em> followed by a noun 
				(verbal or otherwise).&nbsp; For example<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No entry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No 
				smoking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No talking<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				Sometimes just the noun will do:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence in court!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smoking forbidden</em></li>
				<li><strong>Softened imperatives</strong><br />English habitually softens the imperative mood in a number 
				of 
				ways.&nbsp; The usual reason for this is to save the face of the 
				hearer by disguising the authority which the imperative implies.&nbsp; 
				For example:<ol  class="auto-style9">
					<li>We use a passive:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do that now<br />
					</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That 
					needs to be done now</em>.</li>
					<li>We use the first person plural:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must do it today<br />
					</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must get it done today</em>.</li>
					<li>We attribute the imperative to a third party:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get 
					the accounts up to date today<br />
					</em>vs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The taxman wants 
					up-to-date accounts today</em>.</li>
					<li>The use of <em>please</em>:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please open the door</em><br />
					but this is not available, as we saw above, with imperatives 
					emphasised by the use of the pronoun.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			<h2>The summary</h2>
			<p>As was stated above, the optative really doesn't fall neatly into 
			the area of suasion but, in English at least, similar forms are used 
			and the language is intended to affect the behaviour of someone or 
			something other than the speaker (even when it is clear that there 
			is no possibility of its happening).<br />
			Conceptually, and for 
			teaching purposes, it seems sensible to include it here.</p>

			<h3>Structural issues</h3>
			<p>The important issue is to look carefully at the forms of the 
			various realisations of the functions.&nbsp; There is something of a 
			mishmash.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>wish</em> and <em>hope</em> are followed by <em>would</em> 
				clauses, with or without a connecting <em>that</em>.&nbsp; Tense 
				structures with <em>wish</em>, in particular, can be complex and 
				include the use of the subjunctive.</li>
				<li><em>if only</em> can be followed by a <em>would</em> clause 
				(with or without <em>that</em>) and is also followed by a 
				subjunctive form.</li>
				<li><em>let's, shall we</em> and <em>why don't we</em> are 
				followed by the bare infinitive but <em>how about</em> and <em>
				what about</em> are frequently followed by a gerund.</li>
				<li>many of the grammatical realisations are rare or only formal 
				(or both).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It makes sense, especially at lower levels, therefore, carefully 
			to select realisations which have parallel forms and to teach the 
			area piecemeal.&nbsp; Trying to introduce too many forms and too 
			many levels of intensity will confuse and disorientate your 
			learners.</p>
			<p>The imperative in English is a very simple form often taught very 
			early in a learner's career but there are some constraints on its 
			use and subtle ways to limit the presumption of authority as we saw 
			above.</p>
			<h3>Meaning issues</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><em>wish</em> is followed by past forms because, by its 
				nature, the verb is used to refer to hypothetical or unreal 
				statements.&nbsp; In this sense, it mirrors the use of unreal 
				conditional forms such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I were twenty years younger, I'd ask 
				her to marry me<br />
				</em>A short poem is a useful way to help learners remember the 
				forms:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I loved the Human Race;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I loved its silly face;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I liked the way it walks;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I liked the way it talks;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when I'm introduced to one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I thought What Jolly Fun!</em><br />
				<span class="auto-style56">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walter Alexander 
				Raleigh, Wishes of an Elderly Man, Wished at a Garden Party, 
				June 1914</span></li>
				<li>the line between imperative and hortative statements is not 
				clear cut.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have some more cake<br />
				</em>is usually hortative although it looks like an imperative<br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have some sympathy<br />
				</em>is imperative in meaning.<br />
				For teaching purposes, it is very important that the 
				illocutionary force of the forms is made clear.</li>
				<li>the use of modal auxiliary verbs is very variable in terms of the strength 
				of hortation / imperative and is radically affected by 
				intonation.</li>
				<li>the role relationship between speaker and hearer (i.e. the 
				tenor of the discourse) is a key 
				issue.&nbsp; For example, between equals a statement such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				You have to try harder<br />
				</em>may be exhortatory but between a 
				boss and an employee, it becomes an imperative.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Setting a clear context for any presentation or practice is, 
			therefore, even more important than usual.</p>
			<h3>Pronunciation issues</h3>
			<p>Allied to the meaning and context concerns is the use of 
			intonation and stress.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Falling intonation towards the end on:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why don't we do it?<br />
				</em>may 
				indicate an imperative but rising intonation is more likely to 
				indicate a cohortative.</li>
				<li>Stressing the modal auxiliary verb will normally increase its intensity.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It's important that the role of pronunciation is given prominence 
			in teaching this area or you risk your learners sounding imperative 
			when they mean to be hortative and <em>vice versa.</em></p>
			<p>A very rough rule of thumb regarding level is:</p>

			<p class="smallfont">Footnote on <em>may</em>:<br />
			A good example of the use of <em>may</em> as an optative modal 
			auxiliary verb is in this song by Bob Dylan, <em>Forever Young</em>:<br />
			<em>May God bless and keep you always<br />
			May your wishes all come true<br />
			May you always do for others<br />
			And let others do for you<br />
			May you build a ladder to the stars<br />
			And climb on every rung<br />
			May you stay forever young<br />
			Forever young, forever young<br />
			May you stay forever young.<br />
			<br />
			May you grow up to be righteous<br />
			May you grow up to be true<br />
			May you always know the truth<br />
			And see the lights surrounding you<br />
			May you always be courageous<br />
			Stand upright and be strong<br />
			May you stay forever young<br />
			Forever young, forever young<br />
			May you stay forever young.<br />
			<br />
			May your hands always be busy<br />
			May your feet always be swift<br />
			May you have a strong foundation<br />
			When the winds of changes shift<br />
			May your heart always be joyful<br />
			And may your song always be sung<br />
			May you stay forever young<br />
			Forever young, forever young<br />
			May you stay forever young.</em></p>
