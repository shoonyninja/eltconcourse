			<p>By their nature, many expressions of apology imply the commission 
			of some kind of error.<br />
			In many western, Anglophone cultures, people tend admit error quite freely but 
			in other societies, error is something to be ashamed of and rarely 
			admitted casually for fear of loss of face.<br />
			This, like many other functions, is an area that needs to be handled 
			with cultural sensitivity and care.&nbsp; In particular, the first 
			form of apology, identified below, is culturally conditioned in 
			terms of language use.&nbsp; Some languages have very elaborate 
			gradations of guilt admission and these are hard to translate into 
			English because English relies on a much more limited range of 
			exponents.</p>

			<p>In many teaching handbooks, coursebooks and worthy websites, 
			learners are simply presented with a phrase-book approach to 
			expressing apologies.&nbsp; Such phrases are often classified under headings 
			such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apologising for small things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apologising formally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Apologising in writing<br />
			</em>and so on.<br />
			While the lists are probably 
			helpful for some teaching purposes, learners need a bit more 
			guidance.&nbsp; There is more than one sort of apology and how we 
			express it often depends on what sort it is.<br />
			Here's short list for you to classify.&nbsp; What kinds of apology 
			are represented by these 5 sentences?<br />
			<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'list1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have an answer</a>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>I'm sorry I'm late</em></li>
				<li><em>I'm sorry to interrupt but ...</em></li>
				<li><em>I'm sorry to hear about your problems</em></li>
				<li><em>I'm sorry if you feel upset by what I said (but I stand 
				by it)</em></li>
				<li><em>I'm sorry.&nbsp; Can you repeat that, please?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<ol id="list1" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">
				<li><em>I'm sorry I'm late<br />
				</em>This is clearly an apology which carries an unspoken 
				admission of guilt.&nbsp; There is also a strong implication here 
				that the speaker will try to avoid the situation happening 
				again.&nbsp; It is frequently followed by an excuse such as <em>
				The bus broke down.</em></li>
				<li><em>I'm sorry to interrupt but ...<br />
				</em>This admits no guilt and implies, in fact, that the speaker 
				would do this again, given the same situation.&nbsp; It's the 
				use of <em>Sorry</em> or <em>Excuse me</em> when pushing through 
				a crowd or taking a seat in the cinema.</li>
				<li><em>I'm sorry to hear about your problems<br />
				</em>This states clearly that the speaker is not responsible for 
				the hearer's problems but is simply commiserating and expressing 
				some kind of solidarity.</li>
				<li><em>I'm sorry if you feel upset by what I said (but I stand 
				by it)<br />
				</em>This admits no guilt at all and often expresses slight 
				surprise that the hearer is upset.&nbsp; The speaker does not 
				feel that he/she has done anything wrong at all.</li>
				<li><em>I'm sorry.&nbsp; Can you repeat that, please?<br />
				</em>The term <em>Excuse me</em> (particularly in AmE) often substitutes for<em> I'm 
				sorry</em> here. <em>&nbsp;</em>The speaker is aware that there 
				may be some inconvenience for the hearer and regrets that but 
				accepts no responsibility and expresses no guilt.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The sort of language used to apologise will depend 
			on the kind of apology which is meant.</p>
			<p>In what follows, the assumption is that you know how to present 
			the language of apology and can come up with a range of exponents in 
			English such as</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>Sorry!</em></li>
				<li><em>I'm (really / so / very / terribly / deeply / ever so) sorry 
				that ...</em></li>
				<li><em>How stupid / careless / thoughtless of me</em></li>
				<li><em>Can you forgive me for ...</em></li>
				<li><em>Pardon (me) / I beg your pardon</em></li>
				<li><em>That's my fault, I'm afraid</em></li>
				<li><em>Sorry. It was all my fault</em></li>
				<li><em>Please excuse my </em>+ behaviour of some kind</li>
				<li><em>Please don't be angry about </em>+ situation</li>
				<li><em>Please accept our sincere apologies</em></li>
				<li><em>We would like to apologise unreservedly for ...</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The issue here is not just locating a range of exponents but 
			setting the teaching of them in the context of what sort of apology is meant &ndash; 
			i.e., focusing on <strong>appropriacy</strong> and <strong>speaker's 
			intention</strong>.</p>

			<p>This is what most people understand by the term <em>apology</em>.&nbsp; 
			It's the prototype.&nbsp; In fact, it's often the only type teachers 
			consider when they come to teaching the function.<br />
			Utterances such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm very sorry for forgetting your birthday<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I'm sorry I broke the glass<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The management apologises for the inconvenience</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must apologise for forgetting the meeting</em><br />
			come with two important implications:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>regret</strong></dt>
			<dd>this kind of apology implies that the speaker / writer would go 
			back and repair the situation if that were possible.&nbsp; The 
			implied wish is that it had never happened.</dd>
			<dt><strong>commitment</strong></dt>
			<dd>this kind of apology often implies a tacit or expressed 
			commitment to ensuring that it will not recur.<br />
			Expressions of apology are often explicitly followed by, e.g.<br />
			<em>... it won't happen again<br />
			... I'll get you another<br />
			... we will refund any costs plus 10%</em><br />
			<em>... I'll make sure I check my diary more often</em><br />
			etc.</dd>
		</dl>
			<p>Expressions using <span class="style_black"><em>Excuse me</em></span> 
			or <span class="style_black"><em>Pardon</em></span> are very rarely 
			appropriate for these types of apology because they do not usually 
			imply any real or sincere regret.&nbsp; However, the verb
			<span class="style_black"><em>apologise</em></span> and expressions 
			with <span class="style_black"><em>sorry</em></span> are frequently 
			used.<br />
			If this is not clear to learners, you will encourage stylistic 
			errors such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Excuse me for breaking the glass<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*Please excuse the management for ...<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I beg your pardon for forgetting the meeting</em><br />
			and so on.</p>

			<p>This kind of apology does not carry a sense of guilt 
			or remorse and is just a way to soften the inconvenience 
			caused to others.<br />
			The two implications are:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>no regret</strong></dt>
			<dd>this kind of apology implies that the speaker / writer would 
			repeat the action if circumstances require it.&nbsp; There is no 
			implied wish is that it had never happened.</dd>
			<dt><strong>no commitment</strong></dt>
			<dd>this kind of apology does not require any commitment.&nbsp; In 
			fact, to give one constitutes a pragmatic error such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Excuse me but I think that's my seat and it won't happen again.</em></dd>
		</dl>
			<p>Apologies of this kind rarely use the verbs
			<span class="style_black"><em>apologise</em></span> and
			<span class="style_black"><em>regret</em></span>, although phrases 
			containing <span class="style_black"><em>sorry, excuse me, forgive 
			me but</em></span> are 
			common.&nbsp; For example: </p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>Sorry, can I just say that ...</em></li>
				<li><em>Excuse me, can I get through, please?</em></li>
				<li><em>Forgive me for interrupting here.</em></li>
				<li><em>Excuse me .... Sorry about that<br />
				</em>This is a common formula 
				for getting to a seat or getting through a crowd.&nbsp; The 
				action of pushing is preceded by <span class="style_black"><em>
				Excuse me</em></span> and then followed by
				<span class="style_black"><em>Sorry</em></span>.</li>

			<p>The sympathy apology also has a number of implications:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>regret</strong></dt>
			<dd>the speaker / writer clearly regrets that the situation or event 
			has occurred and wishes that it hadn't or were less serious.<br />
			There is a sense of regret but none of remorse.</dd>
			<dt><strong>no responsibility</strong></dt>
			<dd>the speaker takes no personal responsibility for the event or 
			situation.&nbsp; There is, therefore, no acceptance of guilt at 
			all.&nbsp; In other words, the speaker is saying,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I regret this 
			and would change it if I could but it's nothing to do with me.</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>possible commitment</strong></dt>
			<dd>this kind of apology does not require any commitment but some is 
			often made.&nbsp; Usually, this involves the use of some modality 
			in offers such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I regret he's upset you.&nbsp; I'll speak to him about 
			it.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I'm sorry to hear about that.&nbsp; Is there anything I can do?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I'm sorry to hear this.&nbsp; Would it help if I came with you?</em></dd>
		</dl>
			
			<p>This form of apology has a very limited number of 
			exponents, confined almost to <span class="style_black"><em>I'm 
			sorry</em></span> and <span class="style_black"><em>I regret</em></span> in fact.<br />
			The use of the verb <span class="style_black"><em>apologise</em></span> 
			is not appropriate and nor is the use of <span class="style_black">
			<em>Excuse me</em></span> or expressions with
			<span class="style_black"><em>pardon</em></span>.</p>

			<p>This is a pseudo-apology very often expressed with a structure 
			using <em>if</em>.<br />
			It has three implications:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>no regret at all</strong></dt>
			<dd>the speaker / writer does not regret that the other 
			person is upset in some way and 
			would act in the same way in the same situation.</dd>
			<dt><strong>reversal of responsibility</strong></dt>
			<dd>the speaker is implying that it is the other person's 
			fault for feeling upset or injured in some way.&nbsp; This is what 
			is meant by guilt shifting.</dd>
			<dt><strong>no commitment</strong></dt>
			<dd>this kind of apology does not require any commitment from the 
			speaker and to make one results in pragmatic error.&nbsp; E.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'm sorry I've upset you.&nbsp; I'll change my opinions 
			immediately<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I apologise for the inconvenience.&nbsp; I'll change my 
			behaviour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'm sorry if you don't like the colour of my house.&nbsp; I'll 
			have it repainted</em></dd>
		</dl>
			
			<p>These expressions frequently carry more than a hint of 
			sarcasm so getting the tone right is important.<br />
			The guilt-shift only works with the emphasis on <em>sorry</em> or
			<em>apologise</em> and with a rising intonation across the whole 
			clause.<br />
			If you have a rise-fall pattern across <em>sorry</em> or <em>
			apologise</em> and have a falling intonation across the clause, the 
			message may be that this really is a guilt-admission apology.&nbsp; 
			This is how it looks:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style30">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img height="49" src="../../imagesgraphics/sorry1.png" width="250" alt="sorry" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style41">

					<img height="45" src="../../imagesgraphics/sorry2.png" width="250" alt="sorry" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style41">
					<h3>is guilt accepting</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Recognising the tone and the communicative value of what's said is 
			also vital or learners may misinterpret what they hear as a real 
			apology expressing some sense of guilt and respond inappropriately.&nbsp; 
			For example:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>I'm sorry if you are unhappy about that </em>(unspoken: 
				but life's tough, isn't it?)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*Don't apologise</em></li>
				<li><em>I regret it if you don't like the colour </em>(unspoken: 
				but it isn't going to be changed because I like it)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*No harm done.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Being able to produce the correct intonation patterns and tone is 
			important, too, or learners may be misinterpreted.&nbsp; Using a 
			guilt-shifting intonation pattern for what is meant as a real 
			apology may result in serious resentment.&nbsp; Using 
			guilt-accepting intonation when guilt-shifting tone is required 
			merely results in puzzlement and misunderstanding.</p>
			<p>An example:<br />
			<img alt="rugby" height="133" src="../../images/sport_rugby200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			The following was a headline in The Telegraph, a national British 
			newspaper, referring to the fact that England rugby fans sing an 
			American song to encourage their team:</p>
			<p class="auto-style43" ><em><strong>England 
			rugby anthem 'Swing Low, Sweet Chariot' is an ignorant expropriation 
			of slave lyrics, say American academics</strong></em></p>
			<p>It should be noted that rugby fans' songs are not famous for 
			being sensitive and politically correct.&nbsp; The Telegraph quotes 
			an English player, Mako Vunipola, who is of Tongan descent, 
			responding as follows:</p>
			<p class="auto-style43" ><em><strong>If the fans want to 
			sing it then let them sing it, but obviously if people find it 
			offensive then sorry.</strong></em></p>
			<p>He didn't mean <em>sorry </em>at all.&nbsp; He meant that it is 
			the American academics' fault for feeling upset so the 
			responsibility is reversed and no regret at all is shown.</p>

			<p>This is not a real apology at all, of course.&nbsp; It is simply 
			a conventional way to introduce an enquiry or request for action.<br />
			It implies two things:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>no regret at all</strong></dt>
			<dd>the speaker / writer clearly does not regret that the other 
			person is inconvenienced in some way and would do the same 
			if the circumstances arose.</dd>
			<dt><strong>no commitment</strong></dt>
			<dd>this kind of apology implies no commitment to amending one's way 
			in the future and none to making the situation better by any form of

		</dl>
			
			<p>The verbs <em><span class="style_black">apologise</span> </em>and<em>
			<span class="style_black">regret</span> </em>are<em>

				whether ... / if ... etc.</em></li>

			It's important

			<p>Exercises like this, which can be longer and more challenging as

			<p>When presenting apologies and responses, which is often done via

					<td class="auto-style28">Does not want the interruption to

			<p>If the groundwork has been laid and people can distinguish 
			between the main types of apology and the appropriate responses, you can get on to some practice.</p>
			<p><strong>Idea 1:</strong></p>
