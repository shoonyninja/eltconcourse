			(particularly to hortative and imperative statements) or are 
			familiar with those two terms and their meaning.<br />
			Lots of course materials and teaching guides chop this 
			area up into misty concepts such as s<em>uggesting, requesting, 
			demanding, agreeing</em> and <em>declining</em>.&nbsp; That is not 
			the line taken here for reasons which should become clear.&nbsp; We 
			are concerned with looking for commonalities and patterns.</p>

			<p>There are three essential ways to respond to something like <em>

			<p>Before we can select the language in which to respond, we have to 
			have some way of understanding the type of suasion we have been

				<li><em>You ought to try the fish here.<br />

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>If you have followed the guide to suasion, you will be aware, of 
			course, that the power relationship between the speaker and the 
			listener and the intonation patterns the speaker uses are both 
			critical to understanding this.<br />
			A statement such as <em>Let's 
			finish now</em> from a teacher or other in authority actually 
			becomes an imperative or simply a statement of fact.&nbsp; Between 
			equals, it is a true cohortative.<br />
			(If you aren't sure what an initiation might be, you need to have a 
			look at the section on this in
			<a href="../../skills/speaking.html#irf" target="_blank">the guide 
			to speaking skills</a>.)<br />
			Context is everything in understanding the function of language.</p>

					<h2>Style</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p><a name="3"></a>For the purposes of this guide, we'll use four of 
			the styles suggested by Joos (1961).&nbsp; There is
			<a href="../discourse/styleregister1.html" target="_blank">a guide 
			to style</a> on this site, but briefly:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Frozen style</strong> describes things like public 
				notices and citations.&nbsp; They have their own way of saying 
				things and include, e.g.,<em><br />
				</em><span class="style_red"><strong>NO FISHING</strong></span><em><br />
				No smoking<br />
				Students are not to wait here.<br />
				Passengers are not permitted beyond this point.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Formal style</strong> often occurs in writing or in 
				prepared speech.&nbsp; E.g.,<br />
				<em>Please remember that fishing is not permitted.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Consultative style</strong> is that which often 
				occurs in professional settings such as encounters between 
				doctors and patients, teachers and students, service encounters, 
				bosses and employees etc.&nbsp; E.g.,<br />
				<em>Fishing's not allowed in the marina, by the way.<br />
				You should give up the cigarettes.<br />
				The project is to be handed in on Thursday.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Casual style</strong> occurs between equals in 
				informal settings and often requires a good deal of shared 
				information.&nbsp; E.g.,<br />
				<em>You can't fish here, pal.<br />
				Give over.<br />
				Let me have a minute.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The ability to recognise the style of the initial statement is of 
			course essential if a speaker is to respond appropriately.</p>
			<p>What are the possible response types to the fishing statements 
			above?<br />
			<a href="#3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'list2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have some thoughts</a>.</p>
			<ol class="style_brown" id="list2" style="visibility:hidden">
				<li>We actually are not required to respond to frozen style 
				statements whether they are verbal or written.&nbsp; They 
				usually allow no disobedience.</li>
				<li>Formal style imperatives often do require a response and the 
				appropriate one is usually positive.&nbsp; E.g.,<br />
				<em>I will, yes.</em></li>
				<li>Consultative style responses are similar but some 
				temporisation may be appropriate.&nbsp; We could have, e.g.,<br />
				<em>Right.<br />
				I hear you but I guess it's allowed near the entrance.</em></li>
				<li>Casual style is open to all three response types.&nbsp; 
				E.g.,<em><br />
				Oh, can't I?&nbsp; OK. </em>(preferred)<br />
				<em>Why not?</em> (temporising)<br />
				<em>I'll fish where I like, mate.</em> (dispreferred)</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="pair" height="166" src="../../images/two_shoes250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style22">
					<h2>Adjacency pairs</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>
			<img alt="adjacency pairs" height="98" src="../../imagesgraphics/function12.png" width="200" /></p>
			<p>Adjacency is a concept fundamental to the teaching of functional 
			language.&nbsp; Adjacency pairs include, for example,</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>asking for information and giving information</li>
				<li>apologising and accepting apologies</li>
				<li>offering and accepting</li>
				<li>stating facts and agreeing</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.</p>
			<p>There is, however, a problem with simply teaching adjacency pairs 
			as if only one response were possible.&nbsp; In reality, especially 
			in casual style, two or three types of response can arise from the 
			initial speech act.&nbsp; For example, one can respond to a request 
			for information by giving it (preferred), declaring ignorance 
			(dispreferred) or by offering to find out (temporising).&nbsp; Most 
			functions work like this.</p>
			<p>Here we are dealing with suasion so we'll focus on the three 
			response types for each function.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style9">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style11">
					<img alt="cohortation responses" height="115" src="../../imagesgraphics/exhortationresponse.png" width="300" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style12">
					<img alt="exhortation responses" height="116" src="../../imagesgraphics/cohortationresponse.png" width="300" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style10">
					<img alt="imperative responses" height="118" src="../../imagesgraphics/imperativeresponse.png" width="300" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is, of course, all perfectly teachable when it's broken down 
			like this and we can choose the exponents of each function to suit 
			the level of our learners.&nbsp; Teaching <em>I will, thanks</em> as 
			a positive response to an imperative-form exhortation is not too 
			challenging and, moving up the levels, we can focus on, e.g., <em>
			Thanks for the suggestion</em> or <em>I certainly will; it looks 
			utterly delicious</em> and so on.<br />
			So far so good, but there's a catch.</p>
			<hr />
			
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="soften" height="166" src="../../images/soft_focus250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style22">
					<h2>Softening dispreferred responses</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>The catch is that when our response is dispreferred, 
			we habitually soften it by:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>giving a reason</li>
				<li>apologising</li>
				<li>making a countering statement</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and frequently by doing all three together.</p>
			<p>The way we do it it often to employ a modal auxiliary verb or 
			other modal expression and often that is one which expresses dynamic 
			modality (ability, for example) or epistemic modality (the speaker's 
			view of the truth of a proposition).</p>

			<h3>patterns</h3>
			<p>This is not the place, even it were possible, to list all the 
			possible exponents of the functions of responding to suasion.&nbsp; 
			There are, however, some commonalities:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Preferred responses, i.e., positive ones, generally begin 
				with an acknowledgement of what has been said and are followed 
				by some kind of commitment.&nbsp; For example,<ol class="auto-style17">
					<li><strong>Exhortations</strong>:<ol class="auto-style18">
						<li><em>Can you give me a hand? &rarr; Sure.&nbsp; How 
						can I help?</em></li>
						<li><em>Would you open the window? &rarr; Of course.&nbsp; 
						This one?&nbsp; Is that OK?</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Cohortations</strong>:<ol class="auto-style18">
						<li><em>What about going to the cinema? &rarr; That's a 
						good idea.&nbsp; I'll check what's on.</em></li>
						<li><em>Let's eat out. &rarr; Fine.&nbsp; Chinese?</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Imperatives</strong>:<ol class="auto-style18">
						<li><em>Pass me that frying pan, please. &rarr; Sure.&nbsp; 
						Here you are.</em></li>
						<li><em>You ought to write to him. &rarr; I know, I 
						know.&nbsp; I'll do it this evening.</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Dispreferred responses, as we have seen above, generally 
				come in at least two parts: the response followed by 
				a reason (often + apology).</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>ideas</h3>
			<h4>introducing the concepts</h4>
			<p>There are two obvious approaches:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Via</em> a dialogue or set of mini dialogues such as:<br />
				<em>A: Hi.&nbsp; Can you do something for me?<br />
				B: Probably.&nbsp; What is it?<br />
				A: I need a hand with getting a bed upstairs at my mother's 
				house and I can't manage on my own.<br />
				B: I can't help this morning but this afternoon is OK.&nbsp; Is 
				that alright?<br />
				A: Yes, that's fine.</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Via an email exchange in the same vein.&nbsp; E.g.,<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Dear Fred,<br />
				I need to ask a favour and hope you can help.&nbsp; I've had to 
				take my car to the garage and need to get to the airport on 
				Thursday for a 9 o'clock flight and was wondering whether you 
				could take me there.</em></span><em><br />
				</em><span class="style_brown"><em>Dear John,<br />
				That's fine, of course I can help but I'll need to be back in 
				London for work so will it be OK if I drop you off a bit earlier 
				than you need to be there?</em></span><br />
				etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>recognising the concepts</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Simple matching exercises can help raise awareness.&nbsp; 
				Which language exponents you choose will, of course, be a 
				question of the level of your learners.&nbsp; For example,<ol>
					<li>Matching the type of suasion to its function (learners 
					draw the arrows).&nbsp; Note that the role relationships are 
					made clear.&nbsp; That is important.<br />
					<img alt="responding exercise" height="176" src="../../imagesgraphics/respondingsuasionex1.png" width="400" /></li>
					<li>Matching suasion to response is also productive:<br />
					<img alt="exercise 2" height="158" src="../../imagesgraphics/respondingsuasionex2.png" width="400" /></li>
					<li>Raising awareness of the three types of response:<br />
					<img alt="exercise 3" height="123" src="../../imagesgraphics/respondingsuasionex3.png" width="400" /></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>practising</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Controlled practice might include filling gaps in a dialogue 
				(having read or listened to it in full), like this:<br />
				<em>A: Hi.&nbsp; ________ you do __________________?<br />
				B: __________________.&nbsp; What is it?<br />
				A: ____________________ with getting a bed upstairs at my 
				mother's house and _____________ on my own.<br />
				B: _____________ this morning but this afternoon __________.&nbsp; 
				________________?<br />
				A: ______________ .</em><br />
				This can be made as simple or as challenging as you choose.</li>
				<li>Dialogue reordering exercises also work well as controlled 
				practice because they focus clearly on appropriate responses to 
				particular initiations:<br />
				<em>A: Yes that's fine.<br />
				A: The boss needs the report today.<br />
				A: Will you be able to help?<br />
				A: I know, but this is important.<br />
				B: Is this afternoon OK?<br />
				B: Doesn't she always?<br />
				B: Yes, probably, but not this morning.<br />
				B: No problem.</em></li>
				<li>Less controlled practice can involve learners constructing 
				dialogues based on a format you supply.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em><strong>Between the manager and the employee</strong></em>:<ul class="auto-style19">
					<li class="style_black">Greet.</li>
					<li class="style_brown">Greet.</li>
					<li class="style_black">Ask for cooperation.</li>
					<li class="style_brown">Apologise and explain why you can't help.</li>
					<li class="style_black">Explain why it's important (use a passive).&nbsp; Use an 
					imperative.</li>
					<li class="style_brown">Say that you understand and will cooperate tomorrow.</li>
					<li class="style_black">Accept the explanation and agree a time.</li>
					<li class="style_brown">Change the time a little but agree.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Then the learners can go on to practise role 
				playing the situations but make sure context and role 
				relationships are absolutely clear or it will be time wasted.&nbsp; 
				For example:<ul class="auto-style20">
					<li><span class="style_black">Ask for your neighbour's help 
					removing a tree from the garden.</span>&nbsp;
					<span class="style_brown">Agree to help your neighbour but 
					definitely not today.</span></li>
					<li><span class="style_black">Suggest something to do this 
					evening to a friend.</span>&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Disagree 
					with your friend but 
					suggest an alternative.</span>&nbsp; Reach an agreement.</li>
					<li><span class="style_black">Give an order to a difficult 
					employee by making the order sound like a request.</span>&nbsp;
					<span class="style_brown">Refuse to cooperate and explain 
					why you think it's a stupid idea.</span></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>materials</h4>
			<p>Look carefully at materials in coursebooks which cover areas such 
			as suggesting, demanding and asking for help.<br />
			By <em>suggesting</em>, they usually mean cohortation, by <em>demanding</em>, they 
			usually mean using imperative forms and imperative modal verbs and by 
			<em>asking for help</em>, they often mean exhortation.<br />
			The problem arises, of course, that they use the concepts too 
			vaguely and the language they present doesn't always reflect the 
			function.&nbsp; Handle with care.</p>
