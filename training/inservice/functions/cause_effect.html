			<h1>Cause and effect: expressing results</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="result" height="207" src="../../images/dominoes_sequence310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>English has a number of ways to express the connections between 
			causes and results.&nbsp; Here are some examples of the kinds of 
			structures commonly used classified by what they are.&nbsp; In what 
			follows, we'll look at each type in turn.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Clausal subordination:<br />
				<em>I missed the meeting because the train was late<br />
				If it hadn't snowed, I wouldn't have missed the meeting</em></li>
				<li>Clausal coordination:<br />
				<em>The train was late so that I missed the meeting<br />
				The train was late and I missed the meeting</em></li>
				<li>Conjuncts:<br />
				<em>The train was late.&nbsp; Consequently, I missed the meeting<br />
				The train was late.&nbsp; As a result, I missed the meeting<br />
				</em>Below, there is also consideration of the small class of 
				attitudinal disjuncts that perform an allied function.</li>
				<li>Noun or prepositional phrases:<br />
				<em>Due to the snow, the train was late<br />
				Because of the snow, the train was late</em></li>
				<li>Subject nouns:<br />
				<em>The consequence of the snow was that the trains were delayed<br />
				The upshot of the snow was that the trains were delayed</em></li>
				<li>Result verbs:<br />
				<em>The snow caused the delay<br />
				The snow affected the trains</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Which formulation is selected from the range of choices available 
			to a speaker / writer will depend, primarily, on two factors:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style2">
				<li>Style:<br />
				Conjuncts and subject nouns which refer to results are generally 
				more formal than simple subordination or the use of simple 
				result verbs.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was late.&nbsp; Hence, I missed the meeting</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result of the delay was that I missed 
				the meeting</em><br />
				are generally considered more formal than<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The snow made the train late</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting because the train 
				was late</em></li>
				<li>Desired effect:<br />
				Whether the speaker / writer wishes to emphasise the cause or 
				its effect will often determine the structure of choice.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consequence was that I missed the 
				meeting</em><br />
				emphasises the result<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But for the snow, I would have been here</em><br />
				emphasises the cause.</li>

					<h2>Subordination and Coordination</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There is separate guide to subordination and another to 
			coordination on this site linked in the list of related guides at 
			the end.<br />
			We are not concerned here to investigate the subtle and sometimes 
			rather fluid distinctions between subordinators and coordinators (as 
			that is the topic of other guides).&nbsp; We are more concerned here 
			to investigate the functional properties of conjunctions of both 
			sorts (and those that fall in between the categories).</p>
			<p>The most frequently used are:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="auto-style83">Subordination:
			</span>as, because, if, in order to / to, in order 
			(that), seeing that, since, so as<br />
			<span class="auto-style83">Coordination: <em>so,</em> </span>and, so that, for</p>
			<p>Although it was noted above that subordination is often the 
			choice when informal language is required, it can be seen that some 
			of these conjunctions (especially, <em>in order that </em>and<em> since</em>) are more formal than others in the list and more 
			likely to appear in written English, especially where precision and 
			clarity are needed such as in academic texts.<br />
			The complex subordinator <em>in order to</em> is often contracted to <em>to</em> as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I came to hear what he would say</em><br />
			which is often described as the infinitive of purpose although it is 
			a very arguable point that it is an infinitive at all.<br />
			(To this list, we might add the conjunction <em>whereby</em> which 
			generally introduces the means by which an intended outcome is 
			achieved.&nbsp; It is unusual and almost fully confined to formal 
			writing.)</p>
			<p>There are two functions that the subordinators perform:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>as, because, so, since, seeing that</em> function to 
				link a cause to an <strong>inevitable result</strong>.&nbsp; For 
				example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the train was late, I missed 
					the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the train was late, I missed the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting since the train was late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that I missed the meeting, I don't know what was 
					decided</em></li>
					<li>These are proper subordinators, rather than 
					coordinators, so the order of the clauses can be reversed, 
					the subordinator remaining fixed to introduce the cause, not 
					the effect, like this:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting as the train was 
					late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting because the train was late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the train was late, I missed the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what was decided, seeing that I missed the 
					meeting</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>in order to / to, in order (that), so that, so as, 
				whereby, through </em>all imply an <strong>action taken to secure a result</strong> 
				rather than an inevitable consequence of an event.&nbsp; For 
				example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order not to be late, I 
					hurried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So as not to be late, I hurried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried to get there on time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order that I wouldn't be late, I hurried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried so that I wouldn't be late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried so as not to be late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through hurrying, I managed not to be late</em></li>
					<li>Again, because these are subordinators, the clause 
					ordering can be reversed but the conjunction sticks with the 
					outcome of the action:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried in order not to be late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To get there on time, I hurried <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried in order that I wouldn't be late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that I wouldn't be late, I hurried <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So as not to be late, I hurried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I managed not to be late through hurrying</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are some important logical and structural issues to be 
			considered.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It is important to distinguish between action taken to 
				secure an outcome and the inevitable result of an event or the 
				wrong message is sent and, often, nonsense results.&nbsp; So, 
				for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was late so that I missed the 
				meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order that I don't know what was decided I missed the 
				meeting <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried because I wouldn't be late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I wouldn't be late, I hurried</em><br />
				are all either nonsense or not the intended meaning.&nbsp; The 
				first of these implies, incidentally, that someone deliberately 
				made the train late to bring about the result.</li>
				<li>Structurally, there are also differences between the forms 
				because the subordinators which signal an action taken to secure 
				an outcome need verb forms which imply the action was taken.&nbsp; 
				Often this is accomplished <em>via</em> the use of a non-finite 
				infinitive form so we allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried in order not to be late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried so as not to be late</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried in order that I wasn't late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried seeing that to be late</em><br />
				Otherwise, a finite clause can be used with these 
				conjunctions.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that I wouldn't be late, I hurried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order that I wouldn't be late, I hurried</em></li>
				<li>Two complex subordinators (<em>so as </em>and <em>in order to / to</em>) 
				require the non-finite infinitive form and the preposition<em> 
				through</em> requires an <em>-ing</em> form:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried so as not to be late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried not to be late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hurried in order not to be late</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I managed not to be late through hurrying</em><br />
				are acceptable, but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I hurried so as I wouldn't be late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I hurried to not be late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I hurried in order to I wouldn't be late</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Through I hurried I wasn't late</em><br />
				are unacceptable.</li>
				<li>The subordinating conjunction <em>so that </em>also has a coordinating function 
				(see below) but in terms of cause and effect, that use is 
				considerably rarer.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4><em>if-</em>clauses and <em>but for (the fact that)</em></h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Conditional clauses are frequently used to link cause and 
				effect either to refer to the future or to express that <strong>
				but for </strong>an event a result would not have occurred.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the train is late, I'll miss the 
				meeting</em><br />
				refers to the result of a possible cause<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the train hadn't been late, I wouldn't 
				have missed the meeting</em><br />
				refers to a past event which had a past consequence</li>
				<li>In the past, conditional structures are frequently in the 
				negative or imply a frustrated event to show the direction of 
				causation so we can have, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have been at the meeting if the 
				train hadn't been late<br />
				</em>or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have been at the meeting if the 
				train had been on time (but it wasn't)</em></li>
				<li>The expression <em>but for </em>always refers to a noun or a nominal clause, not to a finite 
				verb or clause so, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for the train delay, I wouldn't have 
				been late<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have been at the meeting but for the train delay<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have been at the meeting but for the fact that the 
				train was late</em><br />are acceptable, although<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *But for the train was late I would have 
				been at the meeting<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I would have been at the meeting but for I was delayed</em><br />are not.<br />
				(Lawyers reading this will no doubt recall that in law <strong>
				the but-for test</strong> is often applied to determine factual 
				guilt.&nbsp; The consideration is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>But for the actions of the accused, would the damage, 
				injury etc. have occurred?</em>)</li>
				<li>In order to convert a finite clause into a noun phrase, a 
				common tactic is to insert <em>the fact that</em> + the clause.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the train was late, I missed the 
				meeting</em><br />
				can be converted to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting because of the fact 
				that the train was late</em><br />
				This type of conversion is particularly frequent in written 
				texts.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The ordering of the clauses is, as we saw, reversible but the 
			choice will normally be made depending on whether the speaker / 
			writer wishes to emphasise the cause or the effect.&nbsp; Whichever 
			is fronted is likely to be where the stress lies.<br />
			When the subordinate clause is in the initial position it is usually 
			followed by a comma.</p>
				
			
			<p>Four coordinating conjunctions serve to express resultative 
			meaning.&nbsp; They are:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">so, and, so that, for</p>
			<p>In common with other coordinators, these are in a fixed position 
			between the clauses they link and are not as mobile as subordinators.&nbsp; They show explicitly the direction of causation.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was late so I missed the meeting</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was late and I missed the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a long delay so that I missed the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting for the train was late</em></p>
			<p>There are differences in the use of coordinators to consider:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The clauses cannot be reversed as they can with 
				subordination:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the train was late I missed the 
				meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I missed the meeting the train was late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that I missed the meeting there was a long delay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the train was late I missed the meeting</em><br />
				are all unacceptable because coordinators must appear <strong>
				between</strong> the clauses they connect.<br />
				The exception is the coordinator<em> so</em> which lies in the 
				grey area between coordinators and subordinators.&nbsp; This 
				conjunction can, in a limited way, move with the subordinate 
				clause and we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I could meet his sister, I called at 
				his house</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called at his house so I could meet his 
				sister</em><br />
				However, in this meaning, the conjunctions signals purpose 
				rather than causality.</li>
				<li>The direction of causality is usually explicitly signalled 
				or nonsense results:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting and the train was late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting so that the train was late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was late for I missed the meeting</em><br />
				are all nonsense.</li>
				<li>The conjunction <em>so that</em> is rare in this meaning and 
				is normally used as a subordinator (see above) with a purposive 
				rather than resultative meaning.</li>
				<li>The conjunction <em>and</em> is frequently used to show the 
				ordering of events and allows the hearer / reader to make the 
				causal connection rather than explicitly signalling it.&nbsp; It 
				is, however, very common, especially in informal speech but rare 
				in writing and almost never present in formal writing.</li>
				<li>The conjunction <em>for</em> is a more formal alternative to
				<em>because</em> but it is a coordinator and <em>because</em> 
				subordinates so the grammar and mobility of the clauses vary.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Commas are not usually used when the conjunction serves to 
			coordinate rather than subordinate.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Conjuncts differ from conjunctions in that they are not part of 
			clause in which they appear but function to link two independent 
			clauses or sentences.&nbsp; 
			This does not invariably mean that they occur in the initial 
			position but that is the way to bet (and, probably, the way to teach 
			them).<br />
			Common ones are:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">accordingly, as a result, consequently, hence, 
			so, therefore, thus</p>
			<p>All bar <em>so</em> are more formal than conjunctions and they all introduce or interrupt 
			the clause expressing the effect of something.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was delayed.&nbsp; Consequently, I 
			missed the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting.&nbsp; Accordingly, I do not know what 
			was decided<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The training was late and I missed the meeting.&nbsp; So, I 
			don't know what was decided<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was late.&nbsp; I, therefore, missed the meeting.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting.&nbsp; Hence, I don't know what was 
			decided<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting.&nbsp; Thus, I don't know what was 
			decided</em></p>
			<p>Only the conjunct <em>so</em> is commonly used in informal speech and it 
			must always be in the initial position in the clause.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't need the car until tomorrow.&nbsp; So, if you like, 
			you can borrow it.</em><br />
			It is, in fact, in spoken language almost impossible to tell by 
			listening to a statement whether <em>so</em> is being used as a coordinating 
			conjunction or a conjunct (and it probably doesn't matter).</p>
			<p>Conjuncts often appear in a reinforcing role with coordinating 
			conjunctions so we can have, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was late so I consequently missed the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was late and I therefore missed the meeting<br />
			</em>This does <strong>not</strong>, however, occur with 
			subordinators so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*Because the train was late I consequently missed the 
			meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I therefore missed the meeting since the train was late<br />
			</em>are not acceptable.</p>
			<p>Conjuncts are usually separated from the clause in which they 
			appear by commas.</p>
			<p>In written texts, especially formal or academic texts, these 
			conjuncts are frequently used to make sure that the effect is 
			separated from the cause and signalled clearly.<br />
			They also serve to emphasise the effect rather than the cause 
			because they introduce a new theme into the discourse.</p>

					<h2>A note on performative adverbs</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Usually, as we saw above, adverbs perform the function of 
			conjuncts when expressing the result of an event.&nbsp; More rarely, 
			they can be used within the clause as simple adjuncts and still 
			perform the role of linking cause and effect.</p>
			<p>Some adverbs may express what can be called a performative result, i.e., 
			the result is part of the action.&nbsp; Examples of a performative 
			speech acts are<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I name this ship the Venus</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I bet six Euros</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I object</em><br />
			in which the act of speaking performs the action.&nbsp; In other 
			words, the utterance and its result are simultaneous.</p>
			<p>There are four adverbs in particular which do this:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>hereby</strong></dt>
				<dd>This adverb means <em>as a result of this utterance or 
				document</em>.&nbsp; It is, deixically speaking, a reference to 
				the here and now and occurs in clauses such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are hereby informed that the transfer has been made 
				according to your wishes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The undersigned hereby agrees to pay the sum required</em><br />
				and in both these cases, the acts of informing and agreeing are 
				contained in, i.e., achieved by, the text.</dd>
				<dt><strong>herewith</strong></dt>
				<dd>This adverb also functions to mean <em>with this document</em> 
				but it can carry the same meaning as <em>hereby</em> as in, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are herewith promoted to the position 
				of Personnel Manager<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I promise herewith to pay the sum of $200.</em><br />
				and again, the act of writing or speaking performs the resultant 
				acts of promoting and promising.</dd>
				<dt><strong>thereby</strong></dt>
				<dd>This adverb means <em>as a result of that</em> or <em>by 
				that means.</em>&nbsp; It is deixically speaking, a reference to 
				the there and then and occurs in clauses such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children attended the concert and thereby learned 
				some appreciation of Mozart<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We analysed the results and thereby discovered a disparity.</em><br />
				and in both these cases, the acts of attending and analysing are 
				simultaneous with the learning and discovering.</dd>
				<dt><strong>therewith</strong></dt>
				<dd>Usually, this adverb carries the meaning of <em>with that
				</em>or <em>immediately thereafter</em>.&nbsp; It can, however, 
				more rarely be used to express cause and result as in, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was therewith informed of his 
				responsibilities<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He inherited his grandfather's estate and therewith became 
				rich</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The four adverbs are formal and can be replaced by more 
			conventional subordination, conjuncts, verbs or prepositional 
			phrases.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this we would like to inform you that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, we require ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... so they learned some appreciation ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through analysing the data ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The letter meant he knew his responsibilities</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because he inherited ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, he became rich<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<p>There is also a small class of causal attitudinal disjuncts which 
			includes terms such as <em>inevitably, inexorably, predictably </em>
			and <em>unsurprisingly</em> which signal the speaker's view of the 
			effect of the cause.<br />
			They occur in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She argued her point too forcefully.&nbsp; Predictably, 
			the committee rejected the idea.</em></p>

					<h2>Noun or prepositional phrases</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>A number of phrases serve to introduce nouns or nominalised 
			clauses to show the relationship between cause and effect.&nbsp; 
			These are really prepositional phrases acting to subordinate in most 
			cases.&nbsp; They can be called simply noun phrases but it is more 
			accurate to refer to them as prepositional phrases.<br />
			Here's a short list:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">
			as a 
			consequence of, as a result of, because of, by, by dint of, by means 
			of, by reason of, by use of, by virtue of, due to, on account of, on 
			grounds of, on the strength of, owing to, thanks to, through</p>
			<p>By their nature, these phrases all introduce the cause of the 
			effect, not, as we saw with conjuncts, the effect of the cause.&nbsp; 
			In other words, they are a mirror image but they cannot act as 
			conjuncts themselves.&nbsp; For example, using a conjunct we might 
			have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have worked very hard.&nbsp; Accordingly, 
			we have finished on time.</em><br />
			but with a noun-phrase introducer we can rephrase that as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to your hard work, we have finished on 
			time.</em></p>
			<p>Other examples of these phrases are:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the snow, the train was delayed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the delay, I missed the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On account of missing the meeting, I don't know what was 
			decided<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through missing the meeting, I don't know what was decided<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By virtue of the delay, I missed the meeting</em><br />
			which, incidentally, implies that the speaker wanted to miss the 
			meeting<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to the delay, I missed the meeting</em><br />
			which implies sarcasm,
			and so on.<br />
			Normally, the phrases <em>thanks to, by dint of </em>and <em>by 
			virtue of </em>introduce a positive outcome.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; By dint of hard work and application, he passed all his 
			examinations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By virtue of the fact that it rained, the garden flourished 
			that summer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to his help, we got the job done.</em><br />
			The last of these, however, can be used sarcastically as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to your delaying me, I missed my bus</em><br />
			and also has a variant which comes terminally in the phrase and 
			means its opposite, as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got the job done, no thanks to you.</em></p>
			<p>As with subordinating conjunctions, the clauses can be reversed:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was delayed because of the snow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting as a result of the delay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what was decided on account of missing the 
			meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what was decided through missing the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting by virtue of the delay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting thanks to the delay</em></p>
			<p>We noted above that the useful phrase <em>the fact that </em>is 
			frequently used to convert a clause into a noun phrase and, 
			accordingly, it appears often with these phrases, too.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed the meeting on account of the fact that the 
			train was late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what was decided because of the fact that I 
			missed the meeting</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p>Because these fixed phrases introduce nominalised expressions or 
			nouns, the non-finite gerund or perfect -<em>ing</em> form is 
			frequent as in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through our having so little time, we didn't 
			complete the project<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By dint of working so hard, he got everything done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of losing his money, he was obliged to walk home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By virtue of having had such a good interview manner, he got 
			the job</em></p>
			<p>A note on <em>owing to</em> and <em>due t</em>o:<br />
			Much energy has been expended since the 19th century to distinguish 
			between these two phrases, the usual admonition being that <em>due 
			to</em> is used with a noun phrase and <em>owing to</em> with a 
			non-finite clause so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was due to my lateness that I missed the 
			meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owing to being late, I missed the meeting</em><br />
			A related admonition is never to begin a sentence with<em> due to</em> 
			because it should connect two noun phrases.<br />
			There are those that worry about such things but there is actually 
			no reason at all to make this distinction.&nbsp; Revered writers, 
			including Dickens and Austen, have used the phrases interchangeably.&nbsp; 
			There seems little need to trouble yourself with the distinction and none to 
			trouble your learners with it.</p>
			<p>The ordering of the clauses is, as we saw, reversible but the 
			choice will normally be made depending on whether the speaker / 
			writer wishes to emphasise the cause or the effect.&nbsp; Whichever 
			is fronted is likely to be where the stress lies.<br />
			If the noun phrase is in initial position, it is usually followed 
			by a comma.</p>

			<p>Nouns which represent a consequence are far more common in the 
			subject position in a clause than they are as an object argument (Hoey, 
			2003).&nbsp; Therefore,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consequence was that ...</em><br />
			is preferred over<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; This made the consequence that ...</em><br />
			which seems clumsy and unnatural.<br />
			Other nouns that fall into this category are:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">result, effect, upshot, outcome, corollary, 
			aftermath, product</p>
			<p>That is quite a short list, teachable in a single lesson.<br />
			They have certain connotations and the choice is a semantically 
			rather than structurally determined.&nbsp; In particular, <em>
			aftermath</em> implies a very negative consequence, <em>upshot</em> 
			is informal and <em>corollary</em> implies a by-product rather than 
			the main effect of something.<br />
			Otherwise, the words are close synonyms and are often used in the 
			same text for variety and stylistic reasons rather than for any 
			fundamental distinctions in meaning.&nbsp; The nouns generally are 
			confined to separate clauses or sentences or the writing becomes 
			unwieldy and unnatural.&nbsp; We might have, therefore:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The snow was particularly heavy and the
			<span class="style_underline">effect</span> was to delay all the 
			trains.&nbsp; The <span class="style_underline">consequence</span> 
			was that I was late getting to work and the
			<span class="style_underline">outcome</span> of that was that I 
			missed the meeting.&nbsp; Anyway, the <span class="style_underline">
			upshot</span> is that I don't know what was decided.</p>
			<p>As you can see, overuse of the nouns causes some stylistic 
			infelicity.</p>
			<p>The noun <em>upshot</em>, incidentally, although countable, has 
			no plural form.&nbsp; All the other nouns in this section are count 
			nouns.</p>
			<p>Consequence nouns, because they are normally the subjects of 
			verbs, stress the outcome over the cause.</p>

			<p>Result verbs are a subset of verbs referring to material

			<p class="indentpara">affect, alter, cause, change, determine,

			corrode, rust </em>and so on.&nbsp; Every academic domain will have 
			its preferred process verbs.</p>
			<p>The choice of verb, is, therefore, as with nouns, semantically

			<p>The range of possible ways to link causes and effects is usually

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Conjunction</strong>:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>Conjunction is, however, a logical place to <strong>start</strong>,

				Conceptually and structurally, there are few problems.<br />However, once we venture beyond European languages, the 
				situation becomes more complex because some, such as the Chinese 
				languages, have two-part conjunctions to achieve the meaning and 
				may also distinguish structurally between events that happened 
				simultaneously and those that followed in the course of time.<br />Japanese, on the other hand has parallels in distinguishing 
				between cause and effect in the natural way of things and cause 
				and effect relating to the actor's intended outcomes.&nbsp; The 
				distinction between<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am late because the train was late</em><br />and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am hurrying so that I can catch the 
				train</em><br />will not, therefore, be conceptually difficult.<br />
					Nevertheless, the forms of conjunction used when expressing 
				natural consequence and intended consequence need to be presented 
				in clear contexts or you will encourage error and confusion.</li>
					<li>A simple way to begin is with two sentences expressing 
				natural consequence for the learners to practise combining so, 
				once presented with:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was cold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took a 
					coat</em><br />the learners can see the cause and the effect as distinct and be 
				able to produce:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I took a coat because it was cold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it was cold I took a coat<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took a coat as it was cold</em><br />and so on.</li>
					<li>Later (and not at the same time), the same procedure can be 
				used to express intended consequence with, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
					was raining<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a new hat<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took an umbrella</em><br />from which we can construct, with some help:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					It was raining so I took an umbrella in order that my new hat didn't get wet</em></li>
					<li>A serious pitfall to avoid when presenting conjunctions for 
				the first time or at lower levels is encouraging confusion by 
				mixing subordinating and coordinating conjunctions.&nbsp; It is 
				possible to see <em>so</em> and <em>because</em> as somehow 
				connected and having opposite senses so we can convert, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took an umbrella because it was raining</em><br />into<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was raining so I took an umbrella</em><br />but that can also produce nonsense if we try the formula 
				with:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it was raining I took an umbrella</em><br />as that results in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took an umbrella so it was raining</em><br />and that's nonsense because 
					<em>so</em> is a coordinator and cannot be 
				shifted around with its clause.</li>
					<li>Conditionals which express cause and effect can be dealt 
					with separately when they are the focus of the teaching.&nbsp; 
					Focusing on cause and effect with <em>if</em> or <em>but for</em> 
					phrases is, however, an interesting way to extend and revise 
					the forms.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Conjuncts</strong><ol>
					<li class="bluebullet">Are another matter and a common error that 
				learners make is to treat conjuncts as conjunctions and use them 
				to combine two clauses in the same sentence.&nbsp; We get 
				errors, then, such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He worked hard accordingly he passed his 
				exams</em><br />
				Conjuncts have to be distinguished from conjunctions by co-text 
				and context.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Noun phrases, nouns and result verbs</strong><br />
				Unless your learners are studying English for Academic Purposes 
				or need otherwise to write formally and express cause and 
				effect, the nouns and causal verbs we deploy are probably less 
				useful.<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>Phrases which introduce noun phrases such as <em>as a result 
				of, due to</em> etc. are best approached by distinguishing first 
				between <em>because</em> and <em>because of </em>in a little 
				exercise such as<br />
					<table class="auto-style11" style="width: 50%">
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style6"><em>I took an umbrella because it was raining</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style82"><em>&rarr;</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style6"><em>I took an umbrella because of the rain</em></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td colspan="3" class="auto-style6">Do the same:</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style6"><em>I was uncomfortable because it was hot</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style82"><em>&rarr;</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style6"><em>I was uncomfortable because&nbsp;of __________</em></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style6"><em>I was tired because I had been working</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style82"><em>&rarr;</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style6"><em>I was tired because of __________</em></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					Once the concept is clear in this way, it is safe to move on 
					to the other common phrases such as <em>as a result of, 
					through, by virtue of</em> and so on.</li>
					<li>Collocation grids are usually helpful with verbs:<table class="auto-style11" style="width: 50%">
						<tr>
							<td colspan="3" class="auto-style6">Mark these right or wrong.&nbsp; If 
							they are wrong, can you suggest a correct form?</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td colspan="3" class="auto-style6">For example:</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style6"><em>The heat made the reaction</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style82">X</td>
							<td class="auto-style6"><em>The heat initiated the reaction</em></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="auto-style6"><em>This made the upshot</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style12"></td>
							<td class="auto-style6"><em>&nbsp;</em></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><em>The delay modified the people</em></td>
							<td class="auto-style6">&nbsp;</td>
							<td class="auto-style6">&nbsp;</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					and so on.</li>
