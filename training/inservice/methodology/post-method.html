		<p>This is nothing terribly new.&nbsp; Here's a comment from a 1983 
		publication:</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>During the sixties and seventies 
		several developments indicate a shift in language pedagogy away from the 
		single method concept as the main approach to language teaching.</em></span><br />
		<span class="auto-style29">(Stern, 1983:477)</span></p>

					<h2>The sources of dissatisfaction with methodology</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
		<p>Dissatisfaction with the accepted methodologies had been growing for 
		some time, since well before 1983, because:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>there was a lack of any sound empirical evidence that any method 
			works any better than any other</li>
			<li>the whole concept of method limits teachers and learners and 
			prevents them reaching their true potential</li>
			<li>methods imposed on teachers and learners stifle creativity and 
			autonomy</li>
			<li>there was a noticeable disenchantment with the idea that the 
			application of some kind of scientific method could have the 
			outcomes it promised</li>
			<li>methods ignore the huge range of learners' needs, settings, 
			personalities and cultures</li>
			<li>methods lead to disempowerment of both learners and teachers and 
			contribute to dominance by society's power holders and the 
			deskilling of teachers</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Recently, since the mid-1990s at least, the idea of a post-method 
		language teaching has become more widely accepted.</p>
			<p>The guide to methodology refined, linked from the methodology 
			index (below), attempts some rebuttal of the criticisms above.</p>
		<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img height="166" src="../../images/dictionary_define250.jpg" width="250" alt="define" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style22">
					<h2>Defining post-methodology</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
		<p>This is, unfortunately, much more difficult than saying what it 
		isn't.<br />
		The overarching idea is, in Kumaravadivelu's words, the assertion 
		that:</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>we cannot prepare teachers to tackle so 
		many unpredictable needs, wants and situations; we can only help them 
		develop a capacity to generate varied and situation-specific ideas 
		within a general framework that makes sense in terms of current 
		pedagogical and theoretical knowledge.<br />
		</em></span><span class="auto-style29">(1992, p. 41)</span></p>
		<p>Given this umbrella assertion, he then enumerates three guiding 
		principles: particularity, practicality, and possibility.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>particularity</strong></dt>
			<dd>This refers to the role of the context and setting.&nbsp; The 
			focus is on local needs, local constraints and local culture.<br />
			Kumaravadivelu (2006:171) notes that it is necessary to be<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>sensitive to a particular group of 
			teachers teaching a particular group of learners pursuing a 
			particular set of goals within a particular institutional context 
			embedded in a particular socio-cultural milieu</em></span></dd>
			<dt><strong>practicality</strong></dt>
			<dd>This refers to relationship between theory and practice.&nbsp; 
			In the past, the criticism that 'theorists don't teach and teachers 
			don't read' has been arguably justified so the gap between what is 
			proposed at the theoretical level and what the teacher understands at 
			the practical level has grown.<br />
			In Kumaravadivelu's words,<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>Practicality seeks to rupture the 
			reified role relationship between theorizers and practitioners by 
			enabling and encouraging teachers to theorize from their practice 
			and to practice what they theorize.</em></span><br />
			In other words, it raises the role of the teacher to an 
			action researcher rather than a follower of a methodology laid down 
			by others.</dd>
			<dt><strong>possibility</strong></dt>
			<dd>This refers to tapping into the socio-political consciousness 
			that learners bring with them to the process of language learning, 
			hence raising cultural awareness.<br /></dd>

					<h2>Classroom implications</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
		<p>Kumaravadivelu proposes ten micro-strategies that are 
		the consequence of adopting a setting-sensitive approach to designing 
		and implementing a language-learning programme.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Maximise learning opportunities</li>
			<li>Facilitate negotiated interaction</li>
			<li>Minimize perceptual mismatches</li>
			<li>Activate intuitive heuristics (i.e., problem-solving approaches)</li>
			<li>Foster language awareness</li>
			<li>Contextualise linguistic input</li>
			<li>Integrate language skills</li>
			<li>Promote learner autonomy</li>
			<li>Ensure social relevance</li>
			<li>Raise cultural consciousness</li>
		</ol>
		<p>None of these, you note, is prescribed in terms of what is done in 
		the classroom because that will, inevitably, be dictated by the setting 
		in which language learning is taking place.&nbsp; The admonition is only 
		that these are the aspects of a teaching programme to aim at.</p>

				</table>
		
		<p>Not quite.</p>
		<p>Methods have their attractions, mostly because they sound rather 
		scientific and ought, therefore, to be backed up with some empirical 
		evidence demonstrating their effectiveness.&nbsp; The key word in that 
		is 'ought'.</p>
		<p>A very brief web search will throw up rafts of sites claiming to be 
		the best way to learn a language and many make extravagant claims 
		concerning their effectiveness.&nbsp; Some, for example, promise to 
		teach you mastery of a language in less than three months, some claim to 
		do even better.&nbsp; Others claim that you only need to study for 10 
		minutes a day to gain mastery of any language you need.&nbsp; The 
		problem with all of them, of course, is they can't produce a scrap of 
		real evidence to back up the claims.&nbsp; This leads some cynics to 
		believe that they are less interested in your success than your money.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, methodologies in the classroom are still 
		recognisable from time to time.<br />
		Most obviously, it would not take long in someone's classroom to 
		recognise that they were adopting a form-based or a function-based 
		approach to teaching and within those categories, it would not be 
		difficult to spot a task-based approach, a communicative approach or an 
		audio-lingual approach.<br />
		The problem, of course, is that if you returned to the same classroom at 
		a different time, you may well arrive at different conclusions 
		concerning the methodology being adopted.<br />
		Why should this be?</p>

					<h2>Eclecticism</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
		<p>Eclecticism is an approach that does not hold with applying a single 
		theory or paradigm but attempts to draw on the best (or most 
		appropriate) from a range of competing methodologies.&nbsp; Just as you 
		would expect to find a range of styles and types of objects in a good 
		flea market, so you would expect to find a range of approaches operating 
		in an eclectic classroom.</p>
		<p>Whether this is, as some have described it, <em>principled</em> 
		eclecticism is a matter of judgement.&nbsp; The term 'principled' 
		strongly implies that it is based on a single coherent theory of both 
		how languages are learned and what language actually is.&nbsp; As we 
		shall discover, if the theories underlying the approaches implemented 
		conflict then it is difficult to see how what the teacher is doing can 
		be described as principled in approach.</p>

				</table>
		
		<p>Clearly, some form of eclecticism fits well with the ideas of 
		post-methodology because the practitioner can use whatever method comes 
		to hand to achieve the 10 micro-strategies set out above.&nbsp; It might 
		work something like this:</p>

				<td class="auto-style27" style="width: 226px">Contextualise linguistic input</td>
				<td class="auto-style26">Use an Oral / Situational Approach so

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style27" style="width: 226px">Integrate language skills</td>
				<td class="auto-style26">Use a task-based approach and ensure 
				that learners can react orally to what they read, write about 
				what they hear and so on.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style27" style="width: 226px">Promote learner autonomy</td>
				<td class="auto-style26">Use projects and other tasks to take

				<td class="auto-style26">Set language in a clear, local, social

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style32" style="width: 226px">Raise cultural consciousness</td>
				<td class="auto-style33">Use a conversation-driven approach 
				(e.g., Dogme) to exchange ideas about cultural differences.&nbsp; 
				Set language in its cultural context.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>It's easy to see that taking this kind of approach would provide the 
		classroom with a lot of much-needed variety and be easy to justify in 
		terms of why one is doing the teaching this way.&nbsp; There are 
		downsides, of course, because the theories underlying methodologies are 
		often mutually exclusive:</p>
		<ul class="redbullet">
			<li>If behaviourist theories of language learning are wrong, the 
			drilling and pattern-repetition activities will be a waste of time.</li>
			<li>If behaviourist theories are correct, then time spent on 
			cognitive and problem-solving activities is wasted.</li>
			<li>If a focus on the learners' first language is counterproductive, 
			then any use of it will be harmful and time wasting.</li>
			<li>If adults acquire an additional language in same way that they 
			acquired their first language, then all that is needed is immersion 
			and context to ensure learning.&nbsp; Any focus on structure and 
			pronunciation is simply non-functional.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>and so on.</p>

					<td>
					<img height="166" src="../../images/book_carried250.jpg" width="250" alt="book" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style22">
					<h2>Coursebooks</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
		<p>All that is necessary to implement a post-methodology, eclectic 
		approach is to follow a well-known coursebook.</p>
		<p>A glance at the teacher's book for many of these and at the 
		publisher's descriptions make it clear that no single methodology has 
		been selected.&nbsp; On the contrary, it seems to be a matter of some 
		pride to the authors that they have adopted a range of methodological 
		approaches, regardless of the fact that some of these may be mutually 
		antagonistic.</p>
		<p>For example, 'exercises put rules into practice' seems to imply that 
		language is learned by the application of structural rules but the same 
		coursebook claims that the book endeavours to 'develop real-life 
		communication skills'.&nbsp; Now, either language is learnt <em>via</em> the 
		application of rules or it is learned by the pressure of communicative 
		need.&nbsp; You can't really have it both ways.</p>
		<p>The authors of one very popular coursebook (Inside Out) claim that:</p>
		<ol class="indentpara">
			<li><em>it aims to maximise exposure to high frequency language</em></li>
			<li><em>Students are ... given opportunities to manipulate the new 
			language and try it out in different situations</em></li>
			<li><em>The new language is systematically reviewed and recycled 
			until finally the students feel confident enough to use it to make 
			their own meanings</em></li>
			<li><em>they are strong believers in the old adage: ‘practice makes 
			perfect’</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>What we have here then is:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>a commitment to language exposure (a nod to Krashen, perhaps, 
			to corpus linguistics and to a lexical approach implied by the 'high frequency')</li>
			<li>a commitment to manipulative non-personalised structure practice 
			(an audio-lingual approach)</li>
			<li>a communicative approach to 'making their own meanings'</li>
			<li>a behaviourist approach to practice and repetition instilling 
			good habits and reinforcing learning</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In the sample unit available online we find the following eight approaches:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style28">
			<li>Test–Teach–Test:<br />
			Students are asked to talk to a partner about an experience before 
			they have encountered the language.</li>
			<li>Structural Approach [without personalisation]<br />
			Students have to 
			complete a gap-fill exercise about people in a text whom they have 
			never met with <em>can</em> or <em>can't</em> to express ability.</li>
			<li>Audiolingualism:<br />
			A CD-based listen-and-repeat exercise</li>
			<li>Task-based Learning<br />
			Students carry out a class survey.</li>
			<li>More non-personalised structural practice structure:<br />
			Students 
			write questions with<em> How many</em>, regardless of whether anyone 
			in the room wants to know the answers.</li>
			<li>Audiolingualism:<br />
			Learners listen and repeat the names of body parts.</li>
			<li>Total Physical Response:<br />
			Learners have to touch parts of the body when listening to prompts.</li>
			<li>Lexical approach:<br />
			Learners practise words with -<em>ache</em> set in sentences with 
			delexicalised verbs.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can, of course, carry out the same exercise with a range of 
		modern coursebooks and reach similar conclusions.&nbsp; Try it with 
		yours.</p>
		<p>If you are preparing to take or have taken the Cambridge Delta, you 
		will be familiar with the fact that one of the tasks in the written 
		examination for Module One requires candidates to play 
		spot-the-methodology from a coursebook extract.</p>
		<p>Post-method methodology seems to have arrived.&nbsp; And it's called 
		course-book methodology.</p>
