			<p>
			This guide reiterates some of the content of the essential guide to 
			methodology but then extends the analysis to refine the concepts and 
			make more links between principles and practice.<br />
			It is linked from the Delta index because much of what follows 
			bridges the links between a competent teacher and one whose practice 
			is firmly based on principle.&nbsp; Click
			<a href="../delta/delta_index.html">here</a> to go back to the Delta 
			index.</p>
			<p>
			If you have already followed the essential guide to methodology, 
			click <a href="#refined">here</a> to skip to what's new in this 
			guide.</p>
			<p>There are two common ways to define methodology in English 
			Language Teaching and, graphically, this is how they look:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="methodology" height="294" src="../../imagesgraphics/methodologies.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>The left-hand set was developed by Anthony in 1963.&nbsp; The 
			right-hand set was developed from Anthony's definition later and 
			appears in Richards and Rogers, 2001.&nbsp; Briefly:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Approach</strong></dt>
				<dd>For Anthony, an approach was simply a 
				set of principles or ideas about the nature of language learning.&nbsp; 
				In his words:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>An approach is axiomatic. It 
				describes the nature of the subject matter to be taught</em></span><br />
				For Richards and Rogers it was similar but explicitly divided 
				into theories of what language is and theories of how learning a 
				foreign language happens.<br />
				The second of these definitions has the advantage of being quite 
				explicit.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Method or Design</strong></dt>
				<dd>In this section are lesson designs such as 
				Present&ndash;Practice&ndash;Produce or Test–Teach–Test.&nbsp; Those are not 
				methods, they are ways of structuring lessons within methods.<br />
				For Anthony, method described the plan for the presentation 
				of language which is consistent with the approach.<br />
				Richards and Rogers' concept of design is somewhat broader and 
				covers the practical implications in the classroom: syllabus 
				design, activities and the roles of teachers and students.<br />
				These are not all that different but again, the latter one is 
				more explicit.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Technique or Procedure</strong></dt>
				<dd>Technique, for Anthony, was just any teaching trick or way 
				of doing something in the classroom such as eliciting, 
				approaching a reading text, encouraging authentic speaking, 
				drills and so on.<br />
				For Richards and Rogers, too, the term procedure refers to what 
				we see happening in the classroom when a particular approach and 
				design are implemented.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>It actually doesn't matter all that much which breakdown you 
			accept.&nbsp; Both are fairly arbitrary and subjective ways of 
			breaking down a complex area.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="practice" height="166" src="../../images/work250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style31">
				<h2>Methodology in practice</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>It is worth pointing out that not all methodologies will fit 
			neatly into the categories above.<br />
			For example, Communicative Language Teaching, the current dominant 
			methodology, has a good theory of language but little to say 
			concerning a theory of learning.&nbsp; Some earlier methodologies 
			such as Situational Language Teaching were similarly deficient but 
			some, audio-lingualism, for example, had very clear theories both of 
			what language actually is and how people learn languages.</p>
			<p>The extent to which, if at all, the various models and concepts 
			of language and learning actually reflect the reality of classroom 
			practices is, of course, 
			quite another matter.</p>
			<p>It is, however, often quite possible to work backwards from what 
			is observed in the classroom (techniques and procedures) and deduce 
			the approach a teacher favours (if any) or to work from the materials an 
			institution uses (the method or design) to see what principles (the 
			approach) the institution is favouring (if any).&nbsp; The Delta examination, 
			e.g., explicitly asks you to do that.</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>There are a number of provisos in the foregoing brief guide to 
			what methodology is, including:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It actually doesn't matter all that much which breakdown you 
				accept.</li>
				<li>Both Antony's and Richard and Roger's ways of defining 
				methodology are arbitrary and subjective.</li>
				<li>The extent to which, if at all, the various models and 
				concepts of language and learning actually reflect reality is 
				questionable.</li>
				<li>We should beware of techniques or procedures which 
				masquerade, or are falsely described, as methodologies.&nbsp; 
				For example:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>A PPP vs. a TTT approach to lesson design are not 
					competing methodologies; they are ways of structuring a 
					lesson and can exist happily within a variety of methods.</li>
					<li>Dictogloss is a technique, not even an approach and 
					certainly not a method, as is any form of dictation.</li>
					<li>A noticing exercise is not a method, it's a procedure 
					based on a hypothesis about learning.</li>
					</ul></li></ol>
				<p>The following is an attempt to refine our definition of method or 
			methodology (the terms are used interchangeably in most texts) to 
			make it:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>More precise and usable</li>
				<li>Less arbitrary and subjective</li>
				<li>Easier to apply principles to practice in a consistent 
				fashion.</li>

			</table>
			
			<p>Beginning in the 1980s, there has been a movement away from 
			methodology altogether because any methodology was seen as an 
			inhibiting factor prescribing (and often proscribing) what was 
			allowable in the classroom.<br />
			There is a guide, elsewhere on this site, to post-method methodology 
			as it has come to be known and there you will find the following 
			criticisms of methodology restated on the left.&nbsp; On the right 
			are some counter arguments that have been suggested.<br />

			<p>While these criticisms are partially valid (in one view, taken 
			here), they are not the line taken because a post-method methodology 
			may easily have the effect of allowing teaching to drift into 
			unprincipled eclecticism with lessons and courses being designed on 
			the basis of what seems attractive and engaging rather than what 
			might actually help the learners acquire the targets they have had 
			set or set for themselves.<br />
			There is no suggestion here that materials, procedures, tasks and 
			lessons should not be designed to be attractive and engaging, just 
			that this is not <span class="style_underline"><strong>all</strong></span> 
			they should be.</p>

			Approach, Design and Procedure, akin to Anthony's Approach, Method 
			and Technique.<br />
			We'll have 5 levels and, as we shall see, that allows a good deal more 
			precision (at the cost of some blurred edges because that is what 
			you get when you try to draw lines on a continuum) and, crucially, allows 
			the principled application of theories and hypotheses about language 
			learning to the classroom.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>How learning happens</li>
				<li>What language is</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Many people have made respectable academic careers from the study

			<p>It will suffice here to point out four popular schools of thought 
			concerning how learning happens.<br />
			This does not refer explicitly to language learning (we have yet to 
			get to the next level) but <span class="style_underline"><strong>all</strong></span> 
			learning &ndash; formal, informal and plain incidental.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Behaviourism<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="rat" height="133" src="../../images/animals_rat200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This theory rests on the premise that learning is mostly to 
				do with acquiring habits of thought and absorbing facts.&nbsp; 
				It is a theory of conditioning that makes no claims to consider 
				thoughts or feelings.<br />
				It can be summarised (as it is elsewhere on this site) like 
				this:<br />
				<img alt="behaviourism" height="105" src="../../imagesgraphics/behaviourism310.png" width="310" /><br />
				Very briefly:<br />
				the process, which is known in the trade as<strong> operant 
				conditioning</strong>, by the way, starts with a stimulus, say, a question from a&nbsp;teacher such<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the formula for Ammonia?</em><br />
				The stimulus can elicit a variety of responses, including<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huh?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NH</em><sub><em>4</em></sub><br />
				but only the right one will be reinforced.&nbsp; So, if the 
				student responds with the third response that will be reinforced 
				by the teacher's enthusiastic approval whereas the first two responses will 
				be negatively reinforced by disapproval or silence.<br />
				Enough Stimulus &gt; Response &gt; Reinforcement cycles will see the 
				habit instilled and the fact(s) acquired.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Cognitivism<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="think" height="133" src="../../images/man_thinking_silhouette200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Cognitivism is based on the theory that conscious thought 
				and decision-making are essential to learning.&nbsp; In other 
				words, learning is not a process of acquiring facts and habitual 
				behaviours, it is a process of understanding.<br />
				It is also not an unconscious process.<br />
				A second thread to cognitivism is the assertion that people can 
				integrate new knowledge into their current knowledge, hence 
				building progressively greater understanding and ability.&nbsp; 
				This is sometimes referred to as <strong>assimilation</strong>.<br />
				In this case, learning might happen something like this:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the formula for Ammonia?</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huh?<br />

				<h3>What language is</h3>

			</table>
			
			<p>Where you come from determines where you go with theories of what 
			language is.&nbsp; Theories of language are of interest not only to 
			linguists and language teachers, they are also the concern of 
			archaeologists, anthropologists, evolutionary biologists and computer 
			program theorists among others.<br />
			There are two major strands of thought here and two subsidiary 
			strands:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Language as a system<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="system" height="133" src="../../images/system_earth_moon200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>If you view language as a system of lexemes, structures and 
				grammar, which it is, of course, then you will emphasise what 
				Chomsky refers to as competence (i.e., the language that in 
				theory can be formed) over performance (what people actually say 
				and write).<br />
				In other words, you will proceed from a structuralist theory of 
				language.<br />
				In this realm, we will encounter grammarians, morphologists, 
				phoneticians, lexicographers and a range of other specialists.&nbsp; 
				A number of language guides on this site are also concerned with 
				language, English in particular, as a system of interlocking 
				structures.<br />
				We can also view language slightly differently as a hierarchy of 
				elements from phonemes up through morphemes, words, phrases and 
				clauses to sentences (which is where that analysis stops).<br />
				People who write huffy letters to newspapers complaining about 
				bad grammar and poor lexical choice fall into this camp, too, as 
				do language purists bemoaning what they see as the decline in 
				standards and the baleful influences of other varieties of a 
				language or other languages altogether.<br />
				More serious and informed people will investigate how languages grow adapt, 
				change and develop, of course.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Language as a communicative mechanism<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="talk" height="133" src="../../images/talk_tin_strings200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>If you view language as a way of communicating 
				ideas between people, which it is, of course, then you will 
				emphasise performance over competence.&nbsp; You will be taking 
				a communicative or ethnological approach.<br />
				Most 
				theories of communicative competence will state that formal 
				linguistic competence (the ability to produce well-formed 
				utterances) is <em>part</em> of the ability to use language to 
				communicate.&nbsp; The focus is, however, on functional grammar: 
				what the grammatical structures actually mean.<br />
				The focus of analysis now shifts not to how something is said or 
				written but to why, where and to whom it is directed.<br />
				The focus here, too, is on notions as well as the functions of 
				speech acts.<br />
				Functional theories of grammar such as the one proposed by 
				Halliday are in this realm too because of the emphasis which is 
				placed on the Context of Situation: the Field or topic, the 
				Tenor or relationships between users and the Mode or way the 
				text is produced.&nbsp; For more on this, see the guide to 
				genre, linked below.<br />
				In this realm, we find another zoo of specialists: 
				psychologists, anthropologists, educationalists, ethnographers, 
				functionalists, semanticists, interactionists and so on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Language as a marker of identity<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="who me" height="133" src="../../images/woman_who_me200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Here you will find political theorists and psychologists as 
				well as a few ethnographers and anthropologists.&nbsp; The view 
				here, which does not compete with the first two views is that 
				the language we speak confirms in part who we are or think we 
				are.&nbsp; People have long reported that speaking another 
				language makes them feel differently about themselves.&nbsp; Bi- 
				and multi-lingual individuals, too, may hold views compatible 
				with one language when they speak it but which are absent when 
				they speak their alternate language(s).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Language as a cultural artefact<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="culture" height="133" src="../../images/culture_easterisland200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Here there's another group of specialists in anthropology, 
				ethnology, ethnography, typology and so on.&nbsp; The view here, 
				again, not incompatible with the previous three views, is that 
				language is a culturally formed system of meanings which determines 
				how we think about the world and is determined by the needs of 
				the society in which the language developed.&nbsp; This view is 
				taken by those approaching language from an ethnographical 
				tradition.<br />
				English 
				speakers, for example, may need only one word to describe a <em>yak</em> 
				but people for whom the animal is central to their lives and who 
				depend upon its products may have many words to describe the 
				same animal at various stages of development, of various 
				appearances and either sex.<br />
				It doesn't stop with lexis, although that is where the system is 
				most obvious, but can affect appropriacy and grammar as well as 
				pronunciation.</dd>

			</table>
			
			<p>These views do not form either / or distinctions or necessarily 
			compete in a mutually exclusive manner.&nbsp; It is not in doubt 
			that language, any language, is a system of interlocking structures 
			and it is similarly not arguable that it is also a means of 
			communication.&nbsp; Those theories are simply two sides of the same 
			coin and holders of both views will usually agree that language is a 
			marker of identity and a culturally formed phenomenon.&nbsp; The 
			emphasis they place on each aspect will, however, vary 
			significantly.<br />
			Grammarians, for example, no longer stop as describing and 
			prescribing what is conventionally produced by native speakers but 
			are concerned, too, to explore subtleties of meaning and 
			communicative intention.&nbsp; Whereas once the distinction 
			between, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John broke the glass</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The glass was broken by John</em><br />
			would have been analysed purely as a grammatical form differences 
			(which was, for example, Chomsky's approach), the focus these days 
			is more likely to be on why and how the theme is shifted from <em>
			John</em> to <em>the glass</em> and what communicative effect that 
			has.<br />
			There are two allied concepts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Usage</strong>:<br />
				which concerns the formal accuracy of grammar, lexis, morphology 
				and phonology and concerns the <strong>significance</strong> of 
				a piece of language.</li>
				<li><strong>Use</strong>:<br />
				which concerns the communicative function of a language items 
				and focuses on its <strong>value</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For example, if the response to:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got a headache</em><br />
			is<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try taking an aspirin</em><br />
			and we analyse the dialogue, such as it is, in the form of 
			Initiation (informative, expressing a complaint) and Response 
			(preferred, making a suggestion) and the whole dialogue as an 
			example of a complaint-suggestion adjacency pair, then we are concerned with use 
			rather than usage.<br />
			If, however, we analyse the language of the first utterance as:<br />
			declarative mood statement with contraction of the main verb, 
			British English insertion of the past participle of <em>get</em>, a 
			determiner indefinite article and countable noun consisting of two 
			free morphemes<br />
			And we analyse the second utterance as:<br />
			a clause in the imperative mood 
			with a main verb followed by a verbal noun, an indefinite article 
			determiner and a mass noun made countable (ellipting the partitive 
			expression <em>tablet of</em>)<br />
			then we are analysing usage.<br />
			The distinction becomes rather clearer if the response is:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid shooting a wine</em><br />
			which, unless we are dealing with a bizarre situation, has 
			significance (we know what it means) but no discernible 
			communicative value although the analysis of usage is parallel 
			(imperative + verbal noun + article + mass noun made countable with 
			ellipsis of a partitive).<br />
			There is, naturally enough, no barrier to using both types of 
			analysis simultaneously and, in the second case, searching for a 
			possible communicative function to do with <em>shoot a wine</em>.<br />
			That is, in fact, what teachers do all the time when they focus on 
			form, function and meaning in the same lesson.</p>

				<h2>Level 2: Hypotheses</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Main hypotheses occupy part of what Richards and Rogers refer to 
			as Approaches as well as overlapping the category of Design 
			(Anthony's Approach and Method).<br />
			Under the consideration of cognitivist theory above, we referred to 
			four hypotheses concerning how the process of active thought may be 
			applied to learning.<br />
			This is where life gets a bit more interesting.<br />
			There are guides on this site, linked in the list of related guides 
			at the end, to all of these so a brief description of these 
			hypotheses is all that's needed here.<br />
			This list is not meant to be exhaustive and you can probably add to 
			it with a little research.&nbsp; It is also true that what in this 
			analysis will be placed in level three (the next stage down the 
			road) of the scheme will often be 
			elevated to this category, especially by those who see the 
			procedures as important.<br />
			The first four areas concern cognitivist theories of language 
			learning and some would elevate them to the major theories section, 
			above.&nbsp; However, because they are all hypotheses which are 
			cognitivist in nature, we will demote them here to this category.<br />
			There are rather too many of these hypotheses and there is a guide 
			on this site, linked below, which discusses the most important 
			ones.&nbsp; That guide covers behaviourist theories, cognitivist theories 
			and more.<br />
			Essentially, the split here is between those, like Krashen and TPR 
			enthusiasts who believe that second-language learning parallels 
			first-language acquisition and those who see it as a distinct 
			process.<br />
			One hypothesis, the first one, is actually a behaviourist theory of 
			learning and belongs as a subsection of that major theory of 
			learning.<br />
			Which hypothesis appeals will depend where one comes from at Level 1 
			on this scheme.<br />
			Behaviourists will have little time for active grammar construction 
			theorists, relying more on imitation and repetition theory but 
			cognitivists might conclude that language is learned through the 
			application of a mix of active grammar construction, connectionism 
			and social interaction.&nbsp; See below for what is meant by those 
			terms.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Imitation theory<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="parrot" height="133" src="../../images/birds_parrot200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This hypothesis underlies a good deal of classroom 
				procedures and many activities which involve modelling and 
				drilling (spoken and written).&nbsp; The learner's starting 
				point is:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say what I hear; I write what I read</em><strong>.<br />
				</strong>The idea is that certain 
				skills will become automatic and unconscious with enough 
				repetition of their use so, for example, people's pronunciation 
				will improve if they are presented with a good model and, 
				through repetition and correction, come to an adequate 
				approximation in their own production.&nbsp; In writing, too, 
				the presentation of a model sentence whose form and structure 
				the learners are required to duplicate using different phrases 
				and lexemes is a form of imitation theory in action but may have 
				elements of cognitive approaches because the learners are 
				expected to perceive the patterns they are copying and may even 
				have to analyse them in some way.<br />
				Behaviourists would add, naturally, that for imitation to work 
				well, the correct behaviour needs to be reinforced so the 
				operant conditioning can proceed.&nbsp; How reinforcement 
				happens is a technique issue and can be a reward such as the 
				teacher's approval or something less tangible such as the 
				learner's own perceived success.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Active construction of rules<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="construct" height="133" src="../../images/woman_construction200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>The hypothesis suggests that people form working rules or 
				hypotheses based on the structure of the information they are 
				exposed to.&nbsp; In other words:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I make hypotheses about the language I am learning and 
				refine them, discard them or make new ones as I encounter new 
				data</em>.<br />
				So, to continue the example above that we gave under cognitivism, a learner 
				may have noted that hydrogen forms two bonds with oxygen and 
				hence we arrive at the formula for water: H<sub>2</sub>O.&nbsp; 
				Applied indiscriminately, this little fact will only work for 
				elements of a certain valency so, later, the learner will need 
				to refine the theory to account for elements of different 
				valencies such as nitrogen and then be able to arrive at a 
				correct formula based on a better theory.&nbsp; What has 
				happened here is that the learner has used the data to refine a 
				rule so that it applies more widely.<br />
				In terms of language learning this means that learners are also 
				forming hypotheses based on the language they hear and 
				read.<br />
				For example, having noted that we form a plural in English by 
				the addition of <em>-s</em> or -<em>es</em> to the base form, many learners at 
				early stages will produce <em>womans</em> before noting the 
				restriction to the rule and refining their output accordingly.<br />
				In other words a working hypothesis will be applied indiscriminately and then later amended to 
			account for exceptions.<br />
				This will also explain how the past of <em>go</em> may be 
				correctly learned as <em>went</em> and then, once a learner has 
				acquired a rule-based approach to forming past tenses, be 
				changed to <em>goed</em> before the exceptions are noted and <em>
				went</em> is once more used.<br />
				This U-shaped learning curve (right-wrong-right) has been 
				frequently observed as children acquire their first language.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Constructivism or Social Interactionist theory<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="talk" height="133" src="../../images/talk_silhouette200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Constructivism or Social interactionism stresses social influences and consciousness.&nbsp; 
				Learning is, in other words, socially constructed through 
				discussion and interaction with others.&nbsp; The learner begins 
				from the premise that:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I use the rich data provided by interaction with others 
				to learn to use language in a socially appropriate manner</em>.<br />
				In terms of language learning, we use the language we have 
				mastered (at least partially) and note the responses and 
				reactions of others, refining or amending our own production to 
				match what others do (imitation, in other words) or to make what 
				we say and write more effective on the basis of the social 
				feedback we get.<br />
				We can use our own or others' experiences to enhance the process 
				of learning and thereby gain greater knowledge and insight into 
				the world around us.<br />
				Those wedded to a fully communicative theory of language will 
				emphasise social interaction theories over any others and may 
				attempt to manipulate the classroom setting to encourage this 
				form of learning (Dogme approaches spring to mind).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Connectionism<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="link" height="133" src="../../images/link200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Connectionism is a theory which focuses on humans' ability 
				to see patterns in data.&nbsp; The learner's starting point is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>My brain makes new neural networks responding to the 
				statistical likelihood of something being correct.</em><br />
			It has been suggested that humans make neural connections in 
			the brain based on the <strong>frequency</strong> of what they hear rather than 
			making rules based on the <strong>structure</strong> of what they hear.&nbsp; 
				In this way it differs from the Active construction of rules 
				hypothesis because, instead of forming and applying a rule, the 
				learner will estimate the chances of a form or functional 
				realisation being correct on the basis of statistical 
				likelihood.<br />
				It explains, for example, why many people will suggest that the 
				past tense of the nonsense verb <em>fring</em> would be <em>
				frang</em> rather than <em>fringed</em> because they are not 
				drawing on a rule they have internalised but are operating 
				statistically on the likelihood of something being parallel to 
				another form (quite possibly <em>ring</em> or <em>sing</em>, in this 
				case) which they already know.<br />
				It also explains why people suggest that the plural of <em>
				frouse</em> will be <em>frice</em> not <em>frouses</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Connectivism<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="connect" height="133" src="../../images/connectionist200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Connectivism is somewhat more recent and is not, yet, a 
				full-blown hypothesis concerning learning, let alone a theory.<br />
				It suggests, in essence, that it is partially what you are doing 
				now, using the internet and other digital resources to learn.<br />
				The theory asserts that new technologies have created new 
				opportunities so people can now share, research and exchange 
				views in ways that were not possible before.&nbsp; It is, in 
				these terms, a qualitative rather than simply quantitative 
				change to the way learning happens.<br />
				Technologies, including websites such as this one, online 
				discussion forums, wikis and social networks, may all be 
				involved.<br />
				MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are a good examples of 
				connectivist theory in action.<br />
				You will not be the first to point out that connectivism and 
				constructivism are more or less the same thing in different 
				settings insofar as they both require collaborative action on 
				the part of the learners.<br />
				Connectivism should not be confused with connectionist theory.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Motivation</strong><br />
				<img alt="motive" height="133" src="../../images/animals_donkey_carrot200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>There is a range of theories of motivation as a short web 
				search will reveal.&nbsp; For the purposes of language teaching, 
				two have been preferred.<br />
				Gardner and Lambert (1972) proposed four sorts of motivation 
				concerning language learning:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>Instrumental motivation: learning a language to gain 
					another goal</li>
					<li>Integrative motivation: learning a language to integrate 
					into a culture</li>
					<li>Intrinsic motivation: learning a language for the fun of 
					it and personal satisfaction</li>
					<li>Extrinsic motivation: learning a language under external 
					duress in hope of a reward or under the threat of a sanction</li>
				</ul>
				It is not suggested that these are mutually exclusive 
				categories.&nbsp; People may be motivated by a wide range of 
				factors.<br />
				Vroom (1964) proposes three factors which together are a measure 
				of motivation (this is called Expectancy Theory):<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>Valence: the value attached to an outcome: how strong is 
					the learner's need to acquire the knowledge?</li>
					<li>Expectancy: the individual's perceived ability to 
					achieve the goals set: how strongly do the learners rate 
					their own ability?</li>
					<li>Instrumentality: the likelihood that the effort will be 
					rewarded with a successful outcome: how strongly do the 
					learners feel that what they are asked to do will be 
					successful and effective?</li>
				</ul>
				Both of these hypotheses, and many more ideas about what motivation is, how 
				it can be measured and how it can be manipulated are all simply 
				hypotheses rather than theories but they will relate (if they are 
				even partially correct) to whatever overarching theory of language and theory 
				of learning one adheres to.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Acquisition </strong> <em><strong>vs</strong></em><strong>. learning and Input + 1</strong><br />
				<img alt="learn" height="133" src="../../images/learners_children200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Both of these hypotheses are linked to the name of Krashen.</dd>
				<dd>Krashen distinguishes learning, which is a formal, classroom-based 
				endeavour focused on form and accuracy, with acquisition, which 
				is an 
				informal, unconscious process similar to the way in which 
				children acquire their first language(s).<br />
				Krashen also posited the idea that what is required for 
				acquisition (or learning) to take place is that the input a 
				learner receives for optimum effect should be a) comprehensible 
				and b) just above the level of the learner.<br />
				For more, see the link to the guide at the end.<br />
				If either of these hypotheses is correct, then they are 
				particularly relevant to those whose adherence is to a theory of 
				learning which is constructivist, emphasising the social nature 
				of language acquisition / learning.&nbsp; The hypotheses will not be 
				relevant to those approaching from a purely cognitive or 
				behaviourist position.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Interlanguage<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="broken" height="133" src="../../images/broken_cup200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>You will also find this concept referred to as a learner's 
				approximative system.<br />
			The analysis of learners' errors starts with seminal work by Pit Corder (1981) who set out to investigate how the errors that learners make 
			reflect their internal mental processes.<br />
				The key concept is interlanguage, concerning
				where the learner's current knowledge lies somewhere on a 
				continuum from knowing nothing about the target language to full 
				mastery.<br />
			What studies showed was that although <strong>some</strong> errors 
			were the result of applying first-language rules to the target 
			language (which would indicate the transfer of language habits), 
			some errors indicated that learners were 
			<span class="style_underline">creatively</span> constructing 
			rules and hypotheses to explain the data to which they were exposed 
				(which would indicate an active construction of grammar approach).<br />
				The conclusion is that we should address the positive 
			role of error and ensure an adequate supply of data for the learners' cognitive processes to work 
			on.<br />
				The concept of interlanguage is relevant for those 
				who take a cognitive view of language learning but anathema to 
				those whose view a behaviourist or audio-lingual view and 
				are constrained thereby to avoid error at all costs.&nbsp; It is 
				particularly relevant to Active construction of grammar and 
				Connectionist hypotheses because Pit Corder's data seem to back 
				up the idea that some errors are caused by overgeneralising a 
				rule which needs refining and limiting or by assuming that one 
				language structure will be analogous to one the learner already 
				knows.<br />
				For more, see the links below.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Zone of Proximal Development</strong><br />
				<img alt="zone" height="133" src="../../images/zone200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This is an important hypothesis but one not tied to 
				any single overarching theory of learning or language.&nbsp; 
				The hypothesis is that learning can only be effective when the 
				learner is operating in a narrow band of challenge in which 
				tasks are not too easy (and so no help is needed and no progress 
				is made) or too difficult (where too much help is required to 
				make any progress at all and the learner is overwhelmed by too 
				much data).&nbsp; Between these zones, lies the one concerned 
				with <em>proximal</em> development, i.e., almost mastering the 
				data but needing a little help from someone more knowledgeable 
				(the teacher, a peer or the materials).<br />
				Audio-lingual approaches, based on a behaviourist theory of 
				learning will ensure this by a strict structural syllabus in which 
				incremental small steps are made as the language resources of 
				the learners grow.<br />
				Cognitivists of whichever stripe will try to ensure this by 
				leading learners to refine hypotheses based on small but finely 
				targeted amounts of 
				new data and so on.</dd>
			</dl>
				
			<p>All these important hypotheses are 
			related to which overall theory of learning and language one adopts.&nbsp; 
			That's why, in this scheme, they are described as level 2 
			hypotheses.</p>

			<p>We can summarise the story so far like this but we should bear in

			It is the case, for example, that one can take a structuralist view

			case that one may assume that learning is based on social 
			interactions but still use a good deal of repetition and drilling in 
			an effort to make language form automatic and easier to deploy in 
			interactions.&nbsp; Many proponents of a communicative view of

				<dt><strong>Noticing</strong><br />
				<img alt="notice" height="133" src="../../images/woman_doubtful200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>There is a guide to noticing on this site, linked below.&nbsp;
				Briefly:<br />
				Noticing is an individual cognitive process (so those coming 
				from a social constructivist, or behaviourist position will have 
				less use for the idea).&nbsp; It is also a procedure which 
				depends on <em>active</em> discovery of language (so acquisition 
				theorists will not have much time for it).<br />
				The essence is that learners need to have their attention drawn 
				to specific features of the language so they can notice either 
				how the language works or how their own productions differs 
				from, and is probably inferior to, a native-speaker model (or 
				near offer).&nbsp; In other words, noticing the language and 
				noticing the gap.<br />
				Only when features have been noticed, the idea is, will the 
				learner be able to apply a cognitive process of constructing or 
				amending mental pictures of how the target language works so 
				noticing procedures fit well with cognitivist theories such as 
				active construction of grammar but less well with social 
				interaction theories which focus more on communicative 
				appropriacy.<br />
				A minor facet of noticing procedures is problematising an issue.&nbsp; 
				Part of noticing, it can be argued, is noticing that something 
				is worth noticing.&nbsp; Raising an issue and suggesting that it 
				may be a problem for the learners is, therefore, a way of 
				leading the learners to notice features they previously were 
				unaware of.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Inferring</strong><br />
				<img alt="holmes" height="133" src="../../images/deductive_holmes200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This is about as far as one can get from a behaviourist 
				approach in which inferring (or guessing) is not allowable 
				because it will necessarily lead to error.<br />
				The idea of inferring meaning or structure from the data that 
				are presented does, however, sit well with a cognitivist view of 
				learning and a communicative (use-based) view of language.&nbsp; 
				The former because it depends on a mental process of deduction 
				and inspired guesswork, the latter because it depends on the 
				assumption that what is being said or written has some 
				communicative message to relay.&nbsp; Figuring out what that is 
				is a combination of cognitive processing with a communicative 
				task.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Scaffolding</strong><br />
				<img alt="scaffold" height="133" src="../../images/scaffolding200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This is more than helping or assisting as the guide to it 
				tries to make clear.&nbsp; It is inextricably linked to the idea 
				of the Zone of Proximal Development because it is here that the 
				teacher can engage the learner(s) in recognising the usefulness 
				of targets, maintaining interest in their acquisition and 
				supplying just enough help, but no more, for them to be able to 
				achieve a task.<br />
				Motivation is a key idea here, too, because scaffolding has to 
				be more helpful than supplying answers and more useful and 
				acceptable than simply working alone to puzzle something out.<br />
				There is a guide, linked below, to scaffolding and the ZPD.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Input and Intake</strong><br />
				<img alt="doors" height="133" src="../../images/two_doors_a200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Cognitivists will have a lot to say about the ways in which 
				input is converted to intake (and, eventually, output) through a 
				process of engaging attention, lodging the item in short-term 
				memory and then working on it in order that it can find its 
				place in the long-term memory store.<br />
				It is also not an idea that behaviourist theories will have much 
				trouble with because underlying an audio-lingual approach is a 
				process of drawing the learners' attention to a language item 
				and, through a combination of imitation and repetition 
				(rehearsal and retrieval is another ways of saying that) lodging 
				the data in the learners' long-term memories, ready to be 
				retrieved and produced as the occasion arises for it.<br />
				Those who adhere to the distinction between learning and 
				acquisition may also feel that an input-intake procedure is 
				efficacious because acquisition occurs when the learner is 
				focused on meaning rather than form and attending to what is 
				heard or seen in some way.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Structuring lessons</strong><br />
				<img alt="structure" height="133" src="../../images/structure_staircase200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>How lessons are structured is not, or at least should not 
				be, a random exercise intended only to inject variety into a 
				teaching programme.<br />
				For example, a Test–Teach–Test (TTT) approach may be just the 
				ticket for a class of learners who need to notice the gaps in their own 
				ability and be able to polish and refine their production in the 
				second test phase.<br />
				A task-based (TBL) approach to a lesson will fit well with a 
				constructivist view of language learning because it usually 
				demands a good deal of collaboration and interaction.&nbsp; Such 
				a lesson may be less useful, from a cognitivist point of view, 
				because the accomplishment of the task is the motivating factor 
				and the vehicle for learning which leaves too little space, 
				arguably, for the learners' cognitive processes to function at 
				the optimum level where analysis of language and skills is at a 
				premium.<br />
				A behaviourist would not be in favour of either a Task-Based or 
				a Test–Teach–Test approach because the fundamental assumption is 
				that the learners need to see the targets, repeat them and then 
				produce them in a controlled manner so there is little or no 
				point in asking people to use language they do not fully grasp 
				because error is inevitable.&nbsp; For them a 
				Present–Practise–Produce (PPP) structure is more likely to seem 
				the way forward.<br />
				One the other hand, a PPP approach would not sit well with 
				theories of social constructivist learning of language because there is 
				little that can be called social construction in the 
				presentation phase of such a lesson and by the time it comes to 
				the production phase, it is too late.<br />
				There's a little more on how lessons may be constructed in the 
				guide linked below.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Inductive and deductive approaches to tasks<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="baker" height="133" src="../../images/baker_street200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This distinction could well be regarded as a hypothesis and 
				categorised there but, because the processes are easy enough to 
				demonstrate and apply, we'll place the approaches in the 
				category of procedure.&nbsp; (The words <em>process</em> and <em>
				procedure</em> share a Latin root in <em>processus, going 
				forward</em> although the latter comes to us from French not 
				Latin directly.)<br />
				Briefly, inductive processing of data involves figuring out a 
				rule from examples of it is action so, for example, having been 
				shown:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 fish, 2 fishes, 1 apple, 2 apples, 1 
				car, 2 cars, 1 match, a box of matches, 1 cigarette, 20 
				cigarettes, 1 speaker, 3 speakers</em><br />
				and so on, a learner may arrive at a rule for forming plurals 
				with words ending in -<em>e</em>, those ending in consonants and those 
				ending in certain consonant sounds such as /ʃ/ and /tʃ/.<br />
				A deductive approach involves being told the rule or having figured out 
				the rule inductively, a learner can then proceed to apply it to 
				a more examples, such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clash, chair, bunch, table</em><br />
				etc. and arrive at the correct forms.<br />
				This could be extended, of course, to giving the learner 
				examples of how the words are pronounced (ending in /z/ or /ɪz/) 
				and getting them firstly to induce the rule and then apply it, 
				deductively, to further examples.<br />
				In order for inductive learning to happen, many insist on 
				combining the procedure with some kind of noticing task, 
				highlighting the feature that the learner should use to form the 
				rule.<br />
				Much nonsense is spoken about taking <strong>either</strong> an 
				inductive <strong>or</strong> a deductive approach to learning.&nbsp; 
				This is not an either-or distinction.&nbsp; Even if one starts 
				with a purely inductive approach in the classroom, the aim has 
				to be for the learners to hypothesise a rule (preferably the 
				right one) and then apply it to further examples of the target 
				language.&nbsp; The second procedure is, of course, purely 
				deductive.&nbsp; There is little point in putting learners to 
				the trouble of constructing a rule from exemplification if they 
				are not then encouraged to apply it.<br />
				On the other hand, starting with a deductive approach and 
				supplying a rule from the outset nearly always results in the 
				need to refine the rule later to take account of more complex 
				forms.&nbsp; Even if we knew what they are, it would not be 
				possible to supply all the rules for using, say, verb tenses in 
				English so any rule which is presented to learners has to be no 
				more than an approximation or a working hypothesis, if you 
				prefer.<br />
				The situation looks like this:<br />
				<img alt="rules" height="349" src="../../imagesgraphics/rules.png" width="465" /><br />
				and nobody knows what's in the outer ring, no matter how 
				confident and sure they may sound.</dd>

			<p>This area and the next are parts of what Richards and Rogers call

			Whether you place certain techniques in this category or the next is

			However, here's a possible list of Level 4 techniques which can be 
			applied to a range of issues and lodged within grander and more 
			overarching theories, hypotheses and procedures.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Dictation</strong><br />
				<img alt="dictation" height="133" src="../../images/write_dictation200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Most dictation techniques are most closely aligned to some kind 
				of cognitive approach because writing down what you hear (as you 
				hear it traditionally or later by reconstructing it in various Dictogloss techniques) 
				involves the application of deduction and inference, both 
				high-level cognitive processes.<br />
				Such a technique needs to be adapted to fit with a 
				constructivist theory to allow collaboration and texts need to 
				be carefully designed if they are to fall into the optimum ZPD 
				and contribute to incremental progress in the learners' 
				interlanguage.<br />
				Even in an audio-lingual, behaviourist approach such techniques 
				may be useful providing reinforcement through successful 
				completion if a simple enough text is used.<br />
				Social interaction theorists will have little time for this 
				technique unless it is adapted to be a mutual support task because it focuses on form rather than appropriate 
				communication strategies.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Elicitation, questioning and IRF (Initiation, Response and 
				Follow-up) sequences</strong><br />
				<img alt="listen" height="133" src="../../images/teaching_elicit200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>These sorts of techniques usually involve leading a learner to the right answer by careful 
				questioning and listening hard to the responses.<br />
				Anathematic to behaviourist approaches for the most part, 
				because it involves responses to learner error, such a 
				technique fits well with ideas of scaffolding and noticing as 
				well as the application of a cognitive approach.<br />
				IRF sequences are meat and drink to social interaction theorists 
				because they focus on appropriate ways of providing initiations, 
				acceptable response forms and ways of maintaining social 
				interactions.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Error</strong><br />
				<img alt="error" height="133" src="../../images/error_nail200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>It is noted elsewhere on this site that one's approach to 
				handling error depends largely on one's understanding of the 
				learning process.&nbsp; The existence of error is a sign of 
				failure in audio-lingual approaches but an opportunity for 
				scaffolding and hypothesis building in a cognitivist approach.<br />
				In the first case, error will either be ignored, disparaged or 
				briefly corrected (and never emphasised or used as a focus 
				point) but in the second errors will be expected and used as a 
				valuable source of noticing, problematising and an opportunity 
				for the refinement and upgrading of the learners' output.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Communicative </strong> <em><strong>vs</strong></em><strong>. form-focused activities</strong><br />
				<img alt="talk" height="133" src="../../images/talk_roleplay_graphic200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>How these are designed and whether they are used will largely 
				depend on whether the emphasis lies on a structuralist approach 
				to language or an interactionist / communicative view.&nbsp; The 
				latter will focus (or should) on use and the former on usage.<br />
				They can be combined in a lesson but mixing them up in a single 
				activity is perilous because it is extremely cognitively 
				challenging to focus simultaneously on successful message 
				transmission and the form of the message..</dd>
				<dt><strong>Skills</strong><br />
				<img alt="skill" height="133" src="../../images/man_skill_ball200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>If one takes a robustly structural view of language, skills work 
				will not represent a large proportion of lessons.&nbsp; However, 
				the combination of a functional and a structural view of 
				language, as in a genre approach, may pay dividends in getting 
				the best of both worlds.&nbsp; It involves, therefore, a 
				systematic approach to skills work rather than confining skills 
				and systems to their own sealed compartments.&nbsp; And a 
				systematic approach to skills work implies teaching the skills, 
				not merely providing an opportunity to practise the skills.<br />
				Much skills work is premised on an unproven (and often unstated) 
				hypothesis that language learners, being foreigners, poor 
				things, are unable to apply reading, listening, speaking and 
				writing skills that they routinely use in their first languages 
				to working with a foreign or additional language.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Monitoring</strong><br />
				<img alt="monitor" height="133" src="../../images/monitoring200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>As the guide to monitoring states, <span class="style_black"><em>People are often told to monitor but 
				rarely told how and when</em></span>.&nbsp; What a teacher is doing when 
				monitoring will depend a good deal on what that teacher 
				understands the learning process to be.&nbsp; If the concern is 
				to identify and immediately correct language errors before they 
				become embedded, the approach is audio-lingual.&nbsp; If the 
				monitoring is concerned to scaffold learners' efforts and help 
				them arrive at better and more refined hypotheses about language 
				and skills use, then the concern is more with cognitive learning 
				theories.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Feedback</strong><br />
				<img alt="feedback" height="133" src="../../images/feedback_board200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>How feedback is given and what is elicited from the learners 
				will betray a good deal about where the teaching is coming from.&nbsp; 
				The focus may be on form, on task achievement, on gauging 
				interlanguage level, on communicative success or on how 
				well collaborative procedures have functioned and all of these will 
				reflect some of the major theories and hypotheses covered in 
				this summary.</dd>

			<p>This is what Richards and Rogers mean when they identify as

			<p>We reserve this area for classroom-specific solutions to
