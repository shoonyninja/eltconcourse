			<p>This guide is entitled Alternative Approaches and the word <em>
			approach</em> is used deliberately.&nbsp; Many of the proponents of 
			what follows will describe what they do as a methodology, not an 
			approach, and to qualify for that in the terms used on this site, 
			the phenomenon would have to have a worked out theory of learning, 
			another of language, a set of clear design principles and 
			recognisable techniques used in the classroom.<br />
			It is arguable, in fact, whether any of what we call approaches here 
			qualifies as a methodology by this definition.&nbsp; Hence the term 
			approach.<br />
			The words are, unfortunately, used in different ways by different 
			people and the edges at which an approach blurs into a methodology 
			or a method into a technique are fuzzy.<br />
			For similar reasons, we have avoided the use of the term <em>method</em> 
			because, in ordinary parlance, that simply means a way of doing 
			something but in ELT is often used synonymously with the term <em>
			methodology</em>.<br />
			We will stick to the term <em>approach</em> throughout to avoid 
			wrangling about this.</p>
			<p>This guide serves as an introduction to some 
		other approaches which are often inserted into a communicative approach or may form 
		the basis for experimenting with novel ways to teach language.</p>

		<p>As the name implies, the central characteristic of the 
			approach is for the teacher to remain as silent as possible.&nbsp; 
			The main reason for this is to devolve as much autonomy and decision 
			making as possible to the learners.<br />The teacher may be silent but that is not the same as being 
			inactive.&nbsp; It is the teacher's role to monitor very actively, 
			lead pronunciation practice (a major element of the approach), make 
			decisions about when to move on or introduce new structures and 
			support the learners in their efforts.&nbsp; This may, for example, 
			mean mouthing language silently, gesturing or intervening to draw the learners' 
			attention to errors or correct language in some way.<br />It's important to note that the teacher is not 
		<em>always</em> 
			silent, just for 90% of the time.&nbsp; When the teacher does speak, 
			he/she should only say something once so that learners attend very 
			carefully.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>Cuisenaire rods</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>These are also widely used outside the Silent Way approach.&nbsp; 
			Sets of rods consist of coloured pieces of wood or plastic of 
			varying lengths.&nbsp; They can be used to represent words (showing, 
			e.g., stressed syllables), whole clauses (showing stressed words or 
			important functional words such as articles and prepositions), floor 
			plans (see picture) and even abstract ideas.&nbsp; Like this:<br />
			<img alt="rods" height="198" src="../../imagesgraphics/rod_use_eg.png" width="310" /><br />
			which simultaneously shows word class (nouns are orange, verbs blue, 
			articles black etc.), weak forms and stressed syllables (the length 
			of the rods) as well as being manipulable to show varying word 
			order.&nbsp; The possibilities don't stop there.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Colour charts</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Colour is used extensively for three purposes:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to link pronunciation to colour in the learners' minds, hence 
			making it more memorable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to link spelling to colour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to link sentence structures to colour identifying content and 
			function words<br />
			They look like this:<br />

		<p>There are two fundamental premises:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>people do not learn languages through imitation and drilling.&nbsp; 
			Learning is a creative, cognitive process which is internal to the 
			learner.&nbsp; Learning consists of trial and error, 
			making hypotheses about language and testing them out to see what 
			response the teacher provides.&nbsp; To do this, learners may draw 
			on their first languages, other languages they speak and their 
			intuition.<em>&nbsp; </em>Errors are, therefore, both 
			natural and <em>necessary.</em>&nbsp; This is, therefore, a discovery approach.</li>
			<li>the teacher's responsibility is to focus on how learners learn 
			rather than on teaching methodology or techniques.&nbsp; As far as 
			possible teachers should guide the learning process rather than 
			interfere with it.</li>

		For example, at beginner level, the teacher may use imperatives such as

			<dt><em><strong>The teacher's role</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>The teacher takes on the role of a counsellor or 'knower' whose 
			responsibility it is to help the learners perceive their strengths, 
			weaknesses and needs for the target language.&nbsp; In essence the 
			role is one of understander, informer and sympathetic listener.<br />
			The approach was originally intended for monolingual groups so it is 
			important that the teacher-counsellor is fluent in the learners' 
			language as well as the target language.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>The learners' role</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>The learner is the client.&nbsp; The client is not expected to 
			speak until ready to do so nor respond unless he/she feels 
			comfortable and prepared.&nbsp; In this respect, the approach has 
			something in common with 
			Krashen and Terrell's Natural Approach, to which a guide is linked 
			below.&nbsp; Learners are also given a good deal of autonomy in 
			terms of what they want to learn and the syllabus emerges from their 
			needs.&nbsp; In this respect, there are some parallels with Dogme 
			(see below).</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>The stages of CLL 'lessons'</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>The nature of CLL lessons, by definition, varies depending on 
			the needs and wishes of the learners (the clients).&nbsp; Here, 
			however, is one possible approach:<br />
			At first an unthreatening environment must be created.&nbsp; To this 
			end, learners normally sit in a circle and think about what they 
			want to talk about and learn to communicate.&nbsp; This may involve 
			some collaborative brainstorming in whatever language helps.<br />
			Then a tape recorder is switched on and the learners can contribute.&nbsp; 
			The teacher-counsellor's role here is discreetly to input language, 
			often via translation from the mother tongue of the group.</dd>
			<dd>The recorder is switched off and the learner-clients discuss how 
			the conversation went.<br />
			Now the tape is played back and the learners transcribe the 
			conversation (or, at least, critical parts of it).</dd>
			<dd>Finally, with the help of the teacher-counsellor, the learners 
			analyse the language they used and look for ways to improve it.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>On-line CLL</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>It can readily be seen that the advent of web-based technology 
			has given CLL a new impetus.&nbsp; Learners can form groups 
			independently of where they or their teacher-counsellor actually 
			lives and come together as (in)frequently as they like.&nbsp; Modern 
			conferencing software is ideal for this approach.</dd>

		<p>There aren't too many of these as CLL is a close fit with many

		obvious difficulties:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>It is difficult to implement the approach with anything but 
			monolingual groups (although it <em>can</em> be done with the 
			teacher simply improving the clients' language through shaping input rather 
			than translation).</li>
			<li>Because the 'syllabus' is internally generated and learner 
			based, the approach does not recommend itself to those situations in 
			which there is an externally imposed syllabus (examination classes, 
			EAP 
			and so on).</li>
			<li>Some learners may feel disorientated by the amount of autonomy 
			they are expected to demonstrate, may not have adequate ideas or may 
			be intimidated by the presence of the tape recorder.&nbsp; These are

			furniture was recommended but recently proponents suggest more 
			conventional furniture arranged around a central table.<br />
			Music (normally pre-classical) is a key element and used to 
			accompany the initial introduction of the language which is usually 
			read by the teacher to the accompaniment of the music and then by 
			the learners in the same way.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Typical procedure</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>There is usually a three-step procedure:<br />
			Firstly, the language is introduced to the accompaniment of the 
			music in what is intended to be a very relaxing and unthreatening 
			manner (playful, is a term sometimes used to describe this phase).&nbsp; 
			In this phase, too, there is a concert section in which the learners 
			repeat the material together with the teacher while they listen to 
			the music and the teacher pauses at important moments.<br />
			Next, the learners are free to use the material spontaneously, to 
			'elaborate', to 
			sing and play while the teacher guides and consults.<br />
			Finally, for further elaboration, the learners speak freely in the target language without interference or 
			interruption.</dd>

		<p>Somewhat controversially, the approach has been characterised as

			</table>
		<p>This is a fraught area.&nbsp; Original criticisms of the approach 
		were arguably based on a false understanding, indeed, some say a 
		deliberate caricature, of the approach.&nbsp; The combination of 
		soviet-era psychology and discredited hypnosis may have been 
		influential.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The approach uses subliminal manipulation of the learners 
			through a process close to hypnosis.&nbsp; Hence the name 'suggestopedia'.&nbsp; 
			That's unethical.<br />
			The response to this is that Lozanov, once a user of hypnosis for 
			psychotherapeutic purposes, is 
			now wholly opposed to it and has redefined the approach as 'desuggestopedia' to emphasise the position.&nbsp; He claims that the term was based 
			on the meaning of 'suggest' as in 'recommend', not the meaning used 
			in psychoanalysis.&nbsp; Some critics remain less than fully 
			convinced by this.<br />
			He also now denies any connections to neuro-linguistic programming, 
			the use of reclining furniture, monotonous reading tones and any other techniques that may 
			induce a hypnotic state in the learners.</li>
			<li>The approach is based on pseudo-science and a false 
			understanding of how the brain works.<br />
			There has been little evidence to refute this although there 
			are many who support Lozanov's claims.</li>
			<li>Input is limited to reading and listening with little attention 
			paid to communicative skills.<br />
			The elaboration phase of the process is claimed to provide just that 
			kind of practice.</li>
			<li>Lozanov's focus is on memorisation but language is much more 
			than that.<br />
			The claim is that learners can both memorise language items more 
			easily through these techniques and be able to deploy the items 
			naturally.</li>

		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>Absence of published materials</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>A Dogme approach abjures the use of published materials and the 
			importation of technology so a Dogme lesson may have no materials at 
			all (with all language coming from the participants) or use 
			materials imported by the learners (and, occasionally, the teacher).</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Planning</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Only the general outlines of a lesson can be planned because 
			learning is seen to happen in conversation and the focus is on what 
			emerges naturally from the learners rather than being imposed upon them.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Procedures</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Procedures are, by definition, very flexible so the teacher's 
			role will vary from equal listener and participant to short periods 
			of more recognisable teaching focused on language issues that have 
			emerged from the conversation.&nbsp; Lessons may start from an idea 
			or question from individual learners or they may brainstorm (with or 
			without the teacher) what they would like to talk about.&nbsp; At 
			the outset, before the learners have become accustomed to the 
			approach, ideas may come from the teacher but, thereafter, they 
			should derive from the learners because that will maintain relevance 
			and involvement.</dd>

		<p>The movement (it is more that than a methodology) has a number of 
		guiding principles (the exact number rather depends on who is describing 
		/ advocating the approach).&nbsp; They can be condensed into:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Interact and engage: learning happens when learners are involved 
			in what they are talking about because it is relevant to them and 
			interacting naturally with each other and the teacher.&nbsp; In 
			other words, learning is dialogic.</li>
			<li>Scaffolding: this much-abused term is used here to mean that the 
			teacher's role is to assist and shape emerging language.<br />
			For more, see the guide to scaffolding and the ZPD, linked below.</li>
			<li>Emerging language: the target of Dogme is to work with language 
			that emerges from the learners rather than impose a syllabus.</li>
			<li>Empowerment: the learners and teachers are freed from the 
			demands of externally imposed syllabuses and materials and take 
			control of the learning for themselves.&nbsp; Wherever possible, 
			therefore, any materials should come from the learners.</li>
			<li>Learning is conversation driven: the focus is on connected 
			discourse rather than sentence-level language analysis.</li>
		</ol>
			<p>We should not, however, forget that Dogme is not particularly new 
			in suggesting that an approach based on simply talking, a 
			conversational approach, is at the heart of a communicative approach 
			to language teaching.<br />
			As the guide to Communicative Language Teaching on this site notes:<br />
			In Britain prior to 1800, too, it was reasonably common for 
			wealthier families to employ refugee Huguenots as tutors to their 
			children and from them many children learned to be quite fluent in 
			French, at the time the general <em>lingua franca </em>(for that is 
			what the Latin means) of Europe and the language of diplomacy and 
			science.&nbsp; Such tutors were usually not in any sense, of course, 
			trained teachers let alone trained language teachers and their 
			pupils learned the language simply by talking.&nbsp; In 1693, John 
			Locke, the eminent British philosopher, put it this way:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Men learn languages for the ordinary 
			intercourse of Society and Communication of thoughts in common Life 
			without any design in their use of them.&nbsp; And for this purpose, 
			the Original way of Learning a Language by Conversation, not only 
			serves well enough, but is to be prefer'd as the most Expedite, 
			Proper and Natural<br />
			<span class="auto-style57">(Cited in Howatt, 1984:193)</span></p>
			<p>Underlying all these early approaches to language teaching are 
			three ideas which still inform a communicative approach to language 
			learning and teaching:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Learners need someone to communicate with whose mastery of 
				the target language is better than theirs</li>
				<li>Learners need something to talk and write about that 
				concerns them personally</li>
				<li>Learners have a motivation to learn which stems from a 
				desire to understand and be understood</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and those three requirements are a reasonable summary of the 
			underpinnings of Dogme.</p>

			</table>
		<ol>
			<li>Dogme does not give teachers the opportunity to use a complete 
			range of materials and resources and is obsessively purist (Gill, 
			2000)<br />
			There is some debate about how anti-materials Dogme actually is.&nbsp; 
			Meddings and Thornbury (2009) focus more on a critique of course 
			materials (focus on structure, cultural bias etc.) than on their 
			non-use.&nbsp; On the other hand, Dogme can address the challenges 
			of resource-poor teaching environments.</li>
			<li>Dogme overly constrains the teacher to a single role<br />
			The teacher's role needs, in fact, to be quite flexible (see below) 
			but it is true that the approach, used consistently, could confine 
			the teacher to that of informant and participant rather than, e.g., 
			teacher and manager.</li>
			<li>There is no evidence that it works<br />
			True, research evidence is lacking, but advocates of the approach 
			would aver that<ol class="auto-style56">
				<li>it is an attempt to restore the basis of 
			Communicative Language Teaching and</li>
				<li>that it shares 
			characteristics with approaches for which there is some evidence of 
			effectiveness (such as Task-based Learning in which meaning is 
			constructed in a similar way).</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Learners expect more<br />
			There is no doubt that some learners, paying good money for a 
			course, either directly or via general taxation, expect to see a 
			rich material base and to use a range of technical and print-based 
			resources.&nbsp; They may be demotivated rather than motivated by this 
			approach.</li>
			<li>Some situations require adherence to a syllabus and Dogme can't 
			be used.<br />
			It's true that an examination-focused course is an unlikely place to 
			find Dogme in action but providing the learners are sophisticated 
			enough to know what the demands of the examination are and 
			introspective enough to know where their weaknesses and needs lie, 
			there's no reason why the approach can't work with materials and 
			concerns imported by them.</li>
			<li>The claim that learning happens through dialogue alone is 
			unsustainable because learners may, in fact, learn in a variety of 
			ways and may do the learning alone, for example, struggling to make 
			meaning from a text, accessing the internet or memorising lists.&nbsp; 
			Dialogue and interaction may appeal to some learners but not to all.</li>
			<li>The claim that learning happens in the present is also 
			unsustainable because some learners (some might say most learners) 
			need time away from the stresses of instant communication to absorb 
			language and make sense of data.</li>
			<li>Dogme overstates the case against course books, contrived 
			materials and technology all of which, allied to thoughtful and 
			professional teachers, contribute immensely to teaching and 
			learning, making both more accessible and effective.</li>

		<p>The theory and approach are yet young so discerning influences on 
		other approaches is not simple.&nbsp; However, as a 
		reason to devote at least some hours a week on intensive language 
		courses to conversation-driven events Dogme fits a bill.<br />
		It is also, in fairness, sometimes used as a cover for failing to plan 
		and prepare properly.&nbsp; It has famously been dismissed as:<br />
		<span class="style_black"><em>Winging it, elevated to an art form</em></span><br />
		<span class="auto-style5">(Thornbury, 2000:3)</span></p>
		<hr />
		<p>You will have noted that in all the above a non-partisan view of the approaches 
		has been taken by preferring 
		description to prescription.&nbsp; However, as with all minority 
		approaches, there are strident proponents and opponents.&nbsp; Tread 
		warily if you tread at all.</p>

		<p>There are many web-based descriptions and elaborations of
