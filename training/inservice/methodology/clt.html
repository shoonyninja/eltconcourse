	<h1>Communicative Language Teaching (CLT)</h1>
		<p>
		<img height="207" src="../../images/talk_old_men310.jpg" width="310" alt="talk" /></p>
		<p>You may like to refresh your memory concerning 
		<a href="../background/history_development.html" target="_blank">the history and development of English Language Teaching</a> before we 
		go on (new tab) because that will give you the background.</p>
		<p>To recap briefly what was said at the end of that guide, the 
		following led to a rise in the 1960s and 1970s of a new approach to 
		language teaching:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>criticisms of structural linguistics (and the growth of 
			descriptive rather than prescriptive grammars)</li>
			<li>criticisms of behaviourist theories of learning (and an emphasis 
			on cognition)</li>
			<li>a recognition that language is primarily a means to communicate 
			(and not only a set of grammatical rules and lexis)</li>
			<li>a recognition that learners need to know how to deploy the 
			language they are learning in order to communicate</li>
		</ul>
		<p>That approach is usually called <strong>Communicative Language 
		Teaching</strong> or CLT.&nbsp; You may also find it called Communicative 
		Language Learning or CLL and even Communicative Language Teaching and 
		Learning (CLTL).</p>
		<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style22">
					<h2>The roots of CLT</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
		<p>The roots of CLT run deeper than many realise.&nbsp; As long ago as 
		the 17th century people were producing guides to learning languages 
		which expressly focused on communicative acts such as recommending, 
		suggesting and informing.&nbsp; For a little more on that, see
		the guide to the history and 
		development of ELT.</p>
		<p>The rise of a range of direct-method approaches was also spurred to 
		some extent by the recognition that people need language for a purpose, 
		not just as an intellectual exercise which would, eventually, allow 
		access to literature and the target language culture.&nbsp; For example, the originators of 
		the Oral or Situational Approach to language teaching asserted that:</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><span class="auto-style8"><em>
				The language a person originates ... is always expressed for a 
				purpose.</em></span><span class="auto-style7"><br />
		<span class="auto-style56">(Frisby and Halliday in Richards and 
				Rogers (2014: 48))</span></span></p>
		<p>and that purpose, it can be argued, is to use language to get things 
		done.</p>
			<p>The roots of CLT go further back than the 1930s, however, and 
			have been variously traced to Comenius (a 17th century Polish 
			philosopher and educationalist) and to other 17th century endeavours 
			to teach Europe's increasingly mobile population (or, at least, its 
			elites) to operate in 
			another language.&nbsp; Around that time, too, Latin was beginning 
			to lose its preeminence as the language of scholars and some, 
			notably Isaac Newton, wrote, or were beginning to write, in English.&nbsp; 
			Newton's Principia was written in Latin but his hugely successful Opticks was written in plain English, only translated into Latin two 
			years after the 1704 publication.</p>
			<p>By the 19th century, many approaches to teaching language centred 
			around its communicative functions, not just its grammar, so, for 
			example, François Gouin (1831-1896) developed a teaching methodology 
			based on sequentially logical descriptions of everyday routines and 
			others, too, were experimenting with what today would be seen as 
			communicative approaches.</p>
			<p>In Britain prior to 1800, too, it was reasonably common for 
			wealthier families to employ refugee Huguenots as tutors to their 
			children and from them many children learned to be quite fluent in 
			French, at the time the general <em>lingua franca </em>(for that is 
			what the Latin means) of Europe and the language of diplomacy and 
			science.&nbsp; Such tutors were usually not in any sense, of course, 
			trained teachers let alone trained language teachers and their 
			pupils learned the language simply by talking.&nbsp; In 1693, John 
			Locke, the eminent British philosopher, put it this way:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Men learn languages for the ordinary 
			intercourse of Society and Communication of thoughts in common Life 
			without any design in their use of them.&nbsp; And for this purpose, 
			the Original way of Learning a Language by Conversation, not only 
			serves well enough, but is to be prefer'd as the most Expedite, 
			Proper and Natural<br />
			<span class="auto-style57">(Cited in Howatt, 1984:193)</span></p>
			<p>Underlying all these early approaches to language teaching are 
			three ideas which still inform a communicative approach to language 
			learning and teaching:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Learners need someone to communicate with whose mastery of 
				the target language is better than theirs</li>
				<li>Learners need something to talk and write about that 
				concerns them personally</li>
				<li>Learners have a motivation to learn which stems from a 
				desire to understand and be understood</li>
			</ol>
		<p>Nevertheless, It is arguable that the aim of previous mainstream approaches to teaching 
		English or any other language was linguistic competence: the ability to manipulate the 
		grammatical and lexical system of the target language to construct 
		meaning.<br />
		The aim of CLT is communicative competence, a term coined by Dell Hymes 
		around 1970 to distinguish between formal ability and knowledge of the 
		structures of language and a practical, social ability to use it as a 
		medium of communication.</p>

					<h2>Defining communicative competence</h2>

				</table>
		
		<p>Firstly, of course, we need to define what we mean by communicative 
		competence.<br />
		Briefly, it is the ability to:</p>
		<ul class="redbullet">
			<li><span class="auto-style8">Apply grammar rules of a language in 
			order to form and recognise grammatically correct sentences</span><ul class="redbullet">
				<li class="greybullet">this is what is normally understood by 
			structural or grammatical competence, the ability to produce a 
			structurally accurate sentence that is comprehensible.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span class="auto-style8">Know where and when to use these sentences to whom</span><ul class="redbullet">
				<li class="greybullet">This includes four further competences:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><span class="auto-style8">Linguistic competence</span>: 
				knowledge of the grammar alone is not enough.<br />Added to 
				structural competence we need lexical competence (and that will 
				include a knowledge of idiomaticity, collocation, spelling and so on) in the target language.<br />We also need phonological competence which includes the ability 
				to produce and understand the sounds of the language along with 
				issues of stress, intonation and connected speech phenomena.</li>
					<li><span class="auto-style8">Sociolinguistic competence</span>: 
				knowledge of the rules of speaking &ndash; speech events, 
				illocutionary force, address forms, turn-taking conventions etc.</li>
					<li><span class="auto-style8">Discourse competence</span>: 
				knowing how to use and respond to different types of speech acts &ndash; 
				requests, apologies etc.&nbsp; This is sometimes called 
				functional competence and involves things like adjacency pairs 
				(apologising and forgiving, asking and refusing, demanding and 
				complying etc.).<br />
					There is a guide, linked below, to adjacency pairs and how 
					and why they are important in CLT.</li>
					<li><span class="auto-style8">Strategic competence</span>: 
				knowing how to use language appropriately &ndash; when is it 
				right to perform certain speech acts.&nbsp; This is sometimes 
				called cultural competence.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Two important points:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Communicative competence <em>includes</em> 
		linguistic competence.</li>
			<li>Communicative competence is not 
		the same as oral ability but includes competence in writing, reading and 
		listening, too.</li>
		</ol>
				<p>If you prefer a diagram:<br />
				<img alt="summary" height="391" src="../../imagesgraphics/communicative_competence.png" width="620" /></p>
				<p class="auto-style10">It's actually quite difficult these days 
				to find a teacher of English who doesn't claim to teach 
				communicatively.&nbsp; CLT has become 
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>the</strong></span> dominant methodological 
				approach and it is what underlies many of the criteria which 
				teacher training courses use to assess people.&nbsp; It's attractive, 
				simple to understand and intuitively 'correct'.&nbsp; It is, however, 
				worth taking a closer look at some of the claims.</p>

				</table>
		
		<p>This distinction is usually credited to Chomsky but it is allied to a 
		much earlier distinction described by Ferdinand de Saussure (1857 – 
		1913) a Swiss linguist (sometimes referred to 
		as the father of modern linguistics) and called <em>langue</em> vs. <em>
		parole</em>.<br />
		In both cases, the distinction is between:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>the speaker's abstract <strong>
		knowledge</strong> of the systems of the language (<em>langue</em> or
		<em>competence</em>)</dt>
			<dd>This refers to a learner's ability to articulate the 
			rules of the language.&nbsp; For example,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that the past tense of most verbs in English is formed by 
			adding -d or -ed to the base form of the verb<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I know that the possessive pronoun in French varies with the gender 
			of the following noun</em></dd>
			<dt>the speaker's actual <strong>use</strong> of 
		the language (<em>parole</em> or <em>performance</em>)</dt>
			<dd>This refers to the learner's ability to apply the rules and be 
			able to say, write or understand the value of, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She watched the game<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Marie est ma soeur</em></dd>
		</dl>
		<p>(In fact, de Saussure's distinction relates to the speech community 
		as a whole, whereas Chomsky is referring to individuals.)</p>
		<p>It is clear that CLT focuses on the learners' performance in the 
		language but it should not be forgotten that this performance is based 
		on competence.</p>

					<h2><a name="sa"></a>Speech acts</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
			<p>A speech act is an utterance as an action, a way of getting 
			something done in any language.&nbsp; In discourse analysis, speech 
			acts may be subdivided into moves.&nbsp; A <strong>move</strong> is 
			a communicative use of language which is often smaller than an 
			utterance but may be the utterance itself.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like some more tea?<br />
			</em>is a complete utterance containing just one move, offering.&nbsp; 
			However,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's true and I have often said so myself<br />
			</em>contains two moves, the confirmation (<em>That's true</em>) and 
			the information (<em>I have often said so myself</em>).</p>
			<p>In addition to coining the 
			term communicative competence, Hymes spent a good deal of his career 
			establishing the nature of communicative speech acts and what they 
			depend on for their realisation.&nbsp; The work is voluminous and 
			sometimes complex but he usefully gave us a short-cut acronym &ndash; 
			S-P-E-A-K-I-N-G.<br />
			It works like this:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>S is for Setting and Scene<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="scene" height="133" src="../../images/talk_eye_contact200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This refers to where and when a speech act is taking place 
				and the physical environment in which it occurs.<br />
				For example, the way something is said will be very strongly 
				influenced by where it is said.&nbsp; Language used in the home 
				will differ markedly from that used in a school or a public 
				place where others may be listening in.<br />
				Equally, the language use at a festive occasion will be very 
				different from that used at a more sombre and serious event.</dd>
				<dt><strong>P is for Participants<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="participants" height="133" src="../../images/talk_interview200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This refers to the speaker and the audience.&nbsp; There are 
				four participants by most analyses: addressor, speaker, hearer 
				and addressee.<br />
				For example, if we take:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John asked Mary to tell Peter to let Fred know</em><br />
				then we have:<br />
				John: the addressor and first speaker<br />
				Mary: the hearer and second speaker (note that she is not the 
				addressee)<br />
				Peter: the second hearer and third speaker (also not the 
				addressee)<br />
				Fred: the third hearer and the addressee<br />
				Not all interactions will contain all four roles discretely, of 
				course, because in a situation where only two people are 
				speaking, they will both from time to time take on the role of 
				addressor and speaker and addressee and hearer.&nbsp; It is, 
				however, noticeable that we do frequently say things which are 
				not intended to be addressed to the hearer but to be passed on 
				to, or overheard by, the real addressee.<br />
				We often send messages to more than one addressee, less 
				frequently are we addressed by more than one addressor.<br />
				Who the people are, their roles and relative power will 
				constrain quite markedly what language is used.&nbsp; We will 
				not address a police officer in the same way that we might 
				address a child or life partner in the same way we would address 
				a schoolteacher.<br />
				What is concerned here is what in other, functional, analyses is 
				called the tenor of discourse.&nbsp; For more on that, see the 
				guide to genre, linked at the end.</dd>
				<dt><strong>E is for Ends<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="ends" height="133" src="../../images/question_street200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This refers to the purposes of the interaction: the intended 
				outcomes.<br />
				We may speak to inform, to entertain, to explain, to teach, to 
				create a bond, to request information and a host of other 
				functions.&nbsp; How we phrase what we say will depend to a 
				large extent on what we intend to achieve.<br />
				This is sometimes referred to as the field of discourse but that 
				concept is somewhat wider in scope.&nbsp; See the guide to 
				genre, linked below, for more.<br />
				The language we use, for example, to suggest a reproach will be 
				very obviously different from the language we use to 
				congratulate or request help.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you help me?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You could help me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You could have helped me</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>A is for Act sequencing<br />
				<img alt="sequence" height="133" src="../../images/sequence_grass200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>Speech acts do not, of course, occur randomly.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I want you to help me with this<br />
				</em>is an unlikely beginning to an exchange as is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>What do you want to do?<br />
				</em>a very unlikely closing to an exchange.<br />
				Speech acts occur in logical orders but that is not to say that 
				they are predictable.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you got a minute?<br />
				</em>will usually be perceived as a precursor to some kind of 
				request and may be followed by:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Sure, how can I help?<br />
				</em>but may also be followed by:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a bit busy right now.&nbsp; Can it 
				wait?</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is it now?</em><br />
				and the initiator of this exchange needs to be able to react 
				sensibly and appropriately to whatever response is received.<br />
				Speech acts may follow rules associated with adjacency pairings, 
				so, for example, a suggestion such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You should take a break</em><br />
				will conventionally be followed by something like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Yes, you're right.&nbsp; I think I will</em><br />
				or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't right now<br />
				</em>or even:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not possible.</em><br />
				but will not usually be followed by something like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>May I ask a question?</em><br />
				because suggestions do not normally combine closely with 
				requests for permission.<br />
				There is a good deal more on this in the guide to adjacency 
				pairs such as complaining / making excuses, informing / 
				acknowledging, inviting / accepting / declining and so on.<br />
				The analysis of turn taking, too, is concerned with speech act 
				sequencing and part of the ability to speak in a language 
				involves knowing how, when and with what effect to take a turn, 
				hold a turn or give up a turn.<br />
				There is a separate guide to turn-taking skills, linked in the 
				list of related guides at the end.</dd>
				<dt><strong>K is for Key<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="key" height="133" src="../../images/music_flute200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Our speech contains signals of the manner, tone and spirit 
				in which we want to be heard.&nbsp; Compare for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three horses came into a bar ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess ...<br />

			For example, if you are having trouble with a computer, I might say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend, Pete, is good with hardware</em><br />

					<h2>A theory of learning</h2>

				</tr>
				</table>
		
			<p>
			It has long been recognised that CLT has a well-worked-out theory of 
			language to which, in particular, Hymes, Austin, Seale and others 
			contributed greatly.&nbsp; See above.<br />
			What is less certain is whether the methodology has a theory of 
			learning which is equally robust and detailed as it must if it is to 
			qualify as a methodology in the strict sense of the word as it is 
			used in our profession.</p>
			<p>
			Those who take a weak approach to the methodology are on sounder 
			footings here because they can draw on a range of learning theories 
			and hypotheses to explain how form can be learned and competence acquired.&nbsp; They 
			can select from (and, to some extent, mix and match) any of the 
			theories of second-language acquisition which have been propounded 
			at various times.&nbsp; These will include all those explained and 
			exemplified in the guide to second-language acquisition (to which 
			you are referred for more detail).<br />
			Most of the theories drawn on in CLT will be cognitive and many will 
			centre around active construction of grammar theory and 
			connectivism, in particular, but practitioners will also use 
			techniques which reflect imitation theory and even behaviourist 
			learning theory at times.</p>
			<p>
			Those who take a stronger line have a more impoverished set of 
			theories to draw on and many resort to proposing motivational 
			theories.&nbsp; The suggestion is that growing real communicative ability is a powerful 
			motivational factor and seeing the communicative usefulness of what 
			one is learning to do is another.</p>
			<p>
			Another theoretical lifeline draws on social constructivist theories 
			which state that learning is constructed by the learners.&nbsp; This 
			is usually contrasted in educational theory with what is labelled as 
			a transmission model in which knowledge is handed down from above.<br />
			The criticism of that is, naturally, that social constructivists are 
			setting up an unrealistic 'traditional' model in order to suggest 
			how social constructivism is superior.<br />
			It is, moreover, asserted that learning is primarily a social 
			activity.&nbsp; This means that knowledge and skills are not 
			acquired by individuals operating alone but only through interaction 
			with others.<br />
			This makes the theory a good fit with communicative classroom 
			approaches which forefront real (or even simulated) communicative tasks and emphasise 
			interaction with peers and others.<br />
			For criticisms, see the guide to second-language acquisition 
			theories.</p>
			<p>
			A second string to the theoretical bow is drawn from theories of 
			first-language acquisition and is closely related to social 
			constructivism: social interactionist theories.<br />
			This cluster of theories seeks to explain how it is that children 
			acquire not only the ability to use language accurately but also to 
			use it in socially appropriate ways.&nbsp; A good deal of attention 
			in this theory is on what is called child-directed speech.&nbsp; 
			Such speech tends to be delivered with excessive intonation range 
			and pitch and to be simplified and repeated for comprehension.&nbsp; 
			From it, the child learns to decode its meaning before going on to 
			be able to comprehend and produce more complex and appropriate 
			adult-to-adult language.<br />
			If we substitute child-directed speech for learner-directed speech, 
			we have a good theory about how learning happens in a communicative 
			classroom in which models of communication are simplified at first 
			with explicit direction to noticing the social environment of 
			language as well as the intentions of the speakers but become 
			progressively more complex and demanding as communicative competence 
			grows.</p>

	<dt><strong>Form must serve meaning<br />

			<dd>The strong form of CLT, as we saw above, suggests no teaching of language forms – no pronunciation teaching, no 
			vocabulary teaching, and definitely no grammar teaching.&nbsp; The 
			weak form asserts that all types of teaching are appropriate 
			providing the communicative goal is maintained.<br />
			Either way, there is a clear assumption in CLT that form should be 
			taught in order for people to be able to communicate.&nbsp; It is 
			not the aim of teaching; it is a means to an end.&nbsp; In other 
			words <span class="style_underline">use</span> (the actually 
			deployment of language for a purpose) is prioritised over
			<span class="style_underline">usage</span> (the manipulation of 
			structure, phonology and lexis).<br />
			How form is taught, whether inductively (through the use of example) 
			or deductively (through the provision of explicit rules) is a matter 
			of some debate but there is clear evidence that providing adult 
			learners at least with grammatical rules does contribute to their 
			learning success.<br />
			Much nonsense is spoken about taking <strong>either</strong> an 
			inductive <strong>or</strong> a deductive approach to learning.&nbsp; 
			This is not an either-or distinction.&nbsp; Even if one starts with 
			a purely inductive approach in the classroom, the aim has to be for 
			the learners to hypothesise a rule (preferably the right one) and 
			then apply it to further examples of the target language.&nbsp; The 
			second procedure is, of course, purely deductive.&nbsp; There is 
			little point in putting learners to the trouble of constructing a 
			rule from exemplification if they are not then encouraged to apply 
			it.</dd>

			<img alt="talk" height="133" src="../../images/talk_interview200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>It is not possible to enhance our learners' sociolinguistic, 
			discourse or strategic competence if, when practice is the focus of 
			the teaching, the learners don't know why they are using the 
			language, when, where and to whom.&nbsp; That means giving them the 
			data.<br />

			</strong>
			<img alt="talk" height="133" src="../../images/talk_two_eye_contact200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>This is conceptually allied to the theory underlying task-based 
			methodologies.&nbsp; It means that we should set tasks which as 
			nearly as possible simulate real-world situations and give our 
			learners the opportunity to practise their language skills in 
			meaningful ways.<br />
			It is a fundamental tenet of Communicative Language Teaching and

			<dt><strong>Input must be rich and realistic<br />

			<img alt="rich" height="133" src="../../images/cake_rich200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>This underlies CLT's insistence on using authentic materials and 
			authentic settings.&nbsp; When we acquire our first language we are 
			exposed to rich, ungraded language input &ndash; structural 
			patterns, lexical chunks, phrases and idioms etc. which we can store 
			and access on demand.&nbsp; There is a real challenge here because 
			no classroom can simulate real life but the implication is clear.&nbsp; 
			Accordingly, CLT practitioners need to take advantage of techniques 
			and technologies which allow the importation of real-life language 
			into the classroom: video, internet, 'real' people etc.</dd>
			<dt><strong>We must maximise the opportunity to use the target 
			language<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="talk" height="133" src="../../images/talk_cooler200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>The use, solely, of the target language in instruction is not 
			new but it is a guiding principle of CLT.&nbsp; Although many will 
			allow judicious use of the learners' first languages because it is a 
			useful shortcut to meaning, the ethos of CLT is that the 
			opportunities to hear, read, write and speak in the target language 
			should be maximised.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Input must be meaningful<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="meaning" height="133" src="../../images/meaning_woman200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>Not only should learners' output be set in meaningful contexts 
			and produced for real reasons, so must the input be.&nbsp; This 
			means, among other things, that teacher talk should be personalised 
			and contextualised and written materials should be set in a social 
			context and be seen to be performing a real communicative role 
			(rather than being a vehicle for language study).</dd>
			<dt><strong>Input must be comprehensible<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="talk" height="133" src="../../images/talk_to_statue200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>In order to be meaningful, of course, the language input must be 
			comprehensible and clear context and an understanding of the 
			speaker's or writer's intentions will help to make it so.&nbsp; This 
			string of the approach has been emphasised by Krashen, among others, 
			with the focus being on comprehensible input which is pitched just 
			above the learners' current level of mastery: Input + 1 is often the 
			shorthand way of denoting this.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Output must be elaborated<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="work" height="133" src="../../images/effort_stone200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>We can go a long way towards helping our learners improve their 
			communicative competence by using elaborative routines such as 
			confirmation checks (<em>So what you are saying is ...</em>), calls 
			for expansion (<em>Can you explain why that's important?</em>) etc.&nbsp; 
			In other words, it is never enough to be only comprehensible.&nbsp; 
			Learners need to be pushed to learn to say what they mean with an 
			ever-increasing level of sophistication and precision.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Output must be personalised<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="me" height="133" src="../../images/woman_who_me200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>For example, in a structure-based approach, the response from a 
			learner to the stimulus<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sort of holidays do you like?<br />
			</em>of<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like beach holidays<br />
			</em>would be appropriate 
			given the teacher's whispered prompt of <em>beach</em>.<br />
			In a CLT 
			approach, the statement should be true for that learner, making 
			the language meaningful to the individual.&nbsp; Equally, of course, 
			learners need to respond to language input such as reading or 
			listening texts in a personal way as well as using the content as a 
			language resource or a text for skills practice.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Learning must be collaborative<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="together" height="133" src="../../images/working_group200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>The obvious reason for using pairs and groups to tackle tasks is 
			the enhanced opportunities such procedures provide for real 
			negotiation of meaning and communication.&nbsp; Activities which 
			promote collaborative learning include information-gap exercises, 
			group problem-solving tasks, planning tasks, story-telling tasks and 
			many more.<br />
			The other obvious reason is that pair- and group-work activities 
			contribute to maximising the opportunities for the learners to do 
			the talking.&nbsp; In whole-class, plenary settings, usually only 
			one person speaks at a time.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Feedback must be constructive<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="construct" height="133" src="../../images/buildings_construction200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>Error is seen as a natural product of language learning in CLT 
			and needs to be dealt with on two levels:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
				<li>errors in form which must not be corrected in a way that 
				interferes with the learners' communicative efforts</li>
				<li>errors in communicative success (which can include form, 
				style and appropriacy) which must be highlighted and corrected 
				(at some point).</li>

			<img alt="police" height="133" src="../../images/woman_police200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>Active language performance is a major goal of CLT but with this 
			demand comes a danger of learners feeling stressed or inadequate to 
			the task.&nbsp; This is particular noticeable at lower levels and 
			with learners whose culture emphasises maintaining face and not 
			appearing silly in public (i.e., most of us).&nbsp; We need to

			should</em> be done but to be taken seriously in the profession, we 
			need to go on to argue persuasively <em>why</em> that should be the case.</p>
			<p>Criticisms of CLT fall into a number of categories:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Inductive learning<br />
				<img alt="think" height="133" src="../../images/man_thinking_silhouette200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				While CLT does not have, as we noted above, a 
				well-thought-through theory of how language is learned, there is 
				a thread which seems to state that given enough opportunity to 
				see, hear and use language in a natural context, the learners 
				will be able to construct an internal grammar which explains the 
				forms.<br />
				This may be the case with English which happens to have a quite 
				simple morphology.<br />
				For example, in English there is only one inflexion on the verb 
				in the present simple tense to show person (the<em> -es/-s </em>
				ending) and none at all in the past or future forms.&nbsp; Past 
				forms of all verbs are signalled by a simple ending change (the 
				regular<em> -ed/-d</em> ending) or by internal changes to the 
				verb.&nbsp; Nor does English have a recognised case structure 
				affecting the forms of adjectives, nouns and articles in 
				particular.<br />
				Other, more highly inflected languages are very different and 
				the complications are manifold.&nbsp; Trying to figure out 
				inductively how to use French verbs, German articles and Finnish 
				cases would be virtually impossible.<br />
				CLT may, therefore, arguably be appropriate for a 
				morphologically shallow language like English but is very 
				unlikely to be effective in helping learners to acquire the 
				forms of many other languages.</li>
				<li>Cultural centrism<br />
				<img alt="centre" height="133" src="../../images/centre_graphic200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Anglophone cultures are strongly individualistic and have 
				demonstrably low levels of power distance between individuals.&nbsp; 
				They also score highly on the level of uncertainty that people 
				are willing to tolerate.<br />
				These characteristics are self-evidently useful in a classroom 
				in which the effort to communicate, however inaccurate and 
				clumsy the language use is, is seen as a learning opportunity.<br />
				People from other cultures in which it is not customary to take 
				public risks, where the output of the group is more important 
				that that of the individuals in it and where people are 
				intolerant of uncertainty and prefer to have reliable rules for 
				behaviour will not be helped by an approach which conflicts with 
				their cultural conventions.<br />
				(For a bit more on culture, see the guide, linked below.)</li>
				<li>Teacher ignorance or intolerance of structure<br />
				<img alt="lazy" height="133" src="../../images/man_tired_lazy200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Many teachers who employ a communicative approach, or at least 
				claim to, are native speakers of the language who have not had 
				the opportunity to engage with its formal characteristics.&nbsp; 
				In other words, they don't feel at home with grammar.<br />
				For them, a communicative approach is a bonus because they are 
				relieved of the need to learn the grammar of the language 
				properly and can simply focus on its use.<br />
				Non-native teachers of English, on the other hand, have learned 
				the language, often to a very high level of competence, and know 
				from both personal experience and theory that a knowledge of the 
				formal aspects of grammar, lexis and pronunciation is a 
				prerequisite for the ability to communicate successfully, part 
				of it, in fact.<br />
				The lazy native teacher has no such motivation and may use a 
				communicative approach merely as a way to avoid difficult ideas.</li>
				<li>Indifference to pattern<br />
				<img alt="pattern" height="133" src="../../images/abstract_head200.jpg" width="200" /><br />The image here actually does not contain a pattern that repeats 
				(the definition of a pattern, of course) but if you look at it 
				long enough, you may think that you can discern a pattern.&nbsp; 
				That is what human brains do; we are active pattern seekers.<br />There is an argument that we should teach function not 
				structure because that's the communicative, and, therefore best, 
				way to teach.<br />The problem with the teaching of functions is 
				that it quickly degenerates into a phrase-book approach to 
				teaching anything.<br />Then we get to the stage at which a learner may be told that, 
				for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please forgive me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I regret that<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excuse me</em><br />and so on are all ways to perform the function of apologising 
				(and they are, of course, although they vary in intention and 
				style).<br />Unfortunately, however, learning those four simple phrases and 
				clauses tells the learner nothing which is of any further use 
				and it is not possible for any learner to generate, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I apologise</em><br />from any of them or even from a combination of them because 
				there is no overt pattern to emulate and manipulate.<br />On the other hand, teaching that:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgive me, please<br /></em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excuse me, please<br /></em>are transitive verbs in the imperative and the structure is 
				simply the base form of the verb followed by a direct object 
				(hence <em>me</em> not <em>I</em>) which is softened by the use 
				of <em>please, </em>does allow any learner to generate:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help me, please<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me, please<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show me, please</em><br />and thousands of other perfectly correct imperative-form 
				requests which can perform multiple functions.&nbsp; The learner 
				then has to supply the correct structure (not too hard) and know 
				the meaning of the lexis.&nbsp; That's all.<br />The reason is simple: functional language abjures a focus on 
				pattern but structural considerations insist on it.</li>
				<li>Focus on skills<br />
				<img alt="skills" height="133" src="../../images/man_skill_ball200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				A focus on language as a communication rather than language as a 
				system leads to an overdependence on skills work in the 
				classroom.&nbsp; Most adult learners already have high levels of 
				language skills in their first language(s) and neither need nor 
				want to be told about how to read, write, listen or speak.&nbsp; 
				What they want is the ability to do so in another language and 
				for that they need to know the structural and phonological 
				features which will help.<br />
				In other words, critics might say, they need skills practice, 
				not skills teaching.</li>
				<li>Focus on process<br />
				<img alt="process" height="133" src="../../images/process200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				An unspoken (and very rarely written) assumption in CLT is that 
				the very act of, say, trying to make sense of a text whether 
				written or spoken or of constructing a bit of communicative 
				writing or spoken interaction is in and of itself a good 
				learning endeavour.&nbsp; What is lost sight of is whether the 
				outcome, i.e., the product, is of any use in furthering 
				learners' abilities.<br />
				Teachers within a communicative approach, however conceived, may 
				feel the process is important but what learners crave (and have 
				often paid for) is the product.<br />
				In other words, while it asserted (see above) that learning 
				happens through the effort to communicate meaningfully, that is 
				not a proven.&nbsp; It may be the case that communication aids 
				language <em>acquisition</em> but whether it also aids language
				<em>learning</em> is a different matter.</li>
				<li>Do-it-yourself materials<br />
				<img alt="diy" height="133" src="../../images/woman_diy200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The assumption that the syllabus should be constructed around 
				the needs, interests and wishes of the learners and be 
				negotiated with them is a common one in CLT practice.&nbsp; So, 
				in an effort to appear imaginative and innovative, many teachers 
				within a communicative tradition will endeavour to construct 
				materials which appeal to the current communicative needs as 
				they see them of the learners in their charge.&nbsp; While it is 
				laudable to try to fit materials to learners in this way, there 
				are obvious dangers.<br />
				The construction of a course in language is a vast undertaking, 
				often requiring highly skilled practitioners with access to 
				large databases concerning the frequency and coverage of all 
				sorts of items.&nbsp; To hope to replace that with materials 
				constructed in whatever disposable free time a teacher may have 
				is hopelessly unrealistic and leads to unbalanced and unreliable 
				syllabus content.<br />
				Languages are large interrelated complexes of data and to try to 
				teach the systems on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis as and when the 
				need arises in the efforts of the learners to communicate with 
				inadequate formal linguistic resources is doomed to failure.&nbsp; 
				Thus, for example, a Dogme approach, which sits centrally in a 
				CLT environment, will not result in consistent teaching but 
				scattershot attention to formal features of the language which 
				may be disorganised, unconnected and internally contradictory.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>On their own, each of these criticisms would not be enough to 
			undermine the profession's current faith in CLT but, taken together, 
			they may be.</p>
