	<h1>The Lexical Approach</h1>
		<p>

		<p>There are two key references in this area, both by Michael Lewis:<br />
		<em>The Lexical Approach</em>, 1993 and <em>Implementing the Lexical Approach: Putting Theory 
		Into Practice</em>, 1997</p>
		<p>You should refer to those for more detail.&nbsp; What follows is only 
		an overview and, like all such things, does injury in trying to be 
		concise.</p>

		</table>
		<p>The theory behind the Lexical Approach hinges on the concept of 
		language chunks.&nbsp; Briefly, a language chunk is a group of words 
		which are habitually found together.&nbsp; That definition will include 
		common collocations such as <em>air-conditioning + unit, dry + stone + 
		wall, steering + wheel</em> and thousands of others, of course, as well 
		as fixed expressions such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you mind if<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are 
		you<br />
		</em>etc.&nbsp; 
		(For more,
		
		go to the guide to collocation, linked in the list of related guides at 
		the end.)<br />
		However, it will also include groups of words which are not normally seen 
		as collocations such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look at<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just last week<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tomorrow afternoon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		upside down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right way up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of sorts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have you heard ...?<br />
		</em>etc.&nbsp; Some of these 
		are multi-word verbs, some fixed phrases and some would be called 
		idioms.&nbsp; They all count as lexical chunks and are deployed as 
		single ideas.</p>
		<p>It has long been recognised that native speakers have a huge pool of 
		language chunks to draw on which serve to cut down on the time we 
		need to process thought into language and this aids fluency.&nbsp; The 
		theory is that we don't speak fluently by using our knowledge of grammar 
		and then slotting in the appropriate words to make the sense we choose.&nbsp; 
		What we do is select prefabricated chunks and use our knowledge of 
		grammar in a subsidiary, management role to help the language along.<br />
		This is what Lewes means by <span class="style_black"><em>Language consists of grammaticalised lexis, not 
		lexicalised grammar</em></span>.</p>
		<p>Can you pick out the language chunks in the last paragraph?&nbsp;
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'lexa1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have a few noted down</a>.</p>
		<div id="lexa1" style="visibility:hidden" >
		
		<p><span class="auto-style4">There are lots and lots:</span></p>
			<ul class="auto-style4">
				<li><em>native speakers</em></li>
				<li><em>to draw on</em></li>
				<li><em>to cut down on</em></li>
				<li><em>The theory is</em></li>
				<li><em>slotting in</em></li>
				<li><em>appropriate words</em></li>
				<li><em>use our knowledge</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p><span class="auto-style4">and so on.</span></p>
			</div>
			<p>There are a number of terms for chunks like these and you'll come 
			across expressions such as binomials, semi-fixed / fixed expressions 
			and so on.</p>
			<p><a name="2"></a>In spoken language in particular, where time pressures on 
			speakers are high, the use of pre-fabricated lexical chunks oils the wheels and 
			allows speakers to produce fluent language.&nbsp; It is also the 
			case that grammar rules are often relaxed in informal speech and we 
			are, therefore, more dependent on lexis.&nbsp; For example, how did 
			the speakers in this dialogue produce their utterances?</p>
			<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li><em>Did you pick up the shopping on your way home?</em></li>
				<li><em>No, I clear forgot about it.&nbsp; Sorry about that.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'lexa2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have some ideas</a>.</p>
			<div id="lexa2" style="visibility:hidden">
			<p><span class="auto-style4">In this exchange, it seems likely, according to the theory that 
			the speakers did not set out with a grammatical utterance in mind.&nbsp; 
			To apply the grammar rules in this tiny exchange would simply take 
			too long.<br />
			For speaker A, the application of grammar rules would be something 
			like:</span></p>
			<ol class="auto-style11">
				<li>form a question with an operator <em>do</em> in the right 
				tense (<em>did</em>)</li>
				<li>insert verb plus adverb particle (<em>pick up</em>)</li>
				<li>choose the article determiner for known reference (<em>the</em>)</li>
				<li>form a prepositional phrase (<em>on ... way</em>)</li>
				<li>insert correct genitive determiner (<em>your</em>)</li>
				<li>choose a zero article as this is the generic use of <em>home </em>in this case</li>
			</ol>
			<p><span class="auto-style4">and for speaker B:</span></p>
			<ol class="auto-style11">
				<li>insert negative</li>
				<li>form past tense of <em>forget</em></li>
				<li>select the correct preposition<em> </em>(<em>about</em>)</li>
				<li>insert adverb to emphasise the verb but remove the <em>-ly
				</em>ending</li>
				<li>insert appropriate pronoun (in the singular because 
				<em>shopping</em> is uncountable)</li>
				<li>insert apology with the adjective <em>sorry</em>, eliding 
				the copular verb and the subject</li>
				<li>insert appropriate anaphoric reference demonstrative pronoun to refer to previous clause 
				(<em>that</em>)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To do all that would require a lot of very fast processing.<br />
			What is probably happening is that both speakers have stored 
			expressions such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on your way home</em> as
			<span class="auto-style4">on + genitive + way home<br />
			</span>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pick up the shopping</em> as
			<span class="style_brown">pick up + article/determiner + uncountable 
			noun</span>.<br />
			Processing the language this way, in pre-fabricated chunks allows the 
			speaker to form accurate language quickly without the need to apply 
			complex grammar rules.</p>

			</div>
			<p>Clearly, relationships such as collocation will be 
			central to this approach but it goes beyond that.<br />
			For example, 
			if we take an expression such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pick up the shopping<br />
			</em>we 
			can readily see that a whole range of mass nouns can be substituted 
			with the same grammatical relationship to the verb and there are 
			also some other verbs that can have the same relationship with <em>
			up</em> as <em>pick</em> has.&nbsp; Furthermore, the pronoun 
			reference will remain the same as will the matter of separability (we 
			can't have <em>*pick up it </em>etc.)&nbsp; We can, therefore, 
			have:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>pick up the furniture / information / gossip / news</em></li>
				<li><em>pick it up</em></li>
				<li><em>gather up the crowd / data / flock</em></li>
				<li><em>gather it up</em></li>
				<li><em>clear up the mess / spillage / rubbish</em></li>
				<li><em>clear it up</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.<br />
			This close relationship between lexis and 
			grammar (colligation) is another key element of the Lexical Approach.&nbsp; 
			For more on colligation, <a href="../lexicogrammar/colligation.html">

				<h3>Delexicalised verbs</h3>
				</td>

		</table>
			<p>Allied to the idea above about the relationships between grammar 
			and lexis is the concept that some verbs are 'delexicalised'.&nbsp; 
			The most common of these in English are:<br />
			<span class="auto-style8">do | have | get | go | make | put | set | 
			take</span><br />
			A glance at the dictionary entry for any of these will tell you 
			what's odd about them.&nbsp; For each of these verbs, an online 
			dictionary entry runs to several pages.&nbsp; In the case of <em>get</em>, 
			for example, the online Oxford dictionary lists:<br />
			<span class="auto-style8">receive | experience | contract | attain | 
			fetch | prepare | find | travel by | obtain | contact | reach</span><br />
			and so on before we even get to (!) the uses with prepositions and 
			adverb particles.<br />
			<span class="auto-style9">(Source: http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/get</span>)</p>
			<p>Given this demoralising range of meanings, it is little surprise 
			that learners sometimes despair of ever getting the verb at all.&nbsp; 
			The other verbs in the list exhibit the same phenomenon.<br />
			The problem for teaching then is to encourage our learners to notice 
			the variety of meanings that any of these verbs can exhibit and 
			notice, too, that it is second half of the chunk, such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make 
			the beds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do the cooking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get the message<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have a bath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go bad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put 
			in place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set the clock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take a minute<br />
			</em>etc. which actually 
			carries the meaning.&nbsp; (If you dislike the term 'delexicalised 
			verb', an alternative is 'empty verb'.)</p>		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				<h3>Communicative efficiency</h3>

		</table>
			<p>Schmitt, 2000:400, states the case like this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara" style="width: 600px"><em>
			<span class="auto-style8">There is a good psycholinguistic basis for 
			believing that the mind stores and processes these chunks as 
			individual wholes. The main reason stems from the structure of the 
			mind itself. It can store vast amounts of knowledge in long-term 
			memory, but is only able to process small amounts of it in real time, 
			such as when one is speaking. In effect, the mind makes use of a 
			relatively abundant resource (long-term memory) to compensate for a 
			relative lack in another (processing capacity) by storing a number 
			of frequently-needed lexical chunks as individual whole units. These 
			can be easily retrieved and used without the need to compose them 
			on-line through word selection and grammatical sequencing. This 
			means there is less demand on cognitive capacity</span></em></p>
			<p>If this is true, then learners will be better able to communicate 
			if they are equipped with lexical chunks rather than grammatical 
			knowledge.&nbsp; And there's another reason: lexical chunks form an 
			integral part of functional language use.<br />
			For example, expressions like<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you let me have ... ?<br />
			</em>are 
			both produced and perceived as if they were single lexemes, cutting 
			out the need for the speaker <span class="style_underline">and</span> 
			the listener to process them word by word.&nbsp; The learner who 
			produces this does not need to understand its constituent parts, nor 
			is it necessary to understand the meaning of any of the five words 
			when heard.&nbsp; All that is needed is the knowledge that it is a 
			polite request for something to be given to the speaker.</p>		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				<h3>Theory of learning</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Once the chunk has been acquired, goes the theory, the learner 
			can analyse it at leisure and notice that <em>can</em> may be 
			replaced by other modal auxiliary verbs such as <em>would</em> to vary the meaning 
			and <em>let me have </em>can be replaced by any number of phrases.&nbsp; 
			This means we can generate, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you pass the salt?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you open the door?</em><br />
			and so on, virtually <em>ad infinitum</em>.<br />
			Thus the grammar is acquired through the medium of lexical-chunk 
			learning.&nbsp; In other words, grammar is not learned by combining 
			small units into longer ones but by breaking longer units down into 
			smaller ones.</p>

			<p>If you accept all, or even some, of the theory outlined here, it 
			will make sense to you to focus learners much more on lexical 
			chunking than on the grammar of the language.</p>
			<h3>Noticing</h3>
			<p>It is clearly undesirable to try to teach the many thousands, 
			possibly millions, of lexical chunks that a native speaker commands so proponents of a lexical 
			approach lay emphasis on noticing.&nbsp; Learners need to 
			notice that certain combinations of words perform single functions 
			or represent single ideas as in the example above.&nbsp; Once they 
			have done that, they can then go on to analyse the chunk and in 
			doing so acquire the grammar.<br />
			Noticing can be encouraged in a number of ways (and there is
			a guide to noticing on 
			this site, linked at the end in the list of related guides):</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><strong>Teacher-led noticing</strong><br />
				The teacher deliberately uses models in the classroom which are 
				rich in transferable lexical chunks and highlights these as the 
				teaching / learning targets for the lesson.&nbsp; Typically, 
				this is done through a listening or reading text with the items 
				<strong>emphasised</strong> in <span class="style_red"><strong>some</strong></span>
				<span class="auto-style34">way</span>.<br />
				The learners go on to using the chunks in authentic, 
				communicative tasks and finally to analyse them.</li>
				<li><strong>Student-led noticing</strong><br />
				With practice and some familiarity with the approach, learners 
				can become more independent and take examples of language in use 
				to focus themselves on the potential lexical chunks it contains.<br />
				Then they can incorporate them into their own production and go 
				on to analyse them at leisure.</li>
				<li><strong>Reformulation</strong><br />
				The teacher can reformulate student output (either spoken or 
				written) to focus the learners on lexical chunks.&nbsp; So, for 
				example, the production of <em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cooked the dinner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
				arrived at the station<br />
				</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I received a present<br />
				</em>can 
				be reformulated more naturally as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made the dinner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got to 
				the station<br />
				</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a present<br />
				</em>respectively.<br />
				By the same token, the production of<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to tell you 
				about ...<br />
				</em>can be reformulated as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you heard that 
				...<br />
				</em>and so on.</li>

				<h2>Criticisms</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>A number of criticisms have been made.&nbsp; Among them are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Implementing a lexical approach will produce learners whose 
				speech is limited to a range of clichés and who will not have 
				the language means to deal with new or unexpected topics and 
				functional demands.</li>
				<li>The lexical approach ignores the way second languages are 
				actually learned and that is by understanding the nature of 
				grammar and using this competence to produce novel and accurate 
				utterances.&nbsp; Acquiring lexical chunks is part of this, not 
				the origin of it.</li>
				<li>Claims for the efficacy of a lexical syllabus are not 
				supported by empirical evidence.</li>
				<li>A lexical approach is, in fact, already included in most 
				communicative language-learning approaches and there's nothing 
				new here.</li>
				<li>A good deal of the theoretical work on a lexical approach is 
				simply re-labelling the already well known.&nbsp; Just calling 
				some verbs delexicalised does not alter fundamental issues of 
				colligation and collocation, for example.</li>
				<li>What Lewis and others are actually describing is a 
				long-attested tendency in many languages to grammaticalise 
				words, bleaching them of their lexical meaning and converting 
				them to functions words.&nbsp; In other words, nothing new is 
				being described that warrants a change in teaching approach.&nbsp; 
				For examples of how this has happened in the case of words like 
				will, indeed, let, go etc., see the guide to the roots of 
				English, linked below.</li>
