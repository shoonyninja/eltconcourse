	<h1>Task-based Language Teaching (TBLT)</h1>
		<p>
		<img height="207" src="../../images/list_to-do310.jpg" width="310" alt="list" /></p>
		<p>The usual name for this approach to teaching language is Task-based 
		Learning (TBL) but you will also find it called Task-based Language Learning 
		(TBLL), Task-based Language Teaching (TBLT) or Task-based Instruction 
		(TBI).&nbsp; Here we will refer throughout to TBLT.</p>

					<h2>Origins</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
		<p>The usual primary source is the work of N Prabhu (1987) who developed 
		a theory of TBLT while working in Bangalore, India.<br />
		This approach is based on his idea (or realisation) that learners of 
		English (or any language for that matter) can just as well learn the 
		language by focusing on non-language-based tasks as they can when 
		explicitly being taught the structures and functions of the language.&nbsp; 
		Hence the name, although Prabhu generally refers to what he calls a
		<strong>procedural syllabus</strong> (i.e., one based on doing things 
		rather than overtly learning things).<br />
		The approach grew out of a frustration with the usual form of syllabus 
		(a list of functions and/or structures to learn) and its replacement 
		with a syllabus which consisted of tasks to achieve in the language, 
		such as finding out travel times and options and solving other everyday 
		problems.</p>

				</table>
		
		<p>Task-based language learning rests on three assumptions (which are 
		common to all Communicative Language Teaching):</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Real, meaningful communication is essential for language 
			learning if the aim is to improve communicative competence</li>
			<li>Using the language to do tasks aids learning and memorisation of 
			language patterns and functions</li>
			<li>The language used in the classroom needs to be meaningful to the 
			people using it</li>
		</ol>
			<p>The fourth, often unspoken, assumption is that the achievement of 
			a task in a foreign language is, in itself, a motivating aim and 
			motivation is often seen as a critical component of successful 
			language learning or acquisition.</p>

				</table>
		
		<p>The following is a brief run-down of the major characteristics of a 
		TBLT approach.&nbsp; It should be noted now that among proponents of the 
		approach there are quite marked differences of opinion concerning what 
		are and are not the most important characteristics of TBLT.</p>

				</table>
		
		<p>The objective of the approach is set within with Communicative 
		Language Teaching (of which TBL is sometimes considered a subset) and is 
		primarily to improve communicative competence by getting learners to solve a task or set of problems by communicating together in the 
		target language, refining their production and presenting their 
		findings.</p>

					<h3>Characteristics of tasks</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
		<p>According to Ellis (2009: 223) a task has to satisfy 4 criteria to 
		qualify as a task in this context:</p>
		<ol class="indentpara">
			<li><em>The primary focus should be on ‘meaning’ (by which is meant 
			that learners should be mainly concerned with processing the 
			semantic and pragmatic meaning of utterances).</em></li>
			<li><em>There should be some kind of ‘gap’ (i.e. a need to convey 
			information, to express an opinion or to infer meaning).</em></li>
			<li><em>Learners should largely have to rely on their own resources 
			(linguistic and non-linguistic) in order to complete the activity.</em></li>
			<li><em>There is a clearly deﬁned outcome other than the use of 
			language (i.e. the language serves as the means for achieving the 
			outcome, not as an end in its own right).</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Ellis goes on to note that traditional, language-based classroom 
		tasks may satisfy the second and third of these criteria, insofar as 
		information-gap exercises and the setting of a task at the beginning of 
		a Test–Teach–Test approach to lesson design.&nbsp; However, criteria 1 
		and 4 are exclusive to the taking of a TBLT approach.</p>
			<p>We should be careful here to note the distinctive definition of a 
			task in a TBLT context.<br />
			While an activity which requires learners to, say, fill in gaps in a 
			text with the correct preposition is undeniably a task in the 
			generally accepted meaning of that word, within TBLT a task is 
			distinguished by not being, overtly at least, a language-focused 
			exercise but one which parallels or simulates a real-life task.<br />
			We have, therefore, two types of task:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>language tasks (which are common to many classrooms and 
				occur within a range of methodologies) and</li>
				<li>tasks whose accomplishment leads inevitably to the use of 
				language in a real communicative setting</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is the latter definition which applies here.</p>

					<td class="auto-style22">
					<h3>Tasks types</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
		<p>A task need not be elaborate and it need not be the basis for a 
		lengthy lesson or series of lessons.&nbsp; Here are some examples of 
		tasks:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Filling in an application form</li>
			<li>Planning a day trip</li>
			<li>Learning the rules of a card game and playing it</li>
			<li>Calling a help line</li>
			<li>Planning a new government and constitution</li>
			<li>Planning ways to end war and ensure universal peace and harmony 
			throughout the galaxy</li>
		</ol>
		<p>None of these is a language task <em>per se</em> so we need to 
		distinguish between what we commonly call tasks in the classroom such as 
		vocabulary matching exercises and gap-fill texts which are overtly 
		language based and tasks which are overtly non-linguistic.&nbsp; TBL 
		focuses on non-linguistic tasks.</p>

					<img alt="authenticity" height="133" src="../../images/car_vintage200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style22">
					<h3>Authenticity</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
		<p>Some critics of TBLT have pointed out that not all tasks are of the 
		type which parallel the kinds of things learners will have to do in real 
		life and that, therefore, they lack authenticity (tasks 5 and 6 above 
		are obvious targets of this kind of criticism).<br />
		There are, however, two types of authenticity:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Situational Authenticity</strong><br />
			refers to how realistic a task is in 
			terms of its content and aims.&nbsp; For example, few learners may 
			ever need to cooperate in English to plan a day trip or play a card 
			game, let alone plan a nation's constitution so, the criticism goes, TBLT often lacks authenticity.</li>
			<li><strong>Interactional authenticity</strong><br />
			refers to how realistic in terms of 
			language use, the task is.&nbsp; For example, if the task evinces a 
			need to negotiate meaning with others, enquire and suggest etc., 
			then it may be persuasively argued that TBLT is authentic in those 
			terms.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It is, in some circumstances, for example, in the context of learning 
		English for Academic purposes, possible to attain good levels of 
		authenticity in both ways by setting tasks in which the outcomes will 
		simulate real-life tasks that the learners will need to perform later in 
		their studies as well as ensuring that the level of interactional 
		authenticity is appropriate in terms of the generalised skills such 
		learners will need to master, such as giving and responding to 
		presentations, taking turns in seminars and researching prior to 
		reporting findings etc.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<img alt="window" height="133" src="../../images/window_closed_open200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style22">
					<h3>Closed and open tasks</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
			<p>Traditionally, tasks come in two types:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Closed tasks<br />
				</strong>have single (or a predictable range of) right answers.<br />
				For example, a task which requires learners to identify and 
				categorise a set of items into, say, academic domains, will 
				normally have only one correct answer, although some ambiguity 
				may be built in, deliberately or otherwise.&nbsp; Similarly, a 
				task to summarise a lecture or the plot of a film will, while 
				not wholly predictable, allow of only a small range of possible 
				outcomes.</li>
				<li><strong>Open tasks<br />
				</strong>are those for which no right answer or range of right 
				answers can be provided in advance.<br />
				For example, a task which requires people to canvass a range of 
				opinions on a topic and present the findings to a group will not 
				have outcomes that are predictable in advance and is a task 
				which cannot be graded in terms of right or wrong solutions.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The picture is not so simple, of course, because some tasks may 
			have facets which are closed and others which are open.<br />
			For example, a task which requires learners to research leisure 
			facilities within a 5-kilometre radius and then to plan a day out 
			for their own families has elements of both sorts of task: the first 
			closed, because the task-setter knows what is available; the second 
			open, because the task-setter does not have access, presumably, to 
			the characteristics of the learners' families or to how the learners 
			may speculate on what they will enjoy or benefit from and cannot 
			predict what will arise.</p>
			<p>Often, the difference boils down to whether the learners are 
			transactional (getting something identifiable done in the language) or 
			interactional (talking about opinions, making social connections and 
			so on).<br />
			This will, naturally, lead to the need for very different language 
			to be used.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Transactions</dt>
				<dd>In transactions, verb use will usually be heavily relational, quite 
			straightforward and relatively unmodified with items such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This must be ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This might go ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That isn't ...</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			or the task will evince narrative and recount verbal use such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and then they found themselves in ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She explained ...<br />
				</em>etc<em>.</em></dd>
				<dt>Interactions</dt>
				<dd>In interactions, on the other hand, verb use may well involve 
			projecting inner thought into language with expressions such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reckon they will enjoy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know she likes ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I imagine ... will be very useful / entertaining / popular<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think they would probably enjoy ...</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			The use of discourse features may also vary substantially with 
			transactional tasks requiring the deployment of temporal expressions 
			as well as those which signal causation, concession and so on such 
			as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, ...</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			whereas interactional tasks may require the use of disjuncts (or 
			sentence adverbials) such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitely, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... because she loves ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view ...</em><br />
			etc.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>This is important because as Nunan notes (1991:286):</p>
			<p class="indentpara">In addition to the fact that the different 
			task types stimulated different interactional patterns, the research 
			also indicated that some task types might be more appropriate than 
			others for learners at particular levels of proficiency. ... The 
			important thing is that program planners and teachers should select 
			a mix of tasks to reflect the pedagogic goals of the curriculum.</p>
			<p>When it comes to designing tasks, then, the assumption is that 
			you will have a clear idea of what sorts of language the learners 
			need to learn and develop <strong>before</strong> you start.</p>

		<p>Willis, and others, do not provide a very clear way of measuring the 
		challenge level.&nbsp; However, others do.&nbsp; In particular, the work 
		of Bloom and many others in the area of designing a taxonomy of 
		educational objectives is influential and informative.<br />
		Very briefly, the revised taxonomy measures the level of cognitive 
		challenge as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Level 1: <strong>remembering</strong><br />
				This involves simply the ability to recall a fact.&nbsp; For 
				example, that the past tense of <em>undertake</em> is <em>
				undertook</em>.&nbsp; Making lists of things you have done this 
				week, for example, falls into this category.</li>
				<li>Level 2: <strong>understanding</strong><br />
				This involves some deeper thought to get to grips with a fact.&nbsp; 
				For example, that certain items or events have characteristics 
				in common.&nbsp; Comparison and matching tasks fall mostly into 
				this category, for example, making lists of things which are 
				work related and those which are purely leisure activities and 
				those which are mixed in some way.</li>
				<li>Level 3: <strong>applying</strong><br />
				This involves using knowledge and understanding to make a 
				decision.&nbsp; For example, knowing that a lion is a 
				carnivorous animal, understanding what that means and applying 
				it to being cautious in approaching the animal.&nbsp; 
				Classification tasks fall into this and the next category 
				depending how demanding they are.</li>
				<li>Level 4: <strong>analysing</strong><br />
				This requires the application of levels 1 to 3 and then going on 
				to breaking things down into constituents to understand fully 
				what is happening.&nbsp; For example, knowing the needs and 
				capacities of people, understanding what they entail, applying 
				that knowledge to design of a building and then analysing the 
				design to see how it matches.</li>
				<li>Level 5: <strong>evaluating</strong><br />
				This involves using all the processes in levels 1 to 4 and 
				judging how well, for example, a building's design meets the 
				needs of the people who will live or work in it.&nbsp; 
				Identifying problems and issues falls into this category.</li>
				<li>Level 6: <strong>creating</strong><br />
				This is the most demanding level of all because it requires the 
				use of the previous 5 levels in order to synthesise data into a 
				new and original work.&nbsp; It is at this level that much TBLT 
				is aimed but the error is often to start here and ignore the 5 
				previous levels of cognitive challenge.&nbsp; Without first 
				tackling those, it is arguable that a task will not be completed 
				to anyone's satisfaction.&nbsp; Creative tasks and extensive 
				projects fall into this category.</li>

		<p>There is some debate within TBLT circles, and beyond them, concerning 
		the degree of focus which tasks may legitimately have.<br />
		In a more traditional approach, the nature of tasks and the reasons for 
		doing them in order to practise particular language items or subskills 
		is made clear.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<p class="auto-style28">You are now going to practise turn-taking skills 
		by debating an issue in groups of three.&nbsp; Don't forget to signal 
		how you give up your turn and how you show that you would like to take a 
		turn.</p>
		<p class="auto-style26">or</p>
		<p class="auto-style27">Talk to your partner to plan a perfect holiday 
		saying what you think you should include and saying why you think it's a 
		good idea.&nbsp; For example, "We should go to ... because it'll be a 
		chance to ..." and so on.</p>
		<p>These are what is sometimes called situational skill or grammar 
		exercises inasmuch as the explicit focus is made clear to the learners 
		and they know what it is, linguistically, they are supposed to do or 
		practise.<br />
		Another way to explain this, preferred by, e.g., Nunan (1991:282), is to 
		distinguish between pedagogic tasks and real-life tasks (which attempt 
		to simulate authenticity).<br />
		In the former:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Learners are given a model of the target 
			language behaviour, as well as specific practice in manipulating key 
			language items.</p>
		<p>It is claimed that within TBLT, tasks can be both 
		focused, demanding the deployment of particular language items of 
		subskills or unfocused, demanding only general communicative competence 
		and practice.<br />
		Of the examples above, it is arguable that retelling an anecdote is a 
		task which is close to being a practice routine for spoken, informal 
		narrative tenses and behavioural process verbs, place and time adjuncts etc.<br />
		It is much less easy to predict or alert learners to the sorts of 
		language they will need or skills they need to deploy in the more 
		demanding tasks.<br />
		Focused tasks are therefore included, providing they satisfy the four 
		criteria stated by Ellis above if:</p>
		<p class="indentpara">the target linguistic feature of a focused task is 
		‘hidden’ (i.e. learners are not told explicitly what the feature is).<br />
		<span class="auto-style25">(Ellis, op cit.)</span></p>
		<p>The difference is one of orientation.</p>
		<ul class="bluebullet">
			<li>
			In an unfocused or real-life TBLT task, the learners are 
			focused on achieving the outcome and that is the central 
			motivational feature and purpose for doing the task.</li>
			<li>
			In a situational skill or grammar task (a pedagogic task), 
			the learners are focused on the language or skill they need to use 
			and the task's outcomes are peripheral to this.</li>

		<p>There is something of a small controversy here because authorities 
		differ on the ordering of a lesson procedure.&nbsp; There are 
		essentially two choices and which is suggested depends to a large extent 
		on how pure the practice is intended to be.&nbsp; A pure form of TBLT 
		which presumes that simply doing tasks will lead to language acquisition 
		with no overt teaching will exclude from the teaching-learning cycle any 
		suggestion of explicit language teaching.<br />
		There are, therefore, two approaches which can be taken although there 
		will be variations within each:</p>

		</table>
		<p>Notes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In either procedure, the content of the stages is much the same.&nbsp; 
		The pre-task stage may include the learners being exposed to an example 
		of how to tackle the task, especially if it is of the more complex, 
		cognitively demanding sort.</li>
			<li>In procedure 1, language is not the focus until after the task is 
		complete which chimes better with the approach's spirit but forces the 
		teacher to react very flexibly to the language which has emerged and 
		become the lesson's targets.</li>
			<li>In procedure 2, the teacher must be careful to plan the sorts of 
		language presentation and their targets with regard to the exact nature 
		of the task.&nbsp; This is not a straightforward endeavour.</li>
			<li>In both cases, the report stage can take many forms.&nbsp; The report may 
		be oral, digitally presented, in the form of a poster or booklet 
		presentation or it may contain elements of all of these.</li>
			<li>During the task-completion and report-planning stages, the teacher 
		needs to be very active indeed, supplying needed language, intervening 
		to smooth communication, micro-teaching and acting as a source of ideas 
		and information.&nbsp; The teacher should get out of the way in the 
			report-presentation phase.</li>
			<li>Evaluation occurs at the end of the task and is based on how 
			well the task has been achieved, not the accuracy of the language 
			employed to do it.</li>
		</ol>
			<p>Another way to see the procedure is to focus on what the learners 
			are doing with the language at each stage, like this:<br />
			<img alt="procedure" height="325" src="../../imagesgraphics/tblt_procedure.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>The final repetition phase can either be a repeat of the task, a 
			task very similar to it but with a different topic or a task which 
			builds on and develops the work done in the first (and any previous) 
			task.</p>

			<dt><em><strong>Multiple language focus</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Unlike many approaches, learners are free to deploy as much

			lexis and other items.&nbsp; This blending of language more closely 
			resembles real-life language use than does the focus on individual 
			items which a 'normal' lesson has.&nbsp; See, too, the comments 
			above concerning authenticity.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>The content is relevant and personalised</strong></em></dt>

			it is claimed, makes it memorable.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>It is learner centred</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Compared to a traditional lesson (whatever that may be), the

			<dd>Clearly, groups can be formed which are nearly homogenous in

		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>Appropriateness</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>For certain types of students (those studying for examinations, 
			elementary learners etc.), TBL is often not seen as appropriate 
			because it demands little focus on accuracy and requires language 
			skills above the level of many.&nbsp; Grading the task may help but 
			may not entirely meet these criticisms.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>One-size-fits-all</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Tasks are usually set to whole classes.&nbsp; They may not 
			interest all the students so the advantages of personalisation and 
			motivation are lost.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Language form</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>The teaching of language form is problematic.&nbsp; If it comes 
			at the outset (see Procedure 1), it may not be relevant to what 
			emerges as the task is tackled.&nbsp; If it comes at the end, there 
			is a sense that the cart is before the horse because learners will 
			feel frustrated at only later being taught the language they need.&nbsp; 
			Avoiding both these drawbacks requires highly skilful, proactive 
			and reactive teaching.</dd>
			<dt><strong><em>Input</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>This is a key criticism.&nbsp; Task-based learning requires 
			learners to use language, certainly, but it is language they already 
			know.&nbsp; If the learners receive little or no input on which 
			they can work, how is any learning to be achieved?&nbsp; Swan (2005:378) put 
			it this way:<p class="auto-style29"><em>I 
			suggest that naturalistically-biased approaches are, in important 
			respects, pedagogically impoverished, favouring the development of 
			what is already known at the expense of the efﬁcient teaching of new 
			language, and paying a heavy price for the ‘downgrading’ of the 
			teacher.</em></p>
			</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Learner </strong></em><strong><em>preferences</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>The approach appeals in particular to learners whose preferred 
			style involves being active and getting things done.&nbsp; More 
			reflective, more form-focused and less confident learners may not 
			benefit from the opportunities to negotiate outcomes in the same 
			way, if at all.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Learning</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>It is not clear in many TBLT lessons that real learning of new 
			language is taking place.&nbsp; Learners may simply be deploying 
			language they already command.&nbsp; Practice is happening; learning 
			is not.</dd>

		<p>TBL is undoubtedly very influential, especially in communicative 
		language teaching approaches because of its clear fit with many of the 
		tenets of CLT.&nbsp; Few courses in this tradition lack any element of 
		task-based learning and some courses depend almost entirely upon the 
		approach.<br />
		It should also be noted, however, that taking a TBL approach is 
		different in terms of focus and complexity from just using tasks to 
		practise what has been taught.&nbsp; Handing out a worksheet task is not 
		evidence that you are taking a task-based approach.</p>

			<p>There has been some interest in the adaptation for English 
			Language Teaching of a teaching procedure developed in the 1960s and 
			after for the teaching of medicine.&nbsp; The idea then mutated and 
			was carried over into 
			other science-based realms including engineering, architecture, 
			chemistry, biology and more and from there into the humanities.<br />
			This summary appears here because the approach bears striking 
			resemblances to Task-Based Learning and may be considered part of it 
			in many respects (at least as far as ELT is concerned).<br />
			The procedure is based on the identification of a problem, real or 
			imagined, which is presented to the learners as a group.&nbsp; Then:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The learners elect or dragoon a member to be the chair of 
				the group and another to be its scribe.&nbsp; These roles may 
				rotate around the group members at each session.</li>
				<li>The learners bring to bear as much of what they already know 
				as is appropriate on the problem and suggest / brainstorm areas 
				to research.</li>
				<li>The scribe lists these areas and the tasks are distributed 
				to the group members.</li>
				<li>Individually or collaboratively, the learners carry out the 
				research they need to seek a solution to the problem (which in 
				the original form was, of course, a patient presenting with 
				certain symptoms or another medical problem).</li>
				<li>The learners return to the group and present their findings 
				which are discussed with a tutor present in a seminar to check 
				for accuracy and errors.</li>
				<li>Further research aims are identified and the process repeats 
				until the group is satisfied that it has reached a reasonable 
				conclusion and solution (if there is one) to the problem with 
				which it was presented.</li>
				<li>The group presents its findings to the tutor and receives 
				feedback (and grading possibly).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The claims which are made for this approach are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It encourages collaborative learning and responses to 
				problems which is one goal of the training of doctors.</li>
				<li>It encourages and trains learners in autonomous research 
				skills.</li>
				<li>It enhances and practises the skills of presenting solutions 
				and discussing them rationally.</li>
				<li>It is based on a clearly relevant real-world scenario and 
				may even be based on a real problem encountered in the training 
				institute to which the combined ideas of the group will 
				contribute ideas for solutions.&nbsp; This is clearly a strong 
				motivating factor for people to work assiduously on the task.</li>
				<li>It starts from the premise that knowledge may be acquired 
				but cannot easily or effectively be transmitted.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Although it is not obvious how such a programme could be 
			implemented in language teaching as a central methodological 
			approach it is possible to imagine scenarios in which a real-life 
			language problem for a group of learners working in a particular 
			environment might well be applicable.<br />
			For example, if the learners are faced with the task of writing 
			promotional materials in English for an in-house marketing effort, 
			then they could be encouraged to set out the issues as they see 
			them, research the language they need, brainstorm solutions and 
			produce something they feel is acceptable for the tutor's 
			consideration and feedback.<br />
			Any number of real or imagined issues can be tackled that way 
			whether the outcome is written or a spoken presentation or a 
			combination.</p>
			<p>In the realm of English language teacher training, the approach 
			also has some adherents because the five advantages set out here are 
			not confined to trainee doctors and could just as well apply to 
			trainee language teachers.</p>

		<p>As befits the subject, there's no test on any of this but there is a 
		task.&nbsp; Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to plan and 
		carry out two task-based lessons on the same topic.&nbsp; The topic can 
		be anything, but 'education' is a good place to start because everyone is 
		familiar with it and most people have ideas about how it is best done 
		(uninformed and sometimes daft, though they may be).<br />
		Choose from 
		Procedure 1 or 2 above (or use both).</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The first is simple.&nbsp; All you need to do is design and 
			carry out a listing and matching / comparison task which will take 
			around 40 minutes and get you and your learners accustomed to a 
			task-based approach.&nbsp; Something like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">The best 5 and worst 5 
			things about my school / school days</span><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">&nbsp;The advantages and 
			disadvantages of schools in general</span><br />
			or whatever else will interest 
			and intrigue your learners is one idea.</li>
			<li>The second is more challenging.&nbsp; In a following series of 
			lessons, plan and carry out a project-based task in which the 
			learners will have to produce a thought-through set of ideas and 
			solutions based on the topic area you have chosen and plan and 
			present their findings to the rest of the group in some way &ndash; 
			posters, PowerPoint presentations, oral presentations or a 
			combination of all these ways.</li>
			<li>At the end, <em>your</em> task is to evaluate how the procedures 
			went, what was learnt and how well (or otherwise) the approach was 
			received by your learners.<br />
			(If you are preparing for Module Two of the Cambridge Delta, this is an 
			ideal way to do the Experimental Practice part of the Professional 
			Development Assignment.)</li>
