			<p>There is nothing very new about CLIL, despite the fact that it is 
			being suggested that it is a revolutionary way to approach the 
			teaching of language.<br />
			In Sumeria, 5000 years ago, the conquering Akkadians chose to learn 
			the local language by using it as the language of instruction (Hanesov√°, 
			2015: 7).&nbsp; In Ancient Rome, patrician families would often 
			choose to have their sons, and, occasionally their daughters, 
			educated in Greek.<br />
			More recently, wealthier families in many European countries 
			employed tutors and governesses with particular language backgrounds 
			(often French) to teach their children in a foreign language and the 
			very wealthy would often choose to send their children abroad for a 
			full immersion course in a foreign language.<br />
			More recently, there has been renewed interest in the idea of 
			providing language instruction through the medium of instruction in 
			other subjects in a range of countries, including Canada where, in 
			the mid-1960s, a programme was undertaken in which English-speaking 
			children were taught in primary schools in French and vice versa in 
			an effort, which still continues, to produce a truly bilingual 
			generation.<br />
			In Europe, The Netherlands has a long tradition of bilingual 
			educational programmes as does Finland, Hungary, The Czech Republic 
			and Slovakia.&nbsp; Other countries are catching up fast, especially 
			with the establishment of English-medium universities in, e.g., 
			Italy.</p>
			<h3>Also known as ...</h3>
			<p>CLIL is known by many other names in the profession:<br />
			Bilingual Integration of Languages and Disciplines (BILD), Content 
			and Language Integration in Primary CLIP, Content-based Instruction 
			(CBI), Content-based Language Instruction (CBLI), Content-based 
			Language Teaching (CBLT), English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI), 
			Foreign Languages as a Medium of Education (FLAME), Languages Across 
			the Curriculum (LAC), Teaching Content Through English (TCTE), 
			Teaching English Through Content (TETC) etc.<br />
			Here, for the sake of sanity, we will refer to CLIL but it should 
			not be forgotten that the methodology comes in a variety of guises 
			and forms.</p>

					<h2>The European Union and CLIL</h2>

				</tr>
				</table>
		
			<p>It is unsurprising that the European Union is a fervent supporter 
			of CLIL programmes.&nbsp; The Union has 24 official languages and 3 
			procedural ones (English, French and German) and encourages its 
			citizens to be able to speak two other languages in addition to 
			their native language.<br />
			Article 22 of the charter specifically commits the union to 
			multilingualism and the EU currently spends over 1 billion Euros a 
			year on translation and interpretation services (1% of its entire 
			budget).<br />
			The European Union has become a driving force for research and 
			investment in CLIL programmes.&nbsp; And it is having a dramatic 
			effect.&nbsp; The ICEF Monitor (International Consultants for 
			Education and Fairs) reports, for example, that</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>The number of English-medium undergraduate 
			degree programmes in Europe has gone from practically zero in 2009 
			to nearly 3,000 this year </em><span class="auto-style23">[2017]</span></p>
			<p>The EU also puts its money where its mouth is and provides very 
			significant funding for international CLIL projects through the 
			Socrates Programme in particular.<br />
			If you are looking for more than this brief guide can provide, the 
			EU's websites and various institutions can provide an impressive 
			amount of data.&nbsp; Not all of it is relevant to all 
			English-language teaching.</p>

					<h2>Inside the box: how does CLIL work?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
			<p>CLIL has a number of characteristics and here's a summary:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In CLIL content subjects such as those which appear in a 
				nation's school curricula as well as skills that are generally 
				acquired later in life, in tertiary or occupational education 
				are taught and learnt in a language which is not the mother 
				tongue of the learners.&nbsp; In our case, we are concerned with 
				English but the principles are the same whatever the language 
				target.</li>
				<li>The principle is neither that the content of the syllabus is 
				learned through the language, nor that the language is learned 
				through the learning of the content but that there is a 
				reciprocal process in which acquisition of the target language 
				occurs simultaneously with the learning of the syllabus content.</li>
				<li>The target language is, therefore, integrated into the 
				general educational programme rather than being a strand within 
				it in the traditional sense.</li>
				<li>The theory is that setting a foreign language in a 
				motivating context in which the learners are keen to acquire the 
				topic knowledge will increase motivation by making the language 
				more relevant to them</li>
				<li>Following Krashen, CLIL is concerned with language 
				acquisition rather than language learning.</li>
				<li>The language is encountered in real-life communicative 
				settings providing learners with a rich, relevant and various 
				source of language data to work on</li>
				<li>CLIL encourages long-term learning.&nbsp; Typically, it has 
				been claimed, after 5 to 7 years of a programme, the learners 
				have attained a level of mastery which allows them to continue 
				their language learning independently.</li>
				<li>Mastery of written material is an essential part of CLIL 
				training.</li>
				<li>Most CLIL course seem to take a lexical approach but there's 
				no hard data to confirm that.</li>
			</ol>

					<h2>The typical structure of a CLIL lesson</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
			<p>All lessons are different and CLIL lessons will be very varied, 
			not least to take account of the nature of the content.&nbsp; A CLIL 
			lesson in biology or physics will be very different and have 
			different language focuses from one in history or literature.&nbsp; 
			In that sense, CLIL becomes an extension of teaching English (or 
			another language) for Special Purposes, particularly Academic 
			Purposes.<br />
			There are, however, some discernible commonalities which can be 
			teased out of the literature in the area.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Aims<br />
				The aims of all CLIL lessons are, fairly obviously, to deliver 
				syllabus content in tandem with language learning.</li>
				<li>Priorities<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>to integrate language skills</li>
					<li>to use subject-specific reading or listening texts</li>
					<li>to allow the text content to determine the functional 
					language to be learned</li>
					<li>to ignore structural complexity</li>
					<li>to teach language lexically rather than grammatically</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Test handling<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>texts should, wherever possible be presented in parallel 
					with visual data (charts, graphs, time lines, tree 
					structures and so on)</li>
					<li>activities are based on the text structure and involve 
					some analysis of the text organisation.&nbsp; This is a 
					genre approach to a text.</li>
					<li>activities focus both on the language in the text and 
					the subject content that the text is endeavouring to present</li>
					<li>tasks will frequently compel the learners to reproduce 
					the central ideas of the text in either their own words or 
					by designing diagrams and posters to present the information 
					and concepts</li>
					<li>the language needs of the learners will be functionally 
					rather than structurally based so, for example, the teacher 
					may introduce and practise the language of linking cause and 
					effect, using references to make the text cohesive and so 
					on.</li>
					<li>the main vocabulary focus will be subject specific</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Tasks may include, for example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>Listen / read for specific dates, times or figures</li>
					<li>Read and fill in a table</li>
					<li>Read and label a diagram/picture/map/graph/chart</li>
					<li>Read and label the stages of a process on a worksheet 
					diagram</li>
					<li>Listen and fill in a gapped text with subject-specific 
					noun phrases</li>
					<li>Spoken information-gap activities in which learners 
					explain particular concepts or vocabulary to each other</li>
					<li>Presentation activities in groups or to the whole class</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is nothing in this list, incidentally, which is not also 
			common in most CLT classrooms and certainly nothing which a class in 
			English for Academic Purposes would find unusual.<br />
			This promiscuous mix of methodologies, which includes elements of 
			The Lexical Approach, Task-based Learning, genre theory and English 
			for Academic Purposes, has led some to wonder if CLIL is not simply 
			a form of principled, or unprincipled, eclecticism.</p>

			<p>Proponents of CLIL claim a number of advantages.&nbsp; Some of 
			these are applicable particularly to those in compulsory education; 
			others apply more broadly.&nbsp; CLIL, it is claimed:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>prepares students for an increasingly internationalised 
				world in which mastery of more than two languages will be 
				essential.&nbsp; A number of major international companies 
				already use English as the sole medium of communication within 
				the business and more are expected to follow the trend.</li>
				<li>introduces students to a broader range of cultural contexts 
				than is possible in a mono-lingual educational setting</li>
				<li>allows students access to international qualifications and 
				certification</li>
				<li>enhances the profile of the school</li>
				<li>improves both overall and language-specific skills</li>
				<li>prepares students for work</li>
				<li>develops multi-lingual interests</li>
				<li>diversifies the classroom both in terms of materials and 
				teaching approaches</li>
				<li>increases motivation</li>

					<h2><a name="criticisms"></a>Criticisms of CLIL</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
			<p>The central criticism is that there simply is no reliable 
			empirical evidence to suggest that CLIL is a more effective way to 
			learn languages.&nbsp; There are other more specific criticisms:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Subject teachers in secondary schools and tertiary education 
				may resist the adoption of CLIL because they do not have the 
				necessary language skills or language teaching training.</li>
				<li>Subject teachers may feel that their concerns (to teach the 
				content of the curriculum) is being made harder by the 
				imposition of foreign-language-medium instruction.</li>
				<li>Many current CLIL programmes are money-making enterprises in 
				the private sector which have little or no interest in doing or 
				participating in empirical research to discover what is and is 
				not effective.</li>
				<li>Most CLIL programmes in compulsory education settings happen 
				in mono-lingual settings in which implementing a programme 
				which demands immersion in the target language is both 
				impractical and unnatural.</li>
				<li>There is a serious shortage of teachers who have both the 
				subject knowledge and the language teaching skills to operate 
				effective in a CLIL setting.&nbsp; The majority may, therefore, 
				be ill-equipped and ill-trained for the demands of a CLIL 
				programme and not delivering a high-quality experience.</li>
				<li>Understanding of the content wing of the syllabus may well 
				be reduced if it is accessed through the students' incomplete 
				and patchy mastery of a foreign language.&nbsp; In particular, 
				subtleties within concepts may be masked or remain 
				unappreciated.</li>
				<li>Some aspects of CLIL programmes are unnatural and forced 
				such as teaching national history or even the appreciation of 
				national literature in a foreign language.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It seems likely, therefore that CLIL will remain a borderline or 
			parallel methodology until the needs of teachers are met.&nbsp; 
			Notwithstanding, it is clear that CLIL programmes are becoming 
			increasingly popular in mainstream education, in the private sector 
			and, especially, in tertiary education worldwide.</p>
			<p>This is, as was said, a brief guide to the main aspects of CLIL.&nbsp; 
			For more, try a web search for CLIL.&nbsp; It is not possible to 
			supply a list of links here because many of the sites move around 
			with bewildering rapidity and are often unfindable or simply 
			abandoned.</p>
