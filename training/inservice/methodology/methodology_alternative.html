		<p>As the name implies, the central characteristic of the 
			methodology is for the teacher to remain as silent as possible.&nbsp; 
			The main reason for this is to devolve as much autonomy and decision 
			making as possible to the learners.<br />The teacher may be silent but that is not the same as being 
			inactive.&nbsp; It is the teacher's role to monitor very actively, 
			lead pronunciation practice (a major element of the approach), make 
			decisions about when to move on or introduce new structures and 
			support the learners in their efforts.&nbsp; This may, for example, 
			mean mouthing language silently, gesturing or intervening to draw the learners' 
			attention to errors or correct language in some way.<br />It's important to note that the teacher is not 
		<em>always</em> 
			silent, just for 90% of the time.&nbsp; When the teacher does speak, 
			he/she should only say something once so that learners attend very 
			carefully.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>Cuisenaire rods</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>These are also widely used outside the Silent Way approach.&nbsp; 
			Sets of rods consist of coloured pieces of wood or plastic of 
			varying lengths.&nbsp; They can be used to represent words (showing, 
			e.g., stressed syllables), whole clauses (showing stressed words or 
			important functional words such as articles and prepositions), floor 
			plans (see picture) and even abstract ideas.&nbsp; Like this:<br />
			<img alt="example rod use" height="193" src="../../imagesgraphics/roduseeg.png" width="300" /><br />
			which simultaneously shows word class (nouns are orange, verbs blue, 
			articles black etc.), weak forms and stressed syllables (the length 
			of the rods) as well as being manipulable to show varying word 
			order.&nbsp; The possibilities don't stop there.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Colour charts</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Colour is used extensively for three purposes:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to link pronunciation to colour in the learners' minds, hence 
			making it more memorable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to link spelling to colour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to link sentence structures to colour identifying content and 
			function words<br />
			They look like this:<br />

		<p>There are two fundamental premises:</p>

			<li>people do not learn languages through imitation and drilling.&nbsp; 
			Learning is a creative, cognitive process which is internal to the 
			learner.&nbsp; Learning consists of trial and error, 
			making hypotheses about language and testing them out to see what 
			response the teacher provides.&nbsp; To do this, learners may draw 
			on their first languages, other languages they speak and their 
			intuition.<em>&nbsp; </em>Errors are, therefore, both 
			natural and <em>necessary.</em>&nbsp; This is, therefore, a discovery approach.</li>
			<li>the teacher's responsibility is to focus on how learners learn 
			rather than on teaching methodology or techniques.&nbsp; As far as 
			possible teachers should guide the learning process rather than 
			interfere with it.</li>

			the needs and wishes of the learners (the clients).&nbsp; Here, 
			however, is one possible approach:<br />
			At first an unthreatening environment must be created.&nbsp; To this 
			end, learners normally sit in a circle and think about what they 
			want to talk about and learn to communicate.&nbsp; This may involve 
			some collaborative brainstorming in whatever language helps.<br />
			Then a tape recorder is switched on and the learners can contribute.&nbsp; 
			The teacher-counsellor's role here is discreetly to input language, 
			often via translation from the mother tongue of the group.</dd>
			<dd>The recorder is switched off and the learner-clients discuss how 
			the conversation went.<br />
			Now the tape is played back and the learners transcribe the 
			conversation (or, at least, critical parts of it).</dd>
			<dd>Finally, with the help of the teacher-counsellor, the learners 
			analyse the language they used and look for ways to improve it.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>On-line CLL</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>It can readily be seen that the advent of web-based technology 
			has given CLL a new impetus.&nbsp; Learners can form groups 
			independently of where they or their teacher-counsellor actually 
			lives and come together as (in)frequently as they like.&nbsp; Modern 
			conferencing software is ideal for this approach.</dd>

			based, the approach does not recommend itself to those situations in 
			which there is an externally imposed syllabus (examination classes, 
			EAP 
			and so on).</li>

			In this phase, too, there is a concert section in which the learners 
			repeat the material together with the teacher while they listen to 
			the music and the teacher pauses at important moments.<br />
			Next, the learners are free to use the material spontaneously, to 
			'elaborate', to 
			sing and play while the teacher guides and consults.<br />
			Finally, for further elaboration, the learners speak freely in the target language without interference or

			<li>Input is limited to reading and listening with little attention 
			paid to communicative skills.<br />
			The elaboration phase of the process is claimed to provide just that 
			kind of practice.</li>
			<li>Lozanov's focus is on memorisation but language is much more 
			than that.<br />
			The claim is that learners can both memorise language items more 
			easily through these techniques and be able to deploy the items 
			naturally.</li>

		<p>Dogme is nothing if not communicative.<br />
		The originator is Scott Thornbury and the name comes from a film

			</table>
		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>Absence of published materials</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>A Dogme approach abjures the use of published materials and the 
			importation of technology so a Dogme lesson may have no materials at 
			all (with all language coming from the participants) or use 
			materials imported by the learners (and, occasionally, the teacher).</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Planning</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Only the general outlines of a lesson can be planned because 
			learning is seen to happen in conversation and the focus is on what 
			emerges naturally from the learners rather than imposed upon them.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Procedures</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Procedures are, by definition, very flexible so the teacher's 
			role will vary from equal listener and participant to short periods 
			of more recognisable teaching focused on language issues that have 
			emerged from the conversation.&nbsp; Lessons may start from an idea 
			or question from individual learners or they may brainstorm (with or 
			without the teacher) what they would like to talk about.&nbsp; At 
			the outset, before the learners have become accustomed to the 
			approach, ideas may come from the teacher but, thereafter, they 
			should derive from the learners because that will maintain relevance 
			and involvement.</dd>

					<h3>Theory</h3>

				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>The movement (it is more that than a methodology) has a number of 
		guiding principles (the exact number rather depends on who is describing 
		/ advocating the approach).&nbsp; They can be condensed into:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Interact and engage: learning happens when learners are involved 
			in what they are talking about because it is relevant to them and 
			interacting naturally with each other and the teacher.&nbsp; In 
			other words, learning is dialogic.</li>
			<li>Scaffolding: this much-abused term is used here to mean that the 
			teacher's role is to assist and shape emerging language.<br />
			For more, see the guide to scaffolding and the ZPD, linked below.</li>
			<li>Emerging language: the target of Dogme is to work with language 
			that emerges from the learners rather than impose a syllabus.</li>
			<li>Empowerment: the learners and teachers are freed from the 
			demands of externally imposed syllabuses and materials and take 
			control of the learning for themselves.&nbsp; Wherever possible, 
			therefore, any materials should come from the learners.</li>
			<li>Learning is conversation driven: the focus is on connected 
			discourse rather than sentence-level language analysis.</li>

					<h3>Criticisms</h3>

				</tr>
			</table>
		<ol>
			<li>Dogme does not give teachers the opportunity to use a complete 
			range of materials and resources and is obsessively purist (Gill, 
			2000)<br />
			There is some debate about how anti-materials Dogme actually is.&nbsp; 
			Meddings and Thornbury (2009) focus more on a critique of course 
			materials (focus on structure, cultural bias etc.) than on their 
			non-use.&nbsp; On the other hand, Dogme can address the challenges 
			of resource-poor teaching environments.</li>
			<li>Dogme overly constrains the teacher to a single role<br />
			The teacher's role needs, in fact, to be quite flexible (see below) 
			but it is true that the approach, used consistently, could confine 
			the teacher to that of informant and participant rather than, e.g., 
			teacher and manager.</li>
			<li>There is no evidence that it works<br />
			True, research evidence is lacking, but advocates of the approach 
			would aver that<ol class="auto-style56">
				<li>it is an attempt to restore the basis of 
			Communicative Language Teaching and</li>
				<li>that it shares 
			characteristics with approaches for which there is some evidence of 
			effectiveness (such as Task-based Learning in which meaning is 
			constructed in a similar way).</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Learners expect more<br />
			There is no doubt that some learners, paying good money for a 
			course, either directly or via general taxation, expect to see a 
			rich material base and to use a range of technical and print-based 
			resources.&nbsp; They may be demotivated rather than motivated by this 
			approach.</li>
			<li>Some situations require adherence to a syllabus and Dogme can't 
			be used.<br />
			It's true that an examination-focused course is an unlikely place to 
			find Dogme in action but providing the learners are sophisticated 
			enough to know what the demands of the examination are and 
			introspective enough to know where their weaknesses and needs lie, 
			there's no reason why the approach can't work with materials and 
			concerns imported by them.</li>

		<p>The theory and approach are yet young so discerning influences on 
		other approaches and methodologies is not simple.&nbsp; However, as a 
		reason to devote at least some hours a week on intensive language 
		courses to conversation-driven events Dogme fits a bill.<br />
		It is also, in fairness, sometimes used as a cover for failing to plan 
		and prepare properly.&nbsp; It has famously been dismissed as:<br />
		<span class="style_black"><em>Winging it, elevated to an art form</em></span><br />
		<span class="auto-style5">(Thornbury, 2000:3)</span></p>
		<hr />
		<p>You will have noted that in all the above a non-partisan view of the approaches 
		has been taken by preferring 
		description to prescription.&nbsp; However, as with all minority 
		approaches, there are strident proponents and opponents.&nbsp; Tread 
		warily if you tread at all.</p>
		<h3>Learn more</h3>
		<p>There are many web-based descriptions and elaborations of 
		these approaches but many are 
		written by enthusiastic proponents and may lack a certain 
		objectivity.&nbsp; This is true even for normally reliable sources.&nbsp; 
		Some of the more reliable and less fervent of these are listed below.</p>
