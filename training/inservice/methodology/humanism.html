			<h1>Humanism in English Language Teaching</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="people" height="207" src="../../images/people_humans310.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This is a much written about area and it is one in which terminology is 
			even more variable than usual.&nbsp; You will sometimes see 
			reference to terms such as <strong>holistic, the whole person, 
			affective needs, self-actualisation</strong> and more.&nbsp; The water gets very 
			muddy indeed.<br />
			To make some initial sense, here's what's meant by some key terms:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>holistic</strong></dt>
				<dd>The first use of this term according to Merriam-Webster's 
				site is from 1926.&nbsp; It means, according to that source:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>relating to or concerned with 
				wholes or with complete systems rather than with the analysis 
				of, treatment of, or dissection into parts<br />
				holistic medicine 
				attempts to treat both the mind and the body<br />
				holistic ecology 
				views humans and the environment as a single system</em></span><br />
				(The term was originally employed by the South African General 
				(later Field Marshall) Smuts.)<br />
				For our purposes, we can define this as focusing on the learner 
				as a complete person rather than as a language-processing unit.<br />
				It can also mean treating the language as a whole rather than 
				breaking it down into discrete areas but that is not, for the 
				purposes of this guide, the relevant issue.</dd>
				<dt><strong>the whole person</strong></dt>
				<dd>is a related concept and refers to the need, as some see it, 
				to take into account the learners' emotional and personal lives 
				when teaching.</dd>
				<dt><strong>affective needs</strong></dt>
				<dd>Affect, to distinguish it from effect, when used as a noun 
				means emotion or desire influencing behaviour.&nbsp; It is 
				derived from the verb meaning to change or alter in some way.<br />
				In lay terms, the verb means to move emotionally but also, 
				unfortunately, to pretend or feign an attitude.<br />
				For our purposes, affect and affective needs refer to the 
				learners' emotional responses to the classroom, the materials, 
				their classmates, the teacher and so on as well as to their 
				needs for reassurance, feelings of safety and an unthreatening 
				environment.<br />
				The key idea is to overcome what has been termed <strong>
				lathophobic aphasia</strong> which is a neat term for keeping 
				silent for fear of making a mistake.</dd>
				<dt><strong>self-actualisation</strong></dt>
				<dd>is a term derived from the work of Abraham Maslow and dates 
				from 1943.&nbsp; Maslow proposed his 'Hierarchy of Needs' and 
				asserted that until needs at lower levels are satisfied, those 
				at the next highest level can't be addressed.&nbsp; Levels 1 to 
				4 are described as 'deficit needs'.&nbsp; So, e.g., if you are 
				hungry and in need of sleep, you can't focus on desires for self-esteem and so on.&nbsp; The highest level is that of 
				self-actualisation: being all that you can be.&nbsp; More below 
				on this source of humanist theory.</dd>
				<dt><strong>humanism</strong></dt>
				<dd>This term has a variety of definitions and referred 
				initially to a revival of interest in Ancient Greek and Roman 
				philosophy.<br />
				For our purposes, we'll take one of the Merriam-Webster 
				definitions<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>a doctrine, attitude, or way of 
				life centered on human interests or values; especially :a 
				philosophy that usually rejects supernaturalism and stresses an 
				individual's dignity and worth and capacity for self-realization 
				through reason</em></span><br />
				Others have defined the concept in rather more sophisticated 
				terms as, e.g.:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>a philosophy of joyous service for 
				the greater good of all humanity in this natural world and 
				advocating the methods of reason, science, and democracy<br />
				</em><span class="auto-style4">Mehrgan 2102: 184</span></span></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Humanistic teaching approaches draw on all these concepts to 
			attempt to treat language teaching as more than learning a language 
			but to extend it to helping learners develop and progress as people.</p>

			<h3>Maslow:</h3>
			<p>Abraham Maslow posited what he referred to as the Hierarchy of 
			Needs.&nbsp; It looks like this:<br />
				<img alt="maslow pyramid" height="280" src="../../imagesgraphics/maslow.png" width="400" /></p>
			<p>At the base of the pyramid are the simple physical needs for fresh 
			air, water, food, sleep and so on.&nbsp; The needs become more 
			sophisticated as one moves up the pyramid through safety and freedom 
			from fear, to a sense of belonging and mutual respect.&nbsp;
				In particular, what are called esteem 
				needs (level 4) are critical to this.&nbsp; They include self-respect, reputation, status, feelings of 
				strength, independence, adequacy and importance to others.&nbsp; 
				In other words, high-level affective needs.<br />
				The implication is that feeling positive about yourself and 
				comfortable within your group leads to enhanced levels of 
				motivation and better learning.<br />
			Until levels 1 to 4 are met (the so-called deficit needs), level 5, 
			becoming all that you can be, cannot be achieved.</p>

			<p>Humanistic approaches draw heavily on the work done by Carl 
			Rogers, an American psychologist concerned with a client-centred 
			approach to counselling.<br />
			A flavour of Rogers' concerns will suffice here.&nbsp; Having 
			briefly reviewed what happens in educational establishments in the 
			United States, Rogers avers:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">... education becomes the futile attempt to 
			learn material which has no personal meaning.<br />
			Such learning involves the mind only. It is learning which takes 
			place from the neck up. It does not involve feelings or personal 
			meanings; it has no relevance for the whole person.<br />
			<span class="auto-style14">Rogers, 1969, pp. 3-4</span></p>
			<p>Rogers goes on to posit 5 characteristics of what he calls 
			significant learning:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It personally involves the learner.</li>
				<li>It comes from within: significant learning is initiated by 
				the learner.</li>
				<li>It makes a difference to the learner &ndash; changing the person 
				in some way.</li>
				<li>It is evaluated by the learner to know if it is important.</li>
				<li>It is meaningful to the individual.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In summary, Rogers avers that:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">a person learns significantly only those 
			things which he perceives as being involved in the maintenance of or 
			the enhancement of his own self<br />
			<span class="auto-style14">(op cit. p. 158)</span></p>
			<p>What this means for teachers is also set out by Rogers.&nbsp; In 
			summary, he believes that a teacher (Rogers prefers the term 
			'facilitator' or 'leader'):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>sets the tone for the group or class by trusting and being 
				open.</li>
				<li>helps the learners to understand and articulate their own 
				purposes as well as the purposes of the group as a whole.</li>
				<li>relies upon the learners attend to what has meaning for them 
				as the motivation for significant learning.</li>
				<li>makes available the widest possible range of resources for 
				learning.</li>
				<li>regards him / herself as a flexible resource to be used by 
				the learners rather than an instructor.</li>
				<li>accepts both the content and the emotionalized attitudes of 
				what is expressed by the learners.</li>
				<li>is able to be a participant in the learning process.</li>
				<li>shares feelings and thoughts personally in a 
				non-authoritative manner.</li>
				<li>remains alert to the learners' feelings.</li>
				<li>recognizes and accepts personal limitations.</li>

			<p>Earl Stevick is another very influential voice in the campaign to 
			humanise language instruction.&nbsp; He summarises the issue neatly 
			into five overlapping emphases (1990):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Feelings.<br />
				both personal emotion an aesthetic appreciation of the world.&nbsp; 
				There is an explicit rejection of a focus on whatever makes 
				people feel bad or interferes with aesthetic responses to 
				reality.</li>
				<li>Social relations.<br />
				Friendship and cooperation lie at the heart of the approach and 
				it opposes whatever tends to hinder them.</li>
				<li>Responsibility.<br />
				The acceptance of the need for scrutiny, criticism, and 
				correction.</li>
				<li>Intellect.<br />
				Knowledge, reasoning, and understanding are key aspects of all 
				people.&nbsp; The approach opposes whatever interferes with the 
				free exercise of the mind.</li>
				<li>Self-actualization.<br />
				The approach encourages the full realization of one's own 
				deepest true qualities.</li>

			<p>One of the first authors to set out a handbook for teachers to 
			apply the principles of humanistic approaches to foreign language 
			learning was Gertrude Moskowitz.<br />
			In 1978, Moskowitz published <em>Caring and Sharing in the Foreign 
			Language Classroom</em> a severely practical book containing a range 
			of activities all intended to help learners feel positive about 
			themselves and others in the group.&nbsp; Her fundamental reasoning 
			was that</p>
			<p class="indentpara">in both the humanistic psychological approach 
			and the communicative approach, learners are seen not so much as 
			full-time linguistic objects at whom language teaching is aimed, but 
			rather as human individuals whose personal dignity and integrity, 
			and the complexity of whose ideas, thoughts, needs, and sentiments, 
			should be respected. Foreign language teachers must contribute to 
			the self-actualizing process<br />
			<span class="auto-style14">(1978: p.109)</span></p>
			<p>Here are some examples of the kinds of activities that she 
			proposes, taken from a later (1982) paper but based on her 1978 
			book.&nbsp; She prefaces this with the following admonition:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">People will share or self-disclose only if 
			they feel safe and not threatened by so doing. Therefore, a positive 
			and accepting climate is essential where others listen attentively, 
			non-judgementally, empathetically, and with good will. In keeping 
			with these notions, there are two important guidelines that I 
			strongly recommend when humanistic communication activities are 
			used: focus on the positive aspects and use low-risk activities. The 
			first refers to such things as sharing pleasant memories, 
			identifying one's strengths and those of others, and focusing on the 
			positive occurrences that happen to us each day. Conversely, 
			conversations would not deal with unpleasant memories, pointing out 
			what one considers to be one's own faults or those of others, or 
			dwelling on the negative events that happen to us.<br />

			<p>It is difficult to overestimate how influential humanist ideas 
			have been over the past 40 or so years.&nbsp; All the following 
			approaches (which are covered in a separate guide linked in the list of related guides at the end) have 
			claimed to be humanistic:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Community Language Learning: an approach explicitly based on 
				counselling techniques.</li>
				<li>Suggestopaedia: an approach which explicitly attempts to 
				lower affective barriers.</li>
				<li>The Silent Way: an approach which depends for much of its 
				effect on learners' production rather than teacher intervention.</li>
				<li>Total Physical Response: which allows a pre-speaking phase 
				in which learners are unthreatened by pressure to produce 
				language.</li>
				<li>Dogme: an approach which explicitly targets the language 
				produced by and needed by the learners and in which they 
				initiate the teaching-learning cycle.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Whether all these alternative methodologies actually are 
			operating in accordance with Stevick's five fundamental principles 
			is, naturally, not uncontroversial.</p>
			<p>There are other less obvious influences, too.&nbsp; It is 
			arguable that all the following have, to some extent at least, been 
			influenced by humanist theories.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The concern, especially within Communicative Language 
				Learning, to ensure that the language students use is 
				personalised and meaningful to them.</li>
				<li>The explicit focus on most training courses on making 
				lessons learner centred and reducing the dominance of the 
				teacher.</li>
				<li>Krashen's and Terrell's focus in one of the former's five 
				hypotheses regarding the need to reduce the learners' affective 
				filters and create stress-free learning environments.</li>
				<li>The focus on negotiated syllabuses in which the learners 
				play a central role in deciding what is to be learned.</li>
				<li>The focus on developing autonomy and self-directed learning 
				programmes.</li>
				<li>Genre approaches with their emphasis on empowering learners 
				socially.</li>
				<li>Approaches to reading skills development which focus on the 
				learners' affective response to the content of texts as well as 
				their linguistic content.</li>
				<li>The focus on project work in which the learners set their 
				own goals.</li>
				<li>The increasing focus on how cultural aspects affect what is 
				done in the classroom and underlie learners' reactions to 
				certain methodologies and approaches.</li>
				<li>The focus on exploiting both the physical environment for 
				context as well as the learners' internal, experiential 
				environment.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You may have thought of others.</p>
			<p>One overarching influence is that it is nowadays rare to find a 
			teacher who does not profess to the desire to establish a good 
			rapport with her learners (i.e. empathise) or one who see his 
			learners' feelings, desires aesthetic responses and emotions as 
			irrelevant to the learning process.</p>

			<p>The major criticism of humanistic approaches to language teaching 
			concerns the doctrinaire approach that many proponents take.<br />
			It has not gone unnoticed that many who advocate a humanist approach 
			(and some who merely advocate a communicative approach) have focused 
			on peripheral matters which do not enhance the learning 
			opportunities of their students.<br />
			While it is generally accepted that the comfort and happiness of 
			learners in the classroom is significant, critics of humanistic 
			approaches have suggested (sometimes forcefully) that a focus on 
			these sorts of factors diverts attention from the purpose of a 
			language-learning classroom which is, naturally, to help people to 
			speak, write, read and listen effectively in a foreign language.<br />
			In particular, criticisms have been levelled at:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Negotiated syllabuses<br />
				because most learners have no idea of what they need to learn 
				and it is the teacher's and institution's responsibility to use 
				their knowledge, training and experience to establish a syllabus 
				that will allow the client to learn what he or she really needs.<br />
				At advanced levels in particular fields of language use, the 
				learners may indeed be in a position to set out what they need 
				to learn but this does not describe most learners.</li>
				<li>Skills work<br />
				because most adult learners already have reading, writing, 
				listening and speaking skills.&nbsp; What they need is the 
				ability to use the skills in another language.&nbsp; They do not 
				explicitly need to be taught skills which have nothing 
				specifically to do with <em>a</em> language because they already 
				have skills which are specific to all languages.</li>
				<li>Inductive approaches<br />
				because trying to figure out a rule from a set of data is an 
				unreliable and time-consuming process especially when one 
				considers that generations of linguists have struggled to 
				identify the rules.&nbsp; Asking a student of the language to do 
				this is not only inefficient and wasteful, it is also likely to 
				fail.</li>
				<li>Concerns with affective factors<br />
				because, providing the teacher is approachable, friendly, 
				professional and concerned and remembers the learners names, 
				that is all most learners need.</li>
				<li>Arrogance<br />
				There is some suspicion that teachers, whose central role is one 
				of service to their learners, may arrogate to themselves the 
				role of life coach and that is a domain in which they may 
				neither be trained nor have sufficient expertise.</li>
				<li>Concerns with holistic approaches<br />
				because if a learners feels a need for some counselling and 
				whole-person treatment then the obvious choice is to go to a 
				professional in this field, not to a language teacher.</li>
				<li>Concerns with process not product<br />
				because what most language learners want is precisely the 
				product and they are far less concerned than teachers with how 
				they get it.</li>
