	<h1>Krashen and the Natural Approach</h1>
		<p>
		<img height="207" src="../../images/animals_deer310.jpg" width="310" alt="deer" /></p>
		<p>The <a href="../background/handd.html">guide to the history and development of English Language Teaching</a> 
		covers: grammar translation, audio-lingualism (including structural 
		linguistics and behaviourist theories of learning) and the rise of 
		communicative language teaching.<br />
		The separate <a href="clt.html">guide to Communicative Language Teaching</a> 
		takes it on from there.&nbsp; You should go to those guides for more on 
		the background and the story so far.</p>
		<p>We have a whole guide on the Natural Approach, not because it is hugely influential in 
				itself, but because the theories (or, better, hypotheses) which 
				underlie it have been demonstrably influential in themselves.<br />
		The approach takes its name from the book by Krashen and Terrell which 
		outlined an approach to language teaching based on a set of fundamental 
		hypotheses.&nbsp; It is these we need to focus on before we can discuss 
		methodology arising from them.</p>

		<p>In 1982, Krashen published Second Language Acquisition and Second 
		Language Learning in which he set out five hypotheses.&nbsp; What 
		follows here is a very brief summary.<br />
		The full text is, 
		fortunately, now available at
		http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/sl_acquisition_and_learning.pdf.&nbsp; 
		Please look there for the background, evidence and more detail.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Hypothesis 1: THE ACQUISITION/LEARNING DISTINCTION<br />
			</strong>
			<img height="133" src="../../images/difference_people_shoes_a200.jpg" width="200" alt="shoes" /></dt>
			<dd>Krashen distinguishes between learning (a conscious process) and 
			acquisition (an almost unconscious process).<br />
			Acquisition is a process similar to the way in which children 
			acquire their first language(s).&nbsp; It requires meaningful and 
			frequent interaction in the language in which the speakers are not 
			focused on form but on meaning.<br />
			Learning is, in contrast, a formal procedure which focuses on the 
			explanation of rules and correction of language form.<br />
			It should be noted that Krashen was not explicitly stating that one 
			is better than the other.&nbsp; Indeed, he goes to some lengths to 
			state that<p class="indentpara">
			the classroom can be of value, and in fact generally
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>is</strong></span> of value, in language acquisition as well as in language learning<br />
			<span class="auto-style56">Krashen, 
			2002:48 emphasis in the original)</span></p>
			What he is 
			saying is that informal acquisition, given sufficient and intensive 
			exposure is also an efficient way of acquiring a foreign language.<br />
			Many would agree, drawing on personal experience, that simply 
			picking up a language in informal but frequent and intensive 
			settings is an efficient and effective way of learning a foreign 
			language and many would also agree, having unsuccessfully tried 
			to learn a foreign language in a classroom, that formal learning 
			settings are not invariably successful.<br />
			There are also those who profoundly disagree and aver that language 
			learning is a conscious process.&nbsp; See
			<a href="../teaching/noticing.html">the guide to noticing</a> for 
			a little more on this and some other ways of describing the learning 
			process.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Hypothesis 2: THE MONITOR HYPOTHESIS<br />
			</strong>
			<img height="133" src="../../images/monitoring_a200.jpg" width="200" alt="monitor" /></dt>
			<dd>Following on from the primary distinction, Krashen posits that 
			learners actively monitor their output in a foreign language.&nbsp; 
			To do this they use their learned rather than acquired knowledge.&nbsp; 
			An utterance is initiated and the learned system is used to monitor 
			its accuracy.<br />
			The key point is that monitoring can, of course, only follow 
			production although some have suggested that some learners delay 
			producing language until they have mentally rehearsed what to say 
			and monitored it internally.&nbsp; This produces hesitant, slow 
			production.&nbsp; They are over-monitoring.<br />
			On the other hand, there are learners who under-monitor, producing 
			immediate but wildly inaccurate language.<br />
			In writing, the same considerations apply but monitoring can be an 
			ongoing process because of the nature of the skill.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Hypothesis 3: THE NATURAL ORDER HYPOTHESIS<br />
			</strong>
			<img height="133" src="../../images/orderly200.jpg" width="200" alt="order" /></dt>
			<dd>With back-up from a body of research and a deal of 
			number crunching in the book, Krashen asserts that grammatical language 
			morphemes in particular are acquired in a certain order.&nbsp; That 
			order for English is:<br />
			<img alt="acquisition order" height="196" src="../../imagesgraphics/acquisitionorder.png" width="350" /><br />
			<span class="auto-style4">(Krashen and Terrell (1983; 29))</span></dd>
			<dt><strong>Hypothesis 4: THE INPUT HYPOTHESIS<br />
			<img height="133" src="../../images/enter_key200.jpg" width="200" alt="input" /></strong></dt>
			<dd>The argument here is that, for optimum effect, the input a 
			learner receives should be a) comprehensible and b) just above the 
			level of the learner.&nbsp; This is sometimes abbreviated to INPUT + 
			1 or just i + 1.&nbsp; Many see this as an intuitively correct hypothesis for if 
			the input is incomprehensible, no sense can be made of it and no 
			learning can take place but if the input is below the learner's 
			competence, he/she is not challenged to improve, given the 
			opportunity to acquire new 
			language or notice the gap between his / her own production and the 
			heard / read models.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Hypothesis 5: THE AFFECTIVE FILTER HYPOTHESIS<br />
			<img height="133" src="../../images/coffee_espresso200.jpg" width="200" alt="coffee" /></strong></dt>
			<dd>This suggests that high levels of, e.g., stress, or low levels 
			of, e.g., self-esteem will act as inhibitors of the 
			learning-acquisition process.&nbsp; Low levels of stress and high 
			levels of self-esteem and motivation will have the reverse effect.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>Naturally, such a broad and significant range of hypotheses has not 
		been without its critics.&nbsp; However, whether one accepts the truth 
		of all the hypotheses or not, there are clearly classroom implications 
		to consider.&nbsp; Consider how you would fill in the right-hand column 
		in this table and then click on it for some comments.</p>

		<p>To give you a flavour of how teaching and learning are carried out 
		following the Natural Approach, here are some statements from a handbook 
		of the approach (Krashen and Terrell, 1983).</p>
		<ol class="auto-style5">
			<li><em>Your teacher will speak French exclusively.&nbsp; You may answer in 
			either English or French.&nbsp; You are free to use English until you 
			yourself feel ready to try speaking French.&nbsp; You should not try to 
			use French until you are comfortable doing so.</em></li>
			<li><em>When you do try to speak in the new language, the teacher is 
			interested in what you have to say – not whether you have said it 
			perfectly.&nbsp; Neither you nor the teacher will be overly concerned 
			with grammar errors in your speech while you are a beginner.</em></li>
			<li><em>You do not have to use full sentences.&nbsp; You may talk in short 
			phrases or even use just one word when that is appropriate.</em></li>
			<li><em>Remember that as long as you </em> <strong><em>understand</em></strong><em> what 
			the teacher is saying you are acquiring French.&nbsp; This means that you 
			should focus on </em> <strong><em>what</em></strong><em> is being said, the message, 
			rather than how it is being said.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>The first of these is known as <strong>delayed oral practice</strong> 
		and has received quite a lot of attention.&nbsp; In the past, the 
		assumption has been that intensive oral practice from the outset of the 
		learning process will be effective.&nbsp; This is now not taken for 
		granted and some evidence shows that learners, especially beginners, 
		need a period of time to assimilate what they hear before being asked to 
		produce the target language.&nbsp; In other words, to build competence 
		before performance.</p>
		<p>Many have noted that this kind of approach is not very far removed 
		from an 'ordinary' communicative-approach classroom.</p>

				</table>
		
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Hypothesis 1: THE ACQUISITION/LEARNING DISTINCTION</strong></dt>
			<dd>There is some implication here that acquisition is in some way 
			better than learning whereas the two are complementary.&nbsp; 
			Krashen has been quoted as taking the stance that the study of form 
			actually has no place in the language-learning classroom.&nbsp;
			As he and Terrell state the case:<br />
			<span class="auto-style5"><em>The mistake the innovators have made 
			is to assume that a conscious understanding of grammar is a 
			prerequisite to acquiring communicative competence.&nbsp; That such an 
			understanding might be helpful in some situations for some students 
			is not in question – that it is a prerequisite for all students is 
			patently false.</em></span> (<em>op cit.</em>, p16).<br />
			Others have argued just the opposite:<br />
			<span class="auto-style5"><em>... language learning is essentially 
			learning how grammar functions in the achievement of meaning and it 
			is a mistake to suppose otherwise. .... A communicative approach 
			does not involve the rejection of grammar.&nbsp; On the contrary, it 
			involves a recognition of its central mediating role in the use of 
			and learning of language.</em></span> (Widdowson, 1990: 97/8)</dd>
			<dt><strong>Hypothesis 2: THE MONITOR HYPOTHESIS </strong></dt>
			<dd>The criticism here is that the existence or function of the 
			Monitor has never been explicitly demonstrated.&nbsp; The fact that 
			the Monitor can, by definition, only function <em>after</em> an 
			utterance has been produced seems to imply that it cannot slow down 
			production.&nbsp; It is also, of course, impossible, or at least 
			very hard, to determine whether a learner is consciously or 
			unconsciously applying a rule.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Hypothesis 3: THE NATURAL ORDER HYPOTHESIS</strong></dt>
			<dd>There's a built-in contradiction here.&nbsp; Having first 
			asserted that language learning (or acquisition) is not about 
			grammar, Krashen is now proposing that a grammatical, structural syllabus 
			should be followed.&nbsp; How this can be reconciled with a natural, 
			exposure-rich acquisition programme is not clear.<br />
			Secondly, the situation is more complex than it is painted.&nbsp; 
			The order may be different in production and comprehension, variable 
			across languages, variable depending on the structure of the 
			learner's first language and so on.&nbsp; Worse, the acquisition of, 
			say, the copular verb in <em>He is a teacher</em> may not be the same 
			as the acquisition of the verb in <em>He is idiotic.</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Hypothesis 4: THE INPUT HYPOTHESIS</strong></dt>
			<dd>First of all, it is very nearly impossible to determine exactly 
			where INPUT + 1 would apply to all learners in all situations and 
			hard to determine 'level' at all in some cases.&nbsp; Others have 
			pointed out that Krashen nowhere explains how this works or how it 
			aids learning.&nbsp; It has also been pointed out that this is, in 
			any case, what experienced teachers do all the time.&nbsp; They 
			alter their own production to exactly the point where they are 
			understood but challenging.&nbsp; They also select materials in 
			which some of the input may be beyond i+1 and some below precisely 
			in order to encourage their learners to notice aspects of the 
			language.&nbsp; It is arguable that there are many 
			more factors at work here.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Hypothesis 5: THE AFFECTIVE FILTER HYPOTHESIS</strong></dt>
			<dd>The argument here is that it is clear that emotional and other 
			factors play a part in language learning but that there is no need 
			to hypothesise a 'filter' to explain the fact.&nbsp; Furthermore, of 
			course, one learner's added stress factor is another's motivating 
			challenge.&nbsp; One could argue, for example, that having the 
			entire lesson content translated into the learners' first language 
			would reduce their stress but that would fly in the face of the 
			learning / acquisition hypothesis and much else.<br />
			Furthermore, much of Krashen's work in this area rests on studies of 
			adolescents and it is unclear how applicable it is to adults or 
			younger children.</dd>
