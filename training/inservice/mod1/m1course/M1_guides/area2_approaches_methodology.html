				<li>A methodology will be based on two theories:<ol class="auto-style23">
					<li>what language is.<br />
					That is to say, whether it is a system of 
					meanings set in discoverable grammar rules or whether it is 
					primarily a communicative tool in which rules and the 
					memorisation of vocabulary play little part.</li>
					<li>what learning is.<br />
					That is to say, whether it is a matter of 
					acquiring good habits, of repeating what one hears or making 
					an internal grammar of the language alongside a set of 
					precepts about how the language is used.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>A methodology will be recognisable because the design of

				the first two theories.</li>
				<li>The teaching techniques and procedures adopted in the

				which the educator / trainer / coach / materials writer etc. 
				is / are working.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This section of the course is designed to help you identify these 
			three aspects of a methodology and to be able to engage in some critical 
			discussion of them.<br />
			If you come across a piece of material and a proposed way of using 
			it in the classroom (for example, listening to a tape recording of 
			models of vowel sounds and requiring the learners to repeat them), 
			then you should be well placed to speculate intelligently about the 
			teacher / course materials writer's underlying assumptions about 
			both learning and language.</p>

			refined</em> and you will shortly be asked to access it.<br />

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Unfortunately, the term methodology is used very loosely because 
			it is employed in non-technical areas and in areas far removed from 
			English language teaching.<br />
			We need, at the outset to define our terms because in the 
			examination you will be expected to apply terms such as approach, 
			technique and method with a certain care.<br />
			Here's an overview of a popular way of defining the term for us, 
			taken from the guide you will shortly encounter.<br />
			A methodology contains three elements:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The approach<br />
				This concerns a twofold understanding of<ol class="auto-style23">
					<li>What language is</li>
					<li>How language is learned</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The design<br />
				This concerns the practical implications of the approach to 
				issues such as syllabus design, the role of learners, the role 
				of the teacher, the activities which are undertaken in the 
				classroom and the ways the materials are presented.&nbsp; It 
				also concerns overall lesson design, e.g., Task-based, 
				Test–Teach–Test or Presentation–Practice–Production 
				formats.</li>
				<li>The procedure<br />
				This refers to what we can see happening in the classroom and 
				concerns teaching techniques, ways of approaching skills and 
				systems lessons, error handling, questioning, elicitation and so on.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Area 1 of this course, theoretical perspectives, has covered 
			theories of how learning happens in some depth and how the 
			assumptions which materials writers (and teachers) have concerning 
			the process affects the design of the material and the tasks which 
			accompany it.<br />
			This part of the course is concerned with the rest of a methodology.</p>

						are not completely random in your approach to teaching, 
						there will be underlying assumptions that you make about 
						what language is and how it is learned.<br />

			<p>There can be no 'right' answer to this, of

			However, what you may have identified is</p>
				<ol class="auto-style23">
					<li>that there is some

					<li>some inconsistency insofar as some

			</table>
			<p>This seems a simple question but the answers people provide will, 
			if they are in a position to act on them, radically affect how they 
			design materials and activities in a classroom.<br />
			Fundamentally, there are two opposing camps: those who view language 
			as a system of grammar, phonology and lexis and those who view it as 
			a way to communicate.<br />
			These are not necessarily mutually exclusive views, of course, but 
			the emphasis one places on one type of analysis or the other will be 
			very influential.<br />
			We can discern four ways to answer the question:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Language is a system<br />
				<img alt="cogs" height="133" src="../../../../../images/cogs_blue200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</strong>If you view language as a system of lexemes, phonemes, 
				structures and grammar, which it is, of course, then you will 
				emphasise what Chomsky refers to as competence (i.e., the 
				language that in theory can be formed) over performance (what 
				people actually say and write).<br />
				This is a structuralist view of language (and within 
				structuralism there are many competing theories about what the 
				structure actually is).<br />
				Materials and teaching techniques (the design of the course) 
				will focus on formal matters above all.</li>
				<li><strong>Language is a communicative mechanism<br />
				<img alt="talk" height="133" src="../../../../../images/talk_tin_strings200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</strong>If you view language as a way of communicating ideas 
				between people, which it is, of course, then you will emphasise 
				performance over competence.&nbsp; Although most theories of 
				communicative competence will state that formal linguistic 
				competence (the ability to produce well-formed utterances) is 
				part of the ability to use language to communicate, they will 
				not stop there.<br />
				Materials and teaching techniques (the design of the course) 
				will focus on communicative ability above all.</li>
				<li><strong>Language is a marker of identity<br />
				<img alt="me" height="133" src="../../../../../images/woman_who_me200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</strong>The view here, which does not compete with the first 
				two views is that the language we speak confirms in part who we 
				are or think we are.<br />
				Materials and teaching techniques (the design of the course) 
				will have some focus on affective factors and may make efforts to 
				personalise the language which is produced and practised.</li>
				<li><strong>Language is a cultural artefact<br />
				<img alt="culture" height="133" src="../../../../../images/culture_easterisland200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</strong>The view here, again, not incompatible with the 
				previous three views, is that language is a culturally formed 
				system of meanings which determine how we think about the world 
				and are determined by the needs of the society in which the 
				language developed.<br />
				Materials and teaching techniques (the design of the course) 
				will focus on the concepts and cultural influences on the target 
				language.&nbsp; The argument will be that it is difficult to 
				understand and use any other language unless you know something about the 
				environment, activities, needs and concerns of the people who speak it.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These four views are considered in slightly more depth in the 
			guide.</p>
			<h4>Now, you have a mini-task.</h4>
			<table class="task" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style26">
					<span class="style_brown">Most professionals in this area 
					actually hold all four views simultaneously because they are 
					not mutually exclusive.&nbsp; If that is your position:</span>
					<ol class="style_brown">
						<li>Decide whether you hold each of the four views by 
						re-reading the descriptions and then ...</li>
						<li>... think of an example for each one you hold.</li>

			<p>Your response is unpredictable so there's no right answer 
			(although there are numbers of wrong answers).&nbsp; If, in what 
			follows, you replace references to your teaching with references to <em>my materials</em>, you will be putting yourself in 
			the shoes of a materials designer and that's a good way to approach 
			the task that asks you to do this in the examination.<br />
			Some 
			suggestions:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>I believe that language is an interlocking set of systems so 
				in my teaching I focus on form and grammar consistently but do 
				not forget that pronunciation and style are also systems in the 
				language.<br />
				I do this before I ask learners to apply the language 
				communicatively because I think that form comes first in terms 
				of preparation for tasks and to allow the learners to feel 
				confident.&nbsp; I am placing competence training before 
				performance practice.</li>
				<li>I accept that language is primarily a communicative resource 
				so I always include multiple opportunities in my lessons for 
				learners to use language in an effort to communicate their 
				thoughts.&nbsp; I also accept, incidentally, that some useful 
				learning and awareness raising emerges from the effort to 
				communicate, however inaccurate the form of the language is.</li>
				<li>That language is a marker of identity is true for me so I 
				make sure in my lessons that there are times when the learners 
				can personalise the language and say things that are true for 
				themselves.<br />
				I am alert to the fact that some of my learners might not feel 
				comfortable speaking in English because they may feel that they 
				cannot express their identities very well with limited 
				linguistic resources.<br />
				I never suggest that my learners' language(s) are in any way 
				inferior to English, of course; just different.</li>
				<li>There are some things, idiomatic language in particular, that 
				derive from the culture of English-speaking communities (and 
				there are lots of those) and I point this out when appropriate.&nbsp; 
				It is, for example, difficult to figure out the meaning of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's just my cup of tea</em><br />
				unless you know a little about tea drinking in Anglophone 
				cultures.</li>
				<li>Of course, all languages arise from the cultures in which 
				they developed.&nbsp; I also know that some concepts in English, 
				such as tense structures, reflect how its speakers conceptualise 
				time and that is way of thinking about the world that I know my 
				learners may not share.<br />
				Lexical meaning, too, arises from the community's need to 
				express certain concepts and these needs will vary across 
				cultures.&nbsp; Language is not just a way of talking, it may 
				also be a way of thinking.<br />
				I focus in my teaching on making sure that unusual or culturally 
				specific meanings are made clear.<br />
				However, although language is a cultural artefact, when it comes to 
				English, my learners need to use it for international communication as 
				a <em>lingua franca</em>.&nbsp; I do not, therefore, include 
				too much cultural information in my lessons because English as 
				an international language is, arguably, culture free and no 
				longer depends for its existence on a native-speaker community.</li>

			<p>This is something of an elephant in many classrooms, unnoticed 
			but important.<br />
			Before taking a course at this sort of level, many teachers use 
			materials because they are appealing, carry out techniques because 
			they seem to work (or are engaging and enjoyable), use activities 
			which get people talking or moving and so on, all without properly 
			considering what principles underlie what they do.<br />
			Delta-level people know better and one of the functions of the 
			Module One examination is to make sure they do.</p>
			<p>We have already seen that a theoretical standpoint concerning how 
			people learn language (whether their first or later ones) will have 
			profound effects on materials, tasks and activities.<br />
			Now it is time to look at some other facets of what goes on in 
			classrooms to try to see what hypotheses about language and learning are 
			affecting them.</p>

				<dd>The essence of noticing is that learners need to have their attention drawn 
				to specific features of the language so they can notice either 
				how the language works or how their own production differs 
				from, and is probably inferior to, a native-speaker model (or 
				near offer).<br />
				Clearly, if language is seen as an unconsciously acquired 
				(rather than learned) communicative tool, whether people 
				consciously notice differences in the language they produce from 
				what they are presented with makes no difference and is not 
				important.<br />
				Noticing techniques will, however, be central to people whose 
				theoretical perspective is that language is a system and its 
				acquisition requires real cognitive effort.<br />
				Materials which use highlighting of one form or another can be 
				expected to flow from this theoretical source.<br />
				This means that tasks in which learners are asked, for example, 
				to <em>focus on the underlined words</em> or <em>look at the 
				words Mary uses </em>etc. are consciously using noticing as a 
				technique.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Inferring</strong><br />
				<img alt="guess" height="133" src="../../../../../images/child_guessing200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Clearly, again, someone who believes that language can be 
				learned through a process of good habit formation and that can 
				be encouraged by reinforcement of correct production will have 
				little truck with the idea of allowing (or even encouraging) 
				learners to guess at meaning and predict accurately from what is 
				already known.<br />
				Someone who thinks language is learnt by making connections or 
				by forming hypotheses will be more concerned about inferencing.&nbsp; 
				If that is allied to a belief that language is primarily about 
				communication not accuracy, then inferencing techniques will 
				form a part of course and materials design.<br />
				This means that you should be alert to materials which ask the 
				learners to work out the meaning of words from co-text and match 
				the meanings to definitions or graphics and similar tasks.&nbsp; 
				Including such tasks is tantamount to assuming that inferring 
				meaning is both possible and useful.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Scaffolding</strong><br />
				<img alt="scaffolding" height="133" src="../../../../../images/scaffolding200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This is more than helping or assisting as the guide to it 
				tries to make clear.&nbsp; It is linked to the idea 
				of the Zone of Proximal Development because it is here that the 
				teacher can engage the learner(s) in recognising the usefulness 
				of targets, maintaining interest in their fulfilment and 
				supplying just enough help, but no more, for them to be able to 
				achieve a task.<br />
				Closely allied to scaffolding techniques and materials is the 
				concept (from Krashen) of comprehensible input.<br />
				Materials writers from both traditions will take pains to ensure 
				that the language presented is comprehensible and manageable 
				even if it contains new target items and skills.<br />
				Materials which, for example, contain authentic or 
				quasi-authentic materials which are clearly just above the level 
				of the learners are included by materials writers who see 
				comprehensible input and the effort to keep learners in the ZPD 
				as important aids to learning.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Input and Intake<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="intake" height="133" src="../../../../../images/restaurant_interior200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Cognitivists will have a lot to say about the ways in which 
				input is converted to intake (and, eventually, output) through a 
				process of engaging attention, lodging the item in short-term 
				memory and then working on it in order that it can find its 
				place in the long-term memory store (rehearsal and retrieval, in 
				the jargon).<br />
				It is also not an idea that behaviourist theories will have much 
				trouble with because underlying an audio-lingual approach is a 
				process of drawing the learners' attention to a language item 
				and, through a combination of imitation and repetition 
				(rehearsal and retrieval is another way of saying that) lodging 
				the data in the learners' long-term memories, ready to be 
				retrieved and produced as the occasion arises for it.<br />
				When items are recycled in a set of materials, this is evidence 
				that the writer of the materials believes that recycling helps 
				to move items from the short- to the long-term memory and may 
				also be evidence that the same writer believes that recycling 
				helps to move lexis from the passive to active memory store.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Structuring lessons<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="structure" height="133" src="../../../../../images/structure_leaf200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Lesson structure is a key part of course and materials 
				design and heavily influenced by theoretical understanding of 
				approaches.<br />
				If one believes that, for example, error is to be avoided 
				because it interferes with habit formation then a 
				Test–Teach–Test (TTT) approach 
				will be anathematic.&nbsp; If, however, one believes that 
				language is acquired in the effort to communicate then that 
				approach to lesson design or a task-based approach will sit 
				comfortably with the theoretical predispositions of the 
				designer.<br />
				Look at the structure of the materials with which you are 
				presented and try to see whether a TTT, PPP or TBL approach is 
				being taken (or whether a combination is identifiable).&nbsp; 
				That will tell you a good deal about the writer's assumptions 
				concerning the best lesson shape for learning.</dd></dl>

			<p>There is no right answer.<br />
			</p>
			<p>If, as before, you replace references in the following to your teaching and your 
			lessons with references to <span class="style_black"> <em>my materials</em></span>, you will be putting 
			yourself in the shoes of a materials designer and that's a good way 
			to approach the task that asks you to do this in the examination.</p>
			<p>Some suggestions include, however:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>I do believe that language is a system of forms and 
				structures so I include noticing activities in my teaching by 
				highlighting certain aspects of a text or by asking learners to 
				listen out for specific ways of realising certain functions in 
				listening and video clips or highlighting language items in 
				colour or by underlining etc.&nbsp; I also hold that language is a tool for communication so I 
				try to make sure that all my lessons have an element of 
				communicative practice which is only semi-controlled.</li>
				<li>Almost no learners can ever master the skills in and 
				knowledge of a language 
				which native speakers control so they need to be able to infer 
				meaning from clues around the language they encounter and apply 
				their knowledge of parallel structures and the world as well as 
				looking for clues in what the language producer wants to 
				communicate.&nbsp; The ability to infer meaning from context, 
				co-text and non-linguistic knowledge is something I foster.</li>
				<li>When I set tasks, I try to ensure that they are not so easy 
				that the learners are not stretched to acquire new knowledge and 
				skills but also not so difficult that I have to do the task for 
				them.&nbsp; The amount of support my learners need must be 
				carefully engineered so that I can provide the minimum as tasks 
				proceed.</li>
				<li>I do not think that input from me will be automatically 
				converted to output from my learners so I keep 
				information-giving to a minimum and try to ensure that the 
				learners can discover the language for themselves.&nbsp; I 
				believe this form of discovery learning aids long-term 
				retention.<br />
				I also make sure that the target items and skills in the lesson 
				are encountered more than once to aid in the movement from 
				short- to long-term memory and to help learners make the items 
				part of their active language use.</li>
				<li>I try to vary the ways in which lessons are structured to 
				conform to the content of the lesson.&nbsp; If I am concerned to 
				revise, consolidate and extend language and skills, for example, 
				I adopt a Test–Teach–Test approach and treat error as a positive 
				resource to upgrade my learners' output.<br />
				However, if something is being presented for the first time, I 
				will usually try to avoid my learners making too many mistakes 
				and use a Presentation–Practice–Production format which allows a 
				more controlled learning environment.</li>

			<p>Teachers are rarely free, if they are using published course 
			materials, to select any technique or procedure that pleases them.&nbsp; 
			Many materials designers would aver that they shouldn't be.<br />
			Built in, therefore, to many materials are activities and teaching 
			procedures (another word for techniques for some) which betray the 
			materials constructor's view of what language is and how it is 
			learnt (or acquired).&nbsp; Teacher's guides to materials are often 
			quite explicit in this regard.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Writing down what you hear<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="write" height="133" src="../../../../../images/write_coffee_croissant200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Many materials require learners to take notes, write what 
				they hear or match what they hear to the written word.<br />
				All such techniques are based on the implicit understanding that 
				doing so is a cognitive process which focuses learners on 
				structures in the language, even if they are not overtly looking for 
				how the structure realises a function.<br />
				These sorts of activities stem from the understanding, too, that 
				language is a system of structures and that these have to be 
				identified (i.e., noticed) before they can be learned and used.&nbsp; They do 
				not come from an understanding that language can be acquired 
				from appropriately graded exposure or from one which assumes 
				that repetition leads to learning.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Asking questions<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="ask" height="133" src="../../../../../images/ask_for_information200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Many materials elicit or require the teacher to elicit 
				facts, views, opinions and experiences from learners.&nbsp; 
				Often, such techniques come at the beginning of teaching units 
				masquerading as schema activation procedures.<br />
				A theoretical standpoint which views competence as more 
				important than performance or views error as a failure will not 
				lead to activities like these.<br />
				However, from a social interaction point of view such activities 
				are important because they often personalise a topic and enhance 
				learning through motivational factors.<br />
				A firmly structuralist view of language will have little time 
				for such activities because the outcomes are often random 
				collections of structures which have no clear connections.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Talk to your partner<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="talk" height="133" src="../../../../../images/talk_2men200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Activities which require learners to exchange views or 
				information stem from the view that language is essentially a 
				communicative tool and not, primarily, a set of structures.&nbsp; 
				People who believe that language is socially constructed will 
				place a good deal of emphasis on interpersonal activities like 
				these.<br />
				The view is reinforced if one also believes that personalising 
				an activity makes it memorable and motivating.<br />
				Audio-lingual / behaviourist approaches will not involve such 
				activities as part of the design of materials or courses because 
				there is no overt structural focus and chatting is simply a 
				waste of valuable classroom time.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Skills<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="skill" height="133" src="../../../../../images/man_skill_ball200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Those who are convinced that language is a system of forms 
				and structures will have less time for the development of skills 
				because mastering the forms of the language will naturally lead 
				to better spoken and written production and more effective 
				listening and reading comprehension.<br />
				From a social interactionist standpoint, however, skills will be 
				forefronted because it is by appreciating audience, 
				interlocutor's intentions, communicative purposes of texts and 
				so on that language ability is built.<br />
				Strictly acquisition-led approaches will also contain a good 
				deal of skills work because, by its nature, it allows the 
				learners to encounter rich data from which to learn.</dd>

			<a href="#task2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Now click here for some comments</a>.</p>
			<div id="2" style="visibility: hidden" class="green">
			<p>You may have answers to the little gap-fill 
			exercise that are different from what is suggested here but, 
			providing the gist is parallel, that does not, of course, matter.<br />
			Here are the suggestions:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>According to Richards and Rogers, a methodology has 
					three parts:<br />
					<span class="style_brown"><em><strong>Approach</strong></em></span><br />
					<span class="style_brown"><em><strong>Design</strong></em>
					</span>and<br />
					<span class="style_brown"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></span>.</li>
					<li>The first of these contains twin theories which are 
					reflected in the second.&nbsp; These are (either way round!)<br />
					A theory of <span class="style_brown"><em><strong>language</strong></em></span><br />
					A theory of <span class="style_brown"><strong><em>learning</em></strong></span></li>
					<li>The assertion that people can integrate new knowledge 
					into their current knowledge, hence building progressively 
					greater understanding and ability is a central tenet of
					<span class="style_brown"><em><strong>cognitivism</strong></em></span>.<br />
					Materials which are designed from the standpoint will be 
					carefully graded to allow this happen and this grading 
					conforms to Krashen’s concept concerning the fact that we 
					need to ensure <span class="style_brown"><em><strong>
					comprehensible input</strong></em></span>.</li>
					<li>When there is a deliberate attempt to encourage learners 
					to listen carefully to a model and compare it with what they 
					say, we are encouraging <span class="style_brown"><strong>
					<em>noticing</em></strong></span> (in this case, noticing 
					the gap).</li>
					<li>When we focus learners on listening out for how a 
					particular function is realised structurally in a dialogue, 
					we are encouraging <span class="style_brown"><em><strong>
					noticing</strong></em> </span>(again, but in this case, 
					noticing the language).</li>
					<li>Within a communicative approach, the foundation of any 
					attempt to understand what is meant starts from the fact the 
					all language has a communicative function. This is the basis 
					for exercises in <span class="style_brown"><em><strong>
					inferencing / inferring</strong></em></span>.</li>
					<li>Activities which attempt to exploit the Zone of Proximal 
					Development will be carefully <span class="style_brown"><em>
					<strong>scaffolded</strong></em> </span>to ensure the 
					appropriate level of support.</li>
					<li>A task-based method does not fit well with an approach 
					which is based on behaviourist principles because it leads 
					inevitably to <span class="style_brown"><em><strong>error(s)</strong></em></span>.&nbsp; A more controlled task in which mistakes are not likely to 
					occur is a characteristic of more <span class="style_brown">
					<em><strong>audio-lingual / behaviourist</strong></em></span> 
					approaches.</li>
					<li>Task-based approaches do, however, provide a good fit 
					with those who favour a social interactional view because 
					such a lesson design requires learners to
					<span class="style_brown"><em><strong>collaborate / work 
					together / work in pairs / work in groups</strong></em></span> etc.</li>
					<li>A dictation activity focuses on form so is in synch with 
					a <span class="style_brown"><strong><em>structuralist</em></strong>
					</span>view of language.<br />
					It also fits well with a <span class="style_brown"><em>
					<strong>cognitive</strong></em> </span>theory of learning 
					because learners are required to analyse what they hear to 
					be able to complete the task well.</li>
