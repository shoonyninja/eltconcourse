		<p>
		<img alt="paper 1" height="166" src="../../../images/paperclip250.jpg" width="250" /></p>
		<p>Nearly all the materials and guides on this site will be useful in 
		preparing you for the demands of the Delta examination.&nbsp; In 
		particular, those that deal with language analysis rather than 
		methodology will be of the most help.<br />
		What follows is a brief overview with some examples of what to expect 
		and what to do.<br />
		A little more advice from the examiners is set out in
		<a href="delta_exam_tips.html" target="_blank">the guide to what to avoid in Module One</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>All links on this page open in a new tab so 
			simply shut the page to come back here.</strong></p>
		<h3>Marking</h3>
		<p>Paper one carries half the 200 marks available to you.&nbsp; The 
		apportioning is not equal, however:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style19">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style16" style="width: 114px">Task 1: 6 marks</td>
				<td class="auto-style17" style="width: 114px">Task 2: 12 marks</td>
				<td class="auto-style17" style="width: 114px">Task 3: 12 marks</td>
				<td class="auto-style17" style="width: 114px">Task 4: 20 marks</td>
				<td class="auto-style18" style="width: 115px">Task 5: 50 marks</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>That means that Task 5 is worth half the total marks awarded, for example, 
		and Task 1 only 6% of the total.<br />
		Given that you are allowed only 90 minutes for each paper, it makes 
		sense to 
		allocate the time you spend in the same manner.&nbsp; There's really no 
		point in spending half your time getting full marks for Tasks 1 and 2 
		because that will only get you 18% of the marks.&nbsp; Worse, leaving 
		yourself no time to do Task 5 will almost certainly mean you can't pass.<br />
		In what follows, this information is repeated with a suggested time 
		allocation.</p>

				<h3>Preparing for tasks 1 and 2</h3>
				<p>There are a number of things you can do, short of learning a 
				dictionary of applied linguistics:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Go through one of the in-service guides every day but, 
					instead of doing all the tasks and tests, pause at every 
					technical term and ask yourself two questions:<ol class="auto-style3">
						<li>Can I provide a succinct definition of this term?</li>
						<li>Can I provide a different example from the one given 
						here?</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Pick up a book on an area you have studied so far and 
					open it at the index page.&nbsp; Then ask yourself the same 
					two questions before you go to the relevant part of the book 
					to check.&nbsp; Don't use only one sort of book &ndash; 
					choose a different focus every day such as pronunciation, 
					reading skills, speaking, grammar, discourse, lexis etc.</li>
					<li>Use
					<a href="../../../glossaries/glossary_ip_grammar.html" target="_blank">the glossary of 
					simple grammatical terms</a> to 
					reassure yourself that you understand the basics of grammar 
					and structure at Delta level.&nbsp; A glossary covering a 
					wider area and including lexis and phonology is available
					<a href="../../../glossaries/glossary_is_grammar_lexis_phonology.html" target="_blank">
					here</a>.</li>
					<li>Use
					<a href="../../../glossaries/glossary_ip_methodology_background.html" target="_blank">the glossary of 
					simple terms relating to background theory and 
					methodology</a> in the same way.&nbsp; Again, a 
					fuller glossary is available
					<a href="../../../glossaries/glossary_is_methodology_background.html" target="_blank">
					here</a>.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>If you do that conscientiously, it will prepare you well for 
				the first two tasks in Paper 1.</p>

					the future such as<br /><em>I'm going to complain to the council<br />
					</em>or<br /><em>I'll try to do something tomorrow<br />
					</em>etc.</li>
					<li>They will need ways of amicably (or otherwise) finishing

				<h3>Preparing for tasks 3, 4 and 5</h3>
				<p>There are a number of things you can do.&nbsp; If you can, 
				work with a colleague who is also taking the Delta examination.&nbsp; 
				You can bounce ideas off each other.</p>
				<h4>Task 3</h4>
				<p>Browse a selection of course materials which contain 
					tasks for learners to complete.&nbsp; Choose range of 
					material types, skills focuses and a range of levels.&nbsp; 
					Then ask yourself two questions:</p>
				<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>If I were setting this question, what three 
						obvious abilities learners need to have to complete the 
						tasks would I supply?</li>
					<li>Now can I think of three or four more abilities the 
						learners will need to have?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				<a href="m1revisiontests/p1t345/p1t3.html" target="_blank">There's a practice example of this task here</a>.</p>
				<h4>Task 4</h4>
				<p>Look again at texts written by your learners and those of 
				your colleagues.&nbsp; Check the requirements of Task 4 and 
				apply them to the texts you have found.&nbsp; Remember to find 
				strengths as well as weaknesses.</p>
				<p>
				<a href="m1revisiontests/p1t345/p1t4.html" target="_blank">There's a practice example of this task here</a>.</p>
				<h4>Task 5</h4>
				<p>
				<a href="m1revisiontests/p1t345/p1t5.html" target="_blank">There is a practice test exercise for this task 
				here</a>.</p>
				<p>Get a selection of texts of different sorts and do three 
					things:</p>
				<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>Identify the genre<br />
					<img alt="identify" height="133" src="../../../images/finger_theme_rheme200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					The common ones in the 
						guide to genre are:<br /><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RECOUNT<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NARRATIVE<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROCEDURE<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INFORMATION REPORT<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EXPLANATION<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EXPOSITION<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DISCUSSION</span><br />
					There may, of course, be subgenres within these categories 
					so, for example, you may be presented with a news report 
					which happens to be a kind of recount and follows the same 
					pattern as most recounts.&nbsp; A news report, however, is a 
					text type, not a genre.<br />
					You may also be confronted by a blog page and will need to 
					figure out whether it's a narrative, a recount, an 
					exposition, a discussion or what.&nbsp; A page from an 
					instruction manual will usually follow the patterns of an 
					explanation and so on.<br />
					Once you have identified the overarching category, you can 
					then say what subgenre the text belongs to.<br />
					Do not suggest, for example, that a newspaper is a genre.&nbsp; 
					It isn't because it is a collection of different sorts of 
					texts which have different generic characteristics.&nbsp; 
					Web pages, too, do not constitute a genre because we have to 
					look at the intentions of the author and the purposes of the 
					texts to identify exactly what the genre really is.<br />
					Here's the diagram from the guide to genre to help you 
					identify which genres a text type may represent.<br />
					<img alt="genres" src="../../../imagesgraphics/genres_subgenres.png" /></li>
					<li>Then look at the text again and identify <strong>how</strong> you 
						classified the text.<br />
					To do that, you need to consider three concepts and here's a 
					way to remember them:<br />
					<img alt="ftm" height="363" src="../delta_images/ftm_delta_m1.png" width="465" /><br />
					To explain:<ol class="auto-style22">
						<li>The field of discourse<ol class="deltabluebullet">
							<li>what is the topic?</li>
							<li>what are the writer's views about 
					what the reader needs to know?&nbsp; In other words, what is 
							the producer of the text trying to achieve?</li>
							<li>layout: what does the text look like?</li>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li>The tenor of discourse<ol class="deltabluebullet">
							<li>what is the relationship between the writer / 
							speaker and the reader / hearer?</li>
							<li>are they equal, client to supplier, supplier to 
							client, giver and receiver of information, knower to 
							non-knower etc.?</li>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li>The mode of discourse<ol class="deltabluebullet">
							<li>is it written or spoken?</li>
							<li>what sort of writing or speaking?</li>
							<li>is it public or private?</li>
						</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Then look at the language itself:<ol class="auto-style23">
						<li>What sorts of circumstances and adverbials are 
							used?<ol class="deltabluebullet">
							<li>Ordering and sequencing adverbials (<em>firstly, 
					then, afterwards</em> etc.) will be 
							used in procedures and narratives, for example.</li>
							<li>Other texts, such as information reports will use 
							lots of adverbials and circumstances to say where, 
					when 
							and why things occur and so on (<em>on 14th April, 
					before the war, in Glasgow, during the meeting, according to 
					police reports</em> etc.).</li>
							<li>Narratives and recounts will start with some 
							kind or orientation: where, when, who, with whom 
							etc.</li>
							<li>Expositions and discussions will start with a 
							statement of the issue, where it occurs and whom it 
							affects.</li>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Check the modal expressions to see what sorts are there.<ol class="deltabluebullet">
							<li>If 
							the text contains lots of <em>should, must</em> and 
							<em>ought</em> 
							expressions, it's probably an exposition.</li>
							<li>If the 
							text contains lots of hedging with things such as 
							<em>It 
							may be argued that, It appears that</em> etc., then it 
							may be a discussion.</li>
							<li>Explanations and information 
							reports will contain little modality because they 
					are concerned with factual matters.</li>
							<li>Recounts and 
							narratives may contain speculation modal expressions such as
							<em>she might have thought, he could have assumed</em> etc. and so on.</li>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Look at the tense use.<ol class="deltabluebullet">
							<li>Recounts and 
							narratives are conventionally in the past with 
							perfective verbs uses (saying what (has) happened, who did 
					what, thought what etc.).</li>
							<li>Procedural texts contain 
							present tenses and imperatives.</li>
							<li>Expositions and discussions may 
							contain conditional speculation about the future or the 
							expression of consequences with future forms (<em>if 
					we go on this way ... </em>etc.) and so 
							on.</li>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Now look at the verbs and what processes they 
							encode.<ol class="deltabluebullet">
							<li>Relational processes will appear often in 
							information reports, expositions and discussions.</li>
							<li>Narratives and recounts will contain behavioural, 
							material and projecting verbs.<br />See 
							<a href="../../verbs/verbal_processes.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
							verbal processes</a> for more.</li>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Now look at the lexis.<ol class="deltabluebullet">
							<li>Are there obvious chains 
							running through the text to tell you what it's about 
							and help it cohere?</li>
							<li>Can you immediately identify the 
							register from the lexis?</li>
							<li>What does the writer's 
							choice of lexis and style tell you?<br />
					For more, 
					see <a href="../../discourse/style_register.html" target="_blank">the guide 
					to style and register</a>.</li>
						</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Do all this and you will be well prepared for this paper.</p>
