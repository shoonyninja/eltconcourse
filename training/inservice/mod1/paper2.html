		<h1><span class="deltablue">Delta </span>Module One, Paper 2: Task by task</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="paper 2" height="166" src="../../../images/write_examination250.jpg" width="250" /></p>
		<p>Nearly all the materials and guides on this site will be useful in 
		preparing you for the demands of the Delta examination.&nbsp; In 
		particular, those that deal with language analysis rather than 
		methodology will be of the most help.<br />
		What follows is a brief overview with some examples of what to expect 
		and what to do.<br />
		A little more advice from the examiners is set out in
		<a href="delta_exam_tips.html" target="_blank">the guide to what to avoid in Module One</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>All links on this page except to the tests open in a new tab so 
			simply shut the page to come back here.</strong></p>
		<p>All the tasks in Paper 2 require longer written responses.</p>
		<h3>Marking</h3>
		<p>Paper two carries half the 200 marks available to you.&nbsp; The 
		apportioning is not equal, however:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style19">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style16" style="width: 114px">Task 1: 18 marks</td>
				<td class="auto-style17" style="width: 114px">Task 2: 42 marks</td>
				<td class="auto-style17" style="width: 114px">Task 3: 40 marks</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>That means that Task 1 is worth less than half the marks awarded to 
		either Task 2 or 3.<br />
		Given that you are allowed only 90 minutes for each paper, it makes 
		sense to 
		allocate the time you spend in the same manner.<br />
		In what follows, this information is repeated with a suggested time 
		allocation.</p>
		<table style="width: 100%">

				<strong>not</strong> being 
				asked to evaluate it generally but in terms of what it is

				ability to write an email to a friend will be useless if it is 
				actually spoken accuracy that you want to test.&nbsp; Obviously, 
				the first place to go to prepare yourself for this question is
				<a href="../../background/testing.html" target="_blank">the guide to testing, 
				assessment and evaluation on this site</a>.<br />
				You are expected to make a total of 6 points including <strong>
				both positive and negative</strong> ones.<br />

				<p>There are, obviously, very many 
				possible test types but they fall into a number of categories in 
				terms of their effectiveness and purposes.&nbsp; So:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Figure out from the description of the test's purpose 
					what kind of test it is.&nbsp; Try completing this table by 
					filling in the right-hand column with the kind of test and 
					then click on it for the answers.<br />
					<img id="img5" alt="2.1 task" height="174" src="../delta_images/2.1task1.png" width="500" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img5',/*url*/'../delta_images/2.1task1ans.png')" /></li>
					<li>Go to the guide to
					<a href="../../background/testing.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
					testing, assessment and evaluation</a> to refresh your 
					memory of testing if you haven't done that recently.&nbsp; 
					There are also guides in the in-service section on assessing 
					the four skills discretely which all have examples of tests 
					with comments on their suitability for the target purposes.<br />
					Now <a href="p2t1hp1.htm">try these three mini-tests</a> to 
					check your understanding.&nbsp; The final test gives you the 
					option to come back here.</li>
					<li>Now find a selection of tests (teacher's books have 
					plenty but you could also look at any that you have 
					designed) and apply the principles of testing to them.<br />
					For example:<ol class="auto-style22">
						<li>If the test is intended to 
					be an achievement test (measuring progress) does it actually 
					test what is in the syllabus (content validity)?</li>
						<li>If the test is intended to test 
					writing skills does it do so by actually testing them 
					directly or indirectly?&nbsp; If it is indirect testing, is 
					it reliable and valid?</li>
						<li>Does the test rely on the subjective 
					opinion of the marker (low reliability) or is it 
					mechanically marked (high reliability)?</li>
						<li>If the test has high reliability 
					(multiple choice, fixed answers etc.) does it have validity: 
					is it testing what we think it's testing?</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Think about the learner.&nbsp; You need to apply what 
					you know about testing to <strong>the stated learner for the 
					stated purpose</strong>.&nbsp; This question is not an 
					opportunity for you to tell the examiner everything you have 
					learned about testing.</li>

				<h4>Preparing for task 2</h4>
				You can prepare yourself by browsing various course materials

					<li>What is the purpose of the task, activity or procedure?</li>
					<li>What theories have influenced its design?</li>
					<li>What assumptions underlie those theories?</li>
				</ul>
				When you have answers to those three questions, read the 
				introduction to the Teacher's Book.&nbsp; This is where the 
				materials writer(s) will usually set out the underlying 
				assumptions about learning and language that influenced the 
				construction of the materials.<br />
				For this task, you need to revise and (re-)visit the following 
				guides on this site:<ol>
					<li>
					<a href="../../methodology/methodology_refined.html" target="_blank">
					methodology unpacked and refined</a> – this is an overview

					functional, task-based, mixed etc.)</li>
					<li><a href="../../background/history_development.html" target="_blank">
					the history and development of ELT</a> &ndash; to remind 
					yourself of things like grammar-translation, direct method, 
					audio-lingualism, behaviourism and structural linguistics 
					and see if these theories and approaches are influencing the 
					design of the materials and whether the tasks and 
					presentation depend on inductive or deductive learning.&nbsp; 
					Is there, e.g., an element of discovery learning indicating 
					inductive approaches?</li>
					<li><a href="../../methodology/clt.html" target="_blank">
					communicative language teaching</a> &ndash; to see if (as is 
					probable) there is an underlying assumption that language is 
					a means of communication first and foremost and learners 
					need to have the opportunity to personalise language for 
					real communication</li>
					<li>
					<a href="../../methodology/krashen_natural_approach.html" target="_blank">

				In this task you get an extract or two from something such as a 
				methodology or resource book, a lesson plan, a discussion of a

				Your task is to answer a series of questions about it based on 
				your knowledge of approaches, methods, theories, resources and 
				roles.<br />
				As you can understand, exactly what knowledge you bring to the 
				task will depend on its type but you should not neglect to 
				include reference to your own experience and that of your 
				colleagues when it is appropriate.<br />
				This question carries 40% of the possible marks so spend 35 
				minutes on it.&nbsp; But less if you can.<br />
				Marking:<br />
				2 marks for each correct point made (up to a maximum of 30 
				marks) plus <br />
				You get a mark out of 5 for the depth of your response and that 
				mark is then doubled to bring it up to a maximum of 10 marks.&nbsp;

				Much of that is rather subjective but the gist is that to score 
				well you have to identify what is relevant.&nbsp; You need to 
				refer to:<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li>Your experience or examples</li>
					<li>A range of contexts</li>
					<li>Your knowledge of theory and practice</li>
				</ul>
				<p>and you have convincingly to justify your comments and opinions.</p>
				<p>It is, of course, very difficult to predict the topic of this 
				task but question setters are constrained to some extent by the 
				need to be inclusive and not advantage people with particular 
				experiences and backgrounds so you are unlikely to be faced with 
				anything we could call a niche area.<br />
				Often, questions focus on the <strong>value</strong> (perceived 
				or otherwise) of particular approaches to teaching and classroom 
				techniques such as the values of correction, group work, 
				speaking practice, noticing activities, certain ways to 
				structure lessons, drilling, dictation and so on.<br />
				All of these examples, to which you could add, have both 
				advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp; They all, too, betray 
				something about people's understanding of the role of language 
				and language-learning theories.<br />
				These are the areas on which to focus.</p>
