			<p>If you have not followed <a href="wordstress.html">the guide to

			To analyse sentence stress (and intonation) we need to speak of 
			tone units (or tone groups or intonation contours, depending whom

			<p>On this site, we'll use the term tone unit and, following Crystal, 
			we'll divide it into a pre-head, a head, the nucleus and a tail.&nbsp; 
			In a sentence such as <em>I went to London last week</em>, normally 
			pronounced with no special emphasis, we have:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>the <strong>pre-head</strong> <em>I</em> 
			(which is unstressed to the point of inaudibility)</li>
				<li>the <strong>head</strong> <em>went to</em> (with a weak unstressed pronunciation of 
				<em>to</em> as /tə/)</li>
				<li>the <strong>nucleus</strong>, carrying the key information,
				<em>LONdon</em></li>
				<li>a <strong>tail</strong>, <em>last 
			week</em> which is unstressed.<br /></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The reason that LONdon is spelled the way it is is to show what 
			is called the tonic syllable which is the most prominent (i.e., 
			longest, loudest and highest pitched) in the tone unit.</p>
			<p>The utterance doesn't have to be pronounced that way.&nbsp; If it 
			is said in answer to the question<br />
			<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When</strong> did you go to London?</em><br />
			the tone units might change to move the nucleus to <em>LAST week</em> 
			because that is now the key information.</p>
			<p>Tone units are discussed in slightly more detail in
			<a href="intonationkey.html">the guide to key concepts in intonation</a> 
			because it is in the study of intonation that they play a crucial 
			role.</p>
			<p>If you are not familiar with phonemic transcription, do not worry 
			now.&nbsp; In what follows, we will be using very little.<br />

					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>Timing</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>A distinction is often averred between languages which are 
			syllable timed and those, like English, which are stress timed.&nbsp;
			There are two fundamental forms of stressing.<br />
			The following is the theory.<br />
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Syllable timing</strong><ol class="redbulletlist">
					<li>In some languages, such as French, Italian, Spanish, Cantonese and 
			Mandarin, every syllable is <em>perceived</em> as taking up the same 
			amount of time.&nbsp; This is the so-called 'machine gun' sound of 
			these languages.&nbsp; So we get:<em><br />
					<span class="auto-style4">I ... went ... to ... Lon ... don ... 
				with ... my ... bro ..ther</span></em></li>
					<li>The length of time it takes to say a sentence in 
					syllable-timed languages is dependent on the number of 
					syllables it contains, therefore.</li>
					<li>Vowels in syllable timed languages maintain their 
					essential identity (although they may be shortened in rapid 
					speech).</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				
				
				<li><strong>Stress timing</strong><ol class="redbulletlist">
					<li>In other languages, notably English, Dutch, Farsi, Russian, 
					many Arabic varieties and Scandinavian 
			languages, some syllables take longer to say than others and this 
			results in a reduction of the syllables in between.&nbsp; So we get<em><br />
					<span class="auto-style4">Iwentto ... <strong>L o n </strong>d'n ... 
			withmy ... <strong>b r o</strong> the(r)</span></em></li>
					<li>In stress-timed languages, by contrast, the length of 
					time it takes to say a sentence depends on the number of 
					stresses it contains, not the number of syllables.</li>
					<li>So that the stresses fall evenly, speakers are obliged 
					to weaken and shorten the vowels in unstressed syllables and 
					that leads to the reduction of <em>to</em> from /tuː/ (pronounced the 
					same as <em>two</em> or <em>too</em>) to /tə/ or even /t/ 
					and the reduction of all the other vowels in the unstressed 
					syllables so it sounds like Iwent<strong>lon</strong>dnwim<strong>broth</strong>a.&nbsp; 
					That could be transcribed as /ə wentə ˈlʌn.dən wɪ mə ˈbrʌð.ə/.</li>
					<li>The upshot is that vowels in unstressed syllables lose 
					their quality and, in particular, long vowels get shortened:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /iː/ (as in <em>been</em>) gets shortened to /ɪ/ (as in <em>
					bin</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /uː/ (as in <em>goose</em>) gets shortened to /ʊ/ (as in <em>
					put</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ɜː/ (as in <em>nurse</em>) gets shortened to /ə/ (as in <em>
					<span class="style_underline">a</span>bout</em>) and so do 
					other vowels<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ɑː/ (as in <em>heart</em>) gets shortened to /ɒ/ (as in <em>
					hot</em>)<br />
					and a number of consonants such as /t/ and /h/ may be 
					omitted altogether.</li>
					<li>Languages which exhibit the phenomenon of stress rather 
					than syllable timing are known as isochronous.</li>
					<li>
					<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_Weak_forms.pdf" target="_blank">
					Click here for a list</a> of commonly weakened words in 
					connected speech.&nbsp; You will see that they are almost 
					all grammar or function words rather than carrying meaning 
					content.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>However, even if this distinction exists, it is not an 
			either-or one.&nbsp; Languages will vary along a cline from 
			syllable- to stress-timing tendencies.<br />(There is, in fact, a third form of timing: Mora timing.&nbsp; In 
			Japanese, e.g., a vowel (V) takes the same time to utter as a consonant 
			(C) plus a vowel so V takes the same time as CV and CVV takes twice as 
			long as CV.)</p>
			<p>Here's a rough guide to which languages tend to be more or less 
			syllable- or stress-timed:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style13">
				
				<tr >
					<td class="auto-style14">

					THAI (also tonal)<br />
					TURKISH<br />
					VIETNAMESE (also tonal)<br />

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>In the real world, it has not been possible to measure an 
			appreciable difference in the length of syllables across languages 
			which would support the division above and it is suggested that the 
			differences are not to do with timing so much as to phenomena such 
			as vowel reduction which are the cause, not the effect, of perceived 
			differences in rhythm.<br />
			It has further been suggested that <em>all</em> languages exhibit 
			both types of stressing to various extents.<br />
			It has also been claimed that different dialects of the <em>same</em> 
			language will vary in this respect.</p>
			<p>This is not to say that the concepts of timing and patterns of 
			stress are useless in the classroom but they do need to be handled 
			with care.&nbsp; Alerting learners to the features of connected 
			speech in English, in particular, vowel reduction in unstressed 
			syllables and the pitch movements which occur in stressed syllables, 
			is important both for comprehension and production.</p>
			<p>As was explained in the guide to word stress, three things change 
			when we stress a syllable:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Loudness</strong>: how much force is used when 
				saying the syllable</li>
				<li><strong>Pitch</strong>: stressed syllables are often 
				pronounced in a higher tone</li>
				<li><strong>Length</strong>: stressed syllables take longer to 
				utter than unstressed ones</li>
			</ol>

					<h2>Focusing on new rather than given</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There is a strong tendency in English to present new information 
			towards the end of any utterance, a phenomenon sometimes called
			<strong>end focus</strong>.&nbsp; Take for example:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>A: What did she buy?</em></li>
				<li><em>B: She bought a shirt.</em></li>
			</ul>
			In this exchange, it is a fairly easy matter to suggest that the 
			nucleus of the answering response will be <em><strong>SHIRT</strong></em> 
			because this answers the question.&nbsp; We will have, therefore:<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>the <strong>pre-head</strong> <em>She</em> which is unstressed 
				and possibly reduced to just a 'shi' sound (/ʃɪ/)</li>
				<li>the <strong>head</strong> <em>bought a</em> (with a weak unstressed pronunciation of 
				<em>a</em> as /ə/)</li>
				<li>the <strong>nucleus</strong>, carrying the key information,
				<em>SHIRT</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, if the response is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>She bought a shirt that looks 
				awful on her</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Then we probably have two tone units:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>She bought a <strong>SHIRT</strong></em> (which retains 
				the structure above with the nucleus on <em>SHIRT</em>)</li>
				<li><em>that looks <strong>AW</strong>ful on her</em> (which 
				forms a new tone unit with the nucleus on <em><strong>AW</strong>ful,
				</em>has a pre-head, <em>that</em>, a head, <em>looks </em>and 
				an unstressed tail, <em>on her</em>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The reason is that it is clear to both speakers that they know 
			the person in question and very probably also know that she bought 
			something.&nbsp; The only new information is, therefore, presented at 
			the end of each tone unit and takes the tonic stress.<br />
			<strong>New information, not shared by both speakers determines 
			where the tonic stress will fall in each tone unit.</strong></p>

					<h2>Showing stress and tone movement</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In the classroom, it is necessary to develop and use consistently 
			some means of showing where the stress falls and how the tone is 
			changing on the tonic syllable.&nbsp; Each time a model sentence is 
			presented, for whatever purpose, it is helpful to learners if there 
			is some graphical way of drawing their attention to the sentence 
			stress pattern.<br />
			In the guide to word stress, three obvious choices were presented:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="highlight" height="78" src="../../imagesgraphics/highlightingstress1.png" width="200" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="highlight" height="78" src="../../imagesgraphics/highlightingstress2.png" width="200" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="highlight" height="78" src="../../imagesgraphics/highlightingstress3.png" width="200" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>The same can be done with sentence stress with the addition of an 
			arrow to show the tone movement.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="sentence stress" height="121" src="../../imagesgraphics/sentencestress.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style2">

					<img alt="special" height="166" src="../../images/difference_apples250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Special stress</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We do not, unless we are praying or talking to ourselves, speak 
			in isolation.&nbsp; We continually get, and sometimes suffer from, 
			feedback from whomever we are engaged with in conversation.&nbsp; 
			Take this example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>A: Have you seen Mary recently?</em></li>
				<li><em>B: Yes, I saw her yesterday.</em></li>
				<li><em>A: Yesterday?&nbsp; I thought she was in Cambridge.</em></li>
				<li><em>B: She was.&nbsp; So was I.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>It's probable that the sentence stress will fall like this:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>A: Have you seen </em> <strong><em>MAry </em></strong>
				<em>recently?</em></li>
				<li><em>B: Yes, I saw her </em><strong><em>YESterday</em></strong><em>.</em></li>
				<li><em>A: </em><strong><em>YESterday</em></strong><em>?&nbsp; I thought she was in 
				</em><strong><em>CAMbridge</em></strong><em>.</em></li>
				<li><em>B: She </em><strong><em>WAS</em></strong><em>.&nbsp; So was
				</em><strong><em>I</em></strong><em>.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Which obeys all the rules concerning the stressing of new 
			information and its placement.</p>
			<p>However, if the conversation takes a different turn, things may 
			alter to allow for the other speaker's feedback:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>A: Have </em><strong><em>YOU</em></strong><em> seen Mary 
				recently?</em></li>
				<li><em>B: No, sorry, </em><strong><em>I</em></strong><em> 
				haven't but </em><strong><em>JOHN</em></strong><em> has.</em></li>
				<li>John<em> <strong>PARK</strong>er told me he </em>
				<strong><em>HAsn't</em></strong><em>.</em></li>
				<li><em>Not </em><strong><em>THAT</em></strong><em> John.&nbsp; 
				I mean the John who works in </em><strong><em>IT</em></strong><em>.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this, the speakers apply special stress in order to respond to 
			the other speaker's emphasis, error or misunderstanding.<br />
			Everyone does that, in all languages, so it will not be mysterious 
			to your learners.<br />
			It is, however, important that we present the 'normal', i.e., 
			canonical word stress to our learners before focusing on special 
			stress in sentences or we run the risk of confusing them.&nbsp; If 
			you do feel the need to practise special stress, it can be done by 
			taking a simple statement and varying the question.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Statement: <strong><em>He spoke to the 
				hearer at a party in London.</em></strong><ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li>Question1: <em>Where was the party where he spoke to 
					you?</em></li>
					<li>Answer 1: <em>He spoke to me at the party in </em>
					<strong><em>LON</em></strong><em>don.</em></li>
					<li>Question 2: <em>Where did he speak to you in London?</em></li>
					<li>Answer 2: <em>He spoke to me at the </em><strong><em>PAR</em></strong><em>ty 
					in London.</em></li>
					<li>Question 3: <em>Who did he speak to at the party in 
					London?</em></li>
					<li>Answer 3: <em>He spoke to </em><strong><em>ME</em></strong><em> 
					at the party in London.</em></li>
					<li>Question 4: <em>Who spoke to you at the party in London?</em></li>
					<li>Answer 4: <strong><em>HE</em></strong><em> spoke to me 
					at a party in London.</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.<br />
			Notice, however, that as the exercise goes on, the responses become 
			ever more unnatural because the word order does not change and the 
			tail of the tone unit gets ever longer.&nbsp; To comply with end 
			focus, most speakers will rephrase to get something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the party in London he spoke to <strong>ME</strong></em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the party in London I was spoken to by <strong>HIM</strong></em><br />
			etc.<br />
			Even with special stress, end focus will often rule the roost.</p>
			<p>Special stress may also cancel out normal word stress so we 
			might find something like:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>Is that your Bi</em><strong><em>OL</em></strong><em>ogy 
				teacher?</em></li>
				<li><em>No. It's my </em><strong><em>GE</em></strong><em>ology 
				teacher!</em></li>

			<p>There is <a href="../phrases_clauses_sentences/constituents.html">
			a guide to constituents of phrases</a> on this site.&nbsp; The 
			following comes from
			<a href="../phrases_clauses_sentences/postmodification_nouns.html">the 
			guide to post-modification of noun phrases</a> where similar 
			considerations apply.</p>
			<p>We need to be slightly careful in deciding what exactly a 
			prepositional phrase is modifying or our hearers can misinterpret 
			what we mean.<br />
			For example, the sentence:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Jane spoke to the man behind the bar</em><br />
			can be understood in two ways, like this:<br />
			<img alt="ambiguity" height="78" src="../../imagesgraphics/constituents_preposition.jpg" width="400" /><br />
			In the first sentence, the <strong>verb</strong> is being 
			post-modified and tells us where she spoke so the separated verb 
			phrase is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>spoke to ... behind the bar</em><br />
			Strictly speaking, we have a verb phrase and a prepositional phrase 
			modifier here rather than a pure verb phrase.&nbsp; A verb phrase, 
			technically, can only contain verb forms so the verb phrase is <em>
			spoke</em> and all else is modification of it.<br />
			In the second sentence, the <strong>noun</strong> is being 
			post-modified and the object noun phrase is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the man behind the bar</em><br />
			When the first sense is intended, speakers will insert a slight 
			pause between <em>the man</em> and <em>behind the bar</em>, making 
			two tone units each with a stressed syllable: <em>the </em><strong>
			<em>man</em></strong> and <em>behind the </em><strong><em>bar</em></strong>.</p>

					<h2>Disambiguation</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>One obvious function of special stress and the deliberate moving 
			of the tonic syllable is to disambiguate what might otherwise be 
			unclear.&nbsp; For example, the sentence:</p>
			<p><em class="auto-style17">Anastasia hit the man with the chair</em></p>
			<p>has two possible interpretations if no context or co-text is 
			available:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>The man had a chair and Anastasia hit him</em></li>
				<li><em>What Anastasia hit the man with was a chair</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The only way a hearer can figure out what is meant is by paying 
			attention to how the utterance is stressed:</p>
			<table cellspacing="3">
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2">1</td>
					<td class="auto-style18"><em>Anastasia</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style19"><em>hit the</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style19"><em><strong>MAN</strong></em></td>

			<p>Saying both of these aloud makes it clearer.&nbsp; Notice, too,
