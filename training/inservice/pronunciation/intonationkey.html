		<h3>The physics</h3>
		<p>If you hit middle C on a piano, the sound you hear will be produced 
		by a string vibrating 262 times a second.&nbsp; That's usually expressed 
		as 262 cps (cycles per second) or Hz (Hertz).&nbsp; Making a piano do 
		that is actually rather a complicated piece of engineering which relies 
		on the fact that longer strings produce lower notes and thicker strings 
		vibrate more slowly.&nbsp; If you cut the string in half, and hit it 
		again, the note will be exactly twice as high.<br />
		Your larynx, where you keep your vocal cords, is considerable smaller 
		than the average piano so the effect is achieved by muscles working to 
		tighten or relax the cords across which you are expelling air, 
		lengthening and thickening them.&nbsp; You may not be able to sing 
		terribly well but you do have considerable control over the pitch of 
		sounds that you produce.<br />
		The human ear can (in young people) detect sounds ranging from around 20 
		to 20,000 Hz and you can detect differences of pitch of around 2 or 3 
		Hz.&nbsp; (Bats and elephants are a different matter.)&nbsp; Given that 
		the average range of human voice is around 160 Hz, that allows us to 
		detect something like 65 variations.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Language pitch<br />
		</em></strong>We don't however, have 65 significant variations to 
		contend with.&nbsp; Authorities vary in this respect but the usual 
		consensus is that <em>significant </em>pitch variations are confined to 
		<em>low</em>, <em>middle</em> and <em>high</em> or sometimes as <em>low</em>, 
		<em>middle</em>, <em>high</em> and <em>extra high</em>.</p>

				<h2>Stress</h2>
				<span class="auto-style4"><em>giving particular emphasis or 
				importance to a sound</em></span></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Usually, stress is connected to loudness.&nbsp; If you hit a 
		piano key harder, it will produce a louder sound but one which has the 
		same pitch.<br />
		In humans, as usual, the situation is a bit more complicated and there 
		are two issues:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>If we make an extra effort to expel more air, we will certainly 
			increase the loudness of the sound we produce.&nbsp; However, the 
			extra effort we make usually results in our also tightening (and 
			shortening) the vocal cords and that, of course, will produce a 
			heightened pitch as well.&nbsp; This means that most stressed sounds 
			are also at a higher pitch.</li>
			<li>At the same time, speakers usually also lengthen the sound when 
			they wish to stress it.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This results in three variations, not one:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Stressed sounds are louder</li>
			<li>Stressed sounds are longer</li>
			<li>Stressed sounds are at a higher pitch</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Oddly, the evidence appears to be that loudness is not the deciding 
		factor in what the hearer perceives &ndash; duration and pitch are more 
		important.<br />
		Thankfully, most authorities concur that we only need to distinguish 
		between stressed and unstressed sounds although there is clearly a whole 
		range of intermediate possibilities with the three variables working 
		together.</p><hr />

		<p>Here is where we bump into a common division into syllable- and 
		stress-timed languages.&nbsp; The argument (based on Abercrombie, 1965) 
		is that some languages (such as French) are syllable timed with each 
		syllable taking the same amount of time to be uttered.&nbsp; So we get:</p>
		<p>In French:<br />
		<img alt="french" height="72" src="../../imagesgraphics/syllabletimed.png" width="400" /><br />
		in which all syllables take the same amount of time to utter and in 
		English:<br />
		<img alt="english" height="75" src="../../imagesgraphics/stresstimed.png" width="400" /><br />
		in which each section (called a foot) has one stressed syllable and any 
		number of unstressed syllables, all of which take the same time to utter.</p>
		<p>More recent work has somewhat refined the theory, placing languages 
		on a cline from those which are strictly syllable timed to those which 
		are strictly stress timed with gradations in between.</p><hr />

				<h2>The tone group</h2>
				<span class="auto-style4"><em>Descriptions of intonation are not 
				concerned with the pitch of individual syllables but rather with 
				pitch patterns or tunes.&nbsp; The phonological unit set up to

			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The usual division of the tone group or unit is into four bits:<br />
		(Prehead) (Head) Nucleus (Tail)</p>
		<p>The reason that three of those bits are in brackets is that they may 
		not always occur &ndash; the nucleus, however, is always present.<br />
		This is where things get complicated because there is less agreement 
		among authorities in the analysis.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>Nucleus</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>This is the key bit to focus on.&nbsp; It is the syllable on 
			which the main pitch change starts.&nbsp; Some people call it the 
			tonic syllable.<br />
			Although authorities differ, it's possible to distinguish 4 types of 
			pitch movement on the nucleus: fall, rise, rise-fall and fall-rise.&nbsp; 
			Complicating the issue are the three or four pitch types recognised 
			above (low, middle, high and extra high).&nbsp; Combine all those 
			and it's clear that there are 12 possible variations to consider.&nbsp; 
			The nucleus is followed by the ... </dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Tail</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>This, when it is present, continues the pitch movement 
			which occurred in the Nucleus.&nbsp; Some authorities don't even 
			recognise its existence and combine it with the Nucleus or Tonic.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Prehead and Head</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Together, these two constitute the syllables up to but not 
			including the Nuclear syllable.&nbsp; Some people don't even 
			recognise two categories here and use Pretonic to describe the whole 
			bit leading up to the Nucleus (or Tonic).&nbsp; Usually, the pitch 
			movement on this part of an utterance can be described in the same 
			way as the pitch movement on the nucleus (fall, rise, rise-fall and 
			fall-rise).&nbsp; The movement, is, however, smoother and less 
			emphatic.<br />
			There are those, Brazil <em>et al</em>, for example (1980:9), who 
			suggest that the pitch movement on the Prehead and Head, while 
			variable, is not actually significant.&nbsp; That's convenient for 
			teaching purposes because it means we can virtually ignore it and 
			focus our learners on the pitch movements occurring on the Nucleus 
			or Tonic.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>In the guide to intonation on this site, 6 possible pitch changes on 
		the Nucleus are suggested.&nbsp; They are</p>

				<h2>Intonation and communication</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The communicative importance of all this is:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>where the speaker decides to place the Nucleus in an utterance 
			and </li>
			<li>which of the 6 pitch changes is used</li>
		</ol>
		<p>For example, consider the utterance:</p>
		<h3><em><span class="auto-style18"><strong><a name="1"></a>she's going to see that film</strong></span></em></h3>
		<p>Say this sentence aloud, doing three things:</p>
		<ul class="auto-style19">
			<li>moving the Nucleus around from item to item along the utterance</li>
			<li>raising the pitch of the Nucleus</li>
			<li>changing 
		the pitch movement in one of the four ways: fall, rise, rise-fall, 
			fall-rise</li>
		</ul>
		<p>and you'll soon hear the differences.<br />For example:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the Nucleus on the first syllable (<em>she's</em>) 
		and use a sharply rising pitch movement.&nbsp; You'll get a sentence which 
		sounds like an astonished question asking for the hearer to confirm its 
		truth.</li>
			<li>Try again with the Nucleus on <em>go</em>: and a rise-fall, 
		you'll get a sentence that sounds as if the speaker is confirming her 
		fixed resolution to see the film.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Try doing those two and then writing down the way you see the intonation 
		using arrows to show pitch movements and writing bits of the utterance 
		above or below a base line to show pitch and
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'intonationkey',0,'style.visibility','visible')">then click here</a> 
		for a picture of how it might look.</p>
		<p>
		<img id="intonationkey" style="visibility:hidden" alt="intonation" height="237" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonationkey.png" width="400" /></p>
		<p>
		Try a few more of these for yourself and identify how the sentence will 
		sound to a listener.</p>
		<p>
		This is the kind of thing which can be 
		presented and practised but do not imagine, however, that our reactions 
		and attitudes are signalled only by the intonation we use.&nbsp; Far 
		from it.&nbsp; If you or your materials imply anything of the sort, your 
		students will be seriously misled.&nbsp; For example, the intonation in 
		the first diagram above could just as easily show extreme anger as 
		astonishment.<br />
		The point is:<br />
		<span class="auto-style4"><em>There are no arguments for teaching 
		intonation in terms of attitude, because the rules for use are too 
		obscure, too amorphous, and too easily refutable.
				(<span class="auto-style5">Brazil, Coulthard &amp; Johns, 1980:120)</span></em></span></p>
		<p>
		Intonation does play a communicative role, of course, but <strong>in 
		conjunction with</strong> the setting, the roles of speaker and 
		listener, their intentions and their shared information in the setting.</p>
