				<h2>What is intonation?</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>A simple definition is that it refers to variations in spoken pitch 
		or tone and stress or emphasis.<br />
		Intonation is often used to show the attitude of the speaker and signal such 
		things as:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The difference between statements and questions.&nbsp; Some 
			languages use <strong>only</strong> intonation to do this, having no 
			grammatical difference between an affirmative and an interrogative 
			sentence.</li>
			<li>The difference between various types of question such as those 
			expecting a yes/no answer (closed questions) and those requiring 
			elaboration such as questions beginning with <em>why, who, what</em> 
			etc.</li>
			<li>The speaker's focus of attention on various bits of the message.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><a name="int1"></a>For example, if somebody asks you a simple yes/no question such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Are you 
		coming to the party?</em><br />
		how many ways can you vary the intonation on a 
		simple 'yes' answer?<br />
		Look at the graphic above for some clues and 
		try to express the following attitudes:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style15">
			<li>No emotional response</li>
			<li>Positive confirmation</li>
			<li>Why do you ask?</li>
			<li>Of course!&nbsp; I'm astonished you should ask!</li>
			<li>I'm not sure if I'm coming or not.&nbsp; It depends.</li>
			<li>Carry on and tell me why you are asking.</li>

			<p>Intonation is a significant contributor to a foreign accent in 
			learners of other languages because most adult learners will carry 
			over the intonation patterns from their first languages into a 
			language they are learning.<br />
			It is important to note here that intonation patterns, at least the 
			conventional or canonical ones, will vary from language to language 
			and cannot easily be transferred although, of course, some languages 
			will share very similar patterns and that will make life somewhat 
			easier for learners with those backgrounds.<br />
			It is also the case that intonation patterns will vary from dialect 
			to dialect in most large languages and that, too, is a significant 
			marker of the speaker's origin.<br />
			In French, for example, pitch rises towards the end of each clause 
			and at the end of sentences which gives the language its 
			recognisable intonational contour rather like:<br />
			<img alt="french" height="13" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonation_french.png" width="310" /><br />
			whereas German, by contrast, exhibits a fall at the end of each 
			cause and at the end of the sentence like this:<br />
			<img alt="german" height="13" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonation_german.png" width="310" /><br />
			Italian speakers will tend to let the pitch fall on statements 
			requiring an exclamation mark but speakers of Greek will do the 
			opposite.<br />
			Question intonation is often, not always, signified by rising 
			intonation and some languages have no other way to identify question 
			forms at all.<br />
			In Mandarin Chinese, question and statement intonations follow 
			similar contours but the question intonation starts, continues and 
			finishes at a higher pitch level than a statement.<br />
			Russian speakers will increase pitch in alternative questions on 
			both the first and second alternative (whereas English, for 
			examples, lowers the pitch after the second alternative).<br />
			Within very large languages, such as Arabic, which is better 
			considered as a language family rather than a single language, there 
			are very significant differences between the intonation contours 
			used in, say, Morocco, from those used in other Arabic-speaking 
			cultures such as the Gulf States.</p>

		<p>Although this is undeniably a challenging 
		area to teach, it is important for the simple reason that native 
		speakers are accustomed to hearing English which contains errors in 
		structure and the pronunciation of individual sounds (especially vowels) 
		but may be wholly unaware that errors in intonation are even possible.&nbsp; 
		Wells puts it this way:</p>
		<p class="indentpara" >After all, almost any intonation pattern is
		<em>possible</em> in English; but different intonation patterns have 
		different meanings.&nbsp; The difficulty is that the pattern the learner 
		uses may not have the <em>meaning</em> he or she intends.&nbsp; Speakers 
		of English assume that – when it comes to intonation – you mean what you 
		say.&nbsp; This may not be the same as what you think you are saying.<br />

			<p >Before we can analyse or attempt to teach intonation, there are

			<ol>

				<li>Rhythm</li>
				<li>Tone groups</li>

		<h3>The physics</h3>
		<p>If you hit middle C on a piano, the sound you hear will be produced 
		by a string vibrating 262 times a second.&nbsp; That's usually expressed 
		as 262 cps (cycles per second) or Hz (Hertz).&nbsp; Making a piano do 
		that is actually rather a complicated piece of engineering which relies 
		on the fact that longer strings produce lower notes and thicker strings 
		vibrate more slowly.&nbsp; If you cut the string in half, and hit it 
		again, the note will be exactly twice as high.</p>
			<p>Your larynx, where you keep your vocal folds, is considerable smaller 
		than the average piano so the effect is achieved by muscles working to 
		tighten or relax the cords across which you are expelling air, 
		lengthening and thickening them or shortening and narrowing them.&nbsp; You may not be able to sing 
		terribly well but you do have considerable control over the pitch of 
		sounds that you produce.</p>
			<p>The human ear can (in young people) detect sounds ranging from around 20 
		to 20,000 Hz and you can detect differences of pitch of around 2 or 3 
		Hz.&nbsp; (Bats and elephants are a different matter.)&nbsp; Given that 
		the average range of human voice is around 160 Hz, that allows us to 
		detect something like 65 variations.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Language pitch<br />
		</em></strong>We don't however, have 65 significant variations to 
		contend with.&nbsp; Authorities vary in this respect but the usual 
		consensus is that <em>significant </em>pitch variations are confined to 
		<em>low</em>, <em>middle</em> and <em>high</em> or sometimes as <em>low</em>, 
		<em>middle</em>, <em>high</em> and <em>extra high</em>.<br />
		To imagine how that sounds try saying the word <em>really</em> at the 
		four different pitches.&nbsp; This may help:<br />
		<img alt="really" height="105" src="../../imagesgraphics/really_pitch310.jpg" width="310" /><br />
		On the left, you should sound non-committal, the, moving to the right, 
		sound mildly surprised, very surprised and absolutely astonished 
		respectively.&nbsp; As you do so, your voice should start at a low pitch 
		and move middle and high to extra high.<br />
		You do not have to screech because the differences between the pitches 
		have only to be two or three hertz.&nbsp; You will, however, need, 
		probably, to increase the amount of energy you commit as you get to 
		higher pitches showing that pitch and stress are intimately connected.</p>

		<p>Usually, stress is connected to loudness.&nbsp; If you hit a 
		piano key harder, it will produce a louder sound but one which has the 
		same pitch.<br />
		In humans, as usual, the situation is a bit more complicated and there 
		are two issues:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>If we make an extra effort to expel more air, we will certainly 
			increase the loudness of the sound we produce.&nbsp; However, the 
			extra effort we make usually results in our also tightening (and 
			shortening) the vocal cords and that, of course, will produce a 
			heightened pitch as well.&nbsp; This means that most stressed sounds 
			are also at a higher pitch.</li>
			<li>At the same time, speakers usually also lengthen the sound when 
			they wish to stress it.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This results in three variations, not one:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Stressed sounds are louder</li>
			<li>Stressed sounds are longer</li>
			<li>Stressed sounds are at a higher pitch</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Oddly, the evidence appears to be that loudness is not the deciding 
		factor in what the hearer perceives &ndash; duration and pitch are more 
		important.<br />
		Thankfully, most authorities concur that we only need to distinguish 
		between stressed and unstressed sounds although there is clearly a whole 
		range of intermediate possibilities with the three variables working 
		together.</p><hr />

		<p>Here is where we bump into a common division into syllable- and 
		stress-timed languages.&nbsp; The argument (based on Abercrombie, 1965) 
		is that some languages (such as French) are syllable timed with each 
		syllable taking the same amount of time to be uttered.&nbsp; So we get:</p>
		<p>In French:<br />
		<img alt="french" height="55" src="../../imagesgraphics/syllable-timed.png" width="310" /><br />
		in which all syllables take the same amount of time to utter and in 
		English:<br />
		<img alt="english" height="58" src="../../imagesgraphics/stress-timed.png" width="310" /><br />
		in which each section (called a foot) has one stressed syllable and any 
		number of unstressed syllables, all of which take the same time to utter.</p>
		<p>More recent work has somewhat refined the theory, placing languages 
		on a cline from those which are strictly syllable timed to those which 
		are strictly stress timed with gradations in between.&nbsp; It is now 
		widely accepted that to refer to a stress-timed or syllable-timed 
		language is only a crude approximation of the truth.</p>
			<p>Regional differences are also apparent within languages so, for 
			example, Welsh speakers of English tend more towards syllable- than 
			stress-timed production and South American speakers of Portuguese 
			produce broadly more stress-timed language than European speakers of 
			the language.<br />

		</table>
		<p>A common analogy used to describe tones is that they occur as ripples 
		on the larger waves of intonation across the utterance.</p>
			<p>The usual division of the tone group or unit is into four bits:<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		(Prehead) (Head) <strong>Nucleus</strong> (Tail)</p>
		<p>The reason that three of those bits are in brackets is that they may 
		not always occur &ndash; the nucleus, however, is always present.<br />
		This is where things get complicated because there is less agreement 
		among authorities in the analysis.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>Nucleus</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>This is the key bit to focus on.&nbsp; It is the syllable on 
			which the main pitch change starts.&nbsp; Some people call it the 
			tonic syllable.<br />
			Although authorities differ, it's possible to distinguish 4 types of 
			pitch movement on the nucleus: fall, rise, rise-fall and fall-rise.&nbsp; 
			Complicating the issue are the three or four pitch types recognised 
			above (low, middle, high and extra high).&nbsp; Combine all those 
			and it's clear that there are 12 possible variations to consider.&nbsp; 
			The nucleus is followed by the ... </dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Tail</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>This, when it is present, continues the pitch movement 
			which occurred in the Nucleus.&nbsp; Some authorities don't even 
			recognise its existence and combine it with the Nucleus or Tonic.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Prehead and Head</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Together, these two constitute the syllables up to but not 
			including the Nuclear syllable.&nbsp; Some people don't even 
			recognise two categories here and use Pretonic to describe the whole 
			bit leading up to the Nucleus (or Tonic).&nbsp; Usually, the pitch 
			movement on this part of an utterance can be described in the same 
			way as the pitch movement on the nucleus (fall, rise, rise-fall and 
			fall-rise).&nbsp; The movement, is, however, smoother and less 
			emphatic.<br />
			There are those, Brazil <em>et al</em>, for example (1980:9), who 
			suggest that the pitch movement on the Prehead and Head, while 
			variable, is not actually significant.&nbsp; That's convenient for 
			teaching purposes because it means we can virtually ignore it and 
			focus our learners on the pitch movements occurring on the Nucleus 
			or Tonic syllable.</dd>

		<p>To repeat the data given at the outset, with some examples, 6 possible pitch changes on 
		the Nucleus are suggested.&nbsp; They are:</p>

		<p>There are two key ideas here:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Pitch or tone</strong><br />
			This refers to the 'note' of the voice being high, low or 
			somewhere in the middle.&nbsp; English uses tone as a component of 
			intonation but other languages, called tonal languages, such as 
			Mandarin or Thai, use tone to vary the meanings of words.&nbsp; The 
			classic example is the Mandarin word <em>ma. </em>&nbsp;Spoken with 
			a high tone, the word means <em>mother</em>, with a rising tone it 
			means <em>hemp</em>, with a low fall-rise tone it means <em>horse</em>, and with 
			a falling tone it means <em>to scold</em>.</li>
			<li><strong>Stress</strong><br />
			This is a combination of loudness, duration and pitch or tone.&nbsp; 
			Some languages make great use of stress to distinguish lexical 
			meaning.&nbsp; 
			For example, the Greek word πότε (with the stress on the first 
			syllable [<span class="style_underline"><strong>po</strong></span>tay]) means <em>when</em> but the word ποτέ (with the stress on 
			the second syllable [po<span class="style_underline"><strong>tay</strong></span>]) means <em>never.</em>&nbsp; English rarely does 
			this but there is a distinction between, for example, <em>en<span class="style_underline"><strong>vel</strong></span>ope</em> 
			and <span class="style_underline"> <strong><em>en</em></strong></span><em>velope</em>.<br />
			Usually, four types of stress in English are identified:<ol class="auto-style23">
				<li><strong>Tonic stress</strong>: in any unit of intonation, 
				the stress will always fall on a particular syllable but it will 
				vary, usually falling towards the end of the unit, so we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's </em><span class="style_underline"><strong><em>tal</em></strong></span><em>king.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He's talking to my </em><span class="style_underline"><strong>
				<em>bro</em></strong></span><em>ther.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He's talking to my brother about </em>
				<span class="style_underline"><strong><em>foo</em></strong></span><em>tball.</em><br />
				The original stresses don't disappear in the first two 
				sentences but become less stressed <strong>comparatively</strong>.&nbsp; 
				The assumed reason for this is that there is a clearly 
				discernible tendency in English to place new information towards 
				the end (or right) of an utterance.</li>
				<li><strong>Emphatic stress</strong> occurs when the speaker 
				wants to assign particular emphasis to a word or concept.&nbsp; 
				Often this focuses on a modal auxiliary verb or some kind of adverbial.&nbsp; 
				For example, compare:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was really <span class="style_underline"><strong>ho</strong></span>t
				</em>vs.<em> It was <span class="style_underline"><strong>real</strong></span>ly 
				hot<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He told me I must <span class="style_underline"><strong>do</strong></span> 
				it </em>vs. <em>He told me I <span class="style_underline">
				<strong>mus</strong></span>t do it</em></li>
				<li><strong>C<span class="auto-style24">ontrastive stress</span></strong> 
				is what we hear when the speaker wants to distinguish one 
				concept from another.&nbsp; So we get, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They </em>
				<span class="style_underline"><em>ar<strong>ri</strong>ved</em></span> 
				together (not left together)<br />
				vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrived </em>
				<span class="style_underline"><em>tog<strong>e</strong>ther</em></span> 
				(not separately).<br />
				Contrastive stress is often called special stress.</li>
				<li><strong>New information stress</strong> often occurs in 
				questions, especially <em>wh-question</em>s, so we get a dialogue 
				something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did you <span class="style_underline"><strong>go</strong></span>?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I went to the <strong><span class="style_underline">cin</span></strong>ema.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				What did you <span class="style_underline"><strong>see</strong></span>?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I saw that soppy <strong><span class="style_underline">love 
				story</span></strong>.</em><br />
				and so on.&nbsp; Each question and each answer focuses the 
				stress on the new information.</li>
				<li><strong>Theme and rheme and stress</strong><br />
				The conventional sentence stress and the highest pitch and 
				largest pitch movement occurs conventionally in English on the 
				last content word (not function word) of the rheme of a sentence 
				so, for example in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because she wanted to meet his mother, she travelled up to 
				London<br />
				</em>the greatest pitch movement (a rise-fall) occurs on the final 
				part of the rheme, <em>London</em>.<br />
				If we reverse the clauses, the pitch movement stays in the same 
				place but, of course, it will now fall on <em>mother</em> 
				because that is now the last content word in the rheme of the 
				sentence.&nbsp; It looks like this:<br />
			<img alt="contours" height="83" src="../../imagesgraphics/theme_rheme_intonation3.jpg" width="310" /><br />
				So, reversing the clauses in a complex sentence like this 
				involves making sure that the stress remains where it belongs.&nbsp; 
				Raising one clause or the other to the theme position also has 
				communicative implications, of course, because the natural 
				follow-on statement from the first example will concern <em>
				London</em> and from the second example, it will concern <em>her 
				mother</em>.<br />
				There is a little more on this in
				<a href="../discourse/theme_rheme.html" target="_blank">the 
				guide to theme-rheme structures</a> (new tab).</li>

		<p>The following is drawn from a key text by Wells,2006.&nbsp; Wells has six essential functions 
		(and we have added one).&nbsp; The 
		examples are not from Wells.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>attitudinal function<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="smoking" height="133" src="../../images/woman_smoking200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>This is the kind of thing we started with.&nbsp; For example, if 
			you say <em>Good afternoon</em> with a flat intonation, falling 
			slightly at the end, you will 
			probably sound like you are starting a serious business meeting and 
			are keen to get on to the agenda.&nbsp; It requires no response.<br />
			If you say it with a 
			rise-fall intonation, falling on <em>noon</em>, after rising on <em>
			after</em>, you will sound more positive and welcoming.<br />
			It looks like this:<br />
			<img alt="good afternoon" height="96" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonation_gafternoon.png" width="200" /><br />
			Attitudinal function reflects the emotional state of the speaker and 
			may show anger, shock, sarcasm, irony and so on.&nbsp; This is what 
			is generally referred to as the tone of an utterance.</dd>
			<dt><strong>grammatical function<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="hat" height="133" src="../../images/hat_on_stick200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>We can make a question in English only by changing the 
			intonation pattern.&nbsp; So we can have:<br />
			<img alt="questions" height="124" src="../../imagesgraphics/questions.png" width="200" /></dd>
			<dd>A number of languages (such as Greek) rely solely on intonation 
			to make a question in spoken language.<br />
			Many would also claim that a question requiring a yes/no answer will 
			have rising intonation along the sentence.&nbsp; So, for example<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you coming to the meeting?<br />
			</em>will rise on the word <em>
			meeting</em> to indicate that the speaker needs a yes/no response.<br />
			However, on a <em>wh-question</em> requiring more information from the 
			listener, such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What time's the meeting?<br />
			</em>the intonation 
			falls on the final word.&nbsp; The effect is something like:<br />
			<img alt="question intonation" height="92" src="../../imagesgraphics/meeting_intonation.png" width="200" /><br />
			We also use tone to distinguish phrase constituents rather in the 
			way that we use punctuation in written language.&nbsp; So, for 
			example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I spoke to the man behind the bar</em><br />
			can have two meanings depending on where the pause and tone changes 
			occur.<br />
			If we have, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke to the man</em> <em><strong>↓</strong></em> 
			[pause] <em>behind the bar</em><br />
			we are stating that <em><strong>behind the bar</strong></em> is 
			where I spoke to him but if we have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I spoke to the man behind the bar <strong>↑<br />
			</strong></em>with no pauses, then we are identifying the <strong>
			<em>man</em></strong> by where he was.<br />
			Disambiguating which meaning is intended by pausing and tone shifts 
			are what Wells refers to as the demarcative function of intonation.<br />
			This also occurs with relative pronoun clauses in English so the 
			distinction between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cats which were adopted by the old lady 
			lived happily for many years</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cats, which were adopted by the old lady, 
			lived happily for many years</em><br />
			can be made by a falling tone and slight pause to signify the commas 
			used in written texts.&nbsp; The tone or pitch used on the 
			non-defining relative clause will also often fall and the clause 
			will be more quickly spoken than the rest of the sentence, 
			signalling the fact that this is purely omissible and extra 
			information rather than constituting part of the subject of the main 
			verb.<br />
			This is also a discourse function and discussed again below.</dd>
			<dt><strong>focusing<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="focus" height="133" src="../../images/focus_camera200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>This occurs when the speaker wants to signal what is new and 
			what is shared information.&nbsp; For example, if we put a falling 
			tone on the word <em>pen </em>in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a &darr;pen on the 
			table<br />
			</em>we are answering the question<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's on the table?<br />
			</em>but if we let the tone fall on <em>table </em>as in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's 
			a pen on the table↓<br />
			</em>we are answering the question<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have 
			you got something to write with?</em> (or something similar).<br />
			It might look like this:<br />
			<img alt="pen table" height="89" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonation_pen_table.png" width="200" /><br />
			This is a form of markedness in some analyses and there is
			<a href="../lexicogrammar/markedness.html" target="_blank">a guide to markedness 
			</a>on this site.<br />
			They important point is that we use tone to background some 
			information and mark other information for emphasis, newness or 
			importance.&nbsp; Wells refers to this as a pragmatic function of 
			intonation and states that it is <span class="style_black"><em>
			perhaps the function most readily taught in the EFL classroom.</em></span> 
			(op cit:11)</dd>
			<dt><strong>discourse function<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="talk" height="133" src="../../images/talk_silhouette200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>We use intonation to show how ideas are connected.&nbsp; 
			Subordinate clauses, for example, have lower pitch and are spoken 
			more quickly than the main clause.&nbsp; So we can get:<br />
			<img alt="umbrella" height="41" src="../../imagesgraphics/umbrella.png" width="250" /><br />
			</dd>
			<dd>Another example, often asserted, is that intonation allows the 
			hearer to distinguish between defining and non-defining pronoun relative 
			clauses.&nbsp; So we get:<br />
			<img alt="relative clauses" height="97" src="../../imagesgraphics/boys.png" width="250" /></dd>
			<dd>signalling the commas in the second example by dropping the tone 
			and speaking more quickly.&nbsp; See
			<a href="../phrases_clauses_sentences/relative_pronouns.html" target="_blank">the 
			guide to relative pronoun clauses</a> if this distinction is unclear to you.<br />
			The discourse function also plays a central role in turn-taking cues 
			in interactions.&nbsp; For more, see
			<a href="../discourse/turn-taking.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
			turn-taking</a>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>disambiguation function<br />
			<img alt="cat bird" height="133" src="../../images/animals_cat_bird200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
			<dd>This is an area allied to the last and is the one we have added.<br />
			We saw there that 
			intonation, particularly with regard to where the nucleus of tone 
			units occurs and what constitutes a separate tone unit is one way in 
			which a defining relative clause can be distinguished from a 
			non-defining one.&nbsp; Otherwise, both would sound the same and it 
			would lead to ambiguity in the mind of the hearer.<br />
			Here are some more examples of the way that intonation can 
			disambiguate what are otherwise indistinguishable ideas:<ul class="greybullet">
			<li><em>I washed the car in the 
						corner<br />
			</em>In this written sentence it is not possible to determine 
			whether the car in question was the one in the corner or was washed 
			there.&nbsp; In spoken English, however, we can, if we are careful, 
			express and detect the difference:<br />
			We can phrase the sentence in two ways:<table cellspacing="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2" class="auto-style136">1</td>
					<td class="auto-style5"><em>I</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style19"><em>washed the</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style139"><em><strong>CAR</strong></em></td>
					<td class="auto-style19"><em>in the corner</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style144">pre-head</td>
					<td class="auto-style138">head</td>
					<td class="auto-style141">nucleus</td>
					<td class="auto-style138">tail</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2" class="auto-style133">2</td>
					<td class="auto-style143"><em>I</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style135"><em>washed the car in the </em></td>

					<td class="auto-style135">&nbsp;</td>

					<td class="auto-style19">head</td>
					<td class="auto-style139">nucleus</td>
					<td class="auto-style19">-</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			Phrasing the clause in the first way determines that it is the car 
			which was in the corner.&nbsp; Phrasing it the second way signals 
			that the washing happened in the corner.</li>
			<li><em>I didn't go to the party because she might be there</em><br />
			is another ambiguous statement when it is written and means either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not go to party at all and the reason 
			for that was that she might be there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the party but not because she might be there</em><br />
			Again, we can make the meaning clear by inserting a nuclear stress 
			on the right element:<table cellspacing="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2" class="auto-style136">1</td>
					<td class="auto-style5"><em>I didn't go</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style19"><em>to the party because</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style139"><em><strong>SHE</strong></em></td>
					<td class="auto-style19"><em>might be there</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style144">pre-head</td>
					<td class="auto-style138">head</td>
					<td class="auto-style141">nucleus</td>
					<td class="auto-style138">tail</td>

					<td class="auto-style19">head</td>
					<td class="auto-style139">nucleus</td>
					<td class="auto-style19">-</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			In version 1, the meaning is that the speaker did not go for fear of 
			meeting her.<br />
			In version 2, the meaning is that the speaker went for a reason 
			other than meeting her.</li>
			<li><em>He didn't think the money had been stolen</em><br />
			Here we have a rather unusual case because most people reading this 
			would assume only one interpretation:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>His opinion was that the money had not been stolen.</em><br />
			However, we can phrase and stress the sentence in two ways:<table cellspacing="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2" class="auto-style136">1</td>
					<td class="auto-style5"><em>-</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style19"><em>He didn't</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style139"><em><strong>THINK</strong></em></td>
					<td class="auto-style19"><em>the money had been stolen</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style144">pre-head</td>
					<td class="auto-style138">head</td>
					<td class="auto-style141">nucleus</td>
					<td class="auto-style138">tail</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2" class="auto-style133">2</td>
					<td class="auto-style143"><em>He didn't think</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style135"><em>the money had been</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style140"><em><strong>STOLEN</strong></em></td>
					<td class="auto-style135"><em></em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style142">pre-head</td>
					<td class="auto-style19">head</td>
					<td class="auto-style139">nucleus</td>
					<td class="auto-style19">-</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			and in the first case, we will not be surprised in the speaker went 
			on with:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He </em><strong><em>KNEW</em></strong><em> it had.</em><br />
			One reason for the ambiguity is the tendency in English to transfer 
			the negation from the logical place (the second clause) to the first 
			clause.<br />
			In most other languages, the thought would be expressed as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He thought the money hadn't been stolen<br />
			</em>in which there is no ambiguity.</li>
		</ul>
			There is <a href="../lexicogrammar/ambiguity.html" target="_blank">a 
			guide to ambiguity</a> in general which considers this and other 
			ways of disambiguating meaning, including intonation.</dd>
			<dt><strong>psychological function<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="masked" height="133" src="../../images/masked_man200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>This refers to how we perceive sense units in utterances.&nbsp; 
			In lists, for example, we use something like<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought some &uarr;butter, 
			some &uarr;jam, a loaf of &uarr;bread and a pint of &darr;milk.<br />
			</em>Here's another example of how pausing and the accompanying 
			intonation is affected by the speaker's perception of sense units.&nbsp; 
			Compare:<ol>
				<li><em>The people who under↓stood</em> [PAUSE] <em>quickly grasped 
			the argument.</em></li>
				<li><em>The people who understood ↓quickly </em>[PAUSE] <em>grasped 
			the argument.</em></li>
			</ol>
			In sentence 1., we know some people understood but the adverb 
			<em>quickly</em> applies to the grasping of the point, not the understanding 
			(which may have been slow).<br />
			In sentence 2., we know that people understood, too, but only the 
			ones who quickly understood grasped the point.<br />
			The issue is to do with phrase constituents, to which there is 			
			<a href="../phrases_clauses_sentences/constituents.html" target="_blank">a guide on 
			this site</a>.&nbsp; In sentence 1., we have the verb phrase <em>
			understood</em> <em>quickly </em>and in sentence 2., the verb phrase 
			is <em>quickly grasped</em>.<br />
			Strictly speaking, verb phrases consist only of verb forms rather 
			than verbs plus adverbials but that does not matter for the purposes 
			of this because adverbs are often embedded in verb phrases and the 
			whole becomes a single sense unit.<br />
			Of course, the second sentence can be disambiguated in writing and 
			speech by moving the adverb so we can have:<ol>
				<li><em>The people who quickly understood</em> <em>grasped 
			the argument.</em></li>
				<li><em>The people who understood grasped 
			the argument quickly.</em></li>
			</ol>
			The psychological function also explains why we memorise strings by 
			splitting them into tone units so, in English, a telephone number 
			such as <em>284695677899</em> will be broken down as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 284↑-695↑-677↑-899↓</em><br />
			to make it possible (or at least easier) to remember.</dd>
			<dt><strong>indexical function<br />
			<img alt="me" height="133" src="../../images/woman_who_me200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
			<dd>This refers to intonation acting as a marker of personal or 
			social identity.&nbsp; For example, newspaper sellers use a 
			particular intonation pattern, as do newsreaders and people 
			delivering lectures or sermons.&nbsp; It has also been argued that 
			the high-rise terminal, where all statements sound like questions 
			with a rise at the end, is typical of certain social and age groups 
			in Britain.&nbsp; It has even been suggested that the tendency is 
			caused by exposure to Australian television soap operas in which the pattern is 
			common.</dd>

		Do note imagine, however, that our reactions and attitudes are signalled

		<p>
		Intonation does play a communicative role, of course, but <strong>in 
		conjunction with</strong> the setting, the roles of speaker and 
		listener, their intentions and their shared information in the setting.</p>

		</table>
		<p>The communicative importance of all this is:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>where the speaker decides to place the Nucleus in an utterance 
			and </li>
			<li>which of the 6 pitch changes is used</li>
		</ol>
		<p>For example, consider the utterance:</p>
		<h4><em class="auto-style48"><span class="auto-style18"><strong><a name="1"></a>
		She's going to see that film</strong></span></em></h4>
		<p>Say this sentence aloud, doing three things:</p>
		<ul class="smallgreybullet">
			<li>moving the Nucleus around from item to item along the utterance.&nbsp; 
			In other words, making the tone shift occur on each element of the 
			sentence in turn.</li>
			<li>raising the pitch of the Nucleus</li>
			<li>changing 
		the pitch movement in one of the four ways: fall, rise, rise-fall, 
			fall-rise</li>
		</ul>
		<p>and you'll soon hear the differences.<br />For example:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the Nucleus on the first syllable (<em>She's</em>) 
		and use a sharply rising pitch movement.&nbsp; You'll get a sentence which 
		sounds like an astonished question asking for the hearer to confirm its 
		truth.</li>
			<li>Try again with the Nucleus on <em>go</em>: and a rise-fall, 
		you'll get a sentence that sounds as if the speaker is confirming her 
		fixed resolution to see the film.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Try doing those two and then writing down the way you see the intonation 
		using arrows to show pitch movements and writing bits of the utterance 
		above or below a base line to show pitch and
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'intonationkey',0,'style.visibility','visible')">then click here</a> 
		for a picture of how it might look.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="key" height="275" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonation_key.png" width="465" /></p>
		<p>
		Try a few more of these for yourself and identify how the sentence will 
		sound to a listener.</p>
		<p>
		This is the kind of thing which can be 
		presented and practised but do not imagine, however, that our reactions 
		and attitudes are signalled only by the intonation we use.&nbsp; Far 
		from it.&nbsp; If you or your materials imply anything of the sort, your 
		students will be seriously misled.&nbsp; For example, the intonation in 
		the first diagram above could just as easily show extreme anger as 
		astonishment.<br />
		The point is:</p>

			<span class="auto-style4"><em>There are no arguments for teaching 
		intonation in terms of attitude, because the rules for use are too 
		obscure, too amorphous, and too easily refutable.</em></span><br />
