		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Phonetics</strong></dt>
	<dd>is the study of all speech sounds and is applicable to all 
		languages.&nbsp; It is concerned with how we produce sounds, how they 
		are transmitted physically and how they are perceived and decoded.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Phonology</strong></dt>
			<dd>is to do with the sounds of a specific language rather than all 
			human speech and it is this which concerns us here.</dd>
			<dt><strong>The phoneme</strong></dt>
			<dd>is the basic sound unit of a language.&nbsp; We combine phonemes 
			into morphemes (meaning units) and into words.&nbsp; The phoneme is 
			written with its symbol between two slash marks: /t/ = the 't' sound 
			in <em>la<span class="style_underline">t</span>er</em>.<br />
			The phoneme is an ideal type for the sound it represents.&nbsp; 
			Individual speakers may pronounce certain phonemes quite variably 
			but native speakers will generally recognise which phoneme is being used 
			(and make a mental adjustment if it varies from what they produce).&nbsp; In this sense, 
			phonemes are a way of digitalising the information contained in the 
			sound stream.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			Although /b/ and /p/ are distinct phonemes in English, with the 
			first voiced and the second unvoiced, the amount of voicing is not 
			an on-off phenomenon because in some environments voicing will be 
			more energetically done than in others.&nbsp; Compare, for example, 
			the voicing on the /b/ sound in <em>rubber</em> and the same sound 
			at the end of <em>pub</em>.&nbsp; In the former, voicing is at the 
			more extreme end of the cline from /p/ to /b/ than it is in the 
			second case.&nbsp; Nevertheless, native speaker hearers will easily 
			note the difference between <em>pup </em>and <em>pub </em>even 
			though the amount of voicing on the /b/ is quite minimal.<br />
			Phonemes may be better described as sets of allophone (see below) 
			than as single sounds.&nbsp; The fact that some of them are variably 
			pronounced is not semantically significant.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Consonants</strong></dt>
			<dd>When you produce a sound by completely or partially blocking 
			the air flow through the vocal tract, you produce a consonant.&nbsp; For 
			example, if you block and then release air through pressing your 
			lips together, you will produce the sound /p/.&nbsp; If you block 
			the back of your mouth by raising your tongue, you will produce /k/.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Vowels</strong></dt>
			<dd>If you produce a sound without blocking the air flow you 
			will make a vowel such as the 'a' in <em>cat</em> (/k√¶t/).&nbsp; The 
			quality of the sound is affected by where your tongue is vertically 
			and horizontally in the mouth and whether your lips are rounded or 
			not.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Semi-vowels</strong></dt>
			<dd>are sounds which are produced like vowels but actually don't 
			function like them.&nbsp; An example is the /j/ sound at the 
			beginning of the word <em>yet</em>.&nbsp; The <em>y</em> letter 
			represents a consonant in this case but at the end of the word <em>
			fly</em>, it is a vowel and transcribed as /fla…™ÃØ/.&nbsp; The letter
			<em>w</em> also has this characteristic: at the beginning of <em>was</em> 
			it is close to being a consonant (called a glide, in the trade) but 
			in the centre of <em>cower</em> it is a vowel sound so the 
			transcription of <em>was cowering</em> is /w…ôz Ààka ä…ôr.…™≈ã/.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Markedness</strong></dt>
			<dd>In some theoretical approaches, it is asserted that certain 
			phonemes are more heavily marked than others.&nbsp; For example, the 
			unvoiced consonants (/p/, /t/, /k/ etc.) are less marked, and 
			therefore more ubiquitous across languages than their voiced 
			equivalents (/b/, /d/, /…°/ etc.).&nbsp; The significance is that 
			these marked phonemes are more difficult to acquire because they 
			are not common to most languages, and deserve more attention.&nbsp; 
			Vowels, too may betray the same distinctions with high back vowels 
			being less marked than low front vowels.&nbsp; For more, see
			<a href="../lexicogrammar/markedness.html" target="_blank">the guide to markedness</a> 
			(new tab).</dd>
			<dt><strong>Minimal pairs</strong></dt>
			<dd>are words which differ in meaning because of a change to a 
			single phoneme.&nbsp; In fact, this is part of the definition of a 
			phoneme.<br />
			For example, the words, <em>cat</em> and <em>hat</em> are only 
			distinguished by the first phoneme; /k/ in the first case, /h/ in the 
			second.&nbsp; In English, these are minimal pairs so the sounds are 
			phonemes.&nbsp; Some languages do not recognise the distinction 
			between /h/ and /k/ in this way so in those languages the words are 
			not minimal pairs and the sounds are not phonemes.<br />
			For example, /p/ and /b/ can readily be seen to be phonemes in 
			English by applying the minimal pairs test.&nbsp; We know that <em>
			bat</em> and <em>pat</em> are different words with different 
			meanings so the sounds, /p/ and /b/, are phonemes.&nbsp; In some languages (e.g., 
			most varieties of Arabic) changing /b/ to /p/ will have no effect on the meaning of a 
			word so in those languages the sounds are not phonemes.<br />
			To see how minimal pairs may be exploited in the classroom, see
			<a href="troublesome_sounds.html" target="_blank">the guide to teaching troublesome 
			sounds</a> (new tab).</dd>
			<dt><strong>Allophone</strong></dt>
			<dd>If you say <em>kid </em>and<em> skid </em>aloud you will have 
			produced two different allophones.&nbsp; In the first, there is a 
			slight aspirant or /h/ sound following the /k/; in the second it is 
			absent.&nbsp; These sounds are different but they are not phonemes.&nbsp; 
			If you add the aspirant to the sound in <em>skid</em> you will not 
			make a different word although it will sound odd.&nbsp; In some 
			languages, the two sounds <em>are</em> phonemes and people will understand a 
			different meaning if the /k/ is aspirated or not.&nbsp; These 
			allophones are written either like this: /k/ or like this: /k ∞/.&nbsp; 
			The other aspirated / non-aspirated pairs in English are /p/, aspirated to /p ∞/ and /t/ produced as /t ∞/.<br />
			The other common pair of allophones in English affects the 
			pronunciation of /l/.&nbsp; The light /l/ sound appears, for 
			example, at the beginning of <em>light</em> and the dark sound, 
			transcribed phonetically as […´] appears at the end of a word like
			<em>full</em>.<br />
			Allophonic variation is not an on-off phenomenon because there are 
			variations, for example, in the amount of aspiration given to some 
			sounds and the amount of voicing to others on a cline from no 
			aspiration to full aspiration and no voicing to full voicing.<br />
			Sets of allophones form single phonemes, in other words.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Voicing</strong></dt>
			<dd>describes how phonemes may be different depending on whether the 
			vocal cords vibrate or not at the time of pronunciation.&nbsp; For 
			example, the /k/ sound is made without voicing but the /…°/ sound is 
			made with the mouth parts in the same place but with voice added.&nbsp; 
			If you put your hand on your throat and say the words <em>sue </em>
			and<em> zoo</em>, you will see what is meant and feel a slight 
			vibration on the second word (/s/ is unvoiced but 
			/z/ is voiced).<br />
			Voicing is not an either-or distinction.&nbsp; There is a cline from 
			the fully unvoiced to the fully voiced.&nbsp; For more, see the 
			guide to consonants.<br />
			Unvoiced sounds are described as <strong>fortis </strong>sounds and 
			voiced sounds as <strong>lenis</strong>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Intonation</strong></dt>
			<dd>is the way in which the speaker's pitch (or tone) rises and 
			falls to signal, e.g., a question, surprise, disappointment etc.&nbsp; 
			It is frequently shown in transcriptions using arrows: <strong>&uarr;&darr;&rarr;</strong> 
			etc.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Stress</strong></dt>
			<dd>is the term used to describe the emphasis speakers give to 
			certain syllables in a word or certain words in a sentence.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			Word stress: when the stress falls on the first syllable in <em>
			export</em> the word is a noun <em>(<strong>ex</strong>port),</em> 
			when it falls on the second, it's a verb (<em>ex<strong>port</strong></em>).<br />
			The conventional way to mark stress in transcriptions, used 
			throughout this site and by most authorities, is to place a short, 
			raised vertical line before the stressed syllable (Àà).&nbsp; 
			Secondary stress is denoted by a short lowered vertical line (Àå).&nbsp; 
			So, for example, the word <em>unbelievably</em> is transcribed as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /Àå ån.b…™.ÀàliÀê.v…ô.bli/<br />
			with the secondary stress marked on the first syllable and the 
			primary stress marked on the third syllable.<br />
			You may encounter other ways to mark stress but this is the 
			convention used almost everywhere.<br />
			(There is an exercise on word stress for teachers and advanced 
			learners on this site.&nbsp;
			<a href="../../initial/teaching/identifying_word_stress.html" target="_blank">
			Click here to go there</a>.)<br />
			Sentence stress in English usually falls on the new information 
			being provided and that, for English, generally comes towards the 
			end of the utterance.&nbsp; So for example in the exchange:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: <em>What did you do <strong>yesterday</strong>?</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: <em>I went to see <strong>my mother</strong>.</em><br />
			the first speaker will normally stress <em>yesterday</em> and the 
			second speaker will normally stress <em>my mother</em> because that 
			is the key information in both cases.<br />
			We can, of course, stress other elements in order to emphasise their 
			importance.&nbsp; This is called special stress.&nbsp; For example, try reading these sentences aloud, stressing the 
			word in <strong>bold</strong>:<ol class="auto-style28">
				<li> <em>I went to London with my </em> <strong><em>brother</em></strong> (i.e., not 
			another person)</li>
				<li><em>I went to </em> <strong><em>London</em></strong><em> with my brother</em> (i.e., not to 
			another place)</li>
				<li> <strong><em>I</em></strong><em> went to London with my brother 
			</em>(i.e., it was 
			not someone else who went with my brother)</li>
				<li> <em>I went to London with </em> <strong><em>my</em></strong><em> brother</em> (i.e., not 
			someone else's brother)</li>
			</ol>
			</dd>
			<dt><strong>Stress and syllable timing</strong></dt>
			<dd>The following is the theory.<br />
			There are, it is claimed, two fundamental forms of stressing.<br />
			In some languages, such as French, Italian, Spanish, Cantonese and 
			Mandarin, every syllable is <em>perceived</em> as taking up the same 
			amount of time.&nbsp; This is the so-called 'machine gun' sound of 
			these languages.&nbsp; So we get:<br /><em><span class="auto-style4">I ... went ... to ... Lon ... don ... with 
			... my ... bro ... ther</span></em><br />
			That's <strong>syllable timing</strong>.<br />
			In other languages, notably English, Dutch, Persian languages and Scandinavian 
			languages, some syllables take longer to utter than others and this 
			results in a reduction of the syllables in between.&nbsp; So we get<br /><em><span class="auto-style4">Iwentto ... <strong>L o n </strong>d'n ... 
			withmy ... <strong>b r o</strong> the(r)</span><br />
			</em>That's <strong>stress timing</strong>.<br />For this reason, the preposition <em>to</em> is not pronounced 
			in its full form as /tuÀê/ (rhyming with 'two' and 'too') but with a 
			weak form of the vowel /t…ô/.&nbsp; The funny, upside-down 'e' is 
			called a <strong>schwa</strong> and is the commonest <strong>weak 
			form</strong> in English.&nbsp; Additionally, <em>my</em> is often 
			reduced to <em>m'</em> and so on and in most varieties of British 
			English the final /r/ sound on <em>brother</em> is not pronounced.<br />
			Be aware that even if this distinction exists, it is not an 
			either-or one.&nbsp; Languages will vary along a cline from 
			syllable- to stress-timing tendencies.<br />
			There is, in fact, a third form of timing: Mora timing.&nbsp; In 
			Japanese, e.g., a vowel (V) takes the same time to utter as a 
			consonant (C) plus a vowel so V takes the same time as CV and CVV 
			takes twice as long as CV.&nbsp; Slovak is often considered also to 
			be a Mora-timed language.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Tone unit</strong></dt>
			<dd>Tone units are also called intonation contours and tone groups.&nbsp; 
			They are also called sense units because identifying them aids 
			understanding the sense of what is heard.&nbsp; Authorities do not 
			agree about how the tone unit is divided (or even what it's called) 
			but most would agree that the most important part of it is the 
			nucleus or tonic syllable where the key information the speaker 
			wishes to convey is found.<br />
			For example, we can divide a sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke to the man outside the house</em><br />
			into two distinct patterns of tone units, separated by <strong>||</strong>, 
			like this:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke to </em><strong>||</strong><em> the 
			man </em><strong>||</strong><em> outside the house</em><br />
			which convey the fact that where she spoke to the man is important 
			or we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke to </em><strong>||</strong><em> the 
			man outside the house</em><br />
			which convey the fact that we now know which man it was that she 
			spoke to.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Weak forms</strong></dt>
			<dd>Because English is a stress-timed language (allegedly), many 
			vowels are reduced in rapid, connected speech so, e.g., <em>for</em> 
			is pronounced /f…ô/ (not /f…îÀê/), <em>been </em>is heard as /b…™n/<em>
			</em>(not /biÀên/), <em>we</em> is heard as /w…™/ and so on.<br />

			forms in English,<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_Weak_forms.pdf" target="_blank">
