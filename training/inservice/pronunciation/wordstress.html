			<h1>Word stress (/ˈwɜːd <strong>&#716;</strong>stres/)</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="stress" height="207" src="../../images/sign_stress310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>There are two small marks in the heading for this guide that you 
			need to be aware of before we begin: <strong>&#712;</strong> and <strong>&#716;</strong>.<br />
			These are 
			the conventional ways to show stress in words and used in what follows.&nbsp; The raised mark (<strong>&#712;</strong>) is shown 
			immediately before the stressed syllable and the lowered mark (<strong>&#716;</strong>) 
			comes before the secondary (or less obvious) stress.<br />
			For example, in the word <em>pronunciation</em>, there are two 
			stresses (a secondary one on the second syllable and a main stress on the 
			penultimate syllable:<em> </em><span class="style_black">/prə.ˌnʌn.sɪ.ˈeɪʃ.n̩/</span>.&nbsp; 
			It sounds like pro<span class="auto-style13"><strong>NUN</strong></span>ci<strong>A</strong>T<span class="auto-style13">ION</span>.<br />
			If you are not familiar with phonemic transcription, do not worry 
			now.&nbsp; In what follows, we will be using very little except 
			these two stress indicators.&nbsp; All transcriptions are
			<span class="style_black">in black</span>.<br />
			There is <a href="../../courses/transcription1/transcription.html">a 
			short course in learning to transcribe English sounds phonemically</a> 
			on this site.</p>
			<p>Where's the main stress in the following?&nbsp; Click on the 
			table when you have marked it in your head.</p>
			<p>
			<img id="img1" alt="word stress" height="166" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'../../imagesgraphics/wordstress2.png')" src="../../imagesgraphics/wordstress1.png" width="200" /></p>
			<p>As you can see, we can stress the first, second, third or fourth 
			syllable on words in English (and even the fifth or sixth) and there are, unfortunately, no 
			hard-and-fast rules for which is right.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="stress" height="166" src="../../images/man_weightlifter250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>What is stress?</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It is often assumed that stressed syllables are simply 
				spoken in a louder voice but that's only partly right.&nbsp; 
				There are, in fact, three elements which vary:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Loudness</strong>: how much force is used when 
				saying the syllable</li>
				<li><strong>Pitch</strong>: stressed syllables are often 
				pronounced in a higher tone</li>
				<li><strong>Length</strong>: stressed syllables take longer to 
				utter than unstressed ones</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You'll find a little more on pitch and tone in
			<a href="intonationkey.html">the guide to key concepts in intonation</a>.</p>
			<p>We also need to be aware of the concept of unstress.<br />
			Clearly, if we can have stressed syllables in a word, the other 
			syllables will, by definition be unstressed.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			In a word like <em>geographical</em>, we have a primary stress on 
			the third syllable (graph) and a secondary stress on the first 
			syllable (ge).<br />
			The stress pattern looks like this: <span class="auto-style13">
			<strong>GE</strong></span>o<strong>GRA</strong>phical.&nbsp; This 
			word transcribes as <span class="style_black">/ˌdʒɪə.ˈɡræ.fɪk.l̩/</span> 
			and even if the phonemic transcription is mysterious to you, you 
			need to notice two important phenomena:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The pronunciation of the second syllable is not an 'o' as in 
				open but is reduced to a very short sound
				<span class="style_black">/ə/</span> which is the same sound as 
				begins words like <span class="style_underline"><em>a</em></span><em>bout</em> 
				and <span class="style_underline"><em>a</em></span><em>live</em>.</li>
				<li>The pronunciation of the final syllable is transcribed as
				<span class="style_black">/k.l̩/ </span>showing that there is no 
				vowel at all between the <span class="style_black">/k/</span> 
				sound made by 'c' and the <span class="style_black">/l/ </span>
				sound made by the letter 'l'.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These two changes to the sound expected from the spelling of the 
			word happen because they occur in the unstressed syllables of the 
			word.&nbsp; Weak forms like the <span class="style_black">/ə/ </span>
			and the loss of a vowel as in <span class="style_black">/k.l̩/</span> 
			can only occur in unstressed syllables.&nbsp; Compare this with, 
			e.g.:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>A: Did you say biographical?</em></li>
				<li><em>B: No.&nbsp; I said </em><strong><em>ge</em></strong><em>ographical!</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this, the first syllable is now taking the main stress and the 
			pronunciation of the 'o' assumes the form of the 'o' in <em>go</em> or 
			<em>show</em> (<span class="style_black">/ɡəʊ/, 
			/ʃəʊ/</span>).&nbsp; The secondary stress has now moved to the third 
			syllable.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="random" height="166" src="../../images/dice_5_250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Is stress entirely random?</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>No.&nbsp; There are some rules and we are going to look at them 
			here.&nbsp; It will however, remain true that in many cases the 
			stress in a multisyllable word cannot be guessed or deduced from 
			any rule at all so our learners will need all the help they can get.<br />
			A simple rule of thumb, and certainly the way to guess, is to assume 
			that any common two-syllable word in English will be stressed on the 
			first syllable (unless it's a verb, when the stress falls on the 
			second syllable, conventionally [see below]).</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img height="166" src="../../images/roots250.jpg" width="250" alt="roots" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Word roots</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Words which have early roots in English are the simplest to stress 
			because the stress generally remains fixed regardless of how many 
			affixes we use with them.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style4">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">&#712;please</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">&#712;pleasant</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">un&#712;pleasant</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">un&#712;pleasantly</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">un&#712;pleasantness</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">dis&#712;please</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">dis&#712;pleasing</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">dis&#712;pleasingly</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">&#712;stand</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">under&#712;stand</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">under&#712;standing</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">misunder&#712;stand</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">misunder&#712;standing</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The problem for learners, of course, is to recognise such words 
			and that is not easy.<br />
			Learners from Germanic language backgrounds often have fewer 
			difficulties because they can look for cognates and these will 
			normally be words which maintain the stress.<br />
			Those from Italic language backgrounds can often 
			make guesses because of a lack of a cognate in their languages.<br />
			Those from non-European language backgrounds have no such resources 
			to call on but words like these are often short, describe simple 
			concepts and are non-academic or non-technical.<br />
			That helps a little.<br />
			An even simpler rule is that in English <strong>we rarely stress an 
			affix:</strong></p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style4">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5">disaˈppoint</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">re&#712;cover</td>

				<dd>Nouns formed with the suffixes <em>-age, -ful, -ing, -ly, -y, -ment, -ness

				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5">ˈpostage</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">ˈhopeful</td>
					<td class="auto-style5">ˈdriving</td>

				</table>
				</dd></dl>
				<p>Words which are more formal, academic or technical often have 
			their roots in Latin or Greek and with these words the stress may shift with 
			affixation but all is not lost because there are some rules.<br />
				It is also true that many thousands of words fall into these 
				categories and, once learnt, the rules can be applied with 
				almost 100% success.</p>

	Notes:<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>Participle adjectives take the same stress as the verb 
				(because that is how they are formed) so we get, e.g., for the 
				word <em>record</em>, <span class="style_black">/ˈrek.ɔːd/</span> (noun), 
				and <span class="style_black">/rek.ˈɔːd/ </span>
				<span class="style_blue">(verb) and</span><span class="style_black"> /rɪˈk.ɔː.dɪd/
				</span><span class="style_blue">(adjective)</span>.</li>
				<li>The verb stress falls on the second <strong>or</strong> the last syllable (some 
				are three syllable words).&nbsp; For example, in the list above 
				there are three: <em>underline, intercept </em>and<em> envelope</em>.&nbsp; 
				The pronunciations are:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈʌn.də.laɪn/ (noun) to /ˌʌn.də.ˈlaɪn/ 
				(verb)<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				/ˈɪn.tə.sept/ (noun) to /ˌɪn.tə.ˈsept/ (verb)<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				/ˈen.və.ləʊp/ (noun) to /ɪn.ˈve.ləp/ (verb)<br />
				</span>but there 
				are also other changes to the vowel sounds.</li>
				<li>One verb-noun pair is missing from the list above: <em>
				reˈfuse</em> (a verb meaning <em>decline </em>or<em> reject</em>) 
				and <em>ˈrefuse</em> (a noun meaning <em>rubbish</em>).&nbsp; 
				The words are not closely connected in meaning, the 
				pronunciation of the 's' alters from <span class="style_black">
				/z/</span> in the verb to <span class="style_black">/s/</span> in the noun and the pronunciation 
				of the vowel in the first syllable changes from 
				<span class="style_black">/ɪ/</span> in the verb 
				to <span class="style_black">/e/</span> in the noun:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /rɪ.ˈfjuːz/</span> (verb) and
				<span class="style_black">/ˈrɛfjuːs/ </span>(noun)<br />
				Both words derive ultimately from the Old French verb <em>
				refuser</em> but many would consider them now unconnected in 
				meaning in Modern English, i.e. an example of homonymy not 
				polysemy.</li>
				<li>When some vowels are de-stressed, they are pronounced as 
				weak forms e.g.:<span class="style_black"><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				/prə.ˈɡres/</span> (verb) and <span class="style_black">/ˈprəʊ.ɡres/</span> (noun)<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /kəm.ˈbæt/</span> 
				(verb) and <span class="style_black">/ˈkɒm.bæt/</span> (noun)).</li>
				<li>It was said above that we do not usually stress affixes in English 
				(apart from the six covered above which are stressed!).&nbsp; 
				Well, here are more exceptions.&nbsp; With some nouns, the main 
				stress falls on the prefix in these cases, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his ˈrecall is poor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I demand a ˈrecount<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this needs a complete ˈrewrite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perform a heart ˈtransplant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put in an ˈunderline<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay for a computer ˈupgrade</em><br />
				As nouns, these are: <span class="style_black">/ˈrɪk.ɔːl/, /ˈrɪk.aʊnt 
				/ˈriː.raɪt/, /ˈtræn.splɑːnt/, /ˈʌn.də.laɪn/, /ˈʌp.ɡreɪd/</span><br />
				As verbs, they are: <span class="style_black">/rɪˈk.ɔːl/, /rɪˈk.aʊnt/, 
				/ˌriː.ˈraɪt/, /træn.ˈsplɑːnt/, /ˌʌn.də.ˈlaɪn/, /ˌʌp.ˈɡreɪd/</span></li>
				<li>A number of other changes can occur in parallel to the 
				stress shift:<br />
				<em>record</em>:<span class="style_black"> /’rɛkɔːd/</span> to<span class="style_black"> 
				/rɪˈkɔːd/</span> (with a change to the first vowel from 
				<span class="style_black">/ɛ/</span> to 
				<span class="style_black">/ɪ/</span>)<br />
				<em>abuse</em>: <span class="style_black">/əˈbjuːs/</span> to
				<span class="style_black">/əˈbjuːz/</span> (with a final 
				consonant change from <span class="style_black">/s/</span> to 
				<span class="style_black">/z/</span>).<br />
				(This also occurs with the verb
				<em>use</em>. when it is a lexical verb as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used a hammer</em><br />
				the 's' is pronounced <span class="style_black">/z/</span>, but in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to go</em><br />
				the 's' is pronounced <span class="style_black">/s/</span>.)<br />
				<em>combine</em>: <span class="style_black">/ˈkɒmbaɪn/</span> to
				<span class="style_black">/kəmˈbaɪn/</span> (with a vowel change 
				from <span class="style_black">/ɒ/</span> to 
				<span class="style_black">/ə/</span> [the first is a piece of farm machinery]).&nbsp; 
				This is a common phenomenon which also occurs with all the 
				examples in the table above which begin <em>com-</em> or <em>
				con-</em> (<em>combat,
					compact,
					compound,
					conduct,
					conflict,
					conscript,
					consort,
					construct,
					contest,
					contract,
					contrast,
					converse,
					convert,
					convict</em>).</li>
				<li>These pairs of words are a subset of homographs in that they 
				are spelled the same but vary in <strong>both</strong> meaning 
				and pronunciation.&nbsp; They are often classified as heteronyms 
				or heterophones.</li>
				<li>There is a noticeable tendency in English to discontinue the 
				use of the verb stress and pronounce all these words as the noun 
				/ adjective is pronounced.&nbsp; We are not there yet, however.</li>
				<li>Some verb-noun pairings are pronounced the same regardless 
				of word class.&nbsp; Examples include <em>format</em> (<span class="style_black">/ˈfɔː.mæt/</span>) 
				and disdain (<span class="style_black">/dɪs.ˈdeɪn/</span>), the 
				first always stressed on the first syllable and the second 
				always on the second.</li>

			</table><h3>compound nouns</h3>
			<p>Compound nouns are usually stressed on the first element 
			with a secondary stress on the second element.&nbsp; This is one of 
			the tests for a compound noun rather than a pre-modified noun.&nbsp; 
			Compare, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&#712;green&#716;house </em>and <em>&#716;green &#712;house</em><br />
			In the first, we are referring to a glass construction but in the 
			second, we are referring to the colour of a house.<br />
			The first is a true compound; the second is a pre-modified noun.<br />
			There are hundreds of examples which follow this pattern:<br />
			<em>&#712;candle&#716;stick, &#712;dish&#716;washer, &#712;black&#716;board, &#712;heart&#716;beat, &#712;wind&#716;mill</em>, 
			and, of course, <em>&#712;word&#716;stress</em> etc.</p>
			<h3>compound verbs</h3>
			<p>Compound verbs are much more rarely two verbs combined but most 
			follow the same pattern:<br />
			<em>&#712;baby&#716;sit, &#712;kick&#716;start, ˈforce&#716;feed</em></p>
			<h3>compound words formed from multi-word verbs</h3>
			<p>Nouns and adjectives formed from multi-word verbs also exhibit the stress 
			pattern of main then secondary so we get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&#712;off&#716;putting, &#712;break&#716;down, ˈknock&#716;out</em> etc.<br />
			In fact, the pattern is not quite so simple because prepositional 
			verbs and phrasal verbs are stressed differently and the compounds 
			formed from them also have some interesting stress patterns.<br />
			For more, see <a href="../verbs/mwvs.html">the guide to multi-word 
			verbs</a>.</p>
			<h3>compound adjectives and adverbs</h3>
			<p>Compound adjectives and the rarer compound adverbs often exhibit the opposite stress patterns:<br />
			Adjectives: ˌ<em>top&#712;class, &#716;secondˈrate, &#716;back&#712;handed, 
			ˌfarˈfetched</em><br />
			Adverbs: ˌ<em>there&#712;upon, &#716;henceˈforth, ˌupˈstairs</em></p>
			<p>However, when these are used attributively, the pattern reverses 
			and we get:<br />
			<em>a ˈtop-ˌclass act, a ˈsecond-ˌrate act, an ˈupˌstairs room, a 
			ˈfar-ˌfetched story</em></p>

			<p>As we saw above, word stress in English is highly mobile.<br />
			Learners will, of course, especially at lower levels, be tempted to 
			transfer the rules and patterns of their first languages into 
			English, resulting in mistaken stress very often.<br />
			The following cannot cover all languages but here is a list to give 
			you some idea of the possibilities:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Languages with predictable stress</strong></dt>
				<dd>in French (allegedly) the stress always falls on the final 
				syllable (although some will say that there is, in fact, no word 
				stress in French).<br />
				in Hungarian, again allegedly, the stress is always on the first 
				syllable.<br />
				in Polish, the stress almost always falls on the penultimate 
				syllable (although loan words will vary the pattern).<br />
				in Italian and Spanish the stress also falls frequently on the 
				penultimate syllable but there are some complex rules to 
				determine where the stress should be placed.<br />
				most Swedish polysyllabic words have the stress on the first 
				syllable.<br />
				in Portuguese, most stresses fall on the last syllable but there 
				are rules for words where it is in a different place.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Languages with unpredictable stress include:</strong></dt>
				<dd>Russian<br />
				Greek (although stress is always marked in lower-case writing)<br />
				in Arabic, stress is variable across dialects (and that applies 
				to Portuguese, too) so stress may fall unpredictably.&nbsp; The 
				many varieties of Arabic are not usually mutually comprehensible 
				and pronunciation, in particular, is vary variable.<br />
				in German, stress is frequently on the first syllable but there 
				are exceptions all over the place depending on suffixation, 
				prefixation (whether separable or not) and so on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Languages with alternative systems:</strong></dt>
				<dd>Japanese does not have a stress accent like English.&nbsp; 
				In English, as we saw above the stress affects pitch, loudness 
				and length of the syllable.<br />
				Japanese, by contrast, has what is called a pitch accent which 
				can be high or low.&nbsp; The syllable, however, is pronounced 
				with the same loudness and takes the same amount of time to 
				utter.<br />
				In tonal languages, such as Chinese languages and many South-East 
				Asian languages such as Thai, the stressed syllable is denoted by 
				a larger than usual tone swing.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Learners whose first languages have predictable and dominant 
			stress patterns (the first group) will be tempted to transfer the 
			rules to English.<br />
			Learners whose languages have unpredictable stress patterns may be 
			confused by the fact that English orthography does not mark the 
			stress for them.<br />
			Learners whose languages exhibit alternative systems may have 
			difficult stressing words at all and sound very flat or monotonous.</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Every time a new multisyllable word is introduced in a 
			classroom, therefore, the stress needs to be explicitly highlighted 
			and practised.<br />
			</strong>Here are three ways to highlight.&nbsp; Pick one and keep 
			to it so your learners know what it signifies.</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="highlight" height="78" src="../../imagesgraphics/highlightingstress1.png" width="200" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="highlight" height="78" src="../../imagesgraphics/highlightingstress2.png" width="200" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="highlight" height="78" src="../../imagesgraphics/highlightingstress3.png" width="200" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			Simply doing this on the board is helpful, of course, but you need 
			to make sure that the learners can actually say the words with the 
			stress in the right place.<br />
			Speakers of most European languages will be able to do this but 
			speakers of other languages may encounter trouble.<br />
