			<p>For adult learners, in particular, any ambition to sound like a 
			native speaker is probably unrealistic but all learners need to be 
			comprehensible and none wants to put a strain on people's listening 
			comprehension by the false production of the sounds of English.&nbsp; 
			Even minor adjustments to, for example, the place in which /t/ and 
			/d/ are pronounced or the way a schwa is produced can have a 
			noticeable, immediate effect on helping learners lose the most 
			obvious elements of a foreign accent.</p>
			<p>A good source for specific languages and their sounds systems is 
			Swan and Smith (2001).&nbsp; That reference takes languages one by 
			one and sets out which sounds are most troublesome in English for 
			speakers of those languages, although it does it in a frustratingly 
			inconsistent manner.&nbsp; (If you are looking for issues affecting 
			a particular language on this page, use Ctrl + F to search it.)<br />
			This guide takes a different approach and sets out to look at a 
			range of the phonemes of English, explain what makes them difficult for 
			speakers of certain languages and then suggest some simple teaching 
			techniques which may help you help your learners pronounce things 
			more accurately.&nbsp; It also considers some languages lacking from 
			Swan and Smith and excludes others they cover.</p>
			<p>There is no attempt to be exhaustive here either in the sounds 
			selected or in the languages mentioned.&nbsp; A completely 
			exhaustive list would fill many books so you will need to rely on 
			some research of your own into what phonemes cause your learners the 
			greatest difficulties.&nbsp; If you are a speaker of your learners' 
			first language(s), of course, that's easy.&nbsp; Teachers working 
			with multi-lingual groups face more of a challenge.&nbsp; This guide 
			is here to help.<br />
			Some of the solutions suggested are applicable beyond the specific focus here, 
			e.g., the suggested solutions to the issue of voicing can be applied 
			to a wider range of consonant sounds than are considered in what 
			follows.</p>
			<p>In what follows, we are considering the standard forms of the 
			languages mentioned.&nbsp; Individual speakers of any language will 
			vary their pronunciation from the standard form and may, in fact, be 
			fortunate that their accent or dialect actually does have a sound 
			equivalent to the English phonemes.</p>
			<p><a name="top"></a>If you are here to discover the problems and solutions with 
			particular sounds, or get some ideas for teaching, here's an index:</p>

					first two vowels represent a notorious 
					issue because many languages do not distinguish the short 
					and long sounds represented by these transcriptions or do 
					not lengthen the /i:/ sound sufficiently.<br />
					The short sound is slightly more central and lower in terms 
					of tongue position than the long sound.<br />
					There are two groups of languages that this affects and the 
					effect of both is that learners fail to produce the short /ɪ/ sound.<ol>
						<li>Those having only the long vowel, /iː/:<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						French<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Italian<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Greek<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Farsi (Persian)<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Chinese languages</li>
						<li>Those only having a /i/ sound 
						which is intermediate between /i:/ and /ɪ/ as at the end of <em>happy</em> 
						(/ˈhæp.i/) in English:<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Swedish<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Spanish and Catalan<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Portuguese<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Polish<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Turkish (which also has the short sound)<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Malay / Indonesian<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Japanese<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Korean</li>
					</ol>
					</td>
					<td class="auto-style18" valign="top" style="width: 40%">If your learners' 
					language falls into the first group, the short vowel needs to 
					be taught from scratch.&nbsp; Stage 1 is recognition and 
					that can be achieved simply by getting the learners to notice 
					the shape of the lips, stretched laterally for /i:/ and 
					a little more relaxed for /ɪ/.<br />
					The old trick of getting people to smile and say <em>cheese</em> 
					when having a photograph taken usually works well to alert 
					learners to the long sound they can already produce but it is 
					the short sound that causes problems for learners from these 
					language backgrounds.&nbsp; Start with 
					the long sound (which they can easily produce) and then 
					remove the smile, relaxing the lips (or even rounding them 
					slightly) to make the short sound.<br />
					Try getting learners to breathe out completely and empty 
					their lungs before producing the sound.&nbsp; With no 
					available breath, it is possible to produce /ɪ/ but not 
					/i:/.<br />
					An alternative approach is to get the learners to say the 
					/i:/ sound and while extending it, saying <em>eek!</em>,<em>
					</em>lower the tongue and move 
					it towards the back of the mouth slightly to shorten it, 
					relax the lips and then cut off the breath.<br />
					The second group of learners who actually do have a longer 
					sound /i/ but usually not the short
					/ɪ/ tend to produce /i/ in both cases, failing to produce 
					the short sound and failing to lengthen the long sound 
					sufficiently.&nbsp; They can be encouraged to locate words in 
					their first language(s) which have the /i/ and then simply elongate it to produce the 
					/i:/ sound effectively.<br />
					For the short sound, try the techniques above.<br />
					For both sounds, try some of the ideas for minimal-pair work

					the words on the board until the pronunciation has been 
					mastered.<br />
					This 
					is a difficult area because the second of these sounds is a

					Until learners can successfully produce the two pure vowels, 
					they cannot be expected to produce the diphthong so the 
					first step is to get those right (see above for some ideas).<br />
					The /ɔː/&nbsp;is a pure vowel but it has no equivalent in 
					many languages.&nbsp; It is a very low back vowel and 
					similar to the /ɑː/ which many learners can successfully

					phonemes /p/, /t/ and /k/ appear in English in at least two 
					main forms: aspirated (/pʰ/ /tʰ/ and kʰ/) and non-aspirated 
					(without the /ʰ/).<br />
					For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take</em>: /tʰeɪk/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pike</em>: /pʰaɪk/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kite</em>: /kʰaɪt/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start</em>: /stɑːt/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pickle</em>: /ˈpɪk.l̩/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blacken</em>: /ˈblækən/<br />
					The allophones carry no semantic information in English.&nbsp; 
					Other languages do things differently and in these the 
					aspirated and non-aspirated forms are phonemic, carrying a 
					distinction in meaning.<br />
					In most Chinese languages, including Mandarin and Cantonese, 
					the aspirated and non-aspirated versions of /t/, /k/ and /p/ 
					are full phonemes distinguishing minimal pairs.<br />
					Similar considerations apply to Korean.<br />
					In Thai, too, the two forms of /p/ and /t/ are also 
					phonemes.<br />
					In other languages, these sounds are never aspirated or 
					always aspirated so there will be a tendency by their 
					speakers to produce the same sound in all positions, 
					rendering, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cake</em> as /keɪk/ or /kʰeɪkʰ/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pip</em> as /pɪp/ or/pʰɪpʰ/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tot</em> as /tɒt/ or /tʰɒtʰ/<br />
					etc.<br />
					Speakers of Japanese, Polish and Russian, for example, may 
					do this.<br />
					A number of languages do not produce aspirated versions of 
					these consonants in the initial position making /p/, /k/ and 
					/t/ sound closer to /b/, /ɡ/ and /d/, respectively.&nbsp; This affects 
					speakers of:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Dutch<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Spanish<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Portuguese<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Russian<br />
					<a href="#top" style="color:#ff3300">-top-</a></td>
					<td class="auto-style18" valign="top" style="width: 40%">
					Learners whose first languages have both the aspirated and 
					non-aspirated forms of these consonants have no difficulty 
					producing them but some in knowing when to do so.&nbsp; 
					Practising the initial-position aspirated allophones is a 
					starting point and being aware of when the learners produce 
					the inappropriate sound is helpful.<br />
					Learners whose first languages do not have aspirated forms 
					need more careful treatment.<br />
					Holding a thin piece of paper in front of the mouth will 
					determine whether a consonant is produced with or without 
					aspiration.&nbsp; In the former case, the paper should move 
					slightly as breath is released.<br />
					Learners whose first languages have aspirated versions but 
					who do not use them in the initial position as English 
					usually does can also be trained this way and the upshot is 
					often that they sound considerably less foreign.</td>

					However, unless their attention is drawn to the issue many

					consonants with a consequence that they contribute to 
					sounding more foreign than they should.<br />
					The first issue is for learners to be able to distinguish 
					between voiced (lenis) and unvoiced (fortis) sounds.<br />
					One way is to start with a sound that can be extended and 
					get learners to say firstly <em>SSSSSSSSSS</em> and then the 
					voiced sibilant <em>ZZZZZZZZ</em> with their hands on their 
					throats.<br />
					In the first case, there should be no vibration of the vocal 
					cords and in the second, the learners should perceive the 
					vibration.&nbsp; Then they can go on to try something like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>SSSSSSZZZZZZSSSSSSZZZZZZSSSSSS</em><br />
					This is trickier with stops which cannot be continuously 
					produced like the distinction between /b/ 
					and /p/ or fricatives such as /f/ and /v/ but can still be 
					done with a little practice.<br />

					non-distinction between these two phonemes is most significant 
					for speakers of Southern Chinese dialects, Korean and 
					Japanese.<br />
					The issue is that the sounds, even when they occur are 
					allophones, not phonemes.<br />
					The dark [ɫ] usually causes fewer problems, in fact.<br />
					The /r/ sound is troublesome for many because it is not 
					evident in BrE at the end of words like <em>father</em> 
					unless it is followed by a vowel (a linking /r/).&nbsp; For this reason, 
					some learners find an American accent easier to understand 
					in this respect.<br />
					Speakers of most European languages may have a much stronger 
					pronunciation of /r/, rarely like English, and tend to 
					over pronounce it.<br />
					In particular, Spanish has a phonemic rather than allophonic 
					distinction between the flap [ɾ] sound and the trilled sound 
					akin to the Scottish pronunciation of /r/.<br />
					Many languages, including Bulgarian, Swedish, Norwegian, 
					Italian, Spanish, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian and 
					Dutch use a similar trilled sound.<br />
					French and some German speakers may produce the voiceless 
					uvular fricative, phonetically [ʁ] which is produced by 
					restricting the airflow over the back of the throat with the 
					tongue.&nbsp; Doing so in English contributes to a 
					distinctive foreign accent.<br />
					<a href="#top" style="color:#ff3300">-top-</a></td>
					<td class="auto-style18" style="width: 40%" valign="top">The 
					problem is serious but not wholly intractable.<br />
					Producing [ɫ] instead of /l/ will not, in English, lead to 
					any confusion for a hearer but the speaker will sound a 
					little odd.<br />
					One way to get them to do this is to ask learners to produce 
					[ɫ] at the beginning of a word like <em>love</em> by extending the 
					consonant sound unnaturally and producing /ɫʌv/ instead of /lʌv/. 
					Then put the word into a short phrase such <em>love letter</em> 
					and get them to start by saying it very slowly, producing 
					[ɫ], and slowly speed up when it should lead 
					them to making /l/.<br />
					In English, both /l/ and /r/ are approximants so there is, 
					in fact, only a small difference between them with the air 
					being slightly obstructed so that it flows at the sides of 
					the tongue for /l/ and between the tongue and the roof of 
					the mouth for /r/.<br />
					Here are some ideas:<ol>
						<li>Get the learners to rest the tip of the tongue 
						against the alveolar ridge but the tongue should not 
						touch the teeth at the sides of the mouth.<br />
						To test this, get the learners to breath in sharply and 
						make sure they can feel cold air passing down the sides 
						of the tongue.<br />
						Now they can start with the tongue in the right position 
						and produce, e.g., <em>love</em> and then <em>lovely</em> 
					and then <em>lovable</em>.</li>
						<li>Now you can move on to the /r/ sound by getting the 
						learners to extend the tongue to touch the side teeth 
						and withdrawing it from the alveolar ridge.<br />
						To test this, again get the learners to breath in 
						sharply and they should feel cold air on the roof of the 
						mouth rather than at the sides of the tongue.<br />
						Holding the tongue in that position, the learners should 
						be able to produce <em>run</em> (/rʌn/).</li>
						<li>Another trick is to insert a vowel before /r/ which 
					forces the tongue into the right position. Because the sound 
					/u:/ is a high, back vowel, inserting that before a word 
					like <em>run</em> (/u:rʌn/) means that the tongue is already 
					in the right place to produce the sound.</li>
						<li>For the /l/ sound, use a low vowel such as /ʌ/ and insert 
					that so that the word <em>lack</em> is pronounced as /ʌlæk/ 
					and that forces the tongue to lie flat in the mouth. You can 
					also use the English word ‘alas’ for this exercise if it is 
					pronounced without the usual initial schwa as /æ.ˈlæs/ 
					rather than /ə.ˈlæs/.</li>
						<li>Once they can do this, the learners can stop producing the 
					two intrusive vowels at the beginning and simply imagine 
					them so that the tongue moves to the right place.</li>
						<li>Whichever examples of words you choose to use as practice, 
					avoid consonant clusters with the /l/ and /r/ (such as <em>
						pr, dr, pl, sl</em> and so on) sounds because 
					these are also difficult for most speakers of these 
						languages who will 
					often insert vowels to break them up (see below).</li>

					Given the range of issues here, these sounds need careful 
					practice.<br />
					Learners whose first languages fall into group one will have 
					the most difficulty because they have none of the sounds.&nbsp; 
					For these and other learners, the first step is to use a 
					diagram explaining where they are pronounced (see below).<br />
					/tʃ/ and /dʒ/ are affricatives produced by pressing the 
					tongue to the hard palate, stopping the airflow and then 
					allowing turbulent air to flow over the tongue by 
					withdrawing it downwards and backwards.&nbsp; The first is 
					unvoiced (fortis) and the second is voiced (lenis).<br />
					Making the sounds requires, for some learners, a good deal 
					of practice but positioning the tongue as if for a high 
					vowel such as /iː/ or /ɪ/ and then following it with the 
					consonant helps because the tongue is already in more or 
					less the right place.<br />
					To practice /tʃ/ start with a full stop sound such as /t/ 
					which most learners have little difficulty making and then 
					get them to move the tongue down slowly until turbulent air 
					produces the following /ʃ/ sound.<br />
					/dʒ/ can be practised in the same way for this group by 
					starting with a voiced stop /d/ and keeping the vocal cords 
					in vibration while making the sound.<br />
					Learners whose first languages have no /dʒ/ but do have the 
					/tʃ/, can also be led to the same sound by adding voice.<br />
					To ensure that learners are able to add or remove voice from 
					sounds at will, start by getting them to say <em>SSSSSSSS</em> 
					followed by <em>ZZZZZZZ</em> and then add and remove voice 
					by saying <em>SSSSSZZZZZSSSSSZZZZZ</em> etc.<br />
					Many languages have no /ʒ/ and this sound requires different 
					treatment because it is a full fricative (and can be 
					extended indefinitely).<br />
					Start with /ʃ/ which most learners can make and add voice to 
					the sound to produce the /ʒ/. Learners who can say mesher (/meʃə/) 
					can, by adding voice to the sound, produce measure (/ˈme.ʒə/) 
					(eventually).<br />
					Because Chinese speakers do have related sounds, the issue 
					is one of adjusting the mouth shape from the Chinese sounds 
					to the English sounds.&nbsp; Diagrams (see below) will help 
					but practice is needed to get it consistently right.&nbsp; 
					For Chinese speakers, /tʃ/ can be nearly made by devoicing 
					the Chinese sound /tɕ/.</td>

					usually a schwa, between the elements of the cluster, 
					producing, for example, /səkəruː/ instead of /skruː/ for <em>
					screw</em>.<br />
					These languages include:<br />
					In
					French, there are no final /z/ sounds in clusters making some plurals and 
					third-person verb forms difficult for French speakers.&nbsp; The temptation is 
					to replace the sound with /s/, making the plural of <em>
					hands</em> as /hænds/, not /hændz/, and the third-person 
					verb ending similarly as /həʊlds/, not /həʊldz/ for <em>
					holds</em>.&nbsp; The /z/ is not frequent in French but does 
					occur initially so the sound itself is not mysterious.<br />
					Spanish and Catalan do not allow /s/ + /p/, /t/ or /k/ 
					initially and speakers may insert /e/ before them, 
					producing, e.g. <em>eschool</em> (/ˈeskuːl/) instead of <em>
					school </em>(/skuːl/).&nbsp; 
					Portuguese phonotactic rules lead to a similar phenomenon.<br />
					Russian speakers may have problems with certain initial 
					clusters starting with /t/ as they are not permitted in 
					Russian.<br />
					Finnish does not allow more than one consonant in the 
					initial position and speakers may tend to reduce such 
					clusters, rendering, e.g., <em>stop</em> as <em>top</em>.<br />
					Farsi and Arabic do not have consonant clusters within 
					syllables and vowels may be introduced as above.<br />
					Thai and other South Asian languages as well as Japanese and 
					Chinese languages are similar in this respect and the same 
					issue arises.&nbsp; Thai speakers, in particular will often 
					simplify final clusters, retaining only the first element, 
					so plural endings may be lost.<br />
					Korean speakers have fewer problems.<br />
					Turkish does not have initial consonant clusters.<br />

					<td class="auto-style22" style="width: 40%" valign="top">The 
					issue is the avoidance of an intrusive vowel which may be an 
					initial /e/ or /ɪ/ or an inserted /ə/ or /ɪ/ between 
					elements of unfamiliar clusters.<br />
					The solution, which requires lots of practice, is to focus 
					on place of articulation and how the move from, e.g., /s/ to 
					/k/ to /r/ takes place in words such as <em>scream</em> or 
					at the end of <em>marks</em> where it moves from /r/ to /k/ 
					to /s/<em>.<br />
					</em>Stretching out the sounds unnaturally is the place to 
					begin so the learners can focus on the individual consonants 
					before gradually making the production faster until the 
					cluster is produced.<br />
					Thai speakers encounter particular problems because of the 
					language's phonotactic rules.&nbsp; It is not the production 
					of the cluster which is usually the issue but the reluctance 
					to place it in the final position.&nbsp; They need practice 
					starting simply with two-sound clusters such as /ks/, /ts/, 
					/ds/ etc. as at the ends of <em>sacks </em> (/sæks)<em>, lots </em> 
					(/lɒts/)<em>, lads </em> (/lædz/) etc. before tackling complications with 
					more than two consonant sounds.&nbsp; English words can end 
					in no fewer than four consonants and that is a real 
					challenge for many learners (not just Thai speakers).<br />
					Avoid, therefore, focusing on words like <em>glimpsed</em> 
					(/ɡlɪmpst/) and <em>texts</em> (/teksts/) because that will 
					demotivate and frustrate.<br />
					In BrE, the 'r' in words like 
					<em>marks </em> (/mɑːks/)<em>, carts </em> (/kɑːts/) and <em>lords</em> 
					(/lɔːdz/) is not sounded so these are, in fact, 
					two-, not three-consonant, clusters.<br />
					Clusters are also frequently simplified in rapid speech so 
					it unnecessary to trouble learners with the full 
					pronunciation of words like <em>products</em> or <em>camped</em> 
					because the 't' and the 'p' are not usually sounded by 
					native speakers (so we have <em>products</em> as /ˈprɒ.dʌks/ not /ˈprɒ.dʌkts/ and 
					<em>camped</em> as /kæmt/ not /ˈkæmpt/).<br />
					The troublesome /ð/ in <em>clothes</em> is also often 
					ignored by native speakers and learners can take the same 
					route (say /kləʊz/, not /kləʊðz/).<br />
					Lastly, the /d/ sound before /z/ is often elided by native 
					speakers so the pronunciation of, e.g., <em>sends</em> is /senz/ 
					not /sendz/.&nbsp; Learners who are tempted to simplify the 
					cluster by removing the last element rather than the middle 
					or first sound run the risk of being misunderstood because 
					the final element is usually more significant.</td>

			<p>Nearly everything in this guide has focused on pairs of phonemes 
			so, clearly, the place to start in their teaching and practice is 
			with some minimal pair work so that learners can notice:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>How the sounds differ</li>
				<li>How their own production differs from a model</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Raising awareness</h3>
			<p>Linking the perception of the sounds to physical movements often 
			works well and has the advantage that you can easily see who has 
			identified the right sound and who is still confused.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<span class="auto-style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the sound is long, 
			point at the door.&nbsp; If it is short, point at the window.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>beat | bit | keep | kip | sleep | slip</em></span><br />
			and so on.&nbsp; The same technique can be used for receptive 
			training for any of the pairs of sounds discussed here which cause 
			problems.&nbsp; For variety, you can ask people to remain seated on 
			one sound and stand for another and so on.<br />
			The next obvious step is to hand the activity over to the learners 
			and get them to give the commands and the examples.&nbsp; This 
			involves them both in production and perception of the sounds and 
			can be done with any pairs of sounds which are troublesome for the 
			group or individuals within it.</p>

			production practice,

			<p>Pronunciation teaching is often confined to the realms of modelling 
			and drilling but there is no reason why some deductive focus on 
			place and manner of articulation cannot be effective.&nbsp; For many 
			learners, it is helpful to know where they should be placing the 
			articulators and which ones they should be using in what way to make 
			sounds that are unfamiliar to them because their first language(s) 
			do not have them.<br />
			<strong>Most learners need to know this and
			<span class="style_underline">cannot</span> be expected to infer it simply by being 
			drilled, any more than they can be expected to learn any other 
			elements of the language through repeating them</strong>.<br />
			Using a diagram such as this one is often the way to do this:<br />
			<img alt="articulators" height="432" src="../../imagesgraphics/vocal_tract_simple.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Projecting this allows you to be able to point out to learners 
			where, for example, they should be putting the tongue tip to make 
			the difference between /t/ and /θ/.&nbsp; It can also be used to 
			explain which parts of the vocal tract to block to make stops such /k/ and /b/ etc.<br />
			For vowels, the position of the tongue (front to back and floor to 
			roof of the mouth) can be demonstrated.</p>
			<p>Vowels, in particular, as you will know if you have followed the 
			guide to them, can be classified by four parameters:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>tongue height</li>
				<li>tongue position</li>
				<li>length</li>
				<li>lip roundedness</li>
			</ul>
		<p>A productive exercise is to take vowels which differ in <strong>only 
		one characteristic</strong> and use them for practice.&nbsp; That way, 
		learners can focus only on height, position, length or roundedness and 
		are not distracted by having to make multiple changes to distinguish the 
		sounds when they speak.&nbsp; Use this table as a reference to do that.</p>

			<br />
			and so on.<br />
			Finding suitable images is not difficult.<br />
			Once the learners can recognise the sounds using one of these 
			techniques, they can take over the activity and test each other by 
			making up their own minimal pair sentences.<br />
			That requires them <strong>both</strong> to produce the correct 
			phoneme <strong>and</strong> to recognise it when their colleagues 
			do.&nbsp; It is a self-correcting feedback loop, in other words.<br />
			<p>Tempting though it may be, the advice is to avoid tongue twisters 
			such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>Peter Piper picked a peck of 
			pickled peppers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red lorry, yellow lorry, red leather, yellow leather</em></span><br />
			and so on because they are 
			too hard and tend to demotivate (being designed to make life hard 
			even for native speakers).<br />
			A better way is to practise the relevant sounds 
			separately in short phrases such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> <span class="style_black">red robin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lamplights<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laugh loudly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liking the pub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liking the pup<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bought a boat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have a happy Easter</span></em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p>A way of practising a range of sounds is to use a grid like 
			this:<br />
			<img alt="minimal pairs activity" height="277" src="../../imagesgraphics/minimal_pairs_activity.png" width="400" /><br />
			Here's the explanation and procedure:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Along the top row and down the left side of the grid are the 
				target phonemes set in minimal pairs (<em>hate, ate, bit, beat</em> 
				etc.)<br />
				You dictate a word by using two of the target words: the first 
				one from the top row and the second from the left-hand column.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				The word <em>came</em> is identified by selecting
				<span class="style_black"><em>bit</em></span> in the top row, 
				followed by <span class="style_black"><em>ate</em></span> in the 
				left-hand column and <em>week </em>is selected by saying <em>
				<span class="style_black">bait</span> +
				<span class="style_black">pup</span></em>.</li>
				<li>Demonstrate the activity with a simple phrase such as<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the journey</em></span><br />
				To dictate the phrase, you use the words along the top row, 
				followed by the words in the left-hand column so the phrase is 
				dictated as:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bait plus pet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bit plus hate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bait plus ate</em></span></li>
				<li>When you have checked that the learners have understood the 
				task and got the phrase right, you can move on to dictating 
				longer clauses and sentences such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">I went to London last week and I 
				saw her sister on the journey.</span></em></li>
				<li>Once the idea is clear and you have practised the perception 
				of the target phonemes, you can hand over the activity to the 
				learners.&nbsp; They then make an accurate sentence using the 
				words in the grid.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">We saw her 
				mother on the train</span></em></li>
				<li>In pairs or groups, one learner dictates the sentence to the 
				other(s) but only by using the grid co-ordinates.</li>
				<li>Each word in the sentence is selected individually so, for 
				our example a learner will say something like:<br />
&nbsp;<em class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp; bat plus ate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boat plus bet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but plus pub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bait plus pub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bait plus pet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bit plus hate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bat plus pet</em></li>
				<li>If the production and reception of the sounds has worked, 
				the other learner(s) will have written:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>We + saw + her + mother + on + 
				the + train</em></span></li>
				<li>The speaker then reveals the original sentence and the 
				learners compare what they have, identifying any errors and 
				noticing which sounds were either incorrectly produced or 
				incorrectly perceived.</li>
				<li>Learners take it in turns to dictate their sentences using 
				the grid co-ordinates.</li>
				<li>You can amend the grid, of course, in any way you like, 
				putting the minimal pairs for the current target phonemes in the top row and left-hand 
				column and placing vocabulary or function words that you want to 
				revise in the main grid, focusing on other elements of the 
				language as well as practising pronunciation.<br />
				It will mean that your learners are using their lexical, 
				structural and phonological knowledge simultaneously to 
				understand what they are hearing as well as using their 
				knowledge of what is in the main grid to predict what they might 
				hear and that, of course, simulates a real-life listening / 
				speaking event.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All pronunciation activities need to be repeated often because 
			the aim is to automatise the production of the correct sounds.&nbsp; 
			That takes time and patience both from the teacher and the learners 
			so mixing up activity types to maintain motivation is important.<br />
			Little and often is probably more effective than focusing on the 
			sounds for lengthy periods in a lesson.<br />
			A combination of the ideas above involving images, information-gap 
			activities and physical movements can help to keep learners 
			motivated.&nbsp; Using each one of these ideas to focus on, say, two 
			or three troublesome phonemes for your learners each week will pay 
			dividends.</p>
