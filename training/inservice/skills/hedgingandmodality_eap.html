			<h1>Hedging and modality in academic writing</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="academic writing" height="206" src="../../images/writinglaptop.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>To get an idea of the importance of this area, compare:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>It is clear that Guru is right when he states ... and we 
				must act on his proposal by ...</em></li>
				<li><em>It is probably arguable that Guru may well be right when 
				he states ... and it may be advisable to act on his proposal by 
				...</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Sentence 1. is almost designed to make the reader try to imagine 
			all the times when Guru is wrong and also to reject the obligation 
			to do anything at all.<br />
			Sentence 2., on the other hand, is appropriately hedged with 
			modality, expressing doubt rather than certainty and possibility 
			rather than obligation.&nbsp; It sounds reasoned and tentative 
			rather than trenchant and intransigent.</p>
			<p>Getting this right is not something that comes easily to writers 
			operating in their first languages and in an additional language is 
			even more difficult so the area needs attention.&nbsp; The failure 
			to modulate assertion appropriately is common especially for 
			inexperienced or non-native writers.</p>

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>How to hedge</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The term hedging is somewhat disparaging, implying 
			wishy-washiness and the inability to be decisive.&nbsp; Consider 
			this example from the once-popular British TV series, <em>Yes 
			Minister</em>.&nbsp; It is the response of a civil servant to the 
			Minister's simple question ("<span class="style_black"><em>... are 
			you going to support my view that the Civil Service is over manned 
			and feather-bedded, or not?&nbsp; Yes or no?&nbsp; Straight answer.</em></span>"):</p>

				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="yes minister" height="126" src="../../images/yesminister.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style6">
					<p align="justify" class="auto-style18" style="width: 600px">
					<em>Well Minister, if you asked me for a straight answer, 
					then I shall say that, as far as we can see, looking at it 
					by and large, and taking one time with another, in terms of 
					averages of departments, then, in the final analysis, it is 
					probably true to say that, at the end of the day, in general 
					terms, you would probably find that, not to put too fine a 
					point on it, there probably wasn't very much in it one way 
					or the other, as far as one can see, at this stage.<br />
					</em><span class="auto-style5">(Yes, Minister, Series 1 
					(1980), Episode Five: <em>The Writing on the Wall</em>)</span></p>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is, of course, an extreme example, designed for comic effect 
			but it is also clear that a response such as<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>No, Minister.</em></span><br />
			would not have been appropriate, given the fuzziness of the data and 
			the speaker's wish to be uncommitted.</p>
			<p>Hedging of that sort is not appropriate but hedging in academic 
			writing is very frequent (and very frequently not satisfactorily 
			achieved either by inexperienced writers in their first language or 
			those struggling to write in academic style in a second language).</p>
			<p>In this guide, the focus is on hedging in the statement of a 
			proposition, but the choice of reporting verb, in the case of 
			comment on another's work is also important.&nbsp; For more on how 
			the choice of reporting verb affects the communicated attitude of 
			the writer, see <a href="reportingverbs_EAP.html">the guide to 
			reporting verbs in EAP</a>.</p>

			</table>
			<p>There are a number of ways to classify (and therefore arrange in 
			a teaching programme) hedging in academic writing.&nbsp; We'll look 
			at two here, one focused on function and one on form, which seem the 
			most useful for our purposes.&nbsp; For more data on vague language, 
			try the excellent book by Channell (1994).</p>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The following is drawn from Jordan (1997) who follows Salager-Meyer 
			(1994).</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Shields:<br />
				These terms express degrees of certainty or possibility and 
				include a range of pure and marginal modal verbs as well as 
				adverbials used to soften the a proposition, i.e., to shield the 
				writer from accusation of too much assertion.&nbsp; Examples 
				will be enough here but see below under form for more analysis.<ol class="auto-style17">
					<li>Pure modals:<br />
					<em>The discrepancy <span class="style_black">could</span> 
					be the result of ...<br />
					It <span class="style_black">might</span> be argued that ...<br />
					It <span class="style_black">does not have to be</span> the 
					case that ...<br />
					It <span class="style_black">may</span> be argued that ...<br />
					Some <span class="style_black">would</span> argue that ...</em></li>
					<li>Marginal modals:<br />
					<em>It <span class="style_black">seems to be</span> the case 
					that ...<br />
					This <span class="style_black">tends to be </span>the result 
					of ...<br />
					It <span class="style_black">is likely to be caused</span> 
					by ...</em></li>
					<li>Adverbials:<br />
					<em>This results, <span class="style_black">quite</span> 
					possibly, in ...<br />
					It seems <span class="style_black">arguably</span> possible 
					that ...<br />
					<span class="style_black">Conceivably</span>, ...<br />
					<span class="style_black">Presumably</span>, ...</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Downtoning, approximating and (less frequently) intensifying:<br />
				These terms are usually adverbials, often just adverbs.&nbsp; They generally modify adjectives or other 
				adverbs.&nbsp; For example:<ol class="auto-style17">
					<li>Downtoners:<br />
					<em>The is <span class="style_black">slightly</span> 
					different from arguing that ...<br />
					This is <span class="style_black">marginally</span> 
					different from ...<br />
					This results, <span class="style_black">to some extent at 
					least</span>, show ...</em></li>
					<li>Approximators:<br />
					<em>This is <span class="style_black">approximately</span> 
					the same number of ...<br />
					<span class="style_black">Roughly</span>, the data can be 
					divided into three sections</em></li>
					<li>Intensifiers:<br />
					<em>It is <span class="style_black">particularly</span> 
					noteworthy that ...<br />
					There are <span class="style_black">impressively</span> 
					close parallels between ...</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Expressions which imply the author's personal feelings.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">As far as I am able to discover</span> 
				...<br />
				<span class="style_black">We have no direct knowledge of</span> ...<br />
				<span class="style_black">We are unaware of </span>any contrary findings in the literature.</em></li>
				<li>Compounding the hedges.&nbsp; It is possible to heighten the 
				hedging effect by combining any of the above.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>It <span class="style_black">may</span>, 
				<span class="style_black">quite arguably</span>, be the case that ...<br />
				It <span class="style_black">seems</span>, 
				<span class="style_black">as far as we can discover</span>, 
				<span class="style_black">to be </span>the result of ...</em></li>
			</ol>
		
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="form" height="122" src="../../images/forming200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Focus on form</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>An alternative way to classify how we hedge is to look at which 
			forms we use rather than the (many) functions they perform.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Modal verbs:<br />
				As we saw above, of the pure modals, <em>could, may, might, 
				would</em> are common hedges and, in the negative only, <em>
				don't/doesn't have to </em>is usable.&nbsp; The three marginal 
				modals exemplified above also play a role.&nbsp; The modal <em>
				would</em> is often used to distance the writer.&nbsp; Compare, 
				for example:<br />
				<em>We argue that ... vs. We <span class="style_black">would</span> argue that ...</em><br />
				Modals <strong>not</strong> used in this way, or in academic writing generally, 
				include <em>should, must, ought to</em> and, in the negative <em>
				couldn't and can't (have)</em>.&nbsp; These make the writer seem 
				overly assertive and are avoided.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>This <span class="style_black">must / can't / couldn't</span> be be the result of ...<br />
				We <span class="style_black">should</span> focus on ...<br />
				It <span class="style_black">ought to </span>be clear that ...</em></li>
				<li>Lexical verbs:<br />
				These are often copular verbs standing in place of the 
				too-assertive, <em>be</em>.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.:<br />
				<em>This is the result of ... vs. This <span class="style_black">
				appears to be</span> the result of ...<br />
				The outcome is that ... vs. The outcome
				<span class="style_black">appears</span> to be that ...</em><br />
				Other verbal processes are also common.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>This <span class="style_black">suggests</span> </em>(i.e.,
				<em>I suggest</em>)<em><br />
				This <span class="style_black">leads to the conclusion </span>
				...</em> (i.e., <em>I conclude</em>)<br />
				In general, the present-simple use of the verb <em>be</em> 
				sounds overly assertive in many cases.</li>
				<li>Modal adverbials.&nbsp; See above for other examples.&nbsp; 
				Here are some more:<br />
				<em>It is <span class="style_black">apparently</span> the case 
				that ...<br />
				<span class="style_black">Seemingly</span>, the respondents have 
				taken the view that ...<br />
				<span class="style_black">Ostensibly</span>, this is a reason 
				for concern<br />
				<span class="style_black">Outwardly</span>, the materials are 
				... <br />
				</em>etc.</li>
				<li>Modal adjectives, often used predicatively after a complex 
				nominalisation.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>A <span class="style_black">probable</span> outcome is ....<br />
				A new and more complex model of the phenomena is
				<span class="style_black">possible</span><br />
				One quite <span class="style_black">likely</span> outcome is ...<br />
				More serious and longer-lasting consequences are
				<span class="style_black">imaginable</span><br />
				It is <span class="style_black">conceivable</span> that ...<br />
				The results so far are <span class="style_black">promising</span></em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Modal nouns formed from these adjectives are an alternative.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>One <span class="style_black">possibility</span> is that ...<br />
				A reasonable <span class="style_black">assumption</span> might 
				be that ...<br />
				Our <span class="style_black">hypothesis</span> is that ...<br />
				A <span class="style_black">postulation</span> we can put 
				forward is that ...<br />
				One <span class="style_black">proposition</span> is ...</em></li>
				<li>Prepositional phrases, acting often as adverbials, can also be 
				used to soften the assertive nature of a proposition.&nbsp; For 
				example:<em><br />
				This is, <span class="style_black">as far as we can see</span>, 
				...<br />
				<span class="style_black">By and large</span>, the process can 
				be described as ...<br />
				If one looks <span class="style_black">in terms of averages</span> 
				...<br />
				<span class="style_black">At this stage</span>, it is difficult 
				to predict ...<br />
				<span class="style_black">In general terms</span>, ...</em></li>
			</ol>

			<p>As with much else in English for Academic Purposes, the situation 
			is complicated and the range of hedging terms is too great to 
			present easily.&nbsp; A piecemeal approach over a series of lessons 
			using elements of the analysis above is advisable.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Identification, noticing in other 
				words, often precedes any productive activity.&nbsp; An example 
				might be to get learners to note the differences between these

				the reasons for the differences and the writer's choices.<br />

						<td class="auto-style23"><em>Many would argue that what

					</tr>
				</table>
				</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Another noticing / awareness raising 
				procedure is to present learners with a range of possible ways 
				to express a thought and get them to rank them in terms of their 
				assertiveness.&nbsp; They then need to identify the language use 
				which led them to their conclusions.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black">Rank the following from most to least 
				assertive (A to F):</li>
			</ul>
			<ol class="auto-style25">
				<li><em>cars obviously can sometimes create what some see as 
				harmful pollution</em></li>
				<li><em>it is often asserted that cars create harmful pollution</em></li>
				<li><em>it is often asserted that cars may create harmful 
				pollution</em></li>
				<li><em>it is often asserted that cars create harmful pollution 
				in most circumstances</em></li>
				<span class="style_black">
				<li><em>it is often asserted that cars create harmful pollution 
				in some circumstances</em></li>
				</span>
				<li><em>cars are polluting monsters which should be banned 
				forthwith</em></span></li>
			</ol>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Learners can also be presented with 
				very assertive statements and asked to make them more tentative 
				or vice versa.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black">Fill in the gaps in this table:</span><br />
				<table class="auto-style20">
					<tr>
						<td style="width: 300px"><strong>Tentative</strong></td>

				</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">A reasonable approach to the area is 
				to focus on one function and one or two forms (or realisations 
				of the functions) at a time.&nbsp; This will depend greatly on 
				the level of the learners.<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li> At lower levels, simple adverbs,

					<em>I suggest</em> rather than <em>I think</em><br />

					... </em>rather than <em>Obviously</em>, ...<br />
