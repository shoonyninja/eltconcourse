			<h1>Assessing listening skills</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="listening" height="207" src="../../images/listen_lecture310.jpg" width="310" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In many ways, the consideration of testing and assessing 
			listening ability parallels that of assessing reading.&nbsp; Both 
			are receptive skills and both can be broken down in similar ways.&nbsp; 
			For that reason, you should read this guide after or in conjunction 
			with <a href="assessingreading.html">the guide to assessing reading 
			ability</a>.</p>
			<p>The essential difference between the skills is that the listener 
			cannot move backwards and forwards through the text at will but must 
			listen for the data in the order in and speed at which the speaker 
			chooses to deliver them.</p>
			<p>In common with the assessment of reading skills, that of 
			listening skills is, perforce, indirect.&nbsp; When someone speaks 
			or writes, there is a discernible and assessable product.&nbsp; 
			Merely watching people listen often tells us little or nothing about 
			the level of comprehension they are achieving or the skills they are 
			deploying.&nbsp; This accounts for the fact that both listening and 
			speaking skills are often assessed simultaneously.&nbsp; In real 
			life, listening is rarely practised in isolation and the listener's 
			response to what is heard is a reliable way to assess how much has 
			been comprehended.</p>
			<p>Rarely, however, does not mean never and there are a number of 
			times when listening is an isolated process.&nbsp; For example, 
			listening to the radio or TV, a lecture or a station announcement 
			are all tasks which allow no interruption or feedback from the 
			listener to gain clarification or ask questions.&nbsp; One can, of 
			course, allow the listener access to a recording which he or she can 
			replay as frequently as is needed to understand a text but, as this 
			cannot be said to represent a common real-life task, we'll exclude 
			it from what follows.</p>
			<p>We can, of course, test some underlying 
			skills discretely.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li class="redbulletlist">we can test learners' 
			abilities to understand lexical items through, e.g., matching or 
				multiple choice exercises</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">we can assess the ability to recognise 
				individual phonemes by, for example, getting learners to match 
				minimal pairs of words to written forms</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.</p>
			<p>However, before we do any of that, we need to define what 
			listening skills we want to test and why.&nbsp; For more on the 
			subskills of listening, see <a href="../../skills/listening1.html">the guide to 
			understanding listening skills</a>.&nbsp; The following is premised 
			on the fact that you are familiar with the content of that.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="aim" height="166" src="../../images/aim_archer_b250.jpg" width="250" /></td>

				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>All assessment starts (or should start) from a consideration of 
			the aims of instruction.&nbsp; With listening skills, as with 
			reading skills, however, it is 
			notoriously difficult to identify specific skills which 
			are linked to specific purposes.&nbsp; An argument can 
			almost always be made that the following are key macro listening 
			skills whatever the setting, whatever the purpose and whatever the 
			topic and text type:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Listening to locate specific data is required:<ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li>for academic purposes to locate the part of a lecture or 
					address or book which focuses on what needs to be learned</li>
					<li>by general listeners to locate items of interest in, 
					e.g., announcements and news programmes</li>
					<li>in the workplace to make the identification and 
					absorption of heard data efficient and focused</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Listening to obtain the gist is needed:<ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li>by busy people in their occupations so they can judge 
					whether something they are hearing is relevant or ignorable 
					in part or whole</li>
					<li>by students to judge whether a comment or section of a 
					lecture is relevant to their studies and current concerns</li>
					<li>by general listeners who simple want to get the gist of 
					a text and don't need detailed understanding</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Following directions and instructions:<ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li>by general listeners needing to know what to do or where 
					to go in response to an enquiry which may be as simple as
					<em>Where's the toilet?</em> or much more complicated</li>
					<li>by students to find what to do, what to read and when to 
					submit work</li>
					<li>by people in the workplace to allow them to follow an 
					instruction and organise their working time</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Underlying these three macro skills are a number of micro 
			listening skills without which few texts can be properly understood.&nbsp; 
			These will include, for example:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style6">
				<li>Recognising the phonemes of English, especially those which 
				are allophones in English but full phonemes in the learners' 
				first language(s)</li>
				<li>Identifying lexemes and word boundaries</li>
				<li>Using context and co-text to infer meaning (including visual 
				information)</li>
				<li>Understanding intonation a recognising attitude</li>
				<li>Recognising the communicative functions of utterances: questions, 
				instructions, responses, initiations etc.</li>
			</ol>

				</table>
			<ol>
				<li>We have to use assessment tasks which focus on the 
				kinds of texts the learners will hear in 'the real world'.</li>
				<li>We need to design tasks which accurately show the learners' 
				ability.</li>
				<li>We need to have a reliable way to score the learners' 
				performance.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These three factors are to do with ensuring reliability and 
			validity.&nbsp; For more on those two concepts, see
			<a href="../background/testing.html">the guide to testing, assessment and evaluation</a>.&nbsp; 
			The rest of this guide assumes basic familiarity with the content of 
			that guide.<br />
			Fulfilling all three criteria adequately requires a little care.</p>

					<h2>Identifying listening text types</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>The first step is to find out what sorts of texts the learners 
			will need to access and what strategies are appropriate for the 
			purposes of listening.&nbsp; This is by no means an easy undertaking, 
			especially if the course is one in General English (also known as ENOP 
			[English for No Obvious Purpose]) when it is almost impossible to 
			predict what sorts of texts, for what purposes the learners may one 
			day need to access (see below for a generic check-list of skills).<br />
			On courses for very specific purposes, it is easier to identify the 
			sorts of texts the learners will encounter and the purposes for which 
			they will listen to them but there is no related set of subskills 
			that we can identify with confidence that will allow them easy 
			access to texts in particular topic areas.&nbsp; We can, however, look at 
			the types of texts and identify key listening strategies to focus on.&nbsp; 
			For example:</p>

			<p>When we know what kinds of settings in which our learners will 
			need to operate, we can get on with designing tests which assess how 
			well they are able to deploy the skills they will need.</p>

				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>It may be the case that you find yourself teaching General 
			English rather than English for Specific Purposes.&nbsp; If that is so, you 
			need a general-purpose check-list of abilities at various levels 
			against which to assess your learners' abilities to read.&nbsp; 
			Here's one:<br />
			<img alt="listening check list" height="559" src="../../imagesgraphics/listeningassessmentdescriptors.png" width="800" /></p>
			<p>The abilities and text types are, of course, cumulative.&nbsp; 
			At, e.g., B2 level, a learner should be able to handle everything 
			from A1 to B1 already.</p>

					<h2>Designing tasks</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Now we know what sorts of thing we want to assess, the text types 
			we are targeting, the purposes of listening, the subskills deployed 
			and so on, we can get on and 
			design some assessment procedures.<br />
			There are some generic guidelines for all tasks.<br />
			If you have followed the guide to testing, assessment and 
			evaluation (see above), you will know that this is something of a 
			balancing act because there are three main issues to contend with:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Reliability:<br />
				<img alt="reliable" height="133" src="../../images/rope_mooring200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				A reliable test is one which will produce the same result if it 
				is administered again (and again). &nbsp;In other words, it is not 
				affected by the learner' mood, level of tiredness, attitude etc.<br />
				This is challenging area in the case of assessing 
				listening because the skill requires high levels of 
				concentration especially if more than gist is to be gleaned.<br />
				We need to be aware that very long listening tasks will result 
				in fatigue and that may overwhelm 
				learners who are otherwise good listeners.&nbsp; 
				Unless there is a good reason for using a long text (e.g., when 
				preparing people for study in English), a range of short tasks focused as far as possible on micro 
				skills is a better way forward in most circumstances.<br />
				Assessment outcomes are often in written form and the listening 
				text itself often recorded and repeatable so marking can be 
				quite reliable.</li>
				<li>Validity:<br />
				<img alt="valid" height="133" src="../../images/stamp_valid200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Two questions here:<ol class="auto-style6">
				<li>do the texts represent the sorts of texts the learners are 
				likely to encounter?<br />
				For example, if we set out to test someone's ability to 
				understand a lecture, we need to ensure that the 
				topic area is valid for them.<br />
				On the other hand, if we know that our learners will rarely, if 
				ever, encounter the need to listen to extended monologues from 
				native speakers but will need to understand what they are told 
				in service and informational encounters, then we have to match 
				the texts we use for assessment of their abilities.</li>
					<li>do we have enough tasks to target all the skills we want 
					to assess?<br />
					For example, if we want to test the ability to use context 
					and co-text to infer meaning, do 
					we have a task or tasks focused explicitly and discretely on that 
					skill?&nbsp; If we want to test the ability to monitor a 
					series of announcements for crucial data, do we have a test 
					that requires that skill?</li>
			</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Practicality:<br />
				<img alt="balance" height="133" src="../../images/balance_stones_a200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Against the two main factors, we have to balance practicality.<br />
				It may be advisable to set as many different tasks as possible 
				to ensure reliability and to try to measure as many of the 
				subskills as possible in the same assessment procedure to ensure 
				validity but in the real world, time is often limited and 
				concentration spans are not infinite.<br />
				Practicality applies to both learners and assessors:<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>for learners, the issue is often one of test fatigue.<br />
					Too many tests over too short a time may result in learners 
					losing commitment to the process.<br />
					On shorter courses, in particular, testing too much can be 
					perceived as a waste of learning time.</li>
					<li>for the assessors, too many time-consuming tests which 
					need careful assessment and concentration may put an impractical load on time and 
					resources.&nbsp; Assessors 
					may become tired and unreliable.</li>
					<li>The third issue concerns technology.&nbsp; If we know, 
					for example, that our learners will rarely have to 
					understand audio-only, disembodied text, then providing 
					context and clues through the use of video recordings should 
					be considered.&nbsp; Even settings which are heavily text 
					laden (such as lectures) are accompanied by gesture, 
					expression and visual data that cannot be excluded from a 
					valid test of the skills.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>

			<p>Say we have a short (150-hour) course for motivated B2-level 
			learners who will need to operate comfortably in an English-speaking 
			culture where they will live and work.&nbsp; They will need, 
			therefore, to be able understand a wide and unpredictable range of texts 
			for a similarly wide range of purposes so we 
			need to focus our assessment on generic, recognisable listening 
			skills.<br />
			We have around three hours of the course earmarked for this

			<p>It may be that your circumstances allow for very simple 
			listening 
			tasks such as those requiring the learners to respond spontaneously 
			to a set of prepared initiations.&nbsp; This kind of test can be 
			done in the classroom or a language laboratory or even on the 
			telephone.<br />
			Those are all legitimate 
			tasks providing the task type and content suits the purposes of 
			assessment.<br />
			There are other ways.<br />
			No list can be complete, but here are some other ideas for other 
			ways to set listening tasks for assessment purposes.&nbsp; <strong>The 
			content of any task will of course, depend on all the factors 
			discussed so far.</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Monitoring tasks<br />
				<img alt="pa address" height="133" src="../../images/public_address200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The station-announcement task above is an example of this kind 
				of procedure.&nbsp; Longer texts can be used as well, asking the 
				learners, for example, to identify the linguistic signal a 
				speaker uses to signpost a summary of key points.&nbsp; Such tasks can 
				be graded even if the text is ostensibly beyond the learners' 
				level.&nbsp; Just locating a gate number or a name in an otherwise 
				complex and indistinct recording is a good test of the ability to 
				monitor and ignore 
				the unnecessary.</li>
				<li>Compare and contrast tasks<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
					<tr>
						<td>
						<img alt="accident" height="100" src="../../images/roadside_recovery.jpg" width="150" /></td>
						<td>
						<img alt="crane" height="100" src="../../images/harbour_recovery150.jpg" width="150" /></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				See above for an example of this task type.&nbsp; Two similar 
				but distinct events can be described in speech for listeners to 
				identify key words (e.g., <em>roadside</em> vs. <em>harbour</em>).</li>
				<li>Matching tasks<br />
				<img alt="golfer" height="133" src="../../images/golf200.gif" width="200" /><br />
				Getting people to match a short audio description to a picture (or series of 
				similar pictures where only one represents the content of the 
				text) is a good test of detailed understanding.</li>
				<li>Multiple-choice tests<br />
				<img alt="mc" height="133" src="../../images/choice_pumkins200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				These tests can be carefully targeted on particular items in the 
				text to test the ability to listen for detail, infer likely 
				meaning of lexemes and understand tense relationships and so on.&nbsp; 
				They can also be targeted at the ability to listen for gist and 
				identify key words and phrases.<br />
				The great disadvantage in terms of listening skills assessment 
				is that the learners need to hold all <span lang="x-none">
				</span>the alternatives in 
				their heads while they are also being required to focus on the 
				text itself.&nbsp; Alternatives need to be kept short if 
				cognitive overload is to be avoided.</li>
				<li>Directions and instructions<br />
				<img alt="direction" height="133" src="../../images/sign_2_directions200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				In these tests, learners may be required to listen and follow 
				instructions.&nbsp; Such tasks, because of their artificiality, 
				have limited uses but they do test intensive listening skills.&nbsp; 
				Popular topics are origami and following directions to locate 
				something.&nbsp; They can be motivating and intriguing tests.</li>
				<li>Labelling tasks<br />
				<img alt="labelling" height="133" src="../../images/label200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				In these tasks, the learners are given a diagram of something 
				fairly complicated and asked to match the descriptions of 
				various labels (A, B, C ...) to the parts of the diagram that 
				the listening text refers to.&nbsp; This is an important 
				academic skill for some learners but of limited utility in other 
				settings.</li>
				<li>Note-taking tasks<br />
				<img alt="note" height="133" src="../../images/write_notetaking200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				In these tasks, the usual procedure is to require learners to 
				take notes as they listen and then, when the address or lecture 
				is over, they are presented with questions to answer on what 
				they have heard and use the notes to respond.&nbsp; Providing 
				there is a level playing field, i.e., that some of the learners 
				are not able to answer the questions without any reference to 
				notes because they are familiar with the topic, this can be a 
				valid and reliable test of the skill.</li>
				<li>Dictation<br />
				<img alt="dictation" height="133" src="../../images/write_dictation200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Dictation wanders in and out of fashion but is still seen as a 
				reliable if not too authentic way of testing listening ability.&nbsp; 
				The text has to be carefully chosen to be relevant.&nbsp; The 
				problem with this sort of test is that it isn't always clear 
				what's being tested because a good deal depends on the learners' 
				ability to deploy grammatical knowledge and logic to infer what 
				the text should be.<br />
				It is a fairly flexible procedure because we can force learners 
				to start with a blank piece of paper or have them fill gaps in a 
				text.&nbsp; The latter can be quite finely targeted.</li>

			<p>Unlike writing and speaking test, in which holistic, impression 
			marking can be done, listening tests are normally marked analytically.<br />
			This involves breaking down the tasks and being specific about 
				the criteria you are using to judge success.&nbsp; Any amount of 
			weighting can be applied to whichever of the micro skills you judge 
			to be most important.<br />
				Normally, the results of a listening test are permanent in some 
			way (short answers, multiple choice responses and so on).&nbsp; Even 
			the success of a Directions / Instructions task (above) can be objectively marked.&nbsp; 
			This means that marking can be objective (and the test is reliable, 
			to that degree) but, unless the test items target recognisable and 
			definable micro skills, validity is always problematic.</p>
