			<h1>Reporting verbs</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="reporting verbs" height="206" src="../../images/reporting310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide is not to do with reported or indirect speech and will 
			not cover the simpler reporting verbs such as <em>say, tell, 
			exclaim, ask, enquire</em> etc.&nbsp; For a guide to those matters
			<a href="../verbs/reportedspeech.html">click here</a>.<br />
			What follows assumes that the rules for reporting direct speech are familiar.<br />
			The following is most relevant to formal academic writing although 
			the concepts are generalisable.&nbsp; It is, therefore, of most 
			interest to people teaching EAP (English for Academic Purposes).</p>
			<hr />
		
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="why" height="166" src="../../images/why_ask_meerkat250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Consider this:</p>
			<p class="auto-style4" style="width: 500px"><em>Even the most 
			original academic paper integrates facts, ideas, concepts, and 
			theories from other sources by means of quotations, paraphrases, 
			summaries, and brief references.<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style16">(Campbell 1990, in Jordan, 1997:171)</span></p>
			<p>It is unlikely, but not impossible, that learners of English for 
			Academic Purposes will be producing 'the most original academic 
			paper' so the ability to insert summaries, paraphrases and citation 
			appropriately, using the right reporting verb, is a key writing 
			skill.&nbsp; Not least, of course, to avoid any whiff of plagiarism.&nbsp; 
			Understanding the implications of reporting verbs is also a key 
			reading skill to identify slant and angle.</p>
			<p>Reporting verbs can be classified and presented in a number of 
			ways and we can also, as we shall see, combine elements of the 
			analysis to make the area accessible to learners.</p>
			<hr />
		
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="attitude" height="167" src="../../images/four_men250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Classifying reporting verbs: attitude</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Reporting verbs are subtle but powerful signals of the writer's 
			attitude to the message being sent by a paraphrase or citation.&nbsp; 
			Compare, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru states that ...<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Guru presumes that ...<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Guru claims that ...<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Guru suggests that ...<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Guru mentions that ...<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Guru hypothesises that ...</em></p>
			<p>One way to classify such verbs is to arrange them on a cline from 
			tentative, through neutral to assertive.&nbsp; Something like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="cline of reporting verbs" height="257" src="../../imagesgraphics/reportingverbs1.png" width="500" /></p>
			<p>There are obvious problems with this, not least that opinions may 
			differ concerning the exact connotation each verb carries.<br />
			Such a classification does, however, have some classroom utility.</p>
			<hr />
		
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="function" height="166" src="../../images/fountain250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Classifying reporting verbs: function</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Reporting verbs are used for a range of communicative functions.&nbsp; 
			Presenting them from this standpoint, we can get something like:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="reporting verbs by function" height="139" src="../../imagesgraphics/reportingverbs2.png" width="800" /><br />
			This sort of presentation and analysis sits well with a 
			communicative approach because it focuses clearly on the 
			communicative value of the verbs.</p>
			<p>However, one obvious problem is that some verbs can be synonyms 
			and some can perform multiple functions.&nbsp; There is not a great 
			deal of difference in meaning between, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru proposes that we ...</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru suggests that we ...</em><br />
			However, <em>suggest</em> is also polysemous in a way that <em>
			propose</em> is not so we can also have:<br />
			<em>The data suggest that ...</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The data propose that ...</em></p>
			<hr />
		
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="form" height="166" src="../../images/form_statue250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Classifying reporting verbs: form</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The final way to classify these verbs in this guide is by 
			grammatical and lexical form.&nbsp; We need to look at concepts of 
			collocation and colligation here, especially the latter.&nbsp; This 
			might result in this kind of analysis:<br />
			<img alt="reporting verb colligations" height="358" src="../../imagesgraphics/reportingverbscolligation1.png" width="650" /></p>
			<p>but there are problems with that, too, some colligational, some 
			collocational:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Transitivity<ol class="auto-style17">
					<li>Some verbs in the lists are both transitive and 
					intransitive.&nbsp; We can have<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru concedes the point that ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru concedes that ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru questions the conclusion<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru questions whether ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru proposes a solution<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru proposes that ...</em></li>
					<li>Some verbs are only intransitive.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					G<em>uru observes that ...</em><br />
					but not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Guru observes the conclusion that ...</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Guru theorises a solution</em></li>
					<li>Some verbs are only transitive.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru recommends a solution</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru recommends that ...</em><br />
					but not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Guru discounts that ...</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Guru discusses that ...</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Appropriacy of subject:<ol class="auto-style17">
					<li>Some of these verbs will collocate with inanimate 
					subjects, some with animate only and some with both.</li>
					<li>Animate subjects can be used for most of them but some 
					can also take inanimate subjects.&nbsp; We can have, e.g.,<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The study shows ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru shows ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The evidence indicates ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru indicates</em> ...<br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>Some may only have animate subjects.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru hypothesises ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru maintains ...</em><br />
					but not, arguably<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The evidence comments ...<br />
					</em>or<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*The facts allege ...</em></li>
					<li>Some are <span lang="x-none"></span>open to metaphorical use (pathetic 
					fallacy):<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The study argues ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The facts imply ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The findings argue for ...</em><br />
					and some are not:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The evidence describes ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*The findings believe ...</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

					<h2>Combining the analyses</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We can weave aspects of all three analyses together to produce 
			quite sophisticated analysis&nbsp;.&nbsp; For example, if we combine 
			attitude with function we can produce something like:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="disagree" height="164" src="../../imagesgraphics/reportingverbsdisagree.png" width="650" /></p>
			<p>
			<img alt="reporting verbs suggest" height="153" src="../../imagesgraphics/reportingverbssuggest.png" width="650" /></p>
			<p>and we can do similar things with many of the other functions.<br />
			It is also possible to combine functional and formal analyses:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="form and function" height="318" src="../../imagesgraphics/reportingverbsformandfunction.png" width="650" /></p>
			<p>It is even possible to go one step further and combine all three 
			analyses but, at that stage, the data start to get impenetrable.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Reporting verbs are frequently used in the present simple so that 
			is not difficult to teach.&nbsp; Perversely, some lists of reporting 
			verbs put all of them in the present simple 3rd person which is 
			misleading at best.&nbsp; Two other tenses are also frequently used 
			and multiple authorship is common.&nbsp; Here are examples of all 
			three:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Present simple.&nbsp; This is the most frequent form:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru notes that ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The data imply ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				In that paper, Guru and Mentor propose ...</em></li>
				<li>Past simple.&nbsp; This is frequently used for sources which 
				are older and have become seminal authorities in some way.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru (1949) identified ...</em></li>
				<li>Present perfect.&nbsp; This is used a) when the writer needs 
				to emphasise the present relevance of a source or b) when the 
				sources are varied and (sometimes) not individually identified.&nbsp; 
				It is often used in the passive voice but need not be.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been noted (Guru, 2016) that ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Guru (2010) has discovered that ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Guru and Mentor (2000) investigated the structure of these 
				complex substances and have shown that they are ... <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				It has often been asserted that ...</em></li>

			This list is also available
			<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_reporting_verbs_academic.pdf" target="_blank">as a PDF document</a> for reference.<p>Clearly, presenting learners with a list like this is not going 
			to be a very productive approach.&nbsp; Somehow we have to help our 
			learners eat the elephant so a piecemeal approach is the only 
			practical way forward.</p>
			<p>Before you can begin, you need to make a selection of the 
			reporting verbs which will form the target of a teaching sequence.&nbsp; 
			This site can't do that for you because there are some variables to 
			consider first:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>Level:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>At lower levels, it may be adequate to focus on a short 
					list of frequently used neutral verbs.&nbsp; This might 
					include, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state, mention, discuss, comment, show, suggest</em> 
					etc.</li>
					<li>At higher levels, your learners need to start learning 
					about the attitudes that verb-use implies so the list can 
					start to extend to verbs like:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; question, intimate, assert, demonstrate, discount, 
					hypothesise</em> etc.</li>
					<li>Later yet, learners need to be alert to degrees of 
					assertion and argumentation so the list gets extended again 
					to include, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maintain, portray, take issue with, profess, presume</em> 
					and so on.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Register:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>Within the natural sciences certain reporting verbs are 
					more frequently found.&nbsp; Often, they have inanimate 
					subjects such as <em>data, experimental investigation, 
					observations</em> and so on.&nbsp; Verbs commonly used with 
					inanimate subjects might include:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reveal, show, suggest, demonstrate, explain, confirm, 
					(dis)prove</em> etc.<br />
					so these become the targets for learners in those 
					disciplines</li>
					<li>within the social sciences, more tentative verbs are 
					frequent and they come with animate subjects so verbs like:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; propose, suggest, imply, interpret, posit, postulate</em> 
					etc.<br />
					are more useful targets.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<img alt="approach" height="132" src="../../images/approach_train200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Approach</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>You can approach the verbs from any of the three analyses above 
			by considering attitude, function and form separately.&nbsp; A 
			combined approach is often productive <strong>providing</strong> the 
			number of target verbs is limited and carefully selected.</p>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Start with a shortlist of verbs which function to state what 
				an author believes (<em>say, hold, assert, believe, claim, 
				declare, maintain</em> etc.) and introduce them in context to 
				show the colligations (see above for that).&nbsp; At lower 
				levels, some focus on tense, aspect and voice is appropriate at 
				this stage.</li>
				<li>Move on to presenting them on a cline from tentative, 
				through neutral to assertive (see above).</li>
				<li>Then, once the function, form and meaning are clear, 
				learners can proceed to practising them.&nbsp; A simple way to 
				do that is to present a text which only uses a simple verb like
				<em>say</em> and get learners to replace the verb with something 
				more appropriate.&nbsp; It could look something like this:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Jones (1964:20) 
				<span class="style_underline">says</span> that ... and 
				<span class="style_underline">says</span> it is important to ... but Smith (1990:85) 
				<span class="style_underline">says</span> that this is 
				not true and he <span class="style_underline">says</span> work by Robinson (1990) 
				<span class="style_underline">says</span> that 
				...<br />
				More recently, Smith now <span class="style_underline">says</span> that what the study 
				<span class="style_underline">said</span> was not 
				fully correct.&nbsp; He now <span class="style_underline">says</span> that what Jones 
				<span class="style_underline">said</span> is 
				important.</em></span> <br />
				could become something like:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Jones (1964:20) </em> </span>
				<span class="auto-style20"><em>asserts</em></span><span class="style_black"><em> that ... and 
				</em> 
				</span><span class="auto-style20"><em>emphasises that</em></span><span class="style_black"><em> it is important to ... but Smith (1990:85) 
				</em> </span>
				<span class="auto-style20"><em>avers</em></span><span class="style_black"><em> that this is 
				not true and he </em> </span><span class="auto-style20"><em>points out 
				that</em></span><span class="style_black"><em> work by Robinson (1990) 
				</em> </span>
				<span class="auto-style20"><em>reveals</em></span><span class="style_black"><em> that 
				...<br />
				More recently, Smith now </em> </span><span class="auto-style20">
				<em>concedes</em></span><span class="style_black"><em> that what the study 
				</em> </span>
				<span class="auto-style20"><em>showed</em></span><span class="style_black"><em> was not 
				fully correct.&nbsp; He now </em> </span><span class="auto-style20">
				<em>allows</em></span><span class="style_black"><em> that what Jones 
				</em> </span>
				<span class="auto-style20"><em>noted</em></span><span class="style_black"><em> is 
				important.</em></span></li>
				<li>Finally, the learners can move on to writing or improving 
				their own texts using the limited range you have introduced.</li>
				<li>The procedure can be duplicated with another target function 
				and set of verbs until the learners are able to deploy a wide 
				range of reporting verbs accurately, with attitudinal awareness 
				and for functions they can clearly identify.</li>
