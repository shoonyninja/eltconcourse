			<h1>Assessing reading skills</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="reading" height="207" src="../../images/reading_interested310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Time was when almost all language testing relied, at least to 
			some extent, on assessing reading comprehension and this is still 
			the case.&nbsp; Many public examinations devote whole papers or 
			parts of papers to assessing reading.&nbsp; Even when a test item 
			does not target reading comprehension, some ability to comprehend 
			and act on the instructions in the task rubric is being assumed and 
			tested.</p>
			<p>One issue is that all assessment of reading skills has to be 
			indirect.&nbsp; When someone speaks or writes, there is a 
			discernible and assessable product.&nbsp; Merely watching people 
			read tells us nothing about the level of comprehension they are 
			achieving or the skills they are deploying.&nbsp; This means that 
			test items have to be carefully targeted at the skills we have 
			identified as important for the group of learners we are concerned 
			to assess.</p>
			<p>We can, of course, test some underlying 
			skills discretely.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li class="redbullet">we can test learners' 
			abilities to understand lexical items through, e.g., matching or 
				multiple-choice exercises</li>
				<li class="redbullet">we can assess the ability to recognise 
				the function of conjunctions by, for example, getting learners 
				to match sentence halves</li>
				<li class="redbullet">we can test appreciation of text 
				structure and staging by getting learners to re-order paragraphs 
				or whole texts</li>
				<li class="redbullet">we can test the ability to identify 
				pronoun referents by asking, e.g.<span class="style_black"><br />
				</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
				What does <em>it</em> refer to in line 25?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.</p>
			<p>However, before we do any of that, we need to define what reading 
			skills we want to test and why.&nbsp; For more on the subskills of 
			reading, see 
			<a href="../../initial/skills/reading_overview.html" target="_blank">the guide to understanding reading skills</a> 
			(new tab).&nbsp; The 
			following is premised on the fact that you are familiar with the 
			content of that.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="aim" height="166" src="../../images/aim_archer_b250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>The aims of the teaching programme</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>All assessment starts (or should start) from a consideration of 
			the aims of instruction.&nbsp; With reading skills, however, it is 
			notoriously difficult to identify specific skills in reading which 
			are linked to specific purposes for doing so.&nbsp; An argument can 
			almost always be made that the following are key macro reading 
			skills whatever the setting, whatever the purpose and whatever the 
			topic and text type:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Scanning a text to locate specific data is required:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>by general readers to locate items of interest in, e.g., 
					newspapers and websites or something as simple as a bus 
					timetable</li>
					<li>for academic purposes to locate the part of a paper, 
					article or book which focuses on what needs to be learned or 
					cited</li>
					<li>in the workplace to make the identification and 
					absorption of data efficient and focused</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Skimming to obtain the gist is needed:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>by general readers who simple want to get the gist of a 
					text and don't need detailed understanding</li>
					<li>by students to judge whether a paper, book or article is 
					relevant to their studies and current concerns</li>
					<li>by busy people in their occupations so they can judge 
					whether something they are reading is relevant or ignorable 
					in part or whole</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Identifying the stages of a text using generic knowledge is 
				required:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>by general readers looking for the circumstances or 
					outcomes of, e.g. a news story or anecdote</li>
					<li>by students to find the parts of the text which present 
					the data or the concluding arguments quickly without reading 
					every word</li>
					<li>by people in the workplace to allow them to locate the 
					data they need in, e.g., a report</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Underlying these three macro skills are a number of micro reading 
			skills without which few texts can be understood.&nbsp; These will include, for example:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style6">
				<li>Identifying pronoun referents</li>
				<li>Using context and co-text to infer meaning</li>
				<li>Understanding the way writers in English explicitly 
				signpost, e.g., conclusions, introductions, examples and 
				justifications</li>
				<li>Recognising how conjuncts, disjuncts and adjuncts are used 
				to link ideas, reveal attitudes and modify phrases</li>
				<li>Recognising grammatical signals concerning time and aspect 
				to understand the setting</li>
				<li>Unpacking complex nominalisations and verb phrases to 
				understand the essential participants in a sentence</li>
				<li>Understanding enough of the lexis to read the text with 
				adequate understanding</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />

				</tr>
				</table>
			<ol>
				<li>We have to use assessment tasks which focus on the 
				kinds of texts the learners will need in 'the real world'.</li>
				<li>We need to design tasks which accurately show the learners' 
				ability.</li>
				<li>We need to have a reliable way to score the learners' 
				performance.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These three factors are to do with ensuring reliability and 
			validity.&nbsp; For more on those two concepts, see
			<a href="../background/testing.html" target="_blank">the guide to testing, assessment and evaluation</a>.&nbsp; 
			The rest of this guide assumes basic familiarity with the content of 
			that guide.<br />
			Fulfilling all three criteria adequately requires a little care.</p>

			<p>The first step is to find out what sorts of texts the learners 
			will need to access.&nbsp; This is by no means an easy undertaking, 
			especially if the course is one in General English (also known as ENAP 
			[English for No Apparent Purpose]) when it is almost impossible to 
			predict what sorts of texts, for what purposes the learners may one 
			day need to access (see below for a generic check-list of skills).<br />
			On courses for very specific purposes, it is easier to identify the 
			sorts of texts the learners will encounter and the purposes to which 
			they will put them but there is no related set of subskills that we 
			can identify with confidence that will allow them easy access to 
			texts in particular topic areas although we can look at the genres 
			of texts and identify key language areas to focus on.&nbsp; For 
			example:</p>

			<img alt="check list" height="517" src="../../imagesgraphics/reading_assessment_descriptors.png" width="775" /></p>
			<p>The abilities and text types are, of course, cumulative.&nbsp; 
			At, e.g., B2 level, a learner should be able to handle everything 
			from A1 to B1 already.<br />

			<p>Now we know what sorts of thing we want to assess, the text types 
			we are targeting, the purposes of reading, the subskills deployed 
			and so on, we can get on and 
			design some assessment procedures.<br />
			There are some generic guidelines for all tasks.<br />
			If you have followed the guide to testing, assessment and 
			evaluation (see above), you will know that this is something of a 
			balancing act because there are three main issues to contend with:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Reliability:<br />
				<img alt="reliable" height="133" src="../../images/link_rope_mooring200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				A reliable test is one which will produce the same result if it 
				is administered again (and again). &nbsp;In other words, it is not 
				affected by the learner' mood, level of tiredness, attitude etc.<br />
				This is not too challenging area in the case of assessing 
				reading because the test items are fixed and repeatable.<br />
				We do need, however, to be aware that very long reading texts 
				are unlikely to target skills individually and may overwhelm 
				learners who are otherwise good readers of certain text types.&nbsp; 
				A range of short tasks focused as far as possible on micro 
				skills is a better way forward in most circumstances.<br />
				Assessment, too, is often repeatable and double or triple 
				marking can be used to raise reliability.</li>
				<li>Validity:<br />
				<img alt="valid" height="133" src="../../images/stamp_valid200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Two questions here:<ol class="auto-style6">
				<li>do the texts represent the sorts of texts the learners are 
				likely to encounter?<br />
				For example, if we set out to test someone's ability to 
				read academic materials effectively, we need to ensure that the 
				topic area is valid for them.</li>
					<li>do we have enough tasks to target all the skills we want 
					to assess?<br />
					For example, if we want to test the ability to use context 
					and co-text to infer meaning, do 
					we have a task or tasks focused explicitly and discretely on that 
					skill?</li>
			</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Practicality:<br />
				<img alt="balance" height="133" src="../../images/balance_stones_a200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Against the two main factors, we have to balance practicality.<br />
				It may be advisable to set as many different tasks as possible 
				to ensure reliability and to try to measure as many of the 
				subskills as possible in the same assessment procedure to ensure 
				validity but in the real world, time is often limited and 
				concentration spans are not infinite.<br />
				Practicality applies to both learners and assessors:<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>for learners, the issue is often one of test fatigue.<br />
					Too many tests over too short a time may result in learners 
					losing commitment to the process.<br />
					On shorter courses, in particular, testing too much can be 
					perceived as a waste of learning time.</li>
					<li>for the assessors, too many time-consuming tests which 
					need careful assessment and concentration may put an impractical load on time and 
					resources.&nbsp; Assessors 
					may become tired and unreliable.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Say we have a short (150-hour) course for motivated B2-level 
			learners who will need to operate comfortably in an English-speaking 
			culture where they will live and work.&nbsp; They will need, 
			therefore, to be able to read and understand a wide and unpredictable range of texts so we 
			need to focus our assessment on generic, recognisable reading 
			skills.<br />
			We have around three hours of the course earmarked for this 
			assessment.<br />
			What sorts of items could we include, bearing mind reliability, 
			validity and practicality?<br />

			<p>It may be that your circumstances allow for a very simple 
			reading 
			tasks such as those requiring the learners to answer multiple-choice 
			or other comprehension questions such as sentence completion tasks 
			or tasks requiring the selection of appropriate re-wordings.&nbsp; This kind of test can be 
			done in the classroom or elsewhere.<br />
			Those are all legitimate 
			tasks providing the task type and content suits the purposes of 
			assessment.<br />
			There are other ways.<br />
			No list can be complete, but here are some other ideas for other 
			ways to set reading tasks for assessment purposes.&nbsp; <strong>The 
			content of any task will of course, depend on all the factors 
			discussed so far.</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Scanning tasks<br />
				<img alt="scanning" height="133" src="../../images/eye_green200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				These tasks always require longer texts but the task itself can 
				be graded even if the text is ostensibly beyond the learners' 
				level.&nbsp; Just finding dates and times in an otherwise 
				complex text is a good test of the ability to scan and ignore 
				the unnecessary.</li>
				<li>Compare and contrast tasks<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

						<img alt="house 1" height="100" src="../../images/lakeside150.jpg" width="150" /></td>

					</tr>
				</table>
				See above for an example of this task type.</li>
				<li>Matching tasks<br />
				<img alt="golfer" height="133" src="../../images/sport_golf_multiple200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Getting people to match a short text to a picture (or series of 
				similar pictures where only one represents the content of the 
				text) is a good test of detailed understanding.</li>
				<li>Multiple-choice tests<br />
				<img alt="mc" height="133" src="../../images/selection_pumkins200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				These tests can be carefully targeted on particular items in the 
				text to test the ability to read for detail, infer likely 
				meaning of lexemes and understand tense relationships and so on.&nbsp; 
				They can also be targeted at the ability to unpack complexity 
				and figure out the subject and object of verb phrases.</li>
				<li>How to ... stimuli<br />
				<img alt="origami" height="133" src="../../images/origami200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				In these tests, learners may be required to read instructions 
				and carry out tasks according to what they understand.&nbsp; 
				Popular topics are origami and following directions to locate 
				something.&nbsp; They can be motivating and intriguing tests.</li>
				<li>Labelling tasks<br />
				<img alt="labelling" height="133" src="../../images/label200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				In these tasks, the learners are given a diagram of something 
				fairly complicated and asked to match the descriptions of 
				various labels (A, B, C ...) to the parts of the diagram that 
				the text refers to.</li>
				<li>Identifying referents<br />
				<img alt="presentation" height="133" src="../../images/present200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				These tasks are finely targeted at getting learners to identify 
				what words such as <em>this, that, it, they </em>etc. refer to 
				in the text.</li>
				<li>Synonym and hyponym finding<br />
				<img alt="owl" height="133" src="../../images/birds_owl200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				In these tasks, learners are given either a synonym, a matching 
				definition or a hyponym and asked to locate in the text a word 
				that matches the definition, is a synonym in this context or a 
				hyponym of the hypernym they have been given.&nbsp; E.g., <em>An 
				owl refers to a type of ..., Another word for 'baby bird' is ...</em>etc.</li>

			<p>Unlike writing and speaking tests, in which holistic, impression 
			marking can be done, reading tests are normally marked analytically.<br />
			This involves breaking down the tasks and being specific about 
				the criteria you are using to judge success.&nbsp; Any amount of 
			weighting can be applied to whichever of the micro skills you judge 
			to be most important.<br />
				Normally, the results of a reading test are permanent in some 
			way (short answers, multiple choice responses and so on).&nbsp; Even 
			the success of a 'How to ..' task (above) can be objectively marked.&nbsp; 
			This means that marking can be objective (and the test is reliable, 
			to that degree) but, unless the test items target recognisable and 
			definable micro skills, validity is always problematic.</p>
