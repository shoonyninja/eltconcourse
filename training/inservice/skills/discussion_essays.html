			<h1>For and Against Discussion Essays (FADEs)</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="discuss" height="207" src="../../images/five_discuss310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Learners working in English for Academic Purposes are not alone 
			in needing the skills to write FADEs.&nbsp; They are also important 
			in business, education, government and other fields where the 
			ability logically and dispassionately to set out arguments for and 
			against a proposal or situation is valued.<br />
			The social sciences, in particular, value written, balanced 
			arguments.<br />
			For this reason, this guide is linked from both the EAP sections and 
			the general skills and discourse indexes.</p>

					<h2>Exclusions</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>It is important to be clear about what FADEs are not.&nbsp; They 
			are not:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Expositions<br />
				which require the writer to set out one side of an argument and 
				attempt to persuade the reader of a point of view.</li>
				<li>Reports<br />
				which require the writer to set out facts in logical stages with 
				some discussion of each.</li>
				<li>Problem-Solution texts<br />
				which require the writer to set out the problems and suggest 
				solutions for each which are evaluated in terms of 
				effectiveness, advantages and drawbacks.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Confusing the text types will bewilder learners.</p>

					<h2>Aims and Purposes</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>All texts have purposes.&nbsp; One definition of genre is that it 
			contains texts which share the same cultural purposes.&nbsp; 
			Discussion is no exception so we need to identify what exactly the 
			purpose of a FADE is.&nbsp; We will start with this definition of 
			purpose:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">to look at more than one side of an issue: to 
			explore various perspectives before coming to an informed decision<br />
			<span class="auto-style6">Butt <em>et al</em>, 2001:9</span></p>
			<p>and unpack it a little:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>more than one side ... various 
				perspectives</em></span>:<br />
				A common error in students' writing (and in some teaching) is to 
				see dichotomies where none exists or even to invent them.&nbsp; 
				Few important issues have only two sides and there are shades of 
				opinion and many perspectives which need to be considered.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>to explore</em></span>:<br />
				This requires the writer to identify, discuss and exemplify a 
				point of view, not simply state it.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>an informed decision</em></span>:<br />
				so not a simple statement of a point of view uninfluenced by 
				facts and research.&nbsp; The coda (at the end of the essay) 
				needs to refer to the facts that have been set out.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The result of bearing these three issues in mind is that an essay 
			will impress the reader with the depth of thought that lies behind 
			it and gets away from <em><span class="style_black">some people 
			think X, some people think Y but I agree with Z</span>.</em></p>

					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>The staging of a discussion in English (not necessarily in the 
			languages of other cultures) is, on the face of it, quite simple.&nbsp; 
			It comes in two basic options:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style10">Structure 1</td>
					<td class="auto-style10">Structure 2</td>
				</tr>

					<img alt="structure1" height="327" src="../../imagesgraphics/fade_structure_1.jpg" width="310" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="structure2" height="326" src="../../imagesgraphics/fade_structure_2.jpg" width="310" />&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The first and last stages are common to both forms and, in fact, 
			the last, the Coda, is often optional.&nbsp; The other stages are 
			not.</p>
			<p>A classic error is to mix the structures and, for example, start 
			with structure 1 and give a bunch of arguments for and then confuse 
			the reader by transitioning to structure 2 and mix the points up.&nbsp; 
			That disconcerts, disorientates and displeases.</p>
			<p>We can break all this down and exemplify what is meant.&nbsp; As 
			an example, we will take a topic in a field in which there are few 
			technical terms and special registers to be considered.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<h3>Identify the issue</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Only at very low levels should this be a one-sentence section.&nbsp; 
			It involves two parts and each should be properly refined and 
			defined:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The particular topic of the essay needs, of course, to be 
				stated clearly both in the title and the introductory paragraph 
				but then the issue has to be set in its wider context and 
				properly defined.</li>
				<li>The importance of the issue has to be stated in general 
				terms and then has to be further refined to set out what is 
				meant by importance: to whom, in what circumstances, says who?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here's an example of the introduction to a FADE of the pros and 
			cons of allowing smoking in public spaces:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">This essay concerns whether smoking should be 
			allowed in public spaces and attempts to set out the arguments that 
			have been proposed for and against permitting it.&nbsp; This is a 
			social, legal and public health issue and in what follows these 
			aspects of the subject will be taken in turn.<br />
			For the purposes of this essay, public spaces are defined as any 
			areas outside private homes which are open to the public either free 
			of charge or on payment of an entrance fee.&nbsp; It includes, 
			therefore, open spaces, shops, bars, public houses, services and 
			utilities such as airports and train stations as well as public 
			roads and streets.&nbsp; Excluded from consideration are private 
			spaces although consideration will be given to borderline cases such 
			as hotel rooms, hostels, prisons and private vehicles.<br />
			Smoking is defined as the use of tobacco in pipes, cigarettes and 
			cigars but excludes other, non-smoking ways of ingesting tobacco.&nbsp; 
			Consideration will also be given to the recent development of 
			e-cigarettes.<br />
			The issue is important for three reasons.<br />
			Firstly, there are public health concerns regarding the use of 
			tobacco and its effects both on individuals and those around them.&nbsp; 
			This includes the resources devoted to the care of those whose 
			illnesses may have been caused or exacerbated by smoking.<br />
			Secondly, it is a social issue in which the rights of individuals 
			need to be balanced against the rights of others and society as a 
			whole.<br />
			Thirdly, it is a legal and ethical issue insofar as it concerns the 
			extent to which the law should be used as a social engineering tool 
			to encourage, enforce or prohibit the activities of individuals.</p>
			<p>This is a rather sophisticated introduction written by a 
			competent user of English and learners are unlikely to be able to 
			produce writing of this sort without a good deal of help and 
			teaching.&nbsp; However, such a text may serve as a model for 
			learners to encourage them to say more than just what the essay is 
			about and to define their terms from the outset.&nbsp; A check-list 
			is helpful for this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>State the topic</li>
				<li>What sort if issue is it?<ol>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">organisational</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">political</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">social</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">public health</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">financial</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">legal</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">economic</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">industrial<br />
					etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>What terms do you need to define?</li>
				<li>Give two reasons why the issue is important.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Given such a list, even learners at lower levels can begin to 
			develop an introduction that is more than a title.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="hand" height="133" src="../../images/on_one_hand200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h3>Arguments</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>These lie at the core of the essay and should be carefully 
			constructed.&nbsp; If the introduction has successfully previewed 
			the areas into which the arguments fall, organisation becomes 
			significantly easier.<br />
			The most important issue here is to avoid what has been termed 
			spaghetti writing characterised by rambling sentences, short 
			unconnected points or a stream-of-consciousness approach.&nbsp; Good 
			advice is to confine each argument to four paragraphs:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>the issue and examples</li>
				<li>the argument</li>
				<li>the evaluation of the strength of the argument</li>
				<li>the evaluation of any weaknesses in the argument</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="indentpara">The damage to health that smoking causes is no 
			longer seriously debated by health professionals and other experts.&nbsp; 
			It has been shown in numerous well-conducted studies that smoking 
			tobacco has a range of detrimental effects including but not limited 
			to cancer, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory illnesses, reduced 
			fertility and damage to unborn babies.<br />
			For this reason, there are many who argue that an absolute ban on 
			smoking in public spaces is required to protect individuals from the 
			effects of smoking.&nbsp; Banning smoking, it is argued, will reduce 
			the amount people smoke, encourage abstinence and reduce the costs 
			to the health care services as well as improving the population's 
			overall fitness.<br />
			This is a strong point because the costs to individuals and society 
			can be readily estimated and the potential health benefits of a 
			non-smoking society are also quantifiable in terms of health 
			service, insurance and other costs.<br />
			However, this argument relies on the assumption that it is society's 
			right and duty to protect individuals from their own actions.&nbsp; 
			Extended logically, the argument might just as well apply to banning 
			dangerous sports, such as mountaineering or solo yachting, boxing 
			and even horse riding, rugby, judo and other contact sports, all of 
			which cause thousands of deaths and injuries worldwide every year 
			and all of which people take part in voluntarily despite the risks.&nbsp; 
			These activities, too, involve costs for health services and the 
			emergency services whose members own safety may be put at risk 
			rescuing others from the results of their own choices of 
			recreational activities.</p>
			<p>Again, only advanced learners are likely to be able to produce 
			such a sophisticated text but, as before, such texts can be used as 
			models to develop their own writing.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>State the field in which the argument lies (financial, 
				health, social, legal etc.)</li>
				<li>State the argument clearly</li>
				<li>State the argument's strength</li>
				<li>State the argument's weakness</li>
			</ol>

					<h3>Coda</h3>

				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>A coda may be defined as <em>a concluding remark</em>.&nbsp; The 
			word <em>conclude</em>, of course, also implies arriving at an 
			opinion by deduction (not just stating a view) so the section needs 
			attention.</p>
			<p>Here, the job of the writer is to draw the reader' attention to 
			the points which need to be emphasised and convince them that a just 
			and fair conclusion has been arrived at by weighing the facts and 
			arguments that have been identified.<br />
			It comes in four parts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Identification of the main issue</li>
				<li>Identification of difficulties</li>
				<li>Reiteration of the strongest points</li>
				<li>Statement of view</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here's an example to treat in the same way as the previous ones.&nbsp; 
			It's more than can be expected of all but the strongest students but 
			would serve as a model.</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Whether smoking should be banned in all public 
			spaces is by no means an easy issue to determine.<br />
			Firstly, there is a tension between the public and private spheres 
			regarding the extent to which the rights of smokers may be 
			subordinated to the rights of others to breath clean air.<br />
			Secondly, there is the issue of social costs and how far only one 
			type of potentially dangerous voluntary activity should be 
			controlled because of the costs that may be involved to society as a 
			whole.<br />
			Thirdly, there is the ethical issue of how far the law should be 
			involved in the private decisions and choices of individuals.<br />
			Arguments on both sides have merits and there are many intermediate 
			points of view that lie between no control at all and an outright, 
			universal ban.<br />
			On balance, it seems that the costs to society and to the health of 
			its members are more important than the respect we owe to allowing 
			individuals to make informed choices concerning their own lives.&nbsp; 
			Smoking is not an activity which only affects the smoker.&nbsp; 
			Others are affected by the degradation of their surroundings, damage 
			to their own health and costs to society as a whole to which all 
			taxpayers contribute.<br />
			A reasonable position to take, advocated here, is to limit smoking 
			in circumstances which most affect non-smokers but to allow 
			individuals to make choices in other settings.<br />
			This will mean banning smoking in enclosed public spaces such as 
			shops, bars, caf&eacute;s, cinemas, theatres and so on but permitting it in 
			private spaces and in the open air where the risk of damage caused 
			to others is either voluntarily run or negligible.</p>

			<p>In what follows, we will draw on the examples already given to

			As it is unlikely that the ability to write a discussion is

			from the outset that the learners can competently produce acceptable 
			syntax, control most of the tense structures of English, can make 
			passive and active voice sentences and use a range of conjunction.<br />
			We shall not assume that they are familiar with complex pre- and 
			post-modification or the large range of discoursal features that are 
			needed in a FADE.</p>

			<p>Here's one short paragraph from the example used above:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The damage to health that smoking causes is no 
			longer seriously debated by health professionals and other experts.&nbsp; 
			It has been shown in numerous well-conducted studies that smoking 
			tobacco has a range of detrimental effects including but not limited 
			to cancer, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory illnesses, reduced 
			fertility and damage to unborn babies.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The first sentence in this section is, structurally, about as 
			simple as we get in English and akin to, for example:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book is 
			published</em></span><br />
			because it consists of a subject, a copular verb and an attribute.&nbsp; 
			The fact that the attribute is a participle so the sentence is also 
			analysable as a passive is actually not very important.&nbsp; It 
			breaks down like this:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style14">Subject noun phrase</td>
					<td class="auto-style20">Copular verb / auxiliary verb 
					phrase</td>
					<td class="auto-style16">Adjective / verb phrase</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style17"><em>The book</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style18"><em>is</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style19"><em>published</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>and we can do exactly the same to the longer, apparently more 
			complex sentence, like this:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style14">Subject noun phrase</td>
					<td class="auto-style20">Copular verb / auxiliary verb 
					phrase + modification</td>
					<td class="auto-style16">Adjective / verb phrase</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style17"><em>The damage to health that 
					smoking causes </em></td>
					<td class="auto-style18"><em>is no longer</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style19"><em>seriously debated by health 
					professionals and other experts</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>A feature of many academic texts and of FADEs in particular is 
			that noun, verb and adjective phrases often contain a good deal of 
			pre- and post-modification to make the expression of the data more 
			concise and accessible.&nbsp; We can of course, avoid most of this 
			with shorter, less informative sentences and could produce a 
			paragraph such as:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Smoking causes damage to health.&nbsp; The 
			damage used to be debated.&nbsp; The damage is not debated now.&nbsp; 
			Health professionals do not debate this.&nbsp; Other experts do not 
			debate this.</p>
			<p>but the outcome is clumsy and inefficient.</p>
			<p>A primary teaching aim is to focus, therefore, on how pre- and 
			post-modification of items is achieved in English.&nbsp; There are 
			guides to modification elsewhere on this site so the point will not 
			be discussed at length here.&nbsp; See the links to related guides 
			at the end.</p>
			<p>However, to teach this kind of structure is not as hard as it may 
			seem.&nbsp; We can start with something easy, like this and proceed 
			as suggested:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Homework is useful</em></span><br />
				Add a relative clause to say what sort of 
				homework:</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Homework which is set by the 
				teacher is useful</em></span><br />
				Add 
				an adverb and another verb to make a phrase:</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Homework which is usually set 
				and marked by the teacher is useful</em></span><br />
				Add an adjective phrase for the subject:</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Subject-related homework which 
				is usually set and marked by the teacher is useful</em></span><br />
				Add a prepositional phrase to say who 
				benefits:</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Subject-related homework which 
				is usually set and marked by the teacher is useful for school 
				children</em></span></li>
				<li>Now add a conjunction and another clause to say why this is 
				true:<br /><em><span class="style_black">Subject-related homework which is 
				usually set and marked by the teacher is useful for school 
				children because it helps them to learn</span></em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once learners get the hang of doing this to simple and 
			undemanding sentences, they can revisit their own writing to see how 
			to compress more data into each clause and make the writing more 
			sophisticated and interesting as well as densely informative.</p>

			<p>Once complexity is built into clauses, we can move on to how 
			clauses are connected to make complex and compound sentences.<br />
			Here is another example taken from the texts we have already used:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Firstly, there is a tension between the public 
			and private spheres regarding the extent to which the rights of 
			smokers may be subordinated to the rights of others to breath clean 
			air.<br />
			Secondly, there is the issue of social costs and how far only one 
			type of potentially dangerous voluntary activity should be 
			controlled because of the costs that may be involved to society as a 
			whole.</p>
			<p>There are three systems at work here: prepositional links, 
			conjunctions and conjuncts and they need to be handled separately.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Prepositional links:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>a tension between the public and 
				private spheres </em><span class="style_underline"><strong><em>regarding</em></strong></span><em> the 
				extent</em></span><br />
				Prepositions often function as linkers.&nbsp; Other examples 
				are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A discussion
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>concerning</strong></span> 
				the policy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision was made <span class="style_underline"><strong>
				in keeping with</strong></span> the policy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people acted <span class="style_underline"><strong>
				according to</strong></span> the policy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The debated <span class="style_underline"><strong>relating to</strong></span> 
				the issue of policy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matters <span class="style_underline"><strong>pertaining to</strong></span> 
				government policy</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Learners need teaching and lots of practice in deploying less 
				familiar linking prepositions to enhance their writing.&nbsp; 
				Some to consider are:<br />
				<em>according to, against, ahead of, alongside, apropos, bar, 
				barring, concerning, considering, despite, excluding, failing, 
				following, in keeping with, in place of, notwithstanding, other 
				than, pertaining to, regarding, thanks to, throughout, unlike, 
				versus, via<br />
				</em>Teaching in the area involves the same kinds of procedures 
				one might use to teach any form of linking device.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />

					<td class="auto-style24"><em>The outcome of the enquiry&nbsp;</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style23"><em>the excessive cost overruns</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
				</li>
				<li>Conjunction<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>should be controlled
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>because</strong></span> of 
				the costs</em></span><br />
				contains a simple subordinating conjunction and subordination is 
				a key way to link ideas and make more complex, denser sentences.&nbsp; 
				The choice of subordinator is often constrained by genre and for 
				a FADE, the most usual will be those which signal cause and 
				effect, contingency and contrast.&nbsp; Here the example is <em>
				because </em>but other, more sophisticated and unusual 
				conjunctions to consider teaching include:<br /><em><em>albeit, as long as, assuming (that), 
				consequently, considering (that), even though, hence, insofar 
				as, lest, provided, providing (that), supposing (that), thus, 
				unless, whereas, whilst, yet</em><br />
				</em>Teaching in the area involves the same kinds of procedures 
				one might use to teach any form of linking device.&nbsp; For 
				example:<table cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style27" colspan="3">
					Join the parts on the left using <span class="style_underline"><strong> 
				some of</strong></span> the conjunctions on the right</td>

				</tr>
			</table>
				</li>
				<li>Conjuncts<br />
				Confusing conjuncts with conjunctions is a major source of error 
				for learners trying to write formally.&nbsp; They are 
				superficially attractive because their use is often a sign of 
				sophisticated writing but they need to be handled with some 
				care.&nbsp; Errors such as:<br />
				<em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The problem is severe moreover it is difficult to solve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The problem is severe.&nbsp; Although it is not difficult to 
				solve.<br />
				</em>are common outcomes of confusing conjunct with conjunction.<br />
				Examples of conjunct use from above are:<br /><em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, there 
				is the issue of social costs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On balance, it seems that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, there are many<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this argument relies on </span><br />
				</em>Conjuncts expressing the following concepts are frequently 
				needed in FADEs:</li>
				<li>addition: <em>
				additionally, further, furthermore, in addition, 
				moreover.<br />
				</em><strong>exemplification</strong>: <em>a case in point is, as an example, as an 
				illustration, e.g., for example, such as.<br />
				</em><strong>enumeration</strong>: <em>at the outset, finally, firstly etc., in the first 
				instance, initially, primarily, subsequently.<br />
				</em><strong>result</strong>:<em> as a consequence, consequently, for this / that reason, 
				hence, in consequence, in view of that, thus.<br />
				</em><strong>contrast</strong>: <em>otherwise, on the other hand, as a matter of fact, 
				conversely, in contrast, at any rate, nonetheless, yet.<br />
				</em><strong>equating</strong>: <em>alternatively, by the same token, correspondingly, 
				equally, i.e., likewise, namely, similarly.<br />
				</em><strong>summation</strong>: <em>concisely, in conclusion, in sum, to sum up.</em><br />
				Any of these categories can form the foundation for a lesson.<br />A similar teaching / practice idea is:<table cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">

						<td class="auto-style27" colspan="3">Use one of the 
						conjuncts on the right to introduce the second sentence</td>

				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It should be emphasised that teaching this kind of idea linking 
			should precede the demand for learners to produce fully finished 
			essays.</p>

				</table>
			<p>Here we are on simpler ground.</p>
			<p>The following sorts of verbal processes are common to many 
			differently focused FADEs.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Existential:<br />
				These are almost always introduced by <em>it</em> or <em>there
				</em>followed by a 
				simple copular verb.&nbsp; They are easy enough to deploy but 
				learners often need help in noticing the need for them.&nbsp; 
				For example, from the texts above:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>there are
				</strong>many 
				who argue that an absolute ban on smoking in public spaces is 
				required<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>it seems </strong>that the costs to society and to the health of its 
				members are more important</em></span><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>It has been 
				shown </strong>in numerous well-conducted studies that</em></span></li>
				<li>Relational:<br />
				As the name suggests, these verbal processes link two items.&nbsp; 
				Examples from above include:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; areas outside 
				private homes <strong>which are</strong> open to the public<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; points of view <strong>that lie</strong> between no control at all and an 
				outright, universal ban<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; costs to society and to the health of its members <strong>are</strong> more 
				important than</em></span><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguments on 
				both sides <strong>have</strong> merits</em></span><br />
				Setting up relationships between ideas is central to the role of 
				writing a good FADE.</li>
				<li>Material and behavioural processes:<br />
				These refer either to how people or things act.&nbsp; Example 
				from above include:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The damage to 
				health that smoking <strong>causes</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the law should be <strong>used</strong> as a social engineering tool<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; illnesses may have been <strong>caused</strong> or exacerbated by smoking</em></span><br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>banning</strong> smoking in enclosed 
				public spaces</em></span><br />
				Which verbs learners will need will depend greatly on the topic 
				under discussion, of course.&nbsp; That they will need to deploy 
				verbs relating to material and behavioural processes is not in 
				doubt.</li>
				<li>Projecting:<br />
				These refer to what people believe or say and are central.&nbsp; 
				Examples from above include:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer 
				seriously debated<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there are many who argue that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smoking is defined as</em></span></li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Tense use</strong> is also predictably simple.</p>
			<p>Almost all the verbs in the examples given above are in the 
			present simple because the discussion involves a current situation.&nbsp; 
			Occasionally, the present perfect may be used to refer to a previous 
			event that has significant present consequences, as in, for example:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been shown 
			in numerous well-conducted studies that</em></span><br />
			Otherwise, the simple present is conventionally used throughout.</p>
			<p><strong>Passive-voice clauses</strong> serve to distance the writer from the topic 
			by implying that it is the action that is important, not who did it 
			and that is conventionally how the tone of FADEs is achieved.&nbsp; 
			For example, from above:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public spaces are 
			defined as</em></span><br />
			not:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am defining ...<br />
			</em>&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; voluntary 
			activity should be controlled</em></span><br />
			not:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The state should control<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			There are many more examples and if you use a model text as a 
			teaching tool, it is worth taking the time to notice the frequency 
			and effect of the structures.</p>
			<p><strong>Modal auxiliary verbs</strong> are used sparingly and generally confined 
			to their function as hedging tactics or to express degrees of 
			certainty.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Banning smoking, it 
			is argued, will reduce<br />
			</em></span>a predictive use.<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose illnesses may 
			have been caused<br />
			</em></span>a hedging use.<br />
			Occasionally, usually hedged, modal auxiliary verbs of obligation are used but 
			almost never ones which express absolute obligation (deontic 
			modality, in the trade).&nbsp; For 
			example in</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Whether smoking <span class="style_underline">
			<strong>should</strong></span> be banned in all public 
			spaces is by no means an easy issue to determine.<br />
			Firstly, there is a tension between the public and private spheres 
			regarding the extent to which the rights of smokers 
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>may</strong></span> be 
			subordinated to the rights of others to breath clean air.<br />
			Secondly, there is the issue of social costs and how far only one 
			type of potentially dangerous voluntary activity 
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>should</strong></span> be 
			controlled because of the costs that may be involved to society as a 
			whole.<br />
			Thirdly, there is the ethical issue of how far the law 
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>should</strong></span> be 
			involved in the private decisions and choices of individuals.</p>
			<p>all the uses are putative rather than expressing obligation
			<em>per se</em>.<br />
			Modality in FADE writing is usually focused on the likelihood of a 
			proposition being true.&nbsp; That is epistemic modality and there 
			is a link below which will take you to a guide.</p>

					<h3>Circumstances</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Circumstances refer to concepts such as location in time or 
			space, contingency, cause, matter, means and angle.&nbsp; Many of 
			these, including contingency, matter, angle and cause have been 
			considered above under conjunction and prepositional links.<br />
			However, the discussion would not be complete without some 
			consideration of how adverbials and prepositional phrases in 
			particular are used in a FADE.&nbsp; Here are some key examples:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Location</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to both time and place.&nbsp; In a FADE, the topic 
				will normally determine which are most relevant.&nbsp; Above, 
				the focus is on circumstances of place and exemplified by, for 
				example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; areas outside 
				private homes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; individuals and those around them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in other settings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in enclosed public spaces<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in private spaces<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the open air</em></span></dd>
				<dt><strong>Extent</strong></dt>
				<dd>refer to concepts concerning how far, how long, how often 
				etc.&nbsp; There are examples in the texts above:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regarding the 
				extent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in circumstances which most affect non-smokers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how far the law should be involved</em></span><br />
				Because a FADE is written to be tentative and discursive rather 
				than persuasive, verbs are often tempered by an expression of 
				limitation on the extent of their application.</dd>

					<h2>Paragraph structure and theme-rheme connections</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>There is a guide, linked below, to how theme-rheme structures are 
			achieved in writing.&nbsp; Here it will be enough to consider two 
			aspects only and we'll take this paragraph as the example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">On balance, it seems that the costs to society and to the health of 
			its members are more important than the respect we owe to allowing 
			individuals to make informed choices concerning their own lives.&nbsp; 
			Smoking is not an activity which only affects the smoker.&nbsp; 
			Others are affected by the degradation of their surroundings, damage 
			to their own health and costs to society as a whole to which all 
			taxpayers contribute.:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The topic sentence<br />
				It is not invariably the case that every paragraph in a 
				well-written FADE will begin with a topic sentence to alert the 
				reader to its contents but that is the way most texts work and, 
				for novice writers in particular, a safe way to proceed.<br />
				In our example, the first two word of the first sentence, the 
				conjunct, to give it its proper name, tell the reader what this 
				paragraph will do: sum up and conclude.</li>
				<li>The theme and the rheme<br />
				The theme of the first sentence is the subject of the verb 
				(excluding the hedging in <em>it seems</em>).&nbsp; That subject 
				is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>the costs to society and to the 
				health of its members</em></span><br />
				and its rheme, which follows is<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are more 
				important than the respect we owe to allowing individuals to 
				make informed choices concerning their own lives</em></span><br />
				The reference to <em>individuals</em> is taken up as the theme of the 
				next sentence with<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smoking is not 
				an activity which only affects the smoker</em></span><br />
				and that rheme, <em>only affects the smoker</em>, becomes the theme of the 
				next sentence with:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others are 
				affected</em></span><br />
				and so the coherence of the whole paragraph is maintained.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Simple approaches to teaching in this area involve:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>Recognition, noticing and analysis using cut-up paragraphs for 
				re-sorting, jumbled sentences for re-ordering and so on.&nbsp; 
				The aim is to get learners to <strong>notice</strong> how topic 
				sentences are used in the first instance.</li>
				<li>Giving learners paragraphs without topic sentences and 
				getting them to compose something suitable.</li>
				<li>Analysing theme-rheme structures by tracing connections, 
				underlining links and so on.</li>
				<li>Getting learners to write short paragraphs of their own and 
				analysing them to see how (and whether) the theme-rheme links 
				are working.</li>

			<p>Short-term, the goal of learners' writing is probably for some 
			kind of assessment purpose, either of their language skills or their 
			subject knowledge and ability to construct rational arguments.<br />
			The target audience is often, therefore, a single teacher or tutor 
			rather than the audience one imagines for most essays in 
			non-educational settings which may be somewhat wider.<br />
			However, a long-term objective is to apply the skills learned in 
			real-world settings for true communicative purposes.<br />
			Possible audiences include, therefore:</p>
			<ul class="smallgreybullet">
				<li>a teacher or tutor</li>
				<li>colleagues</li>
				<li>higher management</li>
				<li>policy makers</li>
				<li>readers of newspaper or magazine articles</li>
				<li>readers of technical or trade journals</li>
				<li>readers of academic journals</li>
				<li>website visitors to serious sites</li>
				<li>website visitors to blog sites (although few of these 
				contain argued discussion, normally being just unsupported 
				bluster)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and more.</p>
			<p>The nature of the audience will determine a number of issues and 
			can affect the choice of lexis as well as the choice of grammatical 
			structures.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Lexical choice</strong></dt>
				<dd>In the examples above we find phrases such as<br />
&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp; a range of detrimental effects</em></span><br />
				which might, when formality is less of an issue be rendered as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lots of nasty effects</em><br />

				<em>&nbsp;<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp; allowing individuals to make informed

				which less formally could be  rephrased<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; letting people make up their own minds</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Cohesive devices</strong></dt>
				<dd>The discussion of these above focused on some more formal, 
				less frequently encountered linking devices but less formal 
				texts may, for example, replace:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>pertaining to </em>with <em>about</em> or <em>of</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>notwithstanding</em> with <em>however</em> or <em>but</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>hence</em> with <em>so</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>whereas</em> with <em>but</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>providing</em> with <em>if</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>furthermore</em> with <em>to boot</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a case in point </em>with <em>for instance</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>conversely</em> with <em>on the other hand</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				By the way, many of these elements are now referred to as 
				discourse markers, a term which properly used refers to how 
				speakers manage conversation, and we have avoided its use here 
				as it has lost all utility in proper analysis.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Grammar</strong></dt>
				<dd>There are numerous examples of the use of the passive and 
				hedging modal expressions which may appear less frequently in 
				texts addressed to a more familiar audience requiring less 
				distancing or formality.<br />
				For example, we may replace:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>it has been shown</em> with <em>we have found out</em>
				<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>it may be considered</em> with <em>we should think about</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;it can be argued</em> with <em>it seems reasonable that</em><br />
				etc.</dd>

			<p>Writing well in this genre is not achievable overnight or in a 
			lesson or two.<br />
			Teaching demands consistency in 
			planning and delivery over a series of lessons with sensible and 
			achievable tasks to be accomplished along the way.<br />
			You may decide, based on your reading, the nature of the learners and 
			your own propensities, to adopt a product, process or genre approach 
			to teaching writing skills but whichever approach you take, you will 
			almost certainly have to find or compose model texts which can be 
			drawn on for examples of the language that needs to be used.&nbsp; 
			There are examples which you are welcome to use above.<br />
			An outline syllabus might appear something like:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder" style="width: 730px">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style92" style="width: 364px">Lesson series</td>
					<td class="auto-style93" style="width: 364px">Language foci</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style91" style="width: 364px">
			<ol>
				<li>Focus on the purpose of FADE writing.</li>
				<li>Focus on general structure and staging</li>
				<li>Practising (based on an analysed model) writing the 
				introduction which identifies the area, sets it in context and 
				explains its importance</li>
				<li>Focusing on how arguments are presented, exemplified and 
				evaluated</li>
				<li>Focusing on summing up and writing a coda</li>
			</ol>
					</td>
					<td class="auto-style94" style="width: 364px">
			<ol>
				<li>Pre- and post-modification of a range of phrase types: noun 
				and verb phrases in particular</li>
				<li>Relative clauses</li>
				<li>Discourse features including prepositional links, 
				conjunctions and conjuncts</li>
				<li>Verbal processes</li>
				<li>Tense use: present simple and perfect</li>
				<li>Passive constructions</li>
				<li>Modality</li>
			</ol>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is by no means a simple syllabus to design because, although 
			the general structure of FADE writing can be explained and 
			exemplified quickly and will lead naturally to some level of 
			coherence, achieving cohesion involves weaving together the seven 
			issues identified on the right into a series of lesson focusing on 
			the elements on the left.</p>
