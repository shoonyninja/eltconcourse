		There are two other guides to reading on this site and the following 
		assumes you are familiar with the content of those.&nbsp; They are:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style25">
			<li>
			<a href="../../initial/skills/reading_overview.html" target="_blank">The guide to what reading 
			skills are</a></li>
			<li>
			<a href="../../initial/skills/reading_teaching_essentials.html" target="_blank">An essential guide to 
			teaching reading</a></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Both those open in new tabs so simple shut them to come back here 
		when you are done.<br />
		This guide recapitulates some of the information in the essential guide 
		to teaching reading.&nbsp; It does not cover topics such as skimming, 
		scanning, intensive and extensive reading skills so you will need to 
		refer to those guides if the 
		terms are unfamiliar to you or you would like to be reminded of what 
		they really mean.&nbsp; It also assumes a fundamental knowledge of what 
		reading skills are.</p>
		<p>
		Almost all lessons require the learners to read at 
		some point.&nbsp; Often, this reading is used to introduce some lexis, 
		to kick-start a discussion or focus on a grammar point.&nbsp; However, 
		reading skills in themselves can (some say should) also be a central focus for a lesson 
		or series of lessons.</p>

				<h2>Using reading texts: TALO vs. TAVI vs. TASP</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
		TALO and TAVI are terms coined by Johns and Davies (1983) and mean:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>TALO: Text as a Linguistic Object</strong></dt>
			<dd>In this approach, a reading text is used purely for language 
			input.&nbsp; It may contain, for example, grammatical items which 
			form the target of this part of the teaching programme or lexis in a 
			particular field of interest to the learners.<br />
			The approach involves mining the text for these language items (with 
			most of the hard digging done by the teacher, usually) and 
			then focusing on them for further clarification and practice.&nbsp; 
			Examples of tasks using texts for this purpose will include 
			activities such as:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>Find and underline all the words in 
			the text to do with crime and divide them into three lists: person 
			who does the crime, the crime and the verb<br />
			Find all the ways in the text where the writer is recommending what 
			should happen next.&nbsp; Make a list from strongest to weakest 
			suggestions.</em></span><br />
			This is <strong>not</strong> using the text to develop reading skills, of course, 
			except incidentally.</dd>
			<dt><strong>TAVI: Text as a Vehicle for Information</strong></dt>
			<dd>In this approach, the text <strong>is</strong> being used to develop the 
			strategies that learners need to deploy to unlock the writer's 
			meanings and attitudes.&nbsp; The theory is that this approach will 
			lead to the development of cognitive strategies which learners can 
			then use independently to access the meaning of any text they 
			encounter.<br />
			Tasks typical of a TAVI approach to reading are, for example:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>Is the writer strongly or only weakly 
			opposed to tolls on main roads?<br />
			What does the writer say about his childhood in general?&nbsp; Did 
			he have a normal childhood in your opinion?</em></span><br />
			It is a TAVI approach that is considered here because we are 
			concerned with language skills rather than language systems 
			development.</dd>
			<dt><strong>TASP: Text as a Springboard for Production</strong></dt>
			<dd>Using texts in this third way may involve a good deal of TALO 
			use first because the text may be used as a model to analyse before 
			the learners embark on constructing their own texts following the 
			same generic staging and using similar circumstances and verbal 
			processes.&nbsp; Such a procedure would be typical of
			<a href="../discourse/genre_teaching.html" target="_blank">a genre approach</a> 
			(new tab) to 
			teaching writing skills.<br />
			This approach to reading texts may be much simpler, using the text 
			purely as stimulus for discussion, role-play or a speaking activity.&nbsp; 
			Texts are frequently used this way in conversation-driven classes 
			typified by, e.g., Dogme.<br />
			Typical tasks in a TASP approach might be, for example:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>Circle the paragraphs which set the 
			scene of the story.&nbsp; Put a box around the complication in the 
			story.<br />
			Underline the verbs phrases which refer to actions and highlight the 
			verbs which refer to relationships.<br />
			Make a note of the three reasons the writer dislikes piped music.&nbsp; 
			How far do you agree?&nbsp; Talk to your group to see how much 
			agreement there is.</em></span></dd>
		</dl>
			<p>These are all methodological issues, of course, to do with how we 
			use a text.&nbsp; It is also important to consider what is called 
			the Context of Situation and that involves understanding the topic 
			of the text (i.e., the Field), who wrote the text, to whom and for 
			what purposes (i.e., the Tenor) and how the text is transmitted 
			(i.e., the Mode).<br />
			So, before diving in to the development or teaching of reading 
			skills using a text, it is worth taking a bit of time to alert the 
			learners to these three aspects of all texts.<br />
			This can be done by having a simple form to fill in, by questioning 
			and elicitation or via a short discussion among the learners.<br />
			Something like this works well:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style35" colspan="2">Before we start to read 
					the text, look at it quickly with a partner and see if you 
					can answer these questions.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style39" style="width: 303px">What is the 
					subject?</td>
					<td class="auto-style42" style="width: 304px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style39" style="width: 303px">Who wrote the

					<td class="auto-style40" style="width: 304px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style39" style="width: 303px">Why did they 
					write it?</td>
					<td class="auto-style40" style="width: 304px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style39" style="width: 303px">Who does the 
					writer think will read the text?</td>
					<td class="auto-style40" style="width: 304px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style37" style="width: 303px">Where does 
					this text come from?</td>
					<td class="auto-style41" style="width: 304px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>and takes about 5 minutes to do for most texts.<br />
			If you would like to learn more about what effect the Context of 
			Situation has on how language is used, read the guide to
			<a href="../lexicogrammar/sfg_introduction.html" target="_blank">an 
			introduction of Systemic Functional Linguistics</a>.&nbsp; That 
			guide opens in a new tab and also contains a questionnaire you can 
			use with learners for all skills work, not just reading.</p>

				<h2>Authentic texts</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>The first aim of the teaching programme is to allow learners 
			access to authentic texts.<br />
			There are two kinds of authenticity to consider:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Text authenticity</strong></dt>
				<dd>It is quite arguable that once a text has been brought into 
				a classroom and presented to learners in some way, its 
				authenticity has been compromised because it is not being used 
				for its original purpose.<br />
				Teachers may decide to highlight parts of the text for language 
				analysis (TALO) and this means that authenticity is reduced.<br />
				Teachers may decide to alter or shorten a text to make it more 
				accessible in terms of meaning (TAVI) and this, too, reduces its 
				authenticity.<br />
				Teachers may decide to focus only on parts of the text which 
				serve as models of the staging of information (TASP) and leave 
				out portions so this, too, reduces authenticity.<br />
				Any authentic text which has been tampered with will no longer 
				be authentic.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Learner authenticity</strong></dt>
				<dd>This refers to the use that the learners are putting the 
				text to.&nbsp; For example, a travel brochure is written to 
				inform and persuade prospective customers of the advantages of a 
				particular holiday destination.&nbsp; Once it has been brought 
				into the classroom it could be used<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				to identify positive adjectival phrases (TALO)<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				as way of practising scanning and skimming skills (TAVI)<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				as a model text for learners to write their own texts about 
				somewhere they know well (TASP)<br />
				All of these mean, of course, that the use to which the text is 
				put is no longer authentic because the readers are not the 
				writer's intended audience and are not reading for the same 
				reasons.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>(For more on authenticity and some discussion of authentic, 
			quasi-authentic, semi-authentic and contrived materials, see
			<a href="../../common/materials/authenticity.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
			authenticity</a>.)</p>
			<p>The aim of a reading programme will consider both types of 
			authenticity but it need not do so from the outset.</p>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				<img alt="task" height="133" src="../../images/man_task200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style19">
				<h3>Grading the task</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>The lower the level of learner, the more difficult it is to use 
			authentic materials, of course, but grading the task rather than 
			grading the text can be a productive approach.&nbsp; It does, 
			however, mean that learner authenticity is considerably reduced.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Asking A1/A2-level learners to scan a local newspaper to 
				find an advertisement for a restaurant and then identify (with a 
				dictionary if it helps) what kind of food it serves is an 
				example of a simple task being set for a complex text.&nbsp; 
				This information can then be passed on to the rest of the class 
				in terms of giving advice or information (making it both a TAVI 
				and a TASP event).</li>
				<li>Getting B1/B2-level students to read a Wikipedia article 
				presenting a biography of a famous person and draw a time line 
				of just the most important dates and events is a way of 
				developing the skill of scanning as well as raising awareness of 
				the need to ignore some of a text.</li>
				<li>Getting C1/C2-level learners to read a short story and then 
				summarise only the location, main characters, main events and 
				eventual outcomes either as a speaking task or <em>via</em> something like a 
				PowerPoint or poster presentation is a useful extensive reading 
				task which does not require 100% understanding of the text 
				itself.</li>
			</ul>

				<h3>Grading the text: removing blocks to comprehension</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Grading the text, and thereby reducing its text authenticity, is 
			the other obvious route.&nbsp; Here's an example (from Wikipedia) of a 
			section of a text with the 
			possible blocking items <span class="auto-style23">highlighted</span>:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style22">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="elvis" height="100" src="../../images/elvis155.jpg" width="155" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style43"><span class="style_black"><em>Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and
					</em></span>
					<span class="auto-style24"><em>relocated</em></span><span class="style_black"><em> to Memphis, 
					Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old.&nbsp; 
					His music career began there in 1954, when he recorded a 
					song with producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records.&nbsp;
					</em>
					<span class="auto-style23"><em>Accompanied</em></span><em> by guitarist 
					Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was an early
					</em>
					<span class="auto-style23"><em>popularizer</em></span><em> of rockabilly.</em></span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Note that <em>rockabilly</em> is not a blocking item here because 
			Presley's music is well known and the class should know what it 
			sounds like.&nbsp; If they don't, why are you using this article?</p>
		<p>If an otherwise authentic text is made inaccessible to the 
			learners because of one or two grammatical or lexical items, the 
			problem can be dealt with in three ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Glossing the items in the text with a footnote or inserted 
				comment<br />
				In the example above this would mean explaining the three 
				blockers in a footnote as, e.g.:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li><em>relocate</em> (v.): to move your home or a business to a 
					different place (e.g., <em>they are relocating my office to 
					the fifth floor</em>)</li>
					<li><em>accompany</em> (v.): to go with someone or something (e.g.,
					<em>she accompanied him to the bus station and said goodbye 
					there</em>)</li>
					<li><em>popularizer</em>: (n.): a person who makes something well 
					known and liked (e.g., <em>David Beckham was a popularizer 
					of football in the USA</em>)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Pre-teaching the blocking items<br />
				In the example above, this will mean:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li><em>relocate</em>: focus on the stem (<em>locate</em>) and use a 
					synonym such as <em>put in a place</em>, elicit the meaning 
					of the prefix <em>re-</em> and then supplying and eliciting 
					examples as above.</li>
					<li><em>accompany</em>: miming being arm-in-arm with someone and then 
					eliciting / supplying examples such as <em>the food is 
					accompanied by a salad, the violinist was accompanied by a 
					pianist, I accompanied the old lady across the street</em> 
					etc.</li>
					<li><em>popularizer</em>: again, word formation, this time 
					suffixation with <em>-ize/-ise</em> (to form the verb from 
					the adjective) and <em>-(e)r</em> (to form the doer from the 
					verb), is the focus once a synonym such as <em>liked 
					by lots of people</em> has been provided for the adjective
					<em>popular</em>.&nbsp; Then you can elicit anyone else they 
					know who popularised something.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Replacing the blocking items with simpler alternatives.&nbsp; 
				This often produces an unnatural text because synonymy 
				is not complete.&nbsp; (The dangers of using synonymy to explain 
				lexis are covered in 
				<a href="../lexicogrammar/synonymy.html" target="_blank">the guide to synonymy</a> 
				(new tab))<br />
				In this example, they could be:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li><em>relocated = moved</em></li>
					<li><em>accompanied by = playing together with</em></li>
					<li><em>popularizer = person who makes something well known 
					and liked</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		<p>A fourth alternative is to allow dictionary use, whether of 
		mono-lingual or bi-lingual sources.&nbsp; This can be effective but 
		learners need to be trained in their use or they may start looking up 
		words which are unnecessary for comprehension such as <em>producer</em> 
		in our example.<br />
		The focus on blocking items only needs to be maintained.</p>

		</table>
			<p>The degree of independence which can be encouraged is also, 
			rather obviously, level dependent to a great extent.<br />
			Tactics such as task grading and text grading (above) may encourage 
			a <em>feeling</em> of independence in the classroom but true 
			independence in reading occurs outside the classroom.<br />
			Much depends on the <strong>purposes</strong> the learners have for 
			exercising reading skills.</p>

		<p>Many learners need slightly more advanced reading skills to attain a 
		measure of independence in social and professional contexts while not 
		needing hugely sophisticated reading skills.<br />
		For such learners, the following might be a short list of what's 
		required and, therefore, what should be included in a reading skills 
		programme:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li class="greybullet">the press (skimming and intensive

			<li>educational texts (skimming, scanning and intensive reading)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>People vary widely and so do the settings in which they function so 
		this list can never be complete.<br />
		Only by investigating the needs of learners can we hope to meet their 
		aims and supply them with the strategies they need and familiarity with 
		the text types they are going to encounter and need to access.</p>

		<p>Some learners need to function fully

				<li>intensive reading</li>
				<li>extensive reading</li>
				<li>scanning</li>

		<p>This is not an easy set of targets but equipping learners with the fundamental

		<p>Increasing reading speed is often seen as a kind of Holy Grail of a 
		reading programme and there is little doubt that reading quite quickly 
		is a useful skill.<br />
		It is, however, often overemphasised at the expense of reading for 
		adequate comprehension.&nbsp; There's nothing wrong with reading quite 
		slowly if you have plenty of time and want to understand as much as you 
		can.<br />
		That said, as Nuttall (1996:127) has pointed out, there is a vicious circle at 
		work in which poor readers slow their reading rates to try to understand 
		every word and then become 
		frustrated and demotivated to read because it takes so long, so they 
		stop seeking out opportunities to read.<br />
		There is a guide for learners with a set of exercises on this site to 
		help them increase their reading speeds linked in the next section.</p>
		<p>A number of factors slow readers down: blockage by unknown lexis, 
		complex structural phenomena and so on.<br />
		A major factor is applying the wrong strategy altogether, e.g., reading 
		intensively when one should be skimming or scanning.&nbsp; The solution 
		to this problem lies in better skills training with respect to 
		recognising and implementing the appropriate strategy (or combination of 
		strategies) to deal with a particular text for a particular purpose.&nbsp; 
		For that, see above.</p>

				<h3>Word recognition skills</h3>

			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>If you have followed the first guide to what reading skills are, you 
		will recall that a reading speed of 200 words per minute is the minimum 
		which is considered adequate to understand both the sense of the words 
		and the connections between them.&nbsp; To attain speeds like these one 
		has to be able to recognise words on sight rather than laboriously 
		decoding them letter by letter or even syllable by syllable.<br />
		Sight recognition is, then, a vital preliminary skill which underlies 
		all other reading skills.&nbsp; It cannot be assumed; it must be taught.<br />
		Especially at the early stages of language learning, there are number 
		of exercises which can be used and they are especially suited to 
		computerised exercises (but needn't be done that way with some 
		imaginative use of a data projector or a simple paper-based procedure).<br />
		Here are some examples:</p>

		<p>This may seem an odd category to include in the targets of a reading 
		programme but there are good reasons for its appearance here.<br />
		Some learners, especially at lower levels, may be tempted to read aloud 
		because it seems to aid comprehension.&nbsp; It does, in fact, and it 
		has also been shown to aid memorisation and especially affects the 
		short-term memory store.</p>
		<p>Vocalisation does, however, have a demonstrably adverse effect on 
		reading speed and comprehension because the effort of articulating each word 
		slows the reader and takes away 
		from the effort that can be devoted to comprehension.<br />
		Later, the same learners may no longer be audibly reading aloud but they 
		are subconsciously forming the sounds of what they read in their heads.&nbsp; 
		This is known as sub-vocalising and everyone does it to some extent, 
		especially when trying to memorise a word or other piece of information 
		in a text.<br />
		This is not an easy habit to eradicate.&nbsp; Without specialist 
		apparatus, with which few classrooms are equipped, it is virtually 
		impossible to detect sub-vocalisation at all.<br />
		Raising awareness of its existence and implementing some of the ideas 
		for increasing reading speed (above) can be a great help.</p>

		<p>The key lies in the term 'adequate'.<br />
		For a sports report in a newspaper, 30% may be considered adequate 
		understanding but for the instructions for using a chain saw, anything 
		less than 100% comprehension is potentially dangerous.<br />
		There are some classroom strategies:</p>
		<ol class="redbullet">
			<li>To raise the learners' awareness of what is required and get 
			them away from a chase for the Holy Grail of 100% comprehension, 
			discuss explicitly what the learners understand by <strong>adequate</strong> for a 
			range of texts and purposes such as:<ol class="greybullet">
				<li>finding out the time and gate number for your flight (100%)</li>
				<li>reading a short detective story (60% will do)</li>
				<li>flipping through the local paper to see what catches your 
				eye (20% is adequate)</li>
				<li>reading a summary handout of a lecture (80% is enough)</li>
				<li>finding out if an email is spam (10%?)</li>
				<li>reading most websites (70% will do, even for this one)</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Do not require 100% accuracy in comprehension tests.&nbsp; Even 
			native speakers only average around 70% understanding in most 
			circumstances.</li>
			<li>Make sure that any tasks you set concerning comprehension bear 
			the 70% threshold in mind.&nbsp; Insert enough redundancy to allow 
			the same information to be read in two places.</li>
			<li>Vary text types and reasons for reading as much as possible in a 
			reading programme to alert the learners to what is required to be
			<em>adequate</em> understanding, bearing in mind text type and 
			purpose.</li>
			<li>Set post-reading tasks which are appropriate to the amount of 
			comprehension that is adequate for the purpose and text type.&nbsp; Requiring 
			100% comprehension of a sports report, for example, is unreasonable, 
			inappropriate and unfair.</li>
			<li>Make sure you focus at some time on TAVI even if your ultimate 
			goal is to use the text as a language resource (TALO) or a model 
			(TASP).</li>
