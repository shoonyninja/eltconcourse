			<h1>Assessing writing skills</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="writing" height="207" src="../../images/write_study310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>In this guide, two approaches to testing writing are considered 
			(and they are often combined):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It is often assumed that the best way to test writing ability is 
			to get the learners to write.&nbsp; That may seem obvious 
				but, particularly at lower levels, being asked to write a whole, 
				properly staged and formed text from scratch is a daunting and 
				challenging task which may demotivate and depress our learners.&nbsp; 
				The other issue is that reliably evaluating our learners' 
				ability with a malformed, disorganised and inaccurately written 
				text as the only data source is almost impossible.</li>
				<li>A less forbidding and more reliable and practical approach 
				is often to employ indirect tests which can be used to 
			assess the underlying skills individually.<br />For example, separately testing the learners' ability to use 
			conjunction, sequencers, pronomial referencing and so on can provide some data about 
			how well (if at all) they may be able to deploy the items in written 
			texts.&nbsp; Equally, we can separate out some of the writing skills 
				which go into making up the holistic skill of writing and test 
				these subskills separately.<br />
				Example 1: If one of the target text types our learners will 
				need to produce is a discussion of two sides of an issue (a 
				skill often required in academic settings), then it makes some 
				sense discretely to test the ability to use conjuncts, adjuncts 
				and disjuncts (such as, <em>on the other hand, seen from this 
				angle, equally, however, making matters worse, whereas</em> 
				etc.).&nbsp; The ability to soften a point of view with modal 
				expressions (such as <em>it could be argued, it may be assumed, 
				there is some evidence to suggest</em> etc.) is also a key 
				skill, incidentally.<br />
				Example 2: If a key writing skill is to summarise a mass of data 
				in clear prose (as is often required in occupational settings 
				for the production of a summary report on research), then it 
				makes sense to test the learners' ability to identify key 
				information, describe trends and make tentative predictions 
				based on the identified trends.</li>
			</ol>

				</table>
			<p>All assessment starts (or should start) from a consideration of 
			the aims of instruction.<br />
			For example, if the (or one) aim of a language course is to enable 
			the learners to do well in an IELTS academic writing examination 
			then this will be very influential in terms of the types of 
			assessment tasks we use and the way in which we measure performance.&nbsp; 
			The backwash (or washback, if you prefer) from the examination 
			format will almost inevitably have to be reflected in the task types 
			we set.<br />
			If, on the other hand, our aim is to enable the learners to operate 
			successfully in a work environment then we will set different kinds 
			of assessment tasks and measure performance against different 
			criteria.&nbsp; In this case, a priority will be to measure how 
			accurately and with how much communicative success the learners can 
			handle the specific register and functions required by their work 
			context.<br />
			Finally, if we are aiming at enabling our learners to function 
			adequately in an English-speaking environment (perhaps as an 
			immigrant or temporary resident), then this, too, will fundamentally 
			affect the tasks we set and the benchmarks against which we measure 
			success.&nbsp; Here, for example, we might be dealing with 
			<span lang="x-none"></span>form 
			filling, work getting and accessing services.</p>
			<p>There are, however, some underlying principles in the area which 
			are generally applicable regardless of the aims of the teaching 
			programme.</p>

				</table>
			<ol>
				<li>We have to use assessment tasks which properly reflect the 
				kinds of writing tasks the learners will need to be able to do 
				in 'the real world'.</li>
				<li>We need to design tasks which accurately show the learners' 
				ability.</li>
				<li>We need to have a reliable way to score the learners' 
				performance.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These three factors are to do with ensuring reliability and 
			validity.&nbsp; For more on those two concepts, see
			<a href="../background/testing.html" target="_blank">the guide to testing, assessment and evaluation</a>.&nbsp; 
			The rest of this guide assumes basic familiarity with the content of 
			that guide.<br />
			Fulfilling all three criteria adequately requires a little care.</p>

			<p>The first step is to set out exactly what writing skills are the 
			objects of the teaching programme.&nbsp; To do this, we have to 
			answer these 4 questions (which come with a few examples of the 
			kinds of answers we might get):</p>

					<h2>Identifying text types</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>The first step is to find out what sorts of texts the learners 
			will need to be able to produce.&nbsp; This is by no means an easy undertaking, 
			especially if the course is one in General English (also known as ENAP 
			[English for No Apparent Purpose]) when it is almost impossible to 
			predict what sorts of texts, for what purposes the learners may one 
			day need to write.<br />
			On courses for more specific purposes, such as in-company teaching 
			or examination preparation, it is easier to identify the 
			sorts of texts the learners will write and the purposes to which 
			they will put them.&nbsp; For example, if the writing the learners 
			will need to produce is confined to occupational purposes, it is 
			less likely that the ability to write a narrative, an exposition or 
			a discussion but the ability to write a recount (as a report), and 
			information report, a procedure and an explanation may all be 
			important.</p>
			<p>Before we can begin to assess our learners' writing skills, 
			therefore, it is important to define precisely what genre(s) they 
			need to be able to handle.&nbsp; There is very little point in, for 
			example, testing the learners' ability to write a narrative if they 
			are never going to be asked to write one.</p>
			<p>The following is a short list of the main genre types.&nbsp; The right-hand column contains some indication of the 
			structural components which are likely to be needed to produce each 
			text type.&nbsp; These will be the targets of any indirect testing 
			that is done.&nbsp; For example, if one of the target genres for our 
			learners is the ability to write an information report, we may like 
			separately to test the ability to handle relational verbal processes, tense 
					markers, causal conjuncts, exemplification, graphical 
					representations of data and so on.</p>

			<p>Now we know what sorts of thing we want to assess, the purposes 
			of the writing, the functions the learners need to be able to 
			perform and the topics they need to deal with (i.e., the register), we can get on and 
			design some assessment procedures.<br />
			Again, there are some generic guidelines for all tasks, whatever the 
			answers to the 4 questions above are.<br />
			If you have followed the guide to testing, assessment and evaluation 
			(see above), you will know that this is something of a balancing act 
			because there are three main issues to contend with.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Reliability:<br />
				<img alt="reliable" height="133" src="../../images/link_rope_mooring200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				A reliable test is one which will produce the same result if it 
				is administered again (and again). &nbsp;In other words, it is not 
				affected by the learner' mood, level of tiredness, attitude etc.<br />
				We can, of course, set a single mega-task and get the learners 
				to write for hours to complete it but we risk losing 
				reliability.&nbsp; If any or some of the learners find the topic 
				unappealing, the task too daunting or the content irrelevant to 
				them, they will almost certainly perform below their potential.<br />
				To ensure that a writing test is reliable, then, we need to set 
				as many tasks as we can over a period of days or even weeks.<br />
				This will mean that even if a particular learner in the test 
				group is feeling glum and demotivated when presented with one 
				task, the results will even out over the whole assessment.<br />
				It also means that if a particular task is unappealing to some 
				of the learners for whatever reason, other tasks will appeal 
				more and balance the results.<br />
				The type of marking that is required also plays a role here: the 
				more subjective the marking is, the less reliable will be the 
				test.<br />
				As a general rule, tests which ask the learners to write in full 
				the sorts of text that form the target of the teaching programme 
				will be less reliable and more difficult to evaluate than those 
				which break down the skill and test discrete parts of it 
				separately.</li>
				<li>Validity:<br />
				<img alt="valid" height="133" src="../../images/stamp_valid200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Three questions here:<ol class="auto-style6">
				<li>Does the test measure what we say it measures?<br />
				For example, if we set out to test someone's ability to 
				construct a discussion text for academic purposes, do the test items 
				we use actually test that ability or something else?<br />
				Again, as a general rule, testing the whole skill, rather than 
				breaking it down will result in greater validity, at the expense 
				of some reliability.</li>
				<li>Does the test contain a relevant and representative sample 
				of what it is testing?<br />
				For example, if we are testing someone's ability to write a 
				formal email, does the task we set get them to deploy the sorts 
				of language they actually need to do that?</li>
					<li>Do we have enough tasks to target all the skills we want 
					to teach?<br />
					For example, if we want to test the ability to summarise 
					information, provide information and elicit information, do 
					we have tasks focused explicitly and discretely on each 
					area?</li>
			</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Practicality:<br />
				<img alt="balance" height="133" src="../../images/balance_stones_a200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Against the two main factors, we have to balance practicality.<br />
				It may be advisable to set as many different tasks as possible 
				to ensure reliability and to try to measure as many of the 
				skills as possible in the same assessment procedure to ensure 
				validity but in the real world, time is often limited and 
				concentration spans are not infinite.<br />
				Practicality applies to both learners and assessors:<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>for learners, the issue is often one of test fatigue.<br />
					Too many tests over too short a time may result in learners 
					losing commitment to the process.<br />
					On shorter courses, in particular, testing too much can be 
					perceived as a waste of learning time.</li>
					<li>for the assessors, too many open-ended test tasks which 
					need careful marking may put an impractical load on time and 
					resources.&nbsp; This may be compounded by task types which 
					require subjective judgements in marking.&nbsp; Assessors 
					may become tired and unreliable markers.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>

			abilities to do this so far acquired and plan a way forward for the 
			rest of the course.<br />
			We have around three hours of the course earmarked for this

			<p>It may be that your circumstances allow for very simple writing

			<ol>
				<li>Form filling tasks<br />
				<img alt="form filling" height="133" src="../../images/form_filling200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				These are often used at lower levels because they can be 
				carefully directed and constrained.&nbsp; However, as you will 
				know if you have applied for a passport, they can also require 
				high-level written language skills and precise comprehension of 
				rubrics and instructions.</li>

				Presenting people with two different but similar pictures can be 
				a useful way of testing the ability to compare and contrast 
				things in writing.</li>
				<li>Charts and tables<br />
				<img alt="chart" height="133" src="../../images/chart200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Getting people to transfer data from charts and tables is a 
				useful way to test the ability to describe trends and locate and 
				highlight significant factors.</li>
				<li>Simple graphics and picture sequences<br />
				<img alt="event" height="133" src="../../images/cake_birthday200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Images of events are useful ways of testing the ability to 
				describe and/or speculate in writing.<br />
				Series of related pictures (a picture story) can be used to assess the ability to 
				construct a convincing recount.</li>
				<li>How to ... stimuli<br />
				<img alt="how to" height="133" src="../../images/ingredients200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Requiring people to explain in writing how something is done or how 
				something happens is a good way to test the ability to sequence 
				an instruction or to explain and describe processes.&nbsp; They 
				need to have the data to do this and that can be provided in the 
				form of pictorial steps (such as one finds in operating manuals) 
				and, providing the technology is to hand, <em>via</em> a video 
				demonstration.&nbsp; There are plenty on YouTube.</li>
				<li>Free writing tasks<br />
				<img alt="free writing" height="133" src="../../images/write_relaxed200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				In these tasks, the subjects are provided with a topic, or 
				choice of topic, and a word limit.&nbsp; They write in class or 
				elsewhere and the results are graded according to some 
				prearranged criteria (see below).<br />
				The main issue here is that the freer the task, the easier it is 
				for writers to avoid tricky grammar, structure and lexis.&nbsp; 
				It is, in other words, error avoiding and more difficult to 
				assess because of that.<br />
				A solution is to guide the task in some way, demanding, for 
				example, that the writer includes a range of data or a set of 
				points.&nbsp; In that way, the test becomes fairer and arguably 
				more valid and reliable, too.</li>

			<p>Unless you have a clear way of measuring outcomes, all the work 
			on assessment task design is wasted.&nbsp; Ways of getting clean 
			data are discussed in the guide to assessment in general.&nbsp; For 
			writing in particular, however, there are some conventional 
			approaches which fall into two broad categories.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>holistic assessment</strong></dt>
				<dd>This involves a simple scale, perhaps from 1 to 10, on which 
				the product from each learner is placed on an impression of how 
				well they achieved the task(s).<br />
				With a small group and with assessors who have a clear idea of 
				what they are looking for, it can be quick, reasonably accurate 
				and efficient.<br />
				There are obvious drawbacks in that judgements can be subjective 
				(so double or even triple marking can be used) and it lacks clear criteria against which learners' performances are being 
				measured.</dd>
				<dt><strong>analytic assessment</strong></dt>
				<dd>Involves breaking down the tasks and being specific about 
				the criteria you are using to judge success.<br />
				Large-scale examining boards use this approach as a matter of 
				course.&nbsp; For example, the current assessment criteria for 
				the IELTS examination stretch across 10 bands of ability and 
				fall into 4 assessment criteria groups.&nbsp; These are:<br />
				Task achievement<br />
				Coherence and cohesion<br />
				Lexical resource<br />
				Grammatical range and accuracy<br />
				The detail is available from:<br />

			<p>Taking a ready-made set of criteria from a public 
			examination body like this can be very helpful.&nbsp; They are 
			written by experts and have been trialled and re-trialled numerous 
			times.&nbsp; However, you are probably not setting an examination, 
			you are constructing an achievement test of some kind so the 
			criteria categories and what they contain may only be marginally 
			relevant to you (unless, of course, you are preparing learners 
			actually to take the IELTS examination).<br />
			Other sets of criteria from sources with different concerns may 
			include, for example, communicative quality, effect on the reader, 
			argumentation, appropriacy and so on.<br />
			Each of the category areas can, of course, be weighted (by, for 
			example, doubling the scores for some areas or multiplying by 
			another factor) to reflect what you and the learners see as the most 
			important skills.<br />
			The categories you need will be determined by the aims of your 
			teaching programme and no set of off-the-peg criteria will suit all
