			<h1>Assessing speaking skills</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="talking" height="207" src="../../images/talk_statues310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide assumes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>That the best way to test speaking ability is 
			to get the learners to speak.</li>
				<li>What we need to assess is communicative ability in spoken 
				language.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These 
			are obvious 
			starting points.&nbsp; We can, of course, also test some underlying 
			skills discretely.&nbsp; For example, we can test learners' 
			abilities to produce the sounds of English adequately or to 
			recognise turn-taking signals and so on.&nbsp; Here, however, we 
			will set out an assessment procedure which includes, rather than 
			separates out, those abilities.</p>

				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>All assessment starts (or should start) from a consideration of 
			the aims of instruction.<br />
			For example, if the (or one) aim of a language course is to enable 
			the learners to do well in the oral interaction part of a Cambridge 
			First Certificate examination, 
			then this will be very influential in terms of the types of 
			assessment tasks we use and the way in which we measure performance.<br />
			If, on the other hand, our aim is to enable the learners to 
			transact and interact 
			successfully in an English-speaking environment (such as a social or work environment) then we will set different kinds 
			of assessment tasks and measure performance against different 
			criteria.</p>
			<p>There are, however, some underlying principles in the area which 
			are generally applicable regardless of the aims of the teaching 
			programme.</p>

				</table>
			<ol>
				<li>We have to use assessment tasks which properly reflect the 
				kinds of speaking the learners will need to be able to do 
				in 'the real world'.</li>
				<li>We need to design tasks which accurately show the learners' 
				ability.</li>
				<li>We need to have a reliable way to score the learners' 
				performance.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These three factors are to do with ensuring reliability and 
			validity.&nbsp; For more on those two concepts, see
			<a href="../background/testing.html" target="_blank">the guide to testing, assessment and evaluation</a>.&nbsp; 
			The rest of this guide assumes basic familiarity with the content of 
			that guide.<br />
			Fulfilling all three criteria adequately requires a little care.</p>

				</table>
			<p>The first step is to set out exactly what speaking skills are the 
			object of the teaching programme.&nbsp; To do this, we have to 
			answer these 3 questions (which come with a few examples of the 
			kinds of answers we might get):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>What sorts of settings will our learners need to be able to 
				act in?<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>Informal social chatting (interaction)</li>
					<li>Formal or semi-formal meetings at work (transaction)</li>
					<li>Academic settings and seminars (transaction)</li>
					<li>Service encounters?</li>
					<li>Giving formal presentations in a work or academic 
					setting?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>What functions do the learners need to be able to perform?<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>Expressing: thanks, needs, opinions, attitude, apology, 
					complaints, justifications etc.?</li>
					<li>Narrating sequences of events?</li>
					<li>Explaining: processes, reasons, procedures?</li>
					<li>Providing: information, directions, instructions, advice 
					etc.?</li>
					<li>Eliciting: information, directions, clarification, help, 
					permission, comment etc.?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>What topics will our learners have to be familiar with?<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>Social matters?</li>
					<li>Dealing with officialdom?</li>
					<li>Service providers?</li>
					<li>Entertainment and leisure?</li>
					<li>Travel arrangements?</li>
					<li>Personal experiences?</li>
					<li>The media?</li>
					<li>Medical matters?</li>
					<li>Specific study subjects?</li>
					<li>Specific occupational areas?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When we have the answers, we can go on to considering the best 
			sorts of tasks to set.&nbsp; Without adequate answers, it is 
			pointless to proceed at all.</p>

				</table>
			<p>It may be the case that you find yourself teaching General 
			English rather than English for Specific Purposes (also known as 
			ENAP [English for No Apparent Purpose]).&nbsp; If that is so, you 
			need a general-purpose check-list of abilities at various levels 
			against which to assess your learners' abilities to speak.&nbsp; 
			Here's one:<br />
			<img alt="syllabus" height="518" src="../../imagesgraphics/speaking_skills_descriptors.png" width="775" /></p>
			<p>The abilities and text types are, of course, cumulative.&nbsp; 
			At, e.g., B2 level, a learner should be able to handle everything 
			from A1 to B1 already.<br />

					<h2>Designing tasks</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Now we know what sorts of thing we want to assess, the purposes 
			of the speaking, the functions the learners need to be able to 
			perform and the topics they need to deal with, we can get on and 
			design some assessment procedures.<br />
			Again, there are some generic guidelines for all tasks, whatever the 
			answers to the 3 questions are.<br />
			If you have followed the guide to testing, assessment and 
			evaluation (see above), you will know that this is something of a 
			balancing act because there are three main issues to contend with:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Reliability:<br />
				<img alt="reliable" height="133" src="../../images/link_rope_mooring200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				A reliable test is one which will produce the same result if it 
				is administered again (and again). &nbsp;In other words, it is not 
				affected by the learner' mood, level of tiredness, attitude etc.<br />
				This is a challenging area in the case of assessing speaking.&nbsp; 
				We need to gather as much data as we can but asking learners to 
				speak lengthily, especially at lower levels of ability will 
				result in tiredness and a fall-off in performance.&nbsp; 
				Speaking in a foreign language is tiring and difficult.&nbsp; 
				Adding the stress of assessment to it makes matters worse.<br />
				To ensure that a speaking test is reliable, then, we need to set 
				as many short tasks as we can over a period of days or even weeks 
				targeted at assessing the abilities we have identified.<br />
				The type of marking that is required also plays a role here: the 
				more subjective the marking is, the less reliable will be the 
				test.&nbsp; If the assessor is required to perform multiple 
				functions (interlocutor, assessor, participant etc.) then 
				reliability of judgement is compromised.</li>
				<li>Validity:<br />
				<img alt="valid" height="133" src="../../images/stamp_valid200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Three questions here:<ol class="auto-style6">
				<li>does the test measure what we say it measures?<br />
				For example, if we set out to test someone's ability to 
				participate in a discussion for academic purposes, do the test items 
				we use actually test that ability or something else?</li>
				<li>does the test contain a relevant and representative sample 
				of what it is testing?<br />
				For example, if we are testing someone's ability to take part in 
				everyday interactions, does the task we set get them to deploy the sorts 
				of language they actually need to do that?</li>
					<li>do we have enough tasks to target all the skills we want 
					to assess?<br />
					For example, if we want to test the ability to summarise 
					information orally, do 
					we have a task focused explicitly and discretely on that 
					skill?</li>
			</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Practicality:<br />
				<img alt="balance" height="133" src="../../images/balance_stones_a200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Against the two main factors, we have to balance practicality.<br />
				It may be advisable to set as many different tasks as possible 
				to ensure reliability and to try to measure as many of the 
				skills as possible in the same assessment procedure to ensure 
				validity but in the real world, time is often limited and 
				concentration spans are not infinite.<br />
				Practicality applies to both learners and assessors:<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>for learners, the issue is often one of test fatigue.<br />
					Too many tests over too short a time may result in learners 
					losing commitment to the process.<br />
					On shorter courses, in particular, testing too much can be 
					perceived as a waste of learning time.</li>
					<li>for the assessors, too many time-consuming tests which 
					need careful assessment and concentration may put an impractical load on time and 
					resources.&nbsp; Assessors 
					may become tired and unreliable.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Say we have a short (150-hour) course for motivated B2-level

			They need to interact with colleagues and be members of the society.<br />
			We have around three hours of the course earmarked for this

			<p>It may be that your circumstances allow for very simple

			<ol>
				<li>Form filling tasks<br />
				<img alt="form filling" height="133" src="../../images/form_filling200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The assessor / interlocutor plays the role of helpful clerk

				Presenting people with two different but similar pictures can be 
				a useful way of testing the ability to compare and contrast 
				things in speaking.&nbsp; Such tasks also test the ability to 
				describe what you see (although that is arguably not a 
				commonly required, real-world skill).</li>
				<li>Charts and tables<br />
				<img alt="chart" height="133" src="../../images/chart200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Getting people orally to describe or summarise data from charts and tables, 
				identify 
				trends and locate significant factors orally is a 
				useful way to test some higher-level speaking abilities.&nbsp; 
				It is actually quite challenging and we need to give the subject 
				adequate preparation time.</li>
				<li>Simple graphics and picture sequences<br />
				<img alt="event" height="133" src="../../images/cake_birthday200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Images of events are useful ways of testing the ability to 
				describe and/or speculate in speaking.<br />
				Series of related pictures can be used to assess the ability to 
				produce a convincing recount and obscure or odd-angle pictures 
				can elicit speculative language.</li>
				<li>How to ... stimuli<br />
				<img alt="how to" height="133" src="../../images/ingredients200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Requiring people to explain how something is done or how 
				something happens is a good way to test the ability to sequence 
				an instruction or to explain and describe processes.&nbsp; They 
				need, of course, to have the data to start with and that's not 
				always easy to supply.&nbsp; Diagrams of processes (as in 
				operating manuals) can be supplied.</li>
				<li>Role plays<br />
				<img alt="role play" height="133" src="../../images/talk_roleplay_graphic200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Are almost infinitely variable in terms of topics, functions 
				required and levels of formality used.&nbsp; They can be very 
				finely targeted.<br />
				Role plays can be conducted between two learners or with the 
				assessor or with a third person who has no assessment role at 
				all.&nbsp; The problem with this kind of assessment is that a 
				learner's performance may well be influenced by the performance 
				of the partner and a number of cultural factors may play a 
				significant part.&nbsp; From certain cultures, for example, 
				young females may not wish to appear more knowledgeable than 
				older males and so on.</li>
				<li>Prepared presentations<br />
				<img alt="presentation" height="133" src="../../images/present200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				These are poor ways to test speaking ability in general because 
				too many variables (audience size, personality, nervousness 
				etc.) come into play but if it is a skill the learners will need 
				in English, then it a clear and direct way of testing the 
				ability to do it.</li>

			<p>Unless you have a clear way of measuring outcomes, all the work 
			on assessment task design is wasted.&nbsp; Ways of getting clean 
			data are discussed in the guide to assessment in general.&nbsp; For 
			speaking in particular, however, there are some conventional 
			approaches which fall into two broad categories.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>holistic assessment</strong></dt>
				<dd>This involves a simple scale, perhaps from 1 to 10, on which 
				the product from each learner is placed on an impression of how 
				well they achieved the task(s).<br />
				With a small group and with assessors who have a clear idea of 
				what they are looking for, it can be quick, reasonably accurate 
				and efficient.<br />
				There are obvious drawbacks in that judgements can be subjective 
				and speaking tests are not usually recorded 
				(so double or even triple marking cannot be used).&nbsp; It lacks clear criteria against which learners' performances are being 
				measured.</dd>
				<dt><strong>analytic assessment</strong></dt>
				<dd>Involves breaking down the tasks and being specific about 
				the criteria you are using to judge success.<br />
				Large-scale examining boards use this approach as a matter of 
				course.&nbsp; For example, the current assessment criteria for 
				the IELTS examination stretch across 10 bands of ability and 
				fall into 4 assessment criteria groups.&nbsp; These are:<br />
				Fluency and coherence<br />
				Lexical resource<br />
				Grammatical range and accuracy<br />
				Pronunciation<br />
				The detail is available from:<br />
				https://takeielts.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/IELTS_Speaking_band_descriptors.pdf <br />
				Here's an example of one level of achievement (Band 7):<br />

			<p>No, nobody know the difference between what the writers of this 
			call connectives and what they call discourse markers.&nbsp; The 
			latter term should be used to refer to how speakers manage spoken 
			discourse but the term is so overused and so loosely used that it 
			has had most of the meaning bleached out of it.<br />
			Taking a ready-made set of criteria from a public 
			examination body like this can be very helpful.&nbsp; They are 
			written by experts and have been trialled and re-trialled numerous 
			times.&nbsp; However, you are probably not setting an examination, 
			you are constructing an achievement test of some kind so the 
			criteria categories and what they contain may only be marginally 
			relevant to you (unless, of course, you are preparing learners 
			actually to take the IELTS examination).<br />
			The other obvious issue with descriptors like these is their sheer 
			imprecision.&nbsp; The language is laden with terms which need to be 
			subjectively interpreted such as <em>some awareness, some, but not 
			all, may demonstrate, some flexibility, less common </em>etc.&nbsp; 
			Very careful training and standardisation of assessors need to be 
			done to avoid too much variation in interpretation and this is, of 
			course, what most examination bodies do.<br />
			Other sets of criteria from sources with different concerns may 
			include, for example, accent, grammar, vocabulary, fluency, style, effect on the 
			listener, 
			task achievement, appropriacy and so on.<br />
			Each of the category areas can, of course, be weighted (by, for 
			example, doubling the scores for some areas or multiplying by 
			another factor) to reflect what you and the learners see as the most 
			important skills.<br />
			The categories you need will be determined by the aims of your 
			teaching programme and no set of off-the-peg criteria will suit all 
			purposes.</p>
