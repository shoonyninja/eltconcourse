			<h1>Communicative strategies and tactics in spoken language</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="strategy" height="207" src="../../images/strategy310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>There are two essential guides to speaking skills on this site 
			(both of which will open in a new tab):</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>
				<a href="../../initial/skills/speaking_overview.html" target="_blank">
				an overview of speaking skills</a>: what makes speaking 
				difficult?</li>
				<li>
				<a href="../../initial/skills/speaking_teaching_essentials.html" target="_blank">
				teaching speaking skills</a>: how can we make it less difficult?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>What follows assumes for the most part that you are familiar with 
			the contents of those guides which cover the basics of speaking and 
			teaching speaking.</p>
			<p>Because we are taking a functional approach here, it is as well 
			at the outset to remind ourselves of the sorts of functions that we 
			use.&nbsp; There is a list of nearly 70 in
			<a href="../../initial/functions/functions_essentials.html" target="_blank">
			the pre-service guide to functions</a> which you may like to consult 
			(new tab).<br />
			The overarching categories (which often overlap) are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The descriptive function: giving and understanding factual 
				information.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me where the station is?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's getting late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm taking the train home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't help you</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>The expressive function: relaying and understanding of 
				information about the speaker's feelings, preferences and ideas.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not feeling well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really don't like that man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not even going to try</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>The social function: establishing and maintaining social 
				relationships, especially roles and power structures.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I help you, madam?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything else?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning officer.&nbsp; How can I help you?<br />
				</em>etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="interaction" height="166" src="../../images/child_dog_relationship250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style19">
				<h2>Interaction is reciprocal</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Speaking, unless you are doing something quite unusual such as 
			presenting to an audience who cannot interrupt or making a 
			recording, is a two-way process.&nbsp; By its nature it is 
			reciprocal so, as well as considering how speakers structure what 
			they say, we shall also take into account what the hearer may do to 
			manage the interaction.<br />
			In particular, we shall consider the strategies which non-native 
			speakers use (or can be taught to use or avoid) when they are 
			interacting orally with others.<br />
			We saw, for example, in the essential guide to what speaking is that 
			both parties to a conversation will use a response move to construct 
			a further initiation in order that the conversation does not grind 
			to a halt.&nbsp; To remind you of what is meant, compare these two 
			made-up dialogues:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21"><strong>Interaction A</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style21"><strong>Interaction B</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style22"><span class="style_black"><em>
					Welcome home.&nbsp; Did you have a good day?</em></span><br />
					<em>Yes thanks.</em><br />
					<em><span class="style_black">Did you enjoy lunch with Mary?</span><br />
					Yes.<br />
					<span class="style_black">Is she going to resign?</span><br />
					I think so.<br />
					<span class="style_black">I see.</span></em></td>
					<td class="auto-style22"><span class="style_black"><em>
					Welcome home.&nbsp; Did you have a good day?</em></span><br /><em>Yes thanks.&nbsp; How was yours?<br />
					</em><span class="style_black"><em>Oh pretty good.&nbsp; I 
					got some gardening done.&nbsp; Did you enjoy lunch with 
					Mary?</em></span><br /><em>I noticed how tidy it looked.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Mary's always 
					good company, isn't she?<br />
					</em><span class="style_black"><em>Oh yes.&nbsp; Is she 
					going to resign?</em></span><br /><em>I think so.&nbsp; I'm not sure she has finally decided.<br />
					</em><span class="style_black"><em>I see.&nbsp; When does 
					she have to make up her mind?</em></span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It isn't difficult to see that Interaction B is likely to 
			continue but Interaction A has ground to a halt.&nbsp; The reason is 
			quite simple:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>in Interaction A, the second speaker simply responds to the 
				first speaker's initiations.<br />
				This forces the second speaker to take on the onus of the 
				conversation and she will get pretty frustrated.</li>
				<li>In Interaction B, the second speaker responds but also 
				initiates in the same move.<br />
				This means that both speakers are taking responsibility for the 
				conversation's progress, and that is what keeps the conversation 
				alive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Learners of English often report that the native speakers they 
			encounter are reluctant to hold conversations with them.&nbsp; If 
			they are acting in the way the second speaker is behaving in 
			Interaction A, that is not surprising.<br />
			This is, naturally, not a phenomenon confined to English.&nbsp; All 
			speakers of whatever language cooperate in keeping interactions 
			alive until one of them signals the end but people do not 
			automatically transfer their communicative strategies into a 
			language they are learning.<br />
			Being aware of the need to initiate <strong>as well as</strong> 
			respond in the same move is a (some say, <strong>the</strong>) 
			critical communicative strategy.</p>

				<h2>Tactics in communication</h2>

			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>The difference between a tactic and a strategy is slightly 
			obscure and dictionary definitions of the terms are generally very 
			similar, both referring to actions intended to achieve aims.&nbsp; 
			Here, we will use the term <strong>strategy</strong> to refer to an action designed 
			to achieve a long-term aim (such as keeping a conversation going) 
			and <strong>tactic</strong> to refer to shorter-term aims (such as saying what you 
			mean).<br />
			In chess, a tactic is what you utilise when there's something to do, 
			a strategy is what you employ when there's nothing to do.<br />
			In what follows, we are talking mostly about tactics but do not be 
			alarmed if others refer to them as strategies.</p>
			<p>The line taken here is to divide tactics into responses to 
			productive and receptive issues but we should always bear in mind 
			that speakers employ both types almost simultaneously.&nbsp; 
			Conversations are often fast-moving events with overlapping 
			contributions and demands.<br />
			For the purposes of analysis and a teaching agenda, however, it 
			makes sense to separate the tactics.</p>

				<td class="auto-style19">
				<h2>Spoken language</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>In what follows, we are mostly concerned with informal spoken 
			language.&nbsp; In formal situations, such as chaired meetings, 
			academic seminars, presentations and so on, there is little call for 
			the skills discussed here because who speaks, when they speak and 
			what they speak about is likely to be controlled.<br />
			Informal encounters are another matter and it is in these that 
			communicative strategies and tactics become very important if the 
			conversation is not to go off track, grind to a halt or offend 
			someone.</p>
			<p>Here, we will follow Cook, 1989, who suggests the following five 
			features are the defining ones of informal oral encounters:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Informal conversation does not follow a set task.&nbsp; 
				Neither side of such exchanges has a particular end in sight and 
				no agenda is set.&nbsp; Compare this, for example, to a 
				workplace meeting which may, indeed, be informal and require 
				good turn-taking skills but which will also have some kind of 
				agenda to follow and task to achieve, however vaguely that is 
				defined.&nbsp; This is a register rather than a style issue but 
				they are connected.</li>
				<li>Power relationships tend to be fairly equal.&nbsp; If they 
				are not, tactics may be of little use because one participant 
				will be able to run the show.&nbsp; 
				Inequality in participation is often a feature of some 
				registers.</li>
				<li>There is usually a small number of participants.&nbsp; Even 
				in large gatherings, informal conversations tend to be in small 
				groups of only two, three or four people.&nbsp; Anything larger 
				and we are in the realms of speeches or plenary addresses which, 
				apart for barracking from the floor, do not usually require any 
				special tactics.</li>
				<li>Turns are short.&nbsp; Sometimes, in informal conversation, 
				turns may even consist only of a single word or phrase.&nbsp; In 
				more formal settings or those which have an agenda, turns are 
				often quite long and the tactics and strategies discussed here 
				do not apply.<br />
				We are not talking about back-channelling here because that is 
				what happens <em>during</em> turns rather than <em>between</em> 
				turns.</li>
				<li>The talk is intra-personal.&nbsp; Its purpose concerns the 
				participants and it is not intended to be overheard or directed 
				at a wider audience outside the participants.&nbsp; In some 
				registers, the participants in the exchange may be confined to 
				two or three people but they know that their contributions are 
				being heard by and are, therefore, intended for, a wider, often 
				silent audience.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So, depending which kind(s) of skills you want to 
			teach, develop and practise, you need to make sure that the context 
			in which presentation and practice take place is in line with the 
			kinds of skill you want to be the focus.&nbsp; Read on for more.</p>

				<h2>Productive issues: compensation and reduction</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>The essential guide to speaking explains some of the reasons that 
			speaking is a tough skill to master and these include time 
			pressures, lack of familiarity with the topic, audience size, 
			unpredictability and the need for real-time action.&nbsp; Few of 
			those pressures play a role when we read or write, of course.<br />
			What we are talking about here are the ways that learners of English 
			can be taught to deploy tactics to <strong>compensate</strong> for a 
			lack of skill or a lack of language.<br />
			Native speakers of a language do these things unthinkingly and 
			automatically but, as we saw with interaction shapes above, people 
			do not always transfer the skill to a second language.</p>
			<p>Here's an overview of what follows in slightly more detail with 
			some examples of what is meant and some thoughts on teaching the 
			skills.</p>

				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Sometimes a reduction (in weight, expense work, energy use etc.) 
			is also an achievement but when it comes to communicating in a 
			foreign language we need to achieve our communicative aims not 
			reduce communication to what we can say.<br />
			Achievement tactics are, therefore, the ones we should be teaching 
			so that our learners are not thrown back on having to reduce what 
			they want to say or simply abandon the effort altogether.</p>

				<img alt="creativity" height="133" src="../../images/lightbulb200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style19">
				<h3>Creativity</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>One compensating factor for lacking the right word or structure 
			to encode our thoughts is to create language as we go along.&nbsp; This 
			is usually not a teachable skill (or, arguably, one which we should 
			be teaching) but it can be quite effective.&nbsp; We do it in three 
			main ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Simply inserting first language terms into our conversation 
				in the hope that the hearer will understand them,&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll need the er, erm ... aspirateur / 
				aspiradora / Staubsauger to get the carpet clean</em><br />
				respectively these are the French, Spanish and German words for
				<em>vacuum cleaner</em> but, using with the word in the 
				learner's first language and combining it with its purpose may 
				allow the hearer to understand.<br />
				Sometimes this works well, especially when inserting words from 
				languages related to English and pronouncing them in what is 
				hoped is an English way.&nbsp; For example, a learner who does 
				not know the English word <em>conventional</em> may guess that 
				it is derived from the same source as the word in the mother 
				tongue and produce (again for the same three languages):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>That would be conventionnel(le) / convencional / 
				konventionell, wouldn't it?<br />
				</em>and, providing the pronunciation is altered slightly to 
				Anglicise the word, most native speakers of English would have 
				no trouble understanding what is meant.</li>
				<li>Directly translating a word or phrase in the hope that it 
				might be right or at least understandable.&nbsp; For example, a 
				French speaker hunting for an expression to mean not being vague 
				and euphemistic might produce:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call a cat a cat</em><br />
				on the principle of translating<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appeler un chat un chat</em><br />
				directly into English.&nbsp; The correct term (<em>call a spade 
				a spade</em>) is not so different that a native speaker of 
				English cannot grasp what is meant.<br />
				This is a perilous tactic in many cases, however, as a German 
				speaker, trying to render <em>Staubsauger</em> (<em>vacuum 
				cleaner</em>) in English may produce <em>dust sucker</em> which 
				does require a mild leap of the imagination for a native speaker 
				to understand without a clear context and a bit of co-text.</li>
				<li>When all else fails, some non-native speakers (and native 
				speakers, too) may fall back on inventing a word or phrase which 
				just might be right.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you got an electric hole maker?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is she talkable?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you got the dog's line?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to unskin the potatoes.</em><br />
				for <em>drill, approachable, lead</em> and <em>peel</em> 
				respectively.</li>
			</ol>

				<h3>Approximation</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Failing the<em> mot juste </em>(or exact word, if you prefer) 
			many learners need to acquire two related skills.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Circumlocution<br />
				In most dictionaries, this word means a deliberate attempt to be 
				vague or imprecise but not in this field.&nbsp; Here, it means 
				getting around a gap in one's knowledge in some way.&nbsp; For 
				example:<ol class="auto-style23">
					<li>Being unable to use a future perfect tense or select the 
					correct tense in a subordinate clause, a learner may say 
					something like:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, she will leave before I will 
					arrive<br />
					</em>which is perfectly understandable to even an 
					unsympathetic hearer.&nbsp; It is grammatically inaccurate 
					but communicatively quite precise.</li>
					<li>Not knowing exactly the right word for an implement, a 
					learner may contrive:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the machine for cutting food 
					into small bits (food processor)<br />
					</em>or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It makes liquid from fruit to drink 
					(juicer)<br />
					</em>and so on.<br />
					This is a teachable, and necessary, skill often involving 
					the ability to use relative pronoun and adverb clauses such 
					as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the machine that gives you 
					money in the street (ATM)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is the person who shows you where to sit in a theatre 
					(usher)<br />
					</em>or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the place where you keep the 
					book (shelf, library?)<br />
					</em>Failing the relative clause structure, a simpler form 
					to teach is the prepositional phrase <em>for</em> plus the -<em>ing</em> 
					form so we get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A thing for XXXing a YYY<br />
					</em>etc.<br />
					So we arrive at:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing for cutting the grass in 
					the garden</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Substitution<br />
				A second form of approximation is the use of a substitute, 
				usually a less precise one for the term one needs.<ol class="auto-style23">
					<li>Often the substitute word is a hypernym which includes 
					the target word so we may encourage learners to acquire 
					words such as <em>machine, vehicle, device, gadget </em>etc. 
					so they can express ideas at least approximately in the hope 
					that context and co-text will make their precise meaning 
					clear.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you repair this device?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The machine is not working<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drives a large vehicle<br />
					</em>etc.</li>
					<li>Another common device is to search for a synonym which 
					will express the meaning, albeit imprecisely.&nbsp; For 
					example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I play a sport with other people 
					(team game)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found small jumping animals on the cat (fleas?)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bed cover was dirty (sheet)<br />
					</em>etc.<br />
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>

				<h3>Cooperation (exhortation and cohortation)</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>There is a guide to suasion which includes some discussion of 
			exhortation and cohortation on this site, linked below.&nbsp; Here, we are concerned 
			with the tactic of persuading the hearer to help the speaker get 
			over a gap in knowledge.&nbsp; There is a range of tactics that can be 
			taught:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Asking for translation<br />
				Frequently, communication will involve an interaction with 
				someone who knows the first language of the speaker, however 
				poorly, and speakers can call on that knowledge for help.&nbsp; 
				Often, this tactic is combined with some form of circumlocution.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the word for Staubsauger in 
				English?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you say panier in English?&nbsp; You know, for 
				carrying fruit and stuff.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the word for a portero in English?&nbsp; The man by 
				the door.</em></li>
				<li>Gesturing and miming<br />
				With some luck the item in question may actually physically be 
				present or the action may have just occurred or is occurring at 
				the time of speaking.&nbsp; Speakers can enlist the help of 
				interlocutors by pointing to something, miming an action or 
				referring to it.&nbsp; Again, circumlocution may also co-occur 
				with this tactic.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you say what he just did in 
				English?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the word for that thing you used?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What thing is it when you do this to eggs?</em> (miming <em>
				whisk</em>)<br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Asking for language data<br />
				Although many native speakers of any language are sometimes 
				flattered to be asked language questions, many, too, feel 
				embarrassed by them because they simply do not know how to 
				explain things clearly.&nbsp; That's not the case if you are the 
				informant, of course.<br />
				The selection of the sorts of questions that people are trained 
				to ask needs to take this into consideration.&nbsp; There is 
				very little point, for example, in asking a native English 
				speaker something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the opposite of </em>miniscule<em>?<br />
				</em>or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What tense do I use after </em>wish<em>?<br />
				</em>because the answer will usually be vague, incomplete or 
				wrong.<br />
				Keeping the question easy is, therefore, the priority so 
				exponents such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I say the past of </em>understand<em>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the opposite of </em>pretty<em>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I say ... in English?</em><br />
				and so on.</li>

				<h3>Fillers and hesitation devices</h3>

			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>There are a number of simple hesitation and filler devices which 
			native speakers use routinely when they need to think but are 
			unwilling to stay silent and run the risk of giving up a 
			conversational turn unintentionally.<br />
			They include:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Noises<br />
				Meaningless in themselves, certain noises carry the 
				communicative value of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please don't start a new turn, I'm 
				thinking</em><br />
				and they include, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; err<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; um, um<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; erm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ah, ah<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mmmm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ahm<br />
				</em>and so on.<br />
				The noises people make differ from language to language.&nbsp; 
				Many languages use a repeated schwa sound:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ə ə ə ə ə ə ə ə ə/<br />
				as a hesitation device which may not be recognised for what it 
				is or sound foreign to English speakers.<br />
				Other languages may use a rather strangled back-of-the-throat 
				sound approximating to:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aaargh ... aaargh<br />
				</em>which also sounds odd to English speakers or teeth-sucking 
				noises such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;tja </em>(roughly /tʃɑ/).<br />
				Nevertheless, if learners use the devices common in their own 
				languages, the need for a little time will usually be 
				recognised.<br />
				Advanced users of English often pick up the sounds by 
				interactions with native speakers, learners below that level 
				probably do not need to be taught them unless they want to sound 
				a bit more English.</li>
				<li>Prefabricated expressions<br />
				There is a wide range of these and a complete list is probably 
				unobtainable.&nbsp; The commonest include:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like<br />
					</em>much maligned as illiterate as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was like, angry, like and got like 
					rude and everything</em></li>
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you know<br />
					</em>as in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was, y'know, there all the time 
					and y'know waiting for her</em></li>
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actually<br />
					</em>frequently used to signal a false start as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was good ... er, actually, pretty 
					wonderful actually</em></li>
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; basically<br />
					</em>an almost meaningless filler as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was basically really happy with 
					it but actually didn't want to pay for it basically</em></li>
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean<br />
					</em>often as a signal of reformulation as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was waiting for the bus er, I mean, 
					it had just arrived and y'know it its always busy, I mean 
					crowded at that time</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Prefabricated expressions do need to be taught and practised 
			because they are not common across languages.&nbsp; If learners are 
			not alerted to the differences, they will sound odd to an 
			English-speaker's ear and may be misunderstood (and therefore 
			interrupted).&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>Dialects of Arabic vary in the fillers used, ranging from 
				words and expressions meaning <em>by God, like, so, what's its 
				name </em>and more.</li>
				<li>Speakers of Chinese languages may use a filler which 
				translates as <em>that is</em> and the phrase is uncommon in 
				English in that role.</li>
				<li>Speakers of Slavic languages (especially Czech) may use <em>
				simply</em> as a filler (much as English speakers use <em>
				basically</em>).</li>
				<li>French speakers have a range to draw on 
				and some parallel English fillers but they also include <em>you 
				see what I want to say</em>, which is not recognisably natural 
				in English.</li>
				<li>German speakers use teeth-sucking but also a translation of
				<em>actually</em>.</li>
				<li>Greek speakers may use <em>good, good </em>and<em> so, so
				</em>as a filler.</li>
				<li>Italian speakers may use <em>well, then</em> as a filler.</li>
				<li>Polish speakers sometimes use <em>no, no</em> as a filler.</li>
				<li>Spanish speakers may use the word for <em>this</em> as a 
				filler, often repeated.</li>
				<li>Swedish speakers may use the Swedish words for <em>only, 
				therefore</em> and <em>what</em> as fillers.</li>
			</ul>

				<h3>Reduction and avoidance</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Faced with difficulties in finding the right words or grammatical 
			structures, learners may reduce or abandon the message they had in 
			mind.&nbsp; These two tactics are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Reduction<br />
				This is common when learners are faced with a structure they 
				have not yet mastered but are aware of the concept they intend.<br />
				Four types of reduction are recognised (Bygate, 1987:47):<ol class="auto-style23">
					<li>Simpler structural alternatives:<br />
					For example, instead of:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldn't have done that if I had 
					known what would happen</em><br />
					learners might opt for the much simpler:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did it because I didn't know what 
					would happen.</em><br />
					which expresses (more or less) the same thought but in a 
					reduced way.</li>
					<li>Sound avoidance:<br />
					Some sounds give learners great difficulties in English, 
					usually because the sounds do not exist or do not exist in 
					that combination in the learners first language(s).&nbsp; 
					For example, many of the ordinal numbers in English have 
					tricky final consonant clusters (<em>fourth, fifth, sixth, 
					seventh</em> etc. in particular).&nbsp; Learners may simply find 
					an alternative way to refer to these numbers (or remove the 
					ordering from what they are saying) so, instead of:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was her sixty-sixth birthday<br />
					</em>a learner may opt for the slightly unnatural:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was sixty-six on that day</em></li>
					<li>Lexical avoidance:<br />
					If learners are aware of their own lack of vocabulary in a 
					certain area, they may opt to speak more generally so 
					instead of pursuing a conversation about gardening, for 
					example, (with its wealth of register-specific language such 
					as <em>hoe, spade, mulch, mow, harvest </em>etc.) they might 
					prefer to bend the conversation to leisure activities in 
					general where they feel on safer ground</li>
					<li>Statement avoidance:<br />
					If learners believe they are unable to say precisely what 
					they feel about something, they may prefer to alter their 
					message to something they can say.&nbsp; So, for example, we 
					may get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The film was very good<br />
					</em>instead of what is meant along the lines, perhaps, of:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt the film was very atmospheric</em>.<br />
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Total avoidance<br />
				In extreme cases, the inability to express a thought in English 
				despite options for altering the signal to fit current ability, 
				may lead learners simply to sidestep the issue altogether, try 
				to change the subject or fall uncomfortably silent.<br />
				Strategies for changing the subject, generally involving topic 
				shifting-conjuncts such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That reminds me ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way ...</em><br />
				etc. are eminently teachable providing learner are made aware of 
				the fact that we do not usually shift a topic completely but 
				pursue a parallel and connected idea with the use of these 
				conjuncts and practise them that way.<br />
				A better approach is to teach as many of the compensatory 
				tactics as the learners can handle so the need for avoidance is 
				minimised.</li>

		</table>
			<p>Because, as was emphasised above, speaking is usually reciprocal 
			(that's what interactive means), it is important also to focus on 
			how learners may aid their comprehension by forcing facilitation 
			tactics on the speaker.<br />
			There are four ways to do this and here is the summary.&nbsp; Notes 
			and examples follow.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="reception" height="212" src="../../imagesgraphics/speaking_comprehend.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>All of these tactics are very teachable but they need to be 
			handled discretely at first before learners can use them in 
			combination.&nbsp; Practising them can be quite enjoyable, 
			especially if there are native-speaking guinea pigs to hand on whom 
			to try them out.&nbsp; Failing that, the teacher has to provide the 
			input that the learners can practise altering.</p>
			<p>The tone and intonation that has to be practised with these 
			tactics is very important because almost always they constitute 
			interruption of a turn and can easily be perceived as rude or at 
			least discourteous (see the guide to turn taking, linked below, for 
			more).&nbsp; In the following examples, the speaker needs to sound 
			tentative not assertive, so the intonation will generally rise along 
			the utterance.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Gaining time<br />
				Any interruption to gain time has to be done politely in order 
				to avoid giving offence.&nbsp; The unaggressive, palm-outward, 
				hand-up gesture is also important.<br />
				Simple exponents include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry.&nbsp; Could you speak a little 
				more slowly, please?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you slow down a little?&nbsp; It's difficult for me to 
				follow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please speak more slowly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can only understand if you speak more slowly, I'm afraid</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>Getting repetition<br />
				The is a similar tactic to gaining time (and has a similar 
				utility) so it could be practised at the same time.<br />
				Simply exponents include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you repeat that, please?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say again?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How's that again?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did you say?</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>Asking for language information<br />
				We noted above that native speakers are sometimes embarrassed 
				and at a loss when asked to explain language issues but that is 
				not always the case if the questions are well put and simple.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you explain ... ?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you use another word for ... ?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't understand </em>spadework<em>.&nbsp; What does it 
				mean?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it just mean </em>hard work<em>?</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>Summarising<br />
				This is sometimes called interpretive summarising and is a way 
				of both checking comprehension and getting some repetition and 
				support.&nbsp; Examples might include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, as I understand it, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you seem to be saying is ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I right in thinking that ... ?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have I got this right?&nbsp; I think you mean ...</em><br />
				etc.</li>

		</table>
			<p>At the outset, it was claimed that the tactics which people use 
			to manage interactions are not confined to any one language.&nbsp; 
			They exist in all languages and cultures but the ways in which they 
			are realised linguistically varies quite considerably, sometimes 
			quite dramatically.<br />
			The aim of teaching is not, therefore, to teach the tactic <em>per 
			se</em> but to teach how to use the tactic in English.&nbsp; 
			Knowledge of the tactics exists in your learners (unless they are 
			very young) so that knowledge just needs to be activated and then 
			practised.</p>
			<p>In all of the above, we have tried to include common examples of 
			exponents to use when teaching and practising but we make no claim 
			to any list being exhaustive.<br />
			When selecting a tactic (or even two) to teach, make sure that the 
			functions of the exponents you will introduce, practise and assess 
			directly target the tactic you are trying to activate.&nbsp; If that 
			is not the case, you will confuse the learners.<br />
			You need to select exponents which perform the function(s) which 
			match the targets of your teaching and practise them as thoroughly 
			as possible.&nbsp; Many exponents of simple functions are 
			prefabricated language chunks whose use cuts down considerably on 
			processing time (another bonus).&nbsp; However, they will not be 
			recalled as single chunks without a good deal of exposure and 
			repetition.<br />
			Selecting the correct exponents to suit the levels and needs of your 
			students is, of course, partly what you get paid for.</p>
