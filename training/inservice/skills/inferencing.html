			<p>If you glance at this image, it seems reasonable to assume that

			information.&nbsp; You inferred all the data you need from simply 
			glancing at the image.<br />

			</table>
			
			<p>Inferencing is often described as a form of guessing.&nbsp; It is 
			not.&nbsp; Guessing usually implies a stab-in-the-dark approach to 
			knowing something.&nbsp; Inferencing, on the other hand, may be defined as</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em><strong>deriving logical conclusions 
			from premises known or assumed to be true</strong></em></span></p>
			<p>In other words, it is a method of calculating what is likely to 
			be true based on prior expectations and knowledge.&nbsp; In the 
			field of statistics, one approach is to do what is called Bayesian 
			processing to arrive at reasonable inferences based on expectations 
			and previous knowledge of the world.</p>
			<p>In the process of learning or using a language, inferencing is a 
			key skill but it is not one, as we saw above, that learners need to 
			be taught how to do so much as one they need deliberately to employ.</p>
			
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style4">
					<h3>Here's an example:</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>If you are presented with a die and asked to infer what your 
			chances of throwing a six (or any other number between 1 and 6) 
			were, you would probably say, quite rightly, 1 in 6, i.e., a roughly 
			16.67% chance that any throw of the die will result in a six (or any 
			other possibility).&nbsp; You would, therefore, guess that your 
			chances of throwing a particular number are 1 in 6.<br />
			Now, however, you are told that out of the last 100 throws of this 
			particular die, 50 have resulted in a six.&nbsp; What is your 
			'guess' now of the chances of a six coming up?<br />
			Right: inferencing is more than guessing.</p>
			<p>Now take the situation in which you are faced with an unknown 
			word in a sentence.&nbsp; The word is, for argument's sake, <em>
			chenlob</em> and you have no idea what it means at all.&nbsp; Can 
			you infer its meaning?<br />
			No, you can't but you can make some guesses based on what you know 
			about the language.</p>
			<p>You have, roughly a 20% chance that the word is a noun and much 
			less than a 1% chance that it's a hitherto unknown preposition.&nbsp; 
			It could easily be a verb (a chance of something like 15%) but it is 
			less likely that it is an adjective or an adverb (around 7% each).&nbsp; 
			It is almost impossible that the word is a new (to you) determiner 
			or a pronoun.</p>
			<p>Now you may be presented with a little co-text and see:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the chenlob</em><br />
			because you can infer from your knowledge of syntax that the word is 
			a noun, preceded by a determiner, you may adjust your inference to 
			decide that it is a noun of some kind.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, you now see more co-text and that is:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the chenlob wall</em><br />
			so now you may discard your original inference and decide, on the 
			basis of this new evidence, that you are presented with an adjective 
			which is modifying the word <em>wall</em>.&nbsp; Your knowledge of 
			syntax allows this to be the most likely possibility because the 
			sequence <span class="style_black">determiner + adjective + noun</span> 
			is a commonplace of English.<br />
			Moreover, you also know what a<em> wall </em>is and that can lead 
			you understanding that the adjective does not mean something like
			<em>speculative, electronic, papery,</em> or <em>happy</em> because these are 
			not epithets which can be applied sensibly to walls.&nbsp; It could, 
			naturally, describe a range of other possible ways a wall can be 
			including <em>high, brick, beautiful, surrounding, impenetrable</em> 
			and so on.</p>
			<p>If, however, you were presented with<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chenlob spoke at the meeting</em><br />
			you would be able to reinforce your suspicion that the word is a 
			noun and, moreover, that it represents some kind of person because 
			your knowledge of the world includes the fact that only humans speak 
			at meetings.</p>
			<p>If you are now given written context (with punctuation as well as co-text) such as:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The Chenlob spoke at the meeting and all her 
			fellow Chenlobs applauded her even though the chairman had 
			determined that Chenlobs do not have voting rights because they come 
			from outside the county.</p>
			<p>you may be able to make a pretty good guess that a <em>Chenlob</em> 
			is a member of a definable set of people identified with a place.</p>
			<p>What you have done here is apply probabilistic reasoning based on 
			both your knowledge of the syntax of the language and your 
			understanding of the world of meaning.&nbsp; In other words, you 
			have applied extra linguistic knowledge as well as intra-linguistic 
			knowledge to reach your inference.</p>
			<p>Dennett, 2017:269, puts it this way:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">... the brain's strategy is continuously to create "forward 
			models," or probabilistic anticipations, and use the incoming 
			signals to prune them for accuracy &ndash; if needed.&nbsp; When 
			the organism is on a roll, in deeply familiar territory, the inbound 
			corrections diminish to a trickle and the brain's guesses, 
			unchallenged, give it a head start on what to do next.</p>
			<p>What we do next, of course, is understand and, if necessary, act 
			on the linguistic data we are receiving.</p>

			<p>There are two main reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>No user of a language can possibly know all the words, 
				structures and expressions in the language so we have to infer 
				meaning from what we <strong>do</strong> know.&nbsp; This is, 
				naturally, especially important for learners of a language.</li>
				<li>Very few texts, whether spoken or written, actually contain 
				all the information we need fully to understand them.&nbsp; 
				Speakers and writers will always assume some prior knowledge in 
				their hearers and readers.&nbsp; If we didn't do this, texts 
				would be interminably long.&nbsp; Try explaining how to make an 
				omelette to someone who doesn't know anything about food, what a 
				kitchen is or what it's likely to contain and you will see 
				what's meant.</li>

			</table>
			
			<p>In order to understand the sign at the top of this page, you used 
			no linguistic knowledge at all simply because no language was 
			present.&nbsp; What you used was <strong>extra-linguistic knowledge</strong>.&nbsp; 
			That is your knowledge of the world, people's motivations for 
			informing you and your understanding of shape and movement.</p>
			<p><a name="2"></a>Extra-linguistic knowledge can be further 
			refined:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>knowledge of the world</strong></dt>
				<dd>this was what you used to understand the three simple shapes 
				on the sign, the implied direction of movement and the purposes 
				of the sign in general</dd>
				<dt><strong>knowledge of people's motivations</strong></dt>
				<dd>the assumption you used here was that a sign is intended by 
				someone else to tell you something helpful</dd>
				<dt><strong>knowledge of roles in society</strong></dt>
				<dd>you assumed, probably rightly, that the people who designed 
				it and had the sign put up were a) in some kind of authority and 
				b) in possession of knowledge that you need, i.e., better 
				informed</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>As an example of how these can be applied to text, try figuring 
			out what this means:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em><strong><span class="style_black">It's OK, ladies and 
			gentlemen.&nbsp; You can go back to your offices now.</span></strong></em></p>
			<ol>
				<li>What is the meaning?</li>
				<li>Who is speaking to whom?</li>
				<li>Where is it happening?</li>
				<li>What has just happened?</li>
				<li>What happens next?</li>
				<li>How did you know all this?</li>
			</ol>

			<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'inferencing',0,'style.visibility','visible')">

			<ol id="inferencing" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li>The meaning is pretty easy.&nbsp; Someone is telling you 
				that a situation has been resolved and you are allowed to go to 
				your office.&nbsp; You knew this by understanding the <strong>
				meaning of the words</strong> and working out the <strong>syntax</strong>.&nbsp; 
				The key words you needed to understand are <em>OK</em>, <em>go 
				back</em> and <em>now</em>.&nbsp; The key syntactical clues are 
				the relationship between <em>can</em> and <em>go back, </em>the 
				function of the prepositional phrase <em>to your offices</em> 
				and the function of the adverb <em>now</em> in modifying the 
				verb phrase.</li>
				<li>Clearly someone in authority because they are in a position 
				to allow you to do something but also someone in some kind of 
				service because they are being deferential and using the 
				formulaic <em>ladies and gentlemen</em> phrase.&nbsp; It is 
				almost certainly one person speaking to many.&nbsp; You knew 
				this by using <strong>sociolinguistic knowledge </strong>and 
				understanding elements of style as well as the import of the 
				modal <em>can</em>.</li>
				<li>You know that it is not in the office because of the verb
				<em>go</em> and the adverb <em>back</em>.&nbsp; A reasonable 
				assumption, based on <strong>knowledge of the world</strong> 
				plus those two linguistic clues is that you are outside an 
				office building of some sort.</li>
				<li>You can assume that the people have just come <em>from</em> 
				the offices (else they couldn't go <em>back</em>) and you might 
				also assume by <strong>logical deduction</strong> that there has 
				been some sort of alarm to cause people to leave (fire?, bomb 
				scare?).</li>
				<li>As the authority figure has spoken, it is fairly safe to 
				assume that people will now return to work because your <strong>
				social knowledge</strong> tells you that people will generally 
				trust authority figures.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Most of the meaning and understanding of 
			circumstances that you are able to extract from the language are not 
			to do with language clues at all.&nbsp; You have deployed two types 
			of knowledge to do all this.</p>
			<h3>bottom-up processing</h3>
			<p>You used this to figure out the import of <em>OK, go back </em>
			and<em> now</em>.&nbsp; If you were actually listening to the 
			speaker, you would need to use your knowledge of the phonemes of 
			English, of connected speech, of word meaning and word class and 
			syntax.</p>
			<h3>top-down processing</h3>
			<p>You used this for everything else.&nbsp; Your 
			sociolinguistic knowledge, your knowledge of the world, your 
			understanding of social relationships and your ability to draw 
			logical conclusions from linguistic clues are all facets of top-down 
			knowledge that you bring to complete your understanding.</p>
			<h3>in combination</h3>
			<p>It is very important to understand that, although we have 
			separated out the types of processing you did here, you did not use 
			one type of processing and then the other; you <strong>combined</strong> 
			the types to make meaning clear.&nbsp; That is how people do things.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>As far as strategies are concerned, the same considerations apply 
			to written text.&nbsp; We have more time and leisure to extract the 
			meaning but fewer clues about the situation and role relationships 
			to work on.&nbsp; As a result, we use less extra-linguistic 
			knowledge to figure out meanings.<br />
			That does not, however, mean that our knowledge of the world, our 
			ability to draw logical conclusions and our knowledge of the social 
			fabric around us are abandoned.<br />
			An email from a friend and a letter from the tax man will set up 
			completely different expectations in us and will be dealt with in 
			different ways.</p>
			<h3>reading between the lines</h3>
			<p>A lot of reading is actually reading between the lines, not 
			simply extracting meaning from the written word.&nbsp; Take, for 
			example, these snippets from British newspapers and see what they 
			mean and what they imply.</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><span class="style_black">There are those who believe that 
				the government's responsibility is to keep its citizens safe at 
				all costs.</span><br /><em>This is an example of stating a fact in a way that implies the 
				writer doesn't agree.&nbsp; Skilful readers will assume that the 
				writer is going to go on to state an opposing view.</em></li>
				<li><span class="style_black">The issue has ended up like that 
				of the gas bill put behind the clock on the mantelpiece.</span><br />
				<em>Similes are commonly used in writing for effect.&nbsp; Taken 
				at face value this simply means that an issue has been postponed 
				but an alert reader will note that the writer has a point to 
				make, i.e., that it shouldn't be postponed and action is needed 
				now.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some types of text will require more knowledge of the world or a 
			particular culture than others if they are going to be correctly 
			interpreted:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet"><span class="style_black">Pick Your 
				Own</span><br />
				Is not a request for you to go away and harvest your own 
				vegetables and fruit; it is an invitation to come in and harvest 
				some of mine (for a price).</li>
				<li class="greybullet"><span class="style_black">Please wait 
				behind the yellow line until called forward</span><br />
				Is not a polite request; it is an absolute imperative imposed by 
				immigration officers the world over.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can probably think of many more occasion when what you read 
			needs to be interpreted by using extra-linguistic data.&nbsp; 
			Advertising language is, of course, a rich source of such things 
			because the writers of it are trying to make a case for something.&nbsp; 
			Only the very optimistic will interpret <span class="style_black">
			<em>Up to 50% off</em></span> to mean that what we might actually 
			want will be half price.</p>

			<p>One form of knowledge which also lies just outside the text 
			(spoken or written) is the knowledge learners have of their own 
			languages.&nbsp; Many teachers have a tendency to see learners' 
			first languages as some kind of impediment to learning English and 
			there are occasions when cross-language interference is a problem 
			but using the forms, lexis and structures of one's first language to 
			discover meaning in a second is often very helpful.<br />
			Many European languages for example, will have a 
			range of cognate words and structures which aid comprehension and, 
			although such things are often unreliable, they are, more often not, 
			helpful.&nbsp; 
			For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet">If I am a German 
				speaker and I have spotted that an initial 'p' in English is 
				often a 'pf' in German and a final 'th' is often a 'd' in 
				German, I will have less difficulty than many in knowing what a
				<em>path</em> is (because in German it's <em>Pfad</em>).</li>
				<li class="greybullet">If I speak any of Europe's Romance 
				languages such as French or Spanish, I will be able to make 
				quite accurate guesses at many thousands of words in English 
				derived from French or Latin.&nbsp; I will be right, too, 
				overwhelmingly more often than I'm wrong.&nbsp; I can also do 
				this if I speak a language such as Polish or Russian which also 
				has imported many Latin words.</li>
				<li class="greybullet">If I speak any of a number European 
				languages, I will find that the comparative and superlative 
				forms of adjectives in English are quite easy to understand and 
				use because the structural changes are parallel.</li>
				<li class="greybullet">Even if I speak an unrelated language 
				such as Mandarin, I can use some inter-lingual clues (such as 
				the tendency to isolate and depend on word order to carry 
				meaning) to figure out how some tense forms and modal auxiliary verbs 
				operate in English.</li>

			<p>It's not at all difficult to work out the meaning of <em>
			protesters</em> and <em>take to the streets</em> from

			In our first languages, we unconsciously use images and titles to 
			predict what sort of text we are about to read.&nbsp; We also use 
			images, the situation and introductions to predict what we are going 
			to hear (on TV, in an airport or on the radio, for example).</p>
			<p>This is a process often called <strong>schema activation</strong>.&nbsp; 
			A schema can be defined as a mental framework that we can use to 
			organize and understand information.&nbsp; (The plural is, 
			incidentally, <em>schemata</em>.)<br />
			The picture above and its headline caption serve to activate our 
			schema concerning demonstrations and riots so we are prepared for 
			what follows.<br />
			That can be very helpful but schemata cut both ways: activating a 
			schema may lead us to exclude or ignore information which does not 
			fit in to our world view or expectations.</p>

			prepared to encounter the sorts of language we are likely to find in 
			the text that follows (whether we are listening to / watching a TV 
			programme or reading an article).&nbsp; This has three main 
			characteristics.&nbsp; Think for a moment about what you expect the 
			text to be like and then

				etc. and can actively look for the presence of these lexemes.<br />
				In addition, we may also be prepared for the fact that many of 
				the verbs will describe behaviour and action and that some will 
				also tell us the relationships between people and ideas.&nbsp; 
				So we won't be surprised that verbs such as <em>protest, march,

				<dt><strong>word classification, morphological and syntactical clues<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="class" height="133" src="../../images/classify_birds200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Probably the most important information we need to infer 
				meaning is word class.&nbsp; Here we can make easy inferences:<br />
				We know that <em>carried out</em> is a verb of some sort because 
				we have a past-tense ending (we get a morphological clue) and an adverb particle (so we know 
				it's a phrasal verb, too).&nbsp; We also know that it is a 
				transitive verb because it has a subject (<em>the police</em>) 
				and an object (<em>baton</em> <em>charges</em>).<em>&nbsp; </em>
				It must mean something like <em>do</em>.<br />We are not, therefore looking for anything except an active 
				behavioural process meaning.<br />
				We know that <em>baton charges </em>is probably a plural, 
				countable noun because of its ending and the fact that it is 
				modified by an adjective we do know (<em>powerful</em>).&nbsp; Even if we don't know 
				the adjective, we can infer that it is one from the morphology: its ending (<em>-ful</em>).&nbsp; 
				So, we aren't looking for verbal or adjectival meanings.&nbsp; 
				We know it is a thing that happens in a riot.<br />
				We know, too, that <em>casualties</em> is also a plural noun 
				because it is preceded by a determiner (<em>many</em>) and has a 
				plural ending.<br />
				Some knowledge of affixation is a help here because it often 
				allows us to figure out word class, by inspecting suffixes or 
				meaning by inspecting prefixes.&nbsp; For example, looking at 
				the suffix on <em>nationalise</em> will allow us to recognise 
				that it's a verb derived from the noun <em>nation</em> and 
				looking at the prefix on <em>denationalise</em> will allow us to 
				determine that it is a reverse process.&nbsp; See the guides to
				morphology and
				word formation 
				for more, both of which are linked in the list of related guides 
				at the end.</dd>
				<dt><strong>participants and colligation<br />
				<img alt="robot" height="133" src="../../images/woman_robot200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>One key to getting at meaning of verbs is to look at who or 
				what can be the subject and who or what can be the object (i.e., 
				the participants).&nbsp; 
				A fundamental distinction lies in the nature of <strong>colligation</strong> (a 
				kind of grammatical collocation to which there is 				a separate guide on this site, 
				linked at the end).&nbsp; 
				Some verbs can only take human or at least animate or robotic 
				subjects, some can take all kinds.&nbsp; In this case, <em>
				carried out</em> is something done by people (<em>the police</em>) 
				so we know it refers to some sort of behaviour.&nbsp; If we 
				replace it with <em>do</em> the sense is maintained and we know 
				enough now to understand it.<br />
				Clearly, inferencing from the nature of participants also draws 
				on our general knowledge of the world.&nbsp; We need to know 
				what roles people, animals and objects take on.<br />
				For example, we know that:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; children <em>grow up</em> and so do plants but adults rarely 
				do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; insects <em>sting</em> but people and large animals do not 
				(they <em>bite</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thunder and large machines may <em>rumble</em> but small 
				animals and most people do not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; animate things <em>dig</em> but inanimate objects do not 
				unless driven and controlled by animate objects<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people <em>meditate</em> but nothing else does<br />
				and so on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>modification<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="modify" height="133" src="../../images/modification_fingernails200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Nouns 
				are participants whether animate or not and we can often figure 
				out their meaning from how they are modified.<br />
				In this case, the noun <em>baton charges</em> is clearly a 
				compound noun and knowledge of one or the other parts will take 
				us close to the meaning.&nbsp; It is also pre-modified by <em>
				powerful</em> and the object of a verb like <em>do </em>so we 
				know it is some kind of behaviour by analogy with<em> powerful 
				argument, powerful voice, powerful running </em>etc. &nbsp;More 
				importantly, we also know that noun has an outcome &ndash; 
				people went to hospital &ndash; so we can infer that it is not 
				something gentle or pleasant.&nbsp; Add in our knowledge of the 
				world and a bit of logical deduction, and we have arrived at a 
				pretty close understanding of the meaning.<br />
				The noun <em>casualties</em> is pre-modified by <em>many </em>so 
				we know it's countable.&nbsp; It is post-modified by the 
				non-finite verb phrase <em>requiring </em> plus a noun phrase
				<em>hospital treatment</em> and 
				that tells us almost all we need to know to figure out the 
				meaning.</dd>
				<dt><strong>ignoring items<br />
				<img alt="ignore" height="133" src="../../images/woman_ignore200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>Although it adds nothing to our understanding, ignoring what 
				we know to be unimportant is also helpful.&nbsp; Here, for 
				example, we can safely ignore the adverb <em>out</em> once we 
				have decided that the verb phrase refers to an action the 
				police do in riot situations.&nbsp; The word <em>numerous </em>
				can also safely be ignored for general understanding as can many 
				other determiners.<br />
				What counts as safely ignorable depends on the context, the 
				learner’s level and the reasons for reading.&nbsp; If we only 
				want the general idea, we can discount much more than if 
				detailed understanding is needed.</dd>

			needed.&nbsp; Then he took out his camping stool, sat on it and started to 
			fish.</em></span><br />We can make some inferences concerning the fact that 
				<em>fishing tackle</em> 
			seems to be a hypernym which includes things like <em>rods, nets, reels, 
			hooks</em> and <em>bait</em>. If we know only one of those, we have arrived at the 
			meaning of <em>tackle</em>.&nbsp; We also know that <em>a stool</em> is something you 
				<em>sit</em> on 
				and that's enough.</li>
				<li class="greybullet">If we meet:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>He wasn't at all angry.&nbsp; In fact, he was quite serene.</em></span><br />
				We 
			can see that <em>serene</em> seems to be an antonym here of <em>angry</em> so if we 
			assume it means something like <em>calm</em>, we can get on with the text.</li>
				<li class="greybullet">If we meet:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>A minor illness such as cold (or a chill as some people 
			call it) is not a good reason to take a week off work</em></span><br />
				We have a set 
			of logical connections.&nbsp; We know that the writer is using <em>chill</em> and 
				<em>cold</em> as synonyms here and that whatever they are, they are not reasons for 
			taking time off work.&nbsp; Using that information takes us very close to 
			the meaning of the word <em>chill</em>.</li>
				<li class="greybullet">If we meet:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>The gale tore the roofs off the houses and blew down 
			trees</em></span><br />
				We can also work out what a <em>gale</em> is from the consequences of 
			its presence.&nbsp; (And we can use knowledge of participants as we saw 
			above to know that people don't usually <em>tear roofs off houses</em> or 
				<em>blow trees down</em> to know that the term<em> gale </em>must be some kind of natural 
				wind event.)</li>
				<li class="greybullet">If we meet:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>He used a pipe wrench to undo the sink taps and replace
