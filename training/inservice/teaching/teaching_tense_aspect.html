	<h1>Teaching tense and aspect</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="aspect" height="207" src="../../images/aspect310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p>If you have it in mind to teach a particular tense, there are guides 
		to most of them on this site.&nbsp; The links are from
		<a href="../../initial/indexes_ip/verbs_index_ip.html" target="_blank">the initial plus index</a> 
		(new tab).</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="flags" height="166" src="../../images/flags250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style9">
		<h2>Other languages</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>If you have learned another language, you will be aware that this is 
		an area in which languages differ quite dramatically in how they 
		conceptualise time.<br />
		There is something of a debate concerning whether the ways in which our 
		first languages chop up and conceptualise time affect the way we think 
		about time or whether the way we conceptualise time determines how our 
		language develops its tense system.&nbsp; The jury is still out on this.</p>
		<p>All languages have a way of dealing with past, present and future 
		concepts.&nbsp; There the similarities end, unfortunately.<br />
		In general terms, inflecting languages such as the European Romance 
		languages like French, Italian and Spanish, as well as Greek, will typically 
		denote tense markers by amending the verb in some way, often by using different suffixes 
		or prefixes, sometimes by inserting a particle to signal futurity.&nbsp; 
		Other European languages, notably Germanic ones, may also insert 
		various auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; English operates similarly with the 
		exception of not having a specific form to denote the future.&nbsp; So 
		we get, for example:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder" style="width: 70%">

		<p>Notice that <em>she lived </em>and <em>I was living </em>are not, for 
		example, distinguished by the verb form at all in German and the same 
		applies to Dutch and a range of other Germanic languages.<em><br />
		</em>The difficulty will probably become apparent when you insert any 
		other language you know or speak in the last row.&nbsp; Even in that 
		simple table, there are obvious issues:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Aspect:</strong><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was living<br />
			</em>is a <span class="auto-style6">progressive 
			or continuous aspect</span> form and implies, usually, that this was a long-term 
			state in something like<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was living in France when I met her<br />
			</em>This is also sometimes called the <span class="auto-style6">durative</span> 
			aspect.&nbsp; Note, however, that German uses the same form for both
			<em>I lived</em> and <em>I was living</em>, relying on context to 
			determine the nature of the state.&nbsp; There is no marker for the 
			progressive in standard German (although there are dialects which do 
			have the form).<br />
			French, arguably, does not really have a present progressive aspect 
			either, often preferring to use a phrase to mean something like <em>
			to be in the middle of doing</em> (<em>en train de</em>).&nbsp; The 
			imperfect ending on the verb, <em>ais</em>, above, does, however, carry some sense 
			of duration or an interruptible event.<br />
			The <span class="auto-style6">perfect aspect</span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have 
			lived<br />
			</em>for example, will also be problematic because German and 
			English exhibit parallel forms but in German the concept is not 
			parallel at all.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ich habe gesehen<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ich sah<br />
			</em>are functionally the same tense and mean either<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen</em><br />
			depending on the context and meaning intended.<br />
			The French<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; j'ai parle<br />
			</em>is also just as 
			easily rendered in English as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spoken.</em></li>
			<li><strong>Auxiliary verbs:</strong><br />
			English uses an auxiliary to denote the 
			future but can, and frequently does, just use a present tense 
			with a future time marker such as <em>tomorrow</em> as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He leaves next week</em><br />
			In fact, 
			nearly all languages do that.</li>

		This is not the end of the story.&nbsp; Other languages may signal 
		aspects which are not signalled by verb changes in English such as:<dl>
			<dt><strong>Continuative</strong></dt>
			<dd>signalling an ongoing but persistent action.&nbsp; English uses adverbials with 
			the progressive form to show this aspect as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is still asking questions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He isn't here yet</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Defective</strong></dt>
			<dd>signalling an action or event that was not successful or did not 
			actually occur.<br />
			English signals this with adverbials as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She almost lost her temper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nearly got the answer right</em><br />
			or with the future-in-the-past formulation as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to telephone you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was on the point of going out</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Discontinuous</strong></dt>
			<dd>signalling that an action was completed but the state is also 
			terminated.&nbsp; For example, in this aspect, in some languages:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put on my coat</em><br />
			implies that I am no longer wearing my coat.<br />
			English has no way to signal this aspect by changes to the verb 
			form.&nbsp; The language is forced to insert a new clause as in, 
			e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and then took it off</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Episodic</strong></dt>
			<dd>signalling a one-off event rather than iterative or gnomic 
			aspects as in, e.g.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottle broke</em><br />
			English uses the past simple form for this.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Gnomic</strong></dt>
			<dd>signalling an established fact, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A square has four sides</em><br />
			English uses the present simple to express this aspect or modal 
			auxiliary verbs such as <em>must, can, have to</em>, as in e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parallel lines cannot meet</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Inceptive</strong></dt>
			<dd>signalling the beginning of something.<br />
			English signals this aspect semantically by verb choice, often with 
			the<em> to-</em>infinitive, as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It started to rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began to wonder</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Pausative</strong></dt>
			<dd>signalling an interrupted action which then continued.&nbsp; 
			English uses adverbials or non-finite forms to show this aspect as 
			in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stopped to look in the window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave up smoking for a long time</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Resumptive</strong></dt>
			<dd>signalling an action or event that resumes.<br />
			English often signals this semantically by the choice of verb, which 
			may be followed by a non-finite -<em>ing</em> form, or a noun phrase 
			as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I carried on walking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She resumed eating<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He continued his speech</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Terminative</strong></dt>
			<dd>signalling the end of an action or event.<br />
			English signals the aspect semantically by verb choice, often with 
			an -<em>ing</em> form, as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It stopped raining<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finished working</em></dd>

		<h2>Aspect in English</h2>				</td>

		</table>
		
			<p>The usual analysis in most grammars for learners and course 
			materials is to consider only three aspects in English.&nbsp; These 
			are:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>simple<br />
				<img alt="clear" height="133" src="../../images/clear_blue200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Most languages have this aspect, of course, because it is, 
				as the name implies, simple.<br />
				It is realised in English by the verb form without primary 
				auxiliary verbs.<br />
				It function is to state a fact about the past, present or future 
				or one which is always true and, therefore, timeless.<br />
				For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It rained<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like coffee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow is my birthday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be 23<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flight takes off at 15:00</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt>perfect<br />
				<img alt="perfect" height="133" src="../../images/perfect_a200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Many languages do not have an equivalent to this aspect (see 
				above) and it causes difficulty.<br />
				In English the aspect is signalled through the use of the 
				primary auxiliary verb <em>have</em> and / or adverbial use.<br />
				Its function is to embed one state or event in another and 
				signal the relevance (often causal) of one to the other.&nbsp; 
				It may also signal chronological ordering.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary has arrived so we can start the 
				meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had lost my money and had to walk home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will have finished so and then we can go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I already told you so you should know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I explained that yesterday so everyone is up to speed</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt>progressive<br />
				<strong>
				<img alt="hurry" height="133" src="../../images/man_hurry200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>This is also absent from many languages and causes an equal 
				amount of difficulty.&nbsp; This is not helped by the aspect 
				being conflated with continuous in many materials and teaching 
				manuals.<br />
				It is realised in English by the use of the primary auxiliary 
				verb <em>be</em> and / or the use of various adverbials.<br />
				Its function is to signal that an event or state is on going and 
				unfinished.&nbsp; It is, therefore, akin to the imperfect in 
				other languages.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were playing tennis when it began to 
				rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be walking to work this week<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you having problems?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm enjoying this music</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>And that is where the analysis as far as English is concerned 
			usually stops because English does not have a way of signalling 
			other aspects individually.&nbsp; Once we have exhausted the 
			possibilities of using the bare form of the verb and the two primary 
			auxiliary verbs, <em>be</em> and <em>have</em>, most people stop 
			there.&nbsp; However, for the purposes of teaching aspect and tense, 
			we need to be a little more precise because, as we saw above, our 
			learners' languages may have ways of signalling other aspects by 
			changes to the verb forms unique to that aspect.&nbsp; They will be 
			concerned to able to express thoughts in English with similar 
			clarity and precision.<br />
			Because all languages are capable of expressing all human thought, 
			you will not be surprised to discover that English can signal other 
			aspects but does so by re-purposing the verb forms.<br />
			On this site, therefore, we also consider:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>continuous<br />
				<img alt="rain" src="../../images/umbrella_rain200.jpg" /></dt>
				<dd>This is expressed in two main ways in English and also by 
				the use of various adverbials.&nbsp; With dynamic verb use, the 
				preferred realisation is through the use of the primary 
				auxiliary <em>be</em> and that is why it is often conflated with 
				the progressive.&nbsp; However, with stative verb uses, the 
				preferred realisation is simply to use the base form of the verb 
				without auxiliaries or to signal the continuous nature of an 
				event or state by temporal adverbial expressions.<br />
				Its function is to signal that an event may not be happening now 
				(so is not progressive) but is occurring in the background.&nbsp; 
				The other function is simply to signal an existing state of 
				affairs (called the stative continuous aspect, incidentally).<br />
				The form also signals what is sometimes called the gnomic aspect 
				(see above) referring to general truths.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy classical music<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharks are dangerous<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She speaks Italian well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is being difficult<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car is getting old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a terrible cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be staying at the Ritz<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was not helping<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was becoming cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He used to be so nice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's studying at university<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They go to university in America<br />
				</em>etc.</dd>
				<dt>durative<br />
				<img alt="water" height="133" src="../../images/water_illusion200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Some languages (see above) have a dedicated tense form for 
				this aspect but English relies on the primary auxiliary verb <em>
				be</em>, durative verbs or on adverbial use to signal the aspect.<br />
				Its function is to draw attention to the fact that a state endures for some time &ndash; hence its name.&nbsp; 
				It is also sometimes referred to as continuative.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain kept pouring down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would be consistently irritated by it all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They grew old together<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is still working on the problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't finished writing yet</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stayed for quite a while</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				As we saw in the introduction to the analysis in this area, 
				English has both punctual and durative verbs.&nbsp; In the 
				former cases, the verb form has to be amended to signal a 
				durative aspect or the sense will be of a simple action.&nbsp; 
				For example, if we say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We opened the door</em><br />
				the sense is of a simple, short, finished action and to give it 
				a durative sense we have to use a progressive form as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were opening the door</em><br />
				However, with verbs which are themselves durative in meaning, 
				that is not necessary so we can happily say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lived in Paris</em><br />
				and know that this is not, cannot be, anything other than a 
				long-lasting, durative situation.<br />
				We can say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was living in Paris</em><br />
				but we certainly don't have to and when we choose that form, we 
				strongly imply a temporary condition.</dd>
				<dt>iterative<br />
				<img alt="bells" height="133" src="../../images/bell_tower200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This is expressed in English by using the primary auxiliary 
				verb <em>be </em>(sometimes combined with the perfect-signalling
				<em>have</em>) and / or using adverbials to signal 
				the repeated nature of an event or action.<br />
				Its function is to signal that a momentary or progressive verb 
				or a state is repeated.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called the number time and again before 
				I got through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone has been stealing my vegetables from the garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have been taking this medicine for three years soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It had been raining on and off all day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are ringing the bells<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diplomats will be meeting for more discussions next month<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				To understand the difference between the continuous, durative 
				and iterative aspects, it is helpful to consider two adverbs:
				<em>continual</em> vs. <em>continuous.<br />
				</em>The first of these signals an iterative event as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car makes a continual clanking noise 
				but it comes and goes</em><br />
				The second signals a continuous or durative aspect as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car is making a continuous grinding 
				noise and something's seriously wrong</em></dd>
				<dt>prospective<br />
				<img alt="crystal" height="133" src="../../images/future_crystal_ball200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>English, of course, uses the modal auxiliary verb <em>will</em> 
				for the future reference function but it has, notoriously, a 
				number of other ways to signal a prospective event or state from 
				the point of view of the past, the present or the future.<br />
				The function of the aspect is to signal that an event or state 
				is forthcoming based on other states or events or current 
				knowledge of what happens as a matter of course.&nbsp; The forms 
				which refer to an unfulfilled prospective event (e.g., the first 
				one below) are signalling what is sometimes referred to as the 
				defective aspect.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was going to call on her mother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to be furious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't call now.&nbsp; They'll be having lunch.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can't stop now.&nbsp; I'm about to get on my train.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean to talk to him about that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're taking a holiday shortly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't intend to upset him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are we going to do if it rains?</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt>habitual<br />
				<img alt="habit" height="133" src="../../images/woman_smoking200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>English is unusual in reserving a semi-modal auxiliary verb 
				and using a central modal auxiliary verb for this function but 
				it can also use adverbials and base forms of the verb for the 
				same effect.<br />
				The function is to signal that something is or was habitually 
				done or the case.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used to live over there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would take the dog for really long walks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I studied there for two years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went to school in Margate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She takes the train to work</em><br />
				etc.</dd>

			<p>So quite a lot.</p>
			<p>What often confuses learners is the attempt to teach a tense form 
			with exemplifications of different aspects at the same time.&nbsp; 
			We have seen, for example, that the progressive, the durative and 
			the iterative aspects can all be realised through the use of the 
			primary auxiliary verb <em>be</em> in one of its forms <br />
			However, if the examples given of the use carelessly mix up the 
			three aspects, learners may be frustrated and confused and that's 
			not their fault.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was playing tennis<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was ringing the bell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was still sleeping</em><br />
			are all superficially the same tense form but the three sentences 
			signal progressive, iterative and durative events, respectively.&nbsp; 
			To present them together is simply asking for trouble.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, starting with the aspect we want to enable our 
			learners to express and giving them a range of ways of doing it does 
			make sense so we can present:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took the bus to school when I was a child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to take the bus to school when I was a child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would take the bus to school</em> <em>when I was a child</em><br />
			are all alternative ways to signal the habitual aspect in English 
			and presenting them together will not confuse learners unduly 
			because the concept is not shifting before their eyes.</p>
			<p>There's a little more on this below.</p>
			<p>If you have followed the general guide to aspect in this part of 
			the site, this diagram will be familiar.&nbsp; It's a good place to 
			start if you have been convinced that teaching the aspect first and 
			the tense forms second is a better way to proceed than teaching 
			tenses and then getting learners to understand which aspects they 
			may encode.</p>

		</table>
		
		<p>English tense forms and their concepts are difficult to grasp but the 
		verb itself has few inflexions.<br />
		Learning the forms of <em>be</em> and <em>have</em> and the single 
		change between the infinitive and past participle, along with the -<em>ing</em> 
		ending makes it simple to form lots of tenses.&nbsp; Expect some 
		avoidance, therefore, and the use of the perfect and progressive aspects 
		where the simple aspect is desirable.&nbsp; It is easier to form, for 
		example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was choosing</em><br />
		than to remember the past-tense of the verb and form<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I chose</em></p>
			<p>Learners whose first languages make changes internally or to the 
			endings of verbs to signal aspect (such as most Romance languages and 
			many others) will often be bewildered by the number of auxiliary 
			forms available to English speakers and simply avoid using them, 
			preferring to substitute rather clumsy adverbial formulations.&nbsp; 
			We may get then, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bangs on the door for a long time<br />
			</em>instead of the form to signal an iterative aspect such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been banging on the door for a while</em></p>
			<p>This is made worse by the fact that the verb <em>be</em> in 
			English is used to signal both a progressive or continuous action or 
			event and the passive voice.&nbsp; The meaning, therefore, of the 
			auxiliaries in something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car is being serviced<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The garden will be being attended to<br />
			</em>may be lost.<br />
			Forming such structures is even more challenging.<br />
			Learners may often, in these cases, avoid the complication of the 
			passive or the progressive forms and produce either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm servicing the car<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The garden will be attended to.</em></p>

		<p>When you plan a lesson on any particular tense form, time is well 
		spent thinking about a clear context in which to set the language.&nbsp; 
		For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style71">Present perfect for life 
					experiences up to <strong>now</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style73">Exotic foods (<em>I've never eaten</em> 
					etc.)<br  />
					Cultural event (<em>I've seen ..., I've visited the British 
					Museum</em> etc.)<br  />
					Conversational gambits (<em>You've been to ..., haven't you?</em> 
					etc.)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style67">Past perfect</td>
					<td class="auto-style68">Sequences of events in which 
					subsequent ones depend on early ones:<br  />

					forgotten ...</em> etc.)</td>

				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style69"><em>going to </em>prospective 
					aspect based on 
					<strong>present</strong> evidence</td>
					<td class="auto-style79">Forecasting weather from sky pictures<br  />

		<h3>Practice</h3>

			</table>
		<p>Practice also has to be in a context and have meaning for the learners or it's 
		just form manipulation.&nbsp; This is particularly important if the 
		learners' first language has a similar form used differently.&nbsp; For 
		example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder" style="width: 95%" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style100">Present perfect (life experiences 
					up to now)</td>
					<td class="auto-style99">Learners make lists of things they have never done, have 
					done, have done only once/twice etc.&nbsp;
					They then mingle with other students to see if their lists 
					overlap or not, asking and answering questions in the form.<br  />
					You can extend this activity to make sure that people ask 
					where? when? etc. in order to be definite and, accordingly, 
					select the past simple.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="auto-style5">
					<td class="auto-style100"><em>will</em> to show willingness</td>
					<td class="auto-style99">Learners role-play a willing person 
					and a demanding person:<br  />
					<em>A: There's no air in here.<br  />
					B: I'll open a window.<br  />
					A: I haven't got a pen.<br  />
					B: I'll get you one.</em><br  />
					etc.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="auto-style5">
					<td class="auto-style100">Present perfect as a conversational 
					gambit</td>
					<td class="auto-style99">Learners decide on pieces of 
					information they need to know about something and then find 
					out who can tell them by asking things 
					like <em>You've been to France, haven't you?&nbsp; Well, I've 
					been wondering ...<br  />
					</em>Learners invent gossipy stories about each other / teachers 
					etc. and then pass them on to a colleague who in turn 
					embellishes the snippet of scandal and passes it on again.<br  />
					E.g., <em>Did you know that John has moved in with Mary?&nbsp; 
					Yes, and she has decided he can't stay much longer.</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="auto-style5">
					<td class="auto-style100">Future perfect for changes by a

					<td class="auto-style99">Learners make predictions about how 
					they, their home town, their countries, the world will have

		<p>A structural approach to teaching English focuses on the form and then considers its meaning.&nbsp; 
		For example, we teach the form <span class="auto-style6">subject + be + 
		-<em>ing</em></span> (<em>They are talking</em>) and then consider what 
		it might mean (future arrangement, current event etc.)<br />
		A communicative / functional approach may reverse this and focus on the function to be expressed and see what ways the language has to express it.&nbsp; For example, we might start by focusing on making very polite requests and then teach a range of grammatical realisations such as<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you mind awfully ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask you to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it too much trouble to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if ...<br />
		</em>etc.<br />
It is often the case, however, that we don't do this with aspect.&nbsp; Aspect is 
		usually taught structurally as something secondary to the form of the verb:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a present perfect.&nbsp; What does it tell us about the speaker's view of the event?</em><br />
		We can, however, focus on the aspect and look at the various ways English has of signalling it because it, too, has a functional, communicative role.&nbsp; Two examples:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>How can English signal that an action is iterative (i.e., repeated)?</li>
			<li>How can English signal that an action is prospective (i.e., 
			imminent)?</li>
		</ol>

					<td class="auto-style99">Iterative</td>
					<td class="auto-style99"><em>She went on and on asking.<br  />
					They did it continually / repeatedly.<br  />
					I said it again and again.<br  />
					He banged the drum for hours.<br  />
					I mow the lawn every Friday.<br  />
					I used to get up late on Sundays.<br  />
					We would take long walks in the country every week</em><br  />
					etc.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="auto-style5">
					<td class="auto-style99">Prospective</td>
					<td class="auto-style99"><em>It's going to rain.<br  />
					She's about to get very angry.<br  />
					He's on the verge of applying.<br  />
					We're nearly at the point where ...<br  />

					I was on the point of when ...</em><br  />
					etc.</td>

				<p>You may have thought of others.<br />
				An approach like this which identifies a communicative function 
				and then focuses on the language to achieve it, is perfectly 
				legitimate in ELT and may be very fruitful as well as helpful 
				for learners whose first-language backgrounds lead them to focus more explicitly on aspects not often identified as core aspects in English.<br />
