		<p>English makes a good deal of use of affixation (either suffix or 
		prefix attachment), compounding and conversion but less of the other 
		means of word formation.&nbsp; Other languages do things differently and 
		you should know how your learners' languages do things.&nbsp; This will 
		help you plan what to teach and explain things clearly.</p>
		<p>Here's a run-down of some major language groups and a little about what 
		they do in this area.</p>
		<table cellspacing="0" class="auto-style22" style="width: 90%">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><strong>Languages</strong></td>
				<td class="auto-style23"><strong>What they do</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24">Arabic<br class="auto-style58" />
				(and other Semitic languages such as Hebrew and some languages of 
				north-east Africa)<br />
				Arabic is, however, probably better described as a language 
				group or macro-language because its varieties are rarely 
				mutually comprehensible.</td>
				<td class="auto-style23">Arabic words take their form from their 
				function.&nbsp; Words have what are called triliteral roots.&nbsp; 
				For example, from the three consonants K, T and B, Arabic makes 
				a large number of connected words by the insertion of prefixes, 
				suffixes and infixes:<br class="auto-style58" />
				KaTaBa, <em>he wrote</em>, yaKTuB, <em>let him write</em>, KiTaB,
				<em>book, </em>maKTaB<em>, office</em>, KaTiB, <em>clerk</em> and so on.<br class="auto-style58" />
				Arabic has 28 consonants and that figure means there are 3000 or 
				so combinations of them available to generate words (but not all 
				of them can be used for phonological reasons).&nbsp; In 
				theory, any triliteral root can be expanded to make 40-odd 
				connected words.<br class="auto-style58" />
				The process of affixation will not, therefore, be mysterious to 
				Arabic speakers.<br class="auto-style58" />
				The problem arises with compounding because that is an alien 
				concept to speakers of Semitic languages, a fact which causes 
				translators all kinds of problems.&nbsp; Compounds are usually 
				rendered as paraphrases along the lines of <em>an X that is used 
				for Y</em> or <em>a thing that is beyond another thing</em> etc.<br class="auto-style58" />
				Simple conversion is very rare and instances in English will 
				cause some confusion, for example, using <em>drink</em> as 
				a noun and a verb.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24">Chinese languages</td>
				<td class="auto-style23">Modern Standard Chinese is an isolating 
				language with a very large number of monosyllables.&nbsp; 
				Affixation will be an almost wholly unfamiliar concept to speakers 
				of these languages.<br class="auto-style58" />
				Compounding is a different matter and the concept will be 
				familiar (even if the way it is done is very different).&nbsp; 
				For example, in Cantonese, the words <em>great</em> and <em>
				space</em> may be combined to render the concept of <em>
				emptiness.<br class="auto-style58" />
				</em>Conversion exists but is normally signalled by a particle.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24">Slavonic languages including Russian, 
				Polish, Ukrainian, Czech, Slovak etc.</td>
				<td class="auto-style23">Slavonic languages are synthetic in the 
				sense that grammatical meaning is often expressed through 
				affixation.&nbsp; It is somewhat rarer to make new words by 
				affixation but the concept will not be wholly strange.<br class="auto-style58" />
				Compounding is common in these languages and the concept will be 
				familiar; noun–noun, adjective–noun and noun–verb compounds are 
				all frequent.<br class="auto-style58" />
				Conversion is rare.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24">Germanic languages including, e.g., 
				Dutch, German, Afrikaans and English.<br class="auto-style58" />
				Also Scandinavian languages including Finnish (in this case)</td>
				<td class="auto-style23">These languages use both affixation 
				and compounding to make new words.&nbsp; There will be few 
				conceptual difficulties for speakers of these languages.<br class="auto-style58" />
				Conversion is rare with changes in word-class usually being 
				signalled by affixation.<br />
				German in particular is an agglutinating language which forms 
				new words by simply combining others.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24">Italic languages including French, 
				Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian etc.<br />
				Also Greek (in this case)</td>
				<td class="auto-style23">Compounding and affixation are common 
				in these languages, e.g., in Italian <em>ferrovia</em>&nbsp;(railway<em>) </em>
				is formed from <em>ferro</em>&nbsp;(iron) +&nbsp;<em>via</em>&nbsp;(way).&nbsp; 
				In Greek, the word for <em>weekend</em> (a compound in English, 
				too) is formed by compounding the words for <em>Saturday</em> 
				and <em>Sunday</em>.<br class="auto-style58" />
				There should be no conceptual difficulty but there is a tendency 
				for learners with these first languages to guess and render 
				Latin- or Greek-derived words in English in a familiar way (to them).<br />
				These languages are usually left headed so it the first item in 
				a compound which determines meaning and word class.&nbsp; In 
				French, e.g., a <em>timbre postage</em> is a type of <em>timbre</em> 
				(<em>stamp</em>) not a type of <em>postage</em> but in English, 
				a right-headed language, the determining item comes to the right (<em>postage stamp</em>).<br class="auto-style58" />
				Because these are inflected languages, conversion without a 
				signalling suffix is rare.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24">Japanese and Korean</td>
				<td class="auto-style23">Japanese and Korean both have a tendency to agglutinate 
				and uses affixation (often only suffixes) to change word class 
				so, for example, a noun may be converted into its adjective by 
				affixing the adjective-forming suffix.&nbsp; The concept is not 
				alien.<br class="auto-style58" />
				Un-signalled conversion is alien.<br class="auto-style58" />
				Compounding, too, is common in both languages.</td>

		word class, are considered.&nbsp; Some might think that's too much for a 
		presentation but fine for a revision exercise.)</p>
		<p>There are some significant issues to do with how much more productive 
		and useful some affixes are than others and these are covered in the 
		section in <a href="../lexicogrammar/morphology.html">the guide to 
		morphology</a> to do with teaching implications.&nbsp; This is repeated 
		here so if you have already followed that guide, move swiftly on.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>headedness</strong></dt>
			<dd>English is right-headed so the second part of a compound 
			determines:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meaning: a <em>doorman</em> is a type of <em>man</em>, not a 
			type of <em>door</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; word class: a <em>pushbutton</em> is a noun for a type of <em>
			button</em>, not a verb for a type of <em>pushing<br />
			</em>If you have learners whose first language is left headed (as, 
			for example, most Italic languages are), you need to be alert to 
			this comprehension problem.</dd>
			<dt><strong>transparency</strong></dt>
			<dd>When introducing the concepts of word formation in English, it 
			makes sense to start with those morphemes whose meaning is the most 
			transparent.&nbsp; They also tend to be the most productive and, therefore, the most useful.<br />
			So, start with simple affixes which have a near one-to-one 
			relationship between form and meaning:<br />
			Suffixes like: <span class="style_black"><em>able, ness, ity, ize/ise</em></span> 
			are good candidates.<br />
			Prefixes such as<span class="style_black"><em> un, re, pre</em></span> 
			are also good candidates.</dd>
			<dt><strong>frequency and usefulness</strong></dt>
			<dd>are, of course, considerations to bear in mind when deciding on 
			any teaching of lexis and it is sensible to exclude noun-making 
			suffixes such as <span class="style_black"><em>th</em></span> and 
			adjective-forming suffixes such as <span class="style_black"><em>
			esque</em></span> because they are either wholly or nearly fully 
			unproductive in English.&nbsp; In fact, singling out
			<span class="style_black"><em>th</em></span> as a noun-former at all 
			is probably a waste of time.<br />
			It makes more sense to focus on:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Noun-forming suffixes like <span class="style_black"><em>ness, er, 
			ity, eer, ist</em></span> rather than <span class="style_black"><em>
			ant, dom, ery, hood</em></span> etc.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Adjective-forming suffixes like <span class="style_black"><em>able, 
			less, ful, ish, ist</em></span> rather than
			<span class="style_black"><em>ous, ic, ian</em></span>.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The adverb-forming <span class="style_black"><em>ly</em></span> 
			rather than <span class="style_black"><em>wards, ways</em></span> or
			<span class="style_black"><em>wise</em></span>.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The verb-forming <span class="style_black"><em>ise/ize</em></span> 
			rather than <span class="style_black"><em>fy, en</em></span>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>constraints</strong></dt>
			<dd>Phonology and meaning are the two to focus on because etymology 
			will only be useful in real time for learners with a narrow range of 
			European first languages.<br />
			It is, for example, predictable from the syllable number and stress 
			pattern (two syllables or more, stress not at the end) that the 
			verbs from <em>computer, brutal, central, economy, familiar, 
			national, personal</em> etc. will all end in
			<span class="style_black"><em>ize</em></span> 
			or <span class="style_black"><em>ise</em></span>.&nbsp; The 
			constraints on the use of <span class="style_black"><em>en</em></span> 
			in this function are much less easily applied but phonologically, 
			for example, deriving <em>quiet<span class="style_black">en</span></em> 
			from <em>quiet</em> is not too challenging once you spot the /t/ 
			ending.<br />
			Already-negative adjectives (like <em>ugly, vile, 
			hateful, odious, helpless, antagonistic</em>) do not take 
			antonym-making prefixes.<br />
			We can't have <em>*unugly, *unvile, *dishateful, *unhelpless</em> 
			etc.<br />
			Positive adjectives (such as <em>kind, 
			comfortable, generous, helpful, likeable</em>) do take 
			antonym-making prefixes.<br />
			We can have <em>unkind, dislikeable, unhelpful</em> etc.<br />
			This is easy to grasp 
			and the knowledge will help learners avoid a good deal of potential 
			error.</dd>
			<dt><strong>comprehension vs. production</strong></dt>
			<dd>Armed with a knowledge of the function of common affixes, 
			learners can significantly increase their receptive lexicon.<br />
			Production is harder, of course, but opting for the most productive 
			affixes when speculating on word formation will usually pay 
			dividends.&nbsp; If you want to make the opposites of these 
			adjectives, what would you choose?<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cut, read, quiet, easy, lived-in, organised, classified, worried</em><br />
			Participle adjectives very frequently form their opposites with the 
			simple <span class="style_black"><em>un</em></span>.<br />
			Nouns formed from adjectives are overwhelmingly made with
			<span class="style_black"><em>ness</em></span> (and less frequently
			<span class="style_black"><em>ity</em></span>) so that's the way to 
			bet if you want to form nouns from adjectives from, e.g.,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delightful, malicious, rocky, thrifty, dark, clever</em><br />
			all take the <span class="style_black"><em>ness</em></span> suffix when forming a noun.<br />
			If the adjective ends in <span class="style_black"><em>able</em></span> or 
			<span class="style_black"><em>ible</em></span>, 
			opt for <span class="style_black"><em>ity</em></span>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; readable, drinkable, editable, pronounceable, describable </em>
			etc.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>Here are some other issues and ideas to consider:</p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li>For some learners, the morphological patterns in the target 
			language are intrinsically interesting and they are happy to search 
			out patterns of meaning given, for example, a text containing 
			prefixed or suffixed words from which the meanings can be identified 
			or inferred.&nbsp; Almost any text will contain compounds but 
			advertising language and news reports are rich sources.</li>
			<li>An understanding of word class is, of course, fundamental to 
			learning any language.&nbsp; Learners can, for example, be given a 
			text which contains language such as</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="auto-style26"><em>He was walking crab<span class="auto-style21">wise</span> 
		along the ledge, climbing up<span class="auto-style21">wards</span> and 
		holding on tight<span class="auto-style21">ly</span> to the rope.&nbsp; 
		He thought to himself, "This is fool<span class="auto-style21">ish</span> 
		insan<span class="auto-style21">ity</span>, I'm not a mountain<span class="auto-style66">eer</span> 
		and not particularly hero<span class="auto-style21">ic</span>, either."&nbsp; 
		However, the satisf<span class="auto-style66">action</span> and happi<span class="auto-style21">ness</span> 
		he felt on final<span class="auto-style21">ly</span> reaching the summit 
		less<span class="auto-style21">en</span>ed his moodi<span class="auto-style21">ness</span>.</em></p>
		<p class="auto-style29">There are tasks that can be set with texts like 
		this:<br />
		a) to match suffix to word class and draw a table classifying them<br />
		b) why are two endings underlined?&nbsp; (Clue: think of stress.)<br />
		c) to reconstruct the text substituting the words and word classes by 
		choosing to use words with different affixes or removing them.&nbsp; 
		Synonym dictionaries are helpful.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
		<p class="auto-style26"><em>He walked side<span class="auto-style21">ways</span> 
		along the ledge climbing energet<span class="auto-style21">ically</span> 
		and holding glue<span class="auto-style21">-like</span> to the rope.&nbsp; 
		He thought to himself, "This is idiot<span class="auto-style21">ic</span> 
		mad<span class="auto-style21">ness</span>, I'm not a climb<span class="auto-style21">er</span> 
		or particularly courage<span class="auto-style21">ous</span>, either.&nbsp; 
		However, the content<span class="auto-style21">ment</span> and pleas<span class="auto-style21">ure
		</span>he felt on eventual<span class="auto-style21">ly</span> reaching 
		the summit height<span class="auto-style21">en</span>ed 
		his mood.</em></p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li>Prefixation can be handled similarly.&nbsp; Take short texts 
			like:</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="auto-style26"><em>He thought it was <span class="auto-style21">
		im</span>possible to <span class="auto-style21">re-</span>do the work 
		and he explained to his <span class="auto-style21">co-</span>workers why<br />
		She was <span class="auto-style21">un</span>happy that her
		<span class="auto-style21">ex-</span>husband had decided to
		<span class="auto-style21">re</span>join the navy<br />
		He <span class="auto-style21">de</span>frosted the
		<span class="auto-style21">pre-</span>cooked chicken he got from the
		<span class="auto-style21">super</span>market in time but
		<span class="auto-style21">mis</span>calculated how long it would take 
		to <span class="auto-style21">re</span>heat</em></p>
		<p class="auto-style29">The teaching points are<br />
		a) to understand the 
		effect of the prefixes<br />
		b) to see what other prefixes might be 
		substituted and what effect on meaning they have and then<br />
		c) to get the 
		learners to compose similar texts for their colleagues to investigate.<br />
		What happens, for example, if you remove the prefixes from the first 
		and second sentences?&nbsp; What substitutions and removals can you make 
		in the third sentence?</p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li>Compounds can be treated in ways which are similar to handling 
			the teaching of collocation (for obvious reasons):<br />
			a) matching exercises with words from the same field are helpful in 
			terms of making them memorable.&nbsp; You can start by brainstorming 
			things you need for school (or work, a holiday, whatever) and then 
			go on to focus on compounds with something like:</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="auto-style29">b) Compounds can sometimes be chained and 
		patterned to help people who like graphics (as most of us do).<br />
		Learners can be asked to make their own chains starting with certain 
		common components.<br />
		Start, e.g., with the word <em>film</em> and see what 
		compounds you can elicit, teach or get your learners to discover (in 
		dictionaries or on-line corpuses).&nbsp; You may get something like:<br />
		<img alt="film compounds" height="309" src="../../imagesgraphics/filmcompounds.png" width="300" /><br />
		Then take each outlier in turn and assign one to each group of learners 
		with the task of researching further compounds so they come up for the 
		word <em>industry </em>with something like:<br />
		<img alt="industry compounds" height="308" src="../../imagesgraphics/industrycompounds.png" width="300" /><br />
		Each group gets a different word.<br />
		You can of course, repeat the activity with words from a different 
		'daughter' chart<em> ad infinitum</em>.<br />
		The exercise works well with writing tasks based around the main topic 
		words in the centres of the charts.</p>
