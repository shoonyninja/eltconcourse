			<h1>Teaching one-to-one</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="1-1" height="207" src="../../images/hands_explain310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Many teachers, especially the newly qualified, find themselves 
			teaching one-to-one lessons for which they have not been prepared by 
			their training course(s).<br />
			Few initial or in-service courses focus specifically on the area and 
			the assumption is, presumably, that qualified teachers can simply 
			adapt classroom teaching to the one-to-one setting.<br />
			That may be the case but there seems to be a role for a guide to how 
			to get the best out of the setting and how to avoid the worst 
			pitfalls.</p>
			<p>There is an important difference in the roles you may take on 
			when teaching one to one.&nbsp; You may be:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>A mentor</strong><br />
				In this case, the learner is operating almost wholly 
				independently with little input from you.<br />
				Your responsibility is to direct the learner's efforts and 
				assess progress.&nbsp; You are not teaching &ndash; the 
				materials do the teaching and you do the directing and assessing 
				of progress.<br />
				In this sense, you are more like a supervisor than a teacher.</li>
				<li><strong>An instructor</strong><br />
				In this case, you are teaching.&nbsp; You do the preparation, 
				supply the majority of the materials, set the tasks, explain 
				language systems and skills and assess the outcomes.<br />
				In what follows, the assumption is that you are in this role.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the following there are numerous links to other guides on this 
			site and all the links open in a new tab.&nbsp; At the end, they are 
			repeated but do not open in new tabs.</p>

			</table>
			<p>One-to-one teaching has a number of characteristics which 
			distinguish it from group teaching (even if the group is small).&nbsp; 
			Group teaching of two or more people allows for a number of 
			classroom techniques not available to the one-to-one teacher such as 
			mingling exercises, pair work, collaborative learning and so on.<br />
			Here's a run-down of the essential differences with some comment 
			concerning the advantages that they bestow and the disadvantages we 
			need to ameliorate.</p>

			<p>The most obvious advantage of one-to-one teaching is the syllabus 
			content which can be finely tuned to the learner's needs, strengths 
			and weaknesses.&nbsp; However, to take full advantage, it is, 
			naturally, important that you actually <strong>have</strong> a 
			syllabus.<br />
			Some learners are more sophisticated than others and know to a 
			nicety exactly what they need to learn, what skills they need to 
			learn and how well they need to perform.&nbsp; They are the easy 
			ones.<br />
			Others may just need some one-to-one tuition to catch up with or 
			join a regular class and they, too, are easy to accommodate 
			providing you know what the syllabus of the class is.</p>
			<p>It is more difficult to cater to the needs of learners who have 
			little idea what they need and for them you will need do two things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Design and administer a proper needs analysis.</li>
				<li>Design and administer a diagnostic test to see how far 
				towards their needs they will have to travel.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>On this site, there is a guide to constructing and administering 
			a needs analysis for:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Learners who need English for Business (often concerned with 
				having one-to-one tuition).<br />
				<a href="../be/business_english_overview.html#needs" target="_blank">Click here to open that guide in a new tab</a>.</li>
				<li>General English learners who need English for less well 
				defined purposes.<br />
				<a href="needs_analyses.html">Click here to open that guide in a 
				new tab</a>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In either case, there are some key areas to consider:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>setting</strong></dt>
			<dd>in what settings (work, school, university, social encounters, 
			with native speakers, dealing with officialdom etc.) does the 
			subject need to use English?</dd>
			<dt><strong>skills</strong></dt>
			<dd>does the learner need to deploy all four skills or are some of 
			them more important than others?</dd>
			<dt><strong>sub-skills</strong></dt>
			<dd>of the important ones, are there particular subskills (such as 
			writing e-mails, giving oral presentations etc.) that the learner 
			needs?</dd>
			<dt><strong>accuracy levels</strong></dt>
			<dd>is it important that the learner focuses on producing accurate 
			language or is basic communicative competence the aim?</dd>
			<dt><strong>functions</strong></dt>
			<dd>are there specific functions (such as asking for permission, 
			inviting, offering, declining etc.) which are particularly important 
			for this learner?</dd>
			<dt><strong>notions</strong></dt>
			<dd>are there particular notions (such as arrangement of objects, 
			degree, motion etc.) which the learner needs to be able to handle 
			successfully?</dd>
			<dt><strong>registers</strong></dt>
			<dd>are there particular registers (academia, engineering, the 
			military, air transport, tourism etc.) in which the learner will 
			have to use English and will need the lexical and structural means 
			to do so?</dd>
			<dt><strong>learning preferences</strong></dt>
			<dd>does the learner have a clear idea of how learning happens?&nbsp; 
			You would be foolish to ignore the prejudices that a one-to-one 
			learner brings to a course.&nbsp; You need to work together no 
			matter how naïve or misguided you think the learner is in this 
			respect.</dd>
		</dl>
			<p>Once you have a list of what's required you can construct a test 
			to see where the learner currently is.&nbsp; To do that, you will 
			need to have an understanding of validity more than reliability 
			(because you are only focused on one learner).<br />
			There is, of course a guide to testing on this site, two, in fact:<br />
			<a href="../../initial/teaching/testing_essentials.html" target="_blank">Click 
			here to open the essential guide</a>.<br />
			<a href="../background/testing.html" target="_blank">Click here to 
			open the more advanced guide</a>.</p>
			<p>There are two good reasons for carrying out a thorough needs 
			analysis and administering a diagnostic test:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The learner may have needs hitherto unconsidered which a 
				thorough needs analysis questionnaire or interview (or both) may 
				identify.</li>
				<li>It reassures and encourages the learner that you are taking 
				your professional responsibilities seriously and are concerned 
				to meet the learner's needs as exactly and completely as 
				possible.&nbsp; That gets you off to a good start.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is, however, not uncommon for learners to say something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to be better at communicating and 
			taking part in conversations in English.<br />
			</em>and if that is the case, you will need to construct a 
			conversational course with lots of opportunities to take the learner 
			out of the comfort zone and expose him or her to topics and 
			functions in spoken English that are novel and demanding as well as 
			motivating and challenging.<br />
			You can, in fact, take a Dogme approach to such a course and let 
			conversation drive the teaching.&nbsp; It will mean you need to 
			think on your feet and avoid allowing the lessons to degenerate into 
			chit-chat in which the learner is simply deploying language already 
			mastered and learning too little.</p>

			</table>
			<p>While many learners see this as an advantage (and are prepared to 
			pay for it, or persuade someone else to), constant monitoring of 
			one's performance can become trying and may even be threatening and 
			exhausting.</p>
			<p>It is, of course, a huge advantage for the learner to receive the 
			teacher's undivided attention but you need to lighten the load from 
			time to time.&nbsp; This concerns how you respond to the learner and 
			there are two ways to do that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Respond to the form of the learner's production (written or 
				oral).<br />
				This is stressful for learners who, although they often say they 
				want to be <strong>consistently</strong> corrected, do not mean 
				that they want to be <strong>constantly</strong> corrected.<br />
				You need to decide as you go along how much feedback of what 
				kind is likely to be assimilated by the learner.&nbsp; Too much 
				and it becomes interruptive and dispiriting, too little and you 
				aren't seen to be doing your job.&nbsp; Individual tolerance 
				levels and abilities to absorb correction are very variable so 
				look out for signs of distraction and tiredness and go easy when 
				you see them.<br />
				There is a guide to correction on this site which sets out the 
				criteria you should consider before diving in and correcting a 
				learner.&nbsp;
				<a href="../../initial/teaching/correcting_learners.html" target="_blank">Click here to open it in a new tab</a>.</li>
				<li>Respond to the content of the learner's production.<br />
				Learners, especially in one-to-one settings, will frequently 
				want to talk about things which are of personal relevance to 
				themselves and need to be given the opportunity to do so.&nbsp; 
				It pays dividends from time to time to focus the lesson on 
				mutual disclosure.&nbsp; You will need to open up a little about 
				yourself to get the learner to reciprocate in most cases.<br />
				You need to judge when the time is right to ignore error and 
				concentrate on what is being said, not how it is being said.<br />
				If you are skilled enough, you can even take physical or mental 
				notes as you go and focus on the language areas later on in the 
				lesson.</li>

			<p>An advantage of one-to-one teaching is that any task you set is 
			completed in the learner's own time and at the learner's own pace.<br />
			Obscurely, some teachers feel that they are somehow in dereliction 
			of duty if the learner is doing a task (which has been laboriously 
			prepared and targeted) and they are apparently doing nothing.&nbsp; 
			Most learners do not feel that way and appreciate a bit of time and 
			space to absorb the data they have encountered in the task.<br />
			Do not be afraid of silence &ndash; it is in periods of silent 
			thought and contemplation that a great deal of learning happens.</p>
			<p>Taken too far, of course, and the reverse effect will become 
			evident.&nbsp; Any task that takes more than about 5 minutes of 
			one-to-one time is probably too long and learners may well ask why 
			they aren't doing it at home and getting feedback from you in paid 
			time.</p>
			<p>The moral is to pepper lessons with short achievable tasks which 
			are rich in content and provide good opportunities for helpful 
			feedback.</p>

			<p>One-to-one learners get a great deal of speaking and listening 
			practice because they are the only other person involved.&nbsp; The 
			temptation is to assume that no further practice in these two areas 
			is required.&nbsp; But it often is.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Listening</dt>
				<dd>The sort of listening practice the learner is getting is 
				listening to you explain, comment, give feedback and manage the 
				lesson.&nbsp; That's useful but if the learner needs to improve 
				more general listening skills, you'll need to gather a range of 
				text types and put together tasks to develop subskills too.&nbsp; 
				Many listening tasks have to be carried out in real time with no 
				opportunity to replay the tape or get the speaker to repeat.&nbsp; 
				These sorts of tasks need to be done in lesson time.<br />
				A TV, laptop or other playback device is invaluable.</dd>
				<dt>Speaking</dt>
				<dd>Again, the learner may be getting plenty of speaking 
				practice asking questions and responding to you but you also 
				need to focus on role playing other situations and practising 
				the appropriate language in a variety of settings.&nbsp; The 
				learner or needs analysis will tell you what they should be.<br />
				You, as much as the learner, need to be prepared to take on a 
				range of roles.</dd>
				<dt>Writing</dt>
				<dd>It is sometimes assumed that writing and reading practice 
				should be done outside of class times but that's not always the 
				case.<br />
				A simple writing exercise to undertake from time to time is for 
				both you and the learner to take a vow of silence for, say, 20 
				minutes and communicate only by writing on tear-off pages of 
				notebooks.&nbsp; It forces the learner to write quickly and 
				intelligibly but also allows you to take advantage of the 
				learner's output to revisit language or teach new structures and 
				lexis.</dd>
				<dt>Reading</dt>
				<dd>Long reading texts are probably best handled as out-of-class 
				tasks because it is unproductive (and exceptionally dull) for 
				you to sit and watch the learner read for more than a few 
				minutes.<br />
				However, tasks which are designed to be done in real time to 
				develop subskills need to be tackled.&nbsp; There is little 
				point in trying to develop scanning skills, for example, by 
				asking the learner to access the text at home.&nbsp; The learner 
				needs a time limit and a bit of pressure to learn to deploy the 
				skill authentically.<br />
			That is something that often needs to be explained to the learner</dd>

			<p> If a group of learners each have three things they would like to 
			discuss this week, it is very unlikely that you will be able to 
			cater for more than a small fraction of them.<br />
			In a one-to-one situation, it is very unlikely that you won't have 
			time to address <strong>all</strong> of them.<br />
			That's an advantage to be aware of and exploit.</p>
			<p> If you have carried out a proper needs analysis or even just 
			taken the time to get to know your learner, you will be able to 
			identify topics which will appeal and set the language and skills 
			syllabus within the topics.<br />
			But it's not just your choice that matters.<br />
			For example, if your aim is to work on the subskills needed to 
			overcome potentially blocking lexis in a reading or listening text, 
			it really does not matter to you what the text has for a topic.&nbsp; 
			Providing you get early sight of it so you have time to prepare, any 
			text which contains lexis significantly but not absurdly above your 
			learner's level will do.<br />
			With a little encouragement and training, most learners find it 
			challenging and motivating to be in charge of selecting at least 
			some of the materials to be used in the lessons.<br />
			Once the learner has selected materials a few times, you will be 
			much better placed to select those of your own which you know will 
			appeal and appear relevant and engaging.</p>

			<p> Here we need a bit of theory.&nbsp; There is a guide on this 
			site to scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development that you 
			may like to read through.&nbsp;
			<a href="scaffolding_zpd.html" target="_blank">You can open it in a 
			new tab by clicking here</a>.<br />
			Here's a quick summary:</p>
			<p>The Zone of Proximal Development 
		or the ZPD it is the learning zone in which the learner can 
			achieve the task with input 
			from someone who knows more (you).&nbsp; It lies between tasks which the 
		learner can already do without help (so won't learn much) and tasks 
		which the learner cannot even attempt (so won't learn much).&nbsp; If 
		the task is too easy, the learner will get bored.&nbsp; If it's too hard 
		the learner will become anxious.<br />
			The diagram from that guide is:<br />
			<img alt="zpd" height="240" src="../../imagesgraphics/zpd_red_zone310.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Your task is, naturally, to make sure that the input you give 
			(i.e., the language you use, the tasks you set and the materials you 
			employ) are set in the red zone in this diagram. It is there, so the 
			theory goes, that learning will happen.<br />
			The advantage of one-to-one teaching in this respect is obvious 
			enough: you only have one zone to deal with at a time. So:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Do not set tasks that your learner will find easy.&nbsp; You 
				need to inject adequate challenge.</li>
				<li>Do not set tasks which are rich in content but have too much 
				content.&nbsp; You will overwhelm the learner and make your own 
				life difficult because there is just too much to explain.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Where the happy medium lies is something that you will need to 
			learn about the person you are teaching and it will vary depending 
			on the skill type and the sorts of knowledge the learner needs to 
			bring to the task.<br />
			Of course, if you have administered a proper diagnostic test at the 
			outset, finding the learner's ZPD is much easier.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p> Here we are considering lesson shape, not content.&nbsp; That's 
			done above.<br />
			One-to-one teaching allows all lesson shapes to be acceptable to the 
			learner whereas teaching groups requires more variation to appeal to 
			everyone fairly and to provide some variety.<br />
			Individuals, however, need variety, too.</p>
			<p> This is where your preferences are overridden by the learner's.<br />
			You may, for example, be convinced of the advantages of a Test&ndash;Teach–Test 
			approach to lesson design with lots of opportunities for inductive 
			learning and little reliance on providing rules except those which 
			the learners discover.<br />
			That's fine (if a little rigid) but if you take this approach with a 
			learner who likes rules and enjoys the problem-solving nature of 
			applying rules to raw data and is simultaneously irritated by being 
			asked to do something beyond his or her capacity, then you are going 
			to encounter serious problems.</p>
			<p> This is not to say that having identified that you have a 
			learner who likes lessons structured in a particular way that you 
			cannot depart from the structure to inject a bit of variety.&nbsp; 
			In fact, you should, because:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Certain lesson shapes and structures lend themselves to 
				particular skills and materials better than others.</li>
				<li>Your learner may not be aware of alternative lessons shapes 
				and find the change challenging and intriguing.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>One-to-one lessons can very easily become monotonous and dull if 
			you allow them to so you need to vary both lesson structure and task 
			types.&nbsp; The following open in new tabs so you can remind 
			yourself of just some of the possible alternatives:<br />

			<p>It is often the case that a one-to-one teacher can speak the 
			language of the learner.<br />
			While there is an obvious danger of overusing the learner's first 
			language and allowing the lesson to degenerate into chatting (or, 
			worse, an opportunity for the teachers to improve their own language 
			skills), there is an obvious advantage or two because the teacher 
			will be aware of specific inter-lingual difficulties and errors that 
			are likely to arise and tricky but unusual lexis can be easily 
			explained to move on to more important matters.</p>
