	<h1>Conducting needs analyses</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="wish" height="206" src="../../images/child_wish310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p><a name="na1"></a>Needs analyses depend on our learners already 
		knowing, or our ability to discover, their needs for English language 
		training.&nbsp; There a number of ways of going about conducting a needs 
		analysis but before we look at them, let's get the trees out of the way 
		of the wood.&nbsp; Which of the following do you think are true?&nbsp; 
		<a href="#na1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'needsan1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have an answer</a>.<br />
		Needs analysis:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>is different from testing</li>
			<li>always includes some form of diagnostic testing</li>
			<li>should include some form of assessment of learning style</li>
			<li>refers to people's need for the language only</li>
			<li>can be conducted without consulting the learner(s)</li>
			<li>is a straightforward process involving canvassing our students' 
			views</li>
			<li>must always be done before a course is planned</li>
		</ol>
		<div id="needsan1" style="visibility:hidden">
		
		<p><span class="auto-style3">Comments:</span></p>
		<ol class="auto-style3">
			<li>Yes.&nbsp; Needs analyses may <em>include</em> some form of 
			testing but it is not the same thing as testing.</li>
			<li>No.&nbsp; Some analyses don't have to have a test involved in 
			them.&nbsp; For example, if you are constructing a course for very 
			elementary learners, a diagnostic test may not provide any useful 
			data.</li>
			<li>Maybe.&nbsp; See
			<a href="../background/learningstyles.html#crits">
			the criticisms of learning-style theories</a> for more.&nbsp; Some 
			do, some don't.</li>
			<li>No.&nbsp; People's needs for and wishes concerning particular 
			materials, groupings and procedures may also be considered.</li>
			<li>Yes, oddly.&nbsp; There are numerous occasions when the 
			learners' employers, schools, sponsors etc. know what the needs are 
			for their clients.</li>
			<li>No.&nbsp; This is a complicated area because we are relying 
			quite heavily on introspection.</li>
			<li>Should, perhaps, but in the real world it's not always possible.&nbsp; 
			If a course is well described, learners are often able to 
			self-select, depending on their own perceptions of what they need 
			without any needs analysis.</li>

		<p>The usual way of conducting a needs analysis is some form of 
		questioning.&nbsp; However, even simple questions such as <em>What area 
		of English is most important to you?</em> are not as simple and may not 
		be as useful as they look.<br />
		Think for a moment about why this might be the case and then 
		<a href="#na2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'needsan2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">click here

		<div id="needsan2" style="visibility:hidden"><ol class="auto-style3">
			<li>The question requires a level of introspection which not all 
			learners have.</li>
			<li>The respondent needs some meta-language (such as <em>study 
			skills, reading skills, tense structures, functions, notions </em>
			etc.) to produce a helpful response.</li>
			<li>The respondents may actually write down what they think are 
			important skills that they have heard about rather than what is 
			important to them.</li>
			<li>Respondents may not know what is important to them.</li>
			<li>Respondents may give the answer they think the questioner wants.</li>

		<h4>The Johari window</h4>
		<p>The Johari window was invented over 60 years ago by Joseph Luft and 
		Harrington Ingham (hence its name).&nbsp; It was originally designed to 
		help people try to understand themselves and it looks a bit like this:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="johari" height="201" src="../../imagesgraphics/johari.png" width="300" /></p>
		<p>The four central areas are described by the 'Things ...' sentences 
		surrounding them.<br />
		For example, the Facade is the area of things that I know about myself 
		but keep hidden from others.&nbsp; The Blind Spot refers to things that 
		others see in me which I know nothing about.&nbsp; Insight is our 
		ability to draw on our unconscious understanding to realise something 
		about ourselves.<br />
		Originally, the technique was used for people to select 6 adjectives to 
		describe themselves and then their peers were asked to select 6 which 
		described the subject.&nbsp; Putting these adjectives into the grid, it 
		is claimed, helps people to see themselves as others see them and be 
		better able to use insight and introspection.<br />
		For our purposes here it stands as a reminder that however carefully a 
		questionnaire or interview process is designed, it ultimately depends on 
		people knowing about themselves and, as the window demonstrates, few of 
		us really do.</p>

		<p>Before we start a needs analysis we need to do one on 
		ourselves:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>What do we want to know?</li>
			<li>How are we going to discover it?</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>What</h3>
		<p>There is a wide range of things that we might want to know, of 
		course.&nbsp; Among them are:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>setting</strong></dt>
			<dd>in what settings (work, school, university, social encounters, 
			with native speakers, dealing with officialdom etc.) does the 
			subject need to use English?</dd>
			<dt><strong>skills</strong></dt>
			<dd>do the learners need to deploy all four skills or are some of 
			them more important than others?</dd>
			<dt><strong>sub-skills</strong></dt>
			<dd>of the important ones, are there particular subskills (such as 
			writing e-mails, giving oral presentations etc.) that the learners 
			need?</dd>
			<dt><strong>accuracy levels</strong></dt>
			<dd>is it important that the learners focus on producing accurate 
			language or is basic communicative competence the aim?</dd>
			<dt><strong>functions</strong></dt>
			<dd>are there specific functions (such as asking for permission, 
			inviting, offering, declining etc.) which are particularly important 
			in the setting described?</dd>
			<dt><strong>notions</strong></dt>
			<dd>are there particular notions (such as arrangement of objects, 
			degree, motion etc.) which the learners need to be able to handle 
			successfully?</dd>
			<dt><strong>registers</strong></dt>
			<dd>are there particular registers (academia, engineering, the 
			military, air transport, tourism etc.) in which the learners will 
			have to use English and will need the lexical and structural means 
			to do so?</dd>
			<dt><strong>learning styles</strong></dt>
			<dd>are there particularly common learning styles in the group?&nbsp; 
			See <a href="../background/learningstyles.html">the guide to learning styles </a>
			for ways of gathering these data.&nbsp; If you do gather this 
			information, what are you going to do with it and do you trust it?</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>You may have thought of others.&nbsp; Too often, as soon as we start to 
		construct a needs analysis, what we need to know becomes clear.&nbsp; It 
		should, of course, be clear before we start.</p>
		<p>Clearly, <strong>the nature of the course will determine what data we 
		want to gather</strong>.&nbsp; It may be quite narrowly focused if, e.g. 
		we are dealing with an ESP (English for Special Purposes) course such as 
		one targeted at a particular register and set of skills, or an EAP 
		(English for Academic Purposes) in which we also know the register and 
		the skills people need (essay writing, seminar presentations etc.).<br />
		If, on the other hand, we are planning a General English course 
		(sometimes called ENAP, English for No Apparent Purpose), we may need to 
		gather much wider data concerning the learners' views of their own 
		strengths, weaknesses and needs.</p>
		<h3>How</h3>
		<p>There are really only two main ways:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>On paper: questionnaires, written prose responses from learners 
			and so on.</li>
			<li>Face-to-face: interviews, focus groups, discussions etc.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Both of these have pros and cons:</p>

		<p>It is possible in some circumstances to use both approaches and that 
		can avoid the disadvantages of either.</p>
		<h3>Constructing questionnaires</h3>
		<p>Whichever approach is used (and the most common is a written 
		questionnaire) the same considerations apply to how questions are 
		constructed.&nbsp; On this depends absolutely the quality of the data we can 
		gather.</p>
		<p>There are a number of key considerations.</p>
		<ul class="auto-style9">
			<li>Can you involve the whole group or do you need to select a 
			sample to represent it?&nbsp; If so, how will you ensure they really 
			are representative?</li>
			<li>How are you going to keep records?&nbsp; (This is especially 
			important for face-to-face encounters.)</li>
			<li>Are you asking only the questions you need to ask?&nbsp; Don't 
			muddy the data and irritate people by asking questions which have no 
			bearing on the planning.&nbsp; If you can't or don't want to do 
			anything with the answers, don't ask the questions.</li>
			<li>Are respondents likely to interpret your questions 
			unpredictably?&nbsp; Are they unambiguous?</li>
			<li>Are your questions comprehensible, given the levels of the 
			learners?&nbsp; If necessary, can you ask them in the learners' 
			first language(s)?</li>
			<li>Have you thought about how you will analyse the data?&nbsp; If, 
			e.g., the response option is yes/no then you will only know how many 
			or what percent of your sample answered yes/no, not how strongly 
			they felt.</li>
			<li>Are your questions and response choices neutral?</li>
			<li>Have you considered the order and grouping of questions?&nbsp; 
			Previous questions may bias later answers.</li>
			<li>Does each question relate to only one topic?&nbsp; Obviously, if 
			you ask <em>Do you enjoy reading and listening lessons?&nbsp; Yes /
			</em><em>No</em> then the results will be useless.</li>
			<li>If you have a multiple response item such as <em>At work / At 
			school / In social settings / With officials etc. (Tick all that 
			apply)</em> have you covered all the possibilities or do you need a 
			hard-to-analyse <em>Other ________ </em>category?</li>
			<li>If the questionnaire is not being administered by you, have you 
			written clear instructions about how it should be administered?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Note that this matrix has an even number of response possibilities.&nbsp; 
		That stops people always picking the middle one.<br />
		The disadvantage is that all questions have to be phrased in a way that 
		makes the responses appropriate.&nbsp; You can't ask <em>Do you enjoy 
		...?</em></p>
		<h4><strong>Closed questions</strong></h4>
		<p>There are three sorts:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Alternate response questions</strong> such as:<br />
			<span class="auto-style10">Put a tick by your choice:<br />
			I enjoy working with a partner: Yes ___ No ___<br />
			Homework is helpful: True ___ False ___</span></li>
			<li><strong>Multiple-choice items</strong>.&nbsp; The matrix above is an example but all the choices are the same.&nbsp; If you want different 
			possibilities for the responses, you need to re-format the 
			questionnaire to allow this.&nbsp; That means having a series of 
			questions with different possible responses for each.&nbsp; It's 
			flexible and precise but imposes more of a strain on the 
			respondents.<br />
			If you want to make sure the response possibilities are truly 
			random, put them in alphabetical order.</li>
			<li><strong>Scales</strong><br />
			In these questions, respondents must order a number of items in 
			terms of, say, importance or enjoyability.&nbsp; For example<br />
			<span class="auto-style10">Number the following.&nbsp; 1 = the least 
			important.&nbsp; 10 = the most important<br />

		<h4>Open questions</h4>
		<p>With smaller groups it is practical to use open-ended questions which 
		allow for unconstrained responses.&nbsp; They have the advantage that 
		the respondent can be much more precise about the answer.&nbsp; The 
		disadvantage is that the results are much harder to analyse 
		statistically and may require reliability-reducing interpretation.<br />
		For example<br />
		<span class="auto-style10">Please write your answers or finish the 
		sentences in the left-hand column.</span></p>

		<h4>Analysis</h4>
		<p>However you construct the test, you will need to analyse the results 
		somehow.&nbsp; There are two things to remember even if your maths isn't 
		too good.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Convert language to numbers.&nbsp; For example, if you have a 
			Not important / Fairly important / Important / Very important scale, 
			assign 0 to Not important up to 4 for Important.&nbsp; That way, 
			it's easy to construct a graph or other kind of visual 
			representation like a pie chart.</li>
			<li>Understand the difference between Mean and Mode.&nbsp; For 
			example<br />
			The numbers are 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3<br />
			The <span class="auto-style10">mean</span> is the average: 3.3 
			(i.e., the total of all the numbers divided by 10 (the number of 
			responses))<br />
			The <span class="auto-style10">mode</span> is 4 (i.e., the most 
			common response)<br />
			These tell you different things.&nbsp; The mean gives you a way to 
			see how the hypothetically typical learner responded (although, in 
			fact, nobody scored anything as 3.3).&nbsp; The mode tells you how 
			popular a response was to each item (how people really voted).</li>
		</ol>
		<hr />
		<h2>Testing</h2>
		<p>Now that you have carried out a needs analysis, it is logical to go 
		to the next step and find out how good the learners already are at the 
		target language systems and skills which have emerged.&nbsp; To do that, 
		you'll need a valid diagnostic test.&nbsp; Go to <a href="../background/testing.html">
		the guide to testing and evaluation</a> to find out how to make one.</p>
