			<p>At some time or other, most people have been disappointed when 
			they see a film or TV adaptation of a favourite book or radio 
			programme.&nbsp; The pictures rarely match the mind's eye images of 
			how places, characters and creatures are visualised.<br />
			Here's 
			another, more easily traced quotation:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>Even though it directly stimulates only 
			your hearing, radio fully engages the other four senses and the 
			mind.&nbsp; It’s not for the lazy.&nbsp; Unlike TV, movies and even 
			traditional print, where the pictures are thrust in front of your 
			eyes, radio forces you to conjure up your own images to accompany 
			the words you are hearing.&nbsp; As a consequence, those pictures 
			have more impact because of the effort it takes to create them.<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style34">Greg J. Stone, 2016</span></p>
			<p>The link between the level of impact and the cognitive effort 
			required by the listener is the noteworthy part of that.</p>

			<p>There is good evidence that accessing data in both verbal and 
			visual ways simultaneously enhances learning.</p>
			<p>For example, Šmajdek and Selan (2016) report on a study carried 
			out on the effects of visualisation on students’ ability to memorise 
			a difficult written definition.&nbsp; They hypothesised from the 
			outset of the study that</p>
			<p class="indentpara">... active visualisation will contribute to 
			the students’ ability to memorise text in a statistically 
			significant way.&nbsp; This hypothesis is based on the assumption 
			that the combination of verbal and visual experiences enhances 
			cognitive learning.<br />
			<span class="auto-style34">(Op cit. :163)</span></p>
			<p>and they reported that this hypothesis was confirmed by the

			<p>Out here on the web some pretty expansive claims are made for the 
			power of visualisation including that it can affect our genetic 
			make-up, make us more attractive to the opposite (or same) sex and 
			lead to happiness, success and a fulfilling life.&nbsp; <em>Inter 
			alia</em>, it is claimed that Arnold Schwarzenegger would not have 
			made a success of three careers without the power of visualisation.<br />
			No such claims are being made here.&nbsp; Visualisation here is 
			presented as an interesting and quite possibly useful classroom 
			technique.&nbsp; That's all, OK?</p>

			<p>A second word of caution:<br />
			Some people find that sitting in a classroom with people you may not 
			know very well (or much like) with your eyes closed, listening to 
			someone's voice is not a particularly comfortable experience.&nbsp; 
			Visualisation should therefore be handled with a little sensitivity.<br />
			Explaining its purpose and making it an easy experience, especially 
			the first time, is very important.<br />
			Getting people into a relaxed state of mind before starting is 
			important, too, and simple deep-breathing exercises can be used for 
			that.</p>
			<p>Visualisation is a practice or awareness-raising technique; it is 
			not a substitute for teaching language.&nbsp; What is claimed for it 
			is that it is a powerful aid to memory, an engaging activity and a 
			way of getting learners to notice language and make it personal.<br />
			This site uses images quite extensively (there are five on this page 
			already and we aren't done yet) and the theory behind that is that people react to images 
			well and can use them as an <em>aide memoire </em>on which to hang 
			ideas, concepts and thoughts.</p>
			<p>For example, if faced with a number of lexemes in a language you 
			do not speak as your first, you may find it quite difficult to 
			remember what they mean.&nbsp; Adding a picture, the more emotive 
			the better, makes words more memorable.&nbsp; Most teachers are 
			already aware of that and go to some trouble to find engaging 
			visuals to set scenes, exemplify lexis and back up explanations of 
			concepts.</p>
			<p>One could, for example, explain the concepts below in words but 
			simply showing the pictures to a class is likely to be more 
			memorable and have greater impact (and it's a good deal quicker, of 
			course):</p>

			<p>The value of visualisation is, so the theory goes, that the

			But the input doesn't actually have to be human language.&nbsp; 
			Here's a little visualisation exercise to practise three different 
			sorts of things in English (and you can probably think of other 
			areas to practise).&nbsp; The questions can be altered to accord

			<p>Obviously, learners will be unable to do this until they have 
			mastered the language forms they need but even before teaching, this 
			sort of exercise can alert learners to what they <strong>need</strong> 
			to know.&nbsp; In that, it's a form of noticing exercise.<br />
			The key to this kind of exercise is that it lends itself much more 
			easily to personalisation and the exchange of thoughts and ideas for 
			a real communicative purpose.&nbsp; It is interesting in itself to 
			hear how other people answered the questions and compare that with 
			your own perceptions.<br />
			Everyone will answer the questions differently and how people 
			respond is almost entirely unpredictable.</p>

			<p>The art of telling a good story or recounting an engaging 
			anecdote is mostly to do with getting the listeners to visualise 
			what is being described.<br />
			Successful raconteurs use the kinds of language they need to conjure 
			pictures in their listeners' heads.&nbsp; The best do it naturally; 
			the rest of us need to try a little harder and that usually means 
			working from a script.<br />
			Here's an example used to practise epistemic modality in the 
			language of deduction (<em>must be, might do, could be, couldn't be</em> 
			etc.) and some common perception verbs and adjectives.</p>
			<h4>Stage 1</h4>
			<p>Follow this script, speaking as far as possible quite slowly, 
			calmly and clearly.&nbsp; Try not to impose any of your own emotions 
			and emphases.</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Close your eyes, breathe slowly in and out and 
			relax.<br />
			<span class="auto-style51">[Pause 15 seconds]</span><br />
			You are crossing a road in a small town and walking towards a large, 
			old-fashioned house.&nbsp; You have a bag in your hand.<br />
			<span class="auto-style51">[Pause after each question]</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's in the bag?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it heavy?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a lot of traffic?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What time of day is it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the weather like?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you feeling cold?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you feeling relaxed or nervous?<br />
			<span class="auto-style51">[Pause 5 seconds]</span><br />
			Put your hand in your pocket and find the key.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does it feel like?<br />
			Take it out of your pocket.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sort of key is it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What could it open?<br />
			Walk up to the front door.&nbsp; Put the key in the lock and turn 
			it.&nbsp; Open the door.<br />
			There is no sound.&nbsp; The house must be empty.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can you hear?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does the house smell?<br />
			Open the first door on the left and go into the room.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can you see?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you smell anything?<br />
			<span class="auto-style51">[Pause 5 seconds]</span><br />
			There's a big table in the middle of the room with some objects on 
			it.&nbsp; They all tell you something about who lives here.<br />
			There are:<br />
			Two empty cigarette packets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What brand are they?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does this tell you?<br />
			Three detective story books<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's on the front cover?<br />
			An English grammar book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it here?<br />
			A pair of reading glasses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do they tell you?<br />
			A laptop computer.<br />
			You sit at the table and open the laptop and switch it on.&nbsp; The 
			screen comes up with a half-written letter.&nbsp; You start to read.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the first line?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is the letter to?<br />
			<span class="auto-style51">[Pause 10 seconds]</span><br />
			What do you do now?</p>
			<p>You can extend this in any way you like, of course, but for a 
			first time, that's probably enough.&nbsp; It sometimes helps to read 
			the script again to allow people time to gather their thoughts and 
			imagine what they are seeing / hearing / feeling etc. in more 
			detail.</p>
			<h4>Stage 2</h4>
			<p>Now:<br />
			Put the learners in pairs or small groups of no more than four.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Task 1:</dt>
				<dd>The learners compare notes.&nbsp; You can have a short 
				worksheet for this as an <em>aide memoire</em> with the stages 
				of the visualisation (road, weather, house, key etc.).<br />
				The focus is on how they felt and what things were like.<br />
				This stage can take quite a long time and you need to be on hand 
				to help and support the learners with the target language.</dd>
				<dt>Task 2:</dt>
				<dd>The learners discuss what they found on the table.<br />
				With luck, this should involve some of the target modal 
				auxiliary verbs 
				such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever lives here must be short sighted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever lives here might be studying English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever lives here must enjoy detective stories</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Here's another, simpler visualisation designed to reinforce 
			learning of household objects and places.</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Relax.&nbsp; Close your eyes and breathe 
			deeply in and out two or three times.<br />
			Now you are at home.&nbsp; It is 8 o'clock in the morning.<br />
			Go into the kitchen and look around.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a table here?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's on the table?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is anyone in the room?&nbsp; Who?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What colour are the walls?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can you see out of the window?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can you see?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the wardrobe.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What colour is it?<br />
			Open the doors.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the first thing you see?<br />
			Look under the bed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anything there?</p>
			<p>and so on for as many rooms as you like.&nbsp; You can do this 
			one room at a time over a series of lessons so that the learners 
			don't get too tired and you can repeat it after you have revised the 
			vocabulary you are targeting.<br />
			Something similar can be used for gardens, towns, holiday locations 
			and work places.&nbsp; Only your and your learners' imaginations 
			will limit what you can do.</p>

			<p>Visualisation exercises are extensively used in sports training 
			and other forms of coaching.&nbsp; Athletes and others find that 
			visualising, e.g., a diving or vaulting manoeuvre, a tennis, 
			snooker, darts, baseball, cricket or golf shot and so on <strong>in detail</strong> can help them 
			perform the action more precisely and effectively in real life.<br />
			This ability is enhanced if the player can also envisage where, when 
			and against whom the manoeuvre takes place.<br />
			Sports psychologists know this.&nbsp; Here's what one well-known and 
			successful sports psychologist (Dr Steve Bull, cited in Bailey, 
			2014) is reported as saying:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The most important thing with imagery is using 
			multiple senses, like sound, sight and smell.&nbsp; What makes [a 
			player] unique is his imagination.&nbsp; When he visualises scoring 
			a goal, he can feel his foot hitting the ball, the smell of the 
			grass under his foot and the sound of the crowd.&nbsp; This 
			incredibly vivid imagery helps an athlete to prepare mentally, by 
			improving their confidence, focus, clarity and speed of thought.&nbsp; 
			It helps them prepare for any scenario</p>
			<p>He goes on:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">There is a huge crossover between the demands 
			of sport and business.&nbsp; For example, if you visualise a big 
			business presentation in real detail, you will prepare for 
			everything from your best posture and body language, and how you 
			will handle any feelings of anxiety, to the awkward questions that 
			might be asked and how you will respond to them.&nbsp; By the time 
			you walk in there, you will feel much more confident.</p>
			<p>The argument here is that there is no fundamental difference 
			between a business presentation and many other verbal encounters 
			including teaching and using a foreign language.&nbsp; So, there is no reason at all why learners of languages can't employ the 
			same methods to help them perform in language at any level.&nbsp; 
			Speaking is a difficult skill to master and one reason for that is 
			there are three pressures:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Time</li>
			<li>Preparation level</li>
			<li>Topic familiarity</li>
		</ol>
			<p>(See <a href="../../initial/skills/speaking_overview.html">the guide to 
			understanding speaking</a> for more detail.)<br />
			All three of these pressures can be reduced by visualising the 
			encounter in detail beforehand.&nbsp; It will also help learners to 
			identify areas where they are not fully prepared so they can do a 
			little research.<br />
			And there's no reason teachers can't use the technique, either.</p>
			<p>Being able to visualise events is a skill in itself and comes 
			with practice so learners should not be disappointed if they 
			struggle at first.&nbsp; That's normal and people need to practise 
			doing it.&nbsp; When you try to visualise an event, it helps to have 
			some questions in the front of your mind:</p>
			<ol class="style_black">
				<li><em>Where is this event taking place?</em></li>
				<li><em>Who are the other participants?</em></li>
				<li><em>What will you see?</em></li>
				<li><em>What will you hear?</em></li>
				<li><em>How will you feel?</em></li>
				<li><em>Who will speak first?</em></li>
				<li><em>What will that person say?</em></li>
				<li><em>What will you say first?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here are some possible uses:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>Visualising telling a story or anecdote in detail imagining 
				exactly what you will say and what the responses of your 
				listeners will be.&nbsp; This gets the ordering of a story clear 
				in the speaker's mind and reduces the need to use fillers 
				to gain thinking time.&nbsp; It also reduces the stress because 
				the speaker may feel more confident.</li>
				<li>Visualising what happens in an oral examination including 
				the questions one might be asked and the responses one will 
				give.&nbsp; Relaxed, confident learners will perform better.</li>
				<li>Visualising a job interview or an interview for a place at 
				an educational institution.</li>
				<li>As a teacher, visualising all the stages of a lesson or part 
				of a lesson.&nbsp; There's
				<a href="../delta/mod2/visualisation_lesson.html">a guide to 
				doing that in the Delta section of this site</a> to prepare for 
				assessment but it can be used for any lesson.</li>
				<li>Visualising a conversation with someone in authority to 
				prepare to sound informed and confident.</li>
				<li>Visualising a commercial transaction: buying, complaining, 
				getting information etc.</li>
				<li>Visualising what you will say in a role play or simulation 
				exercise before being asked to do it.</li>
				<li>Visualising the stages and content of a presentation before 
				delivering it so you can reduce the need for reference to notes 
				and speak seemingly off the cuff.&nbsp; This is important in 
				many EAP and Business English contexts and the same procedures 
				can be used as those set out in the lesson visualisation guide 
				(link above).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can probably think of some more.</p>
