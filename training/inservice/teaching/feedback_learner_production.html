		<h1>Feedback on learner production: correction routines</h1>
		<p>
		<img height="207" src="../../images/feedback310.jpg" width="310" alt="feedback" /></p>
		<p>This guide does not cover the sorts of tasks that require 
		comprehensive feedback and those which require little or none.&nbsp; All 
		of that is covered in 
		the simpler<a href="../../initial/teaching/feedback.html" target="_blank"> 
		guide to managing feedback</a> on and from tasks (new tab).</p>
		<p>The concern here is with the form of feedback learners get on their 
		production, not the feedback you give on whole tasks and activities 
		concerning what people got right, half right and wrong.<br />
		We shall also not be commenting here on the feedback you give to 
		production which is acceptable or very good and needs no improvement.</p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">The starting point for this guide is some 
			understanding of the importance of feedback to learners, especially 
			feedback on error, in terms of enhancing learning.<br />
			Lyster and Ranta, 1997:41, put the case like this:</p>
			<p class="auto-style76">Comprehensible input alone is not sufficient 
			for successful L2 learning; comprehensible output is also required, 
			involving, on the one hand, ample opportunities for student output 
			and, on the other, the provision of useful and consistent feedback 
			from teachers and peers</p>

			</table>
		<p>Five!<br />
		Relax, these are not complicated but having some way to classify what we 
		are doing when we give feedback and what learners expect us to be doing 
		helps in the thinking process.&nbsp; In what follows, we'll be 
		considering both feedback on spoken production and on written work.<br />
		Here are the five we'll be dealing with (based on Lyster and Ranta, 1997, 
		in which we have combined clarification and elicitation because they so 
		often occur together):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Explicit correction</li>
				<li>Clarification and elicitation</li>
				<li>Metalinguistic feedback</li>
				<li>Recast</li>
				<li>Repetition</li>

		<p>
		Corrective feedback is usually the novice teacher's first port of call 
		and the form that many get stuck with throughout their teaching careers.&nbsp; 
		It works like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Spoken production:<ol class="greybullet">
				<li>Student: <em>I go yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Teacher: <em>NO, that should be 'I went yesterday'</em></li>
				<li>Student: <em>Ah, I went yesterday</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Written Production:<br />
			<img alt="correction" height="107" src="../../imagesgraphics/correction.png" width="620" /></li>
		</ol>
		<p>There are, of course, some issues with this on both sides of the 
		argument.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
		These call for a little more work on the learners' (and teacher's) part.&nbsp; 
		The object is to lead people to the right formulation rather than 
		supplying it.&nbsp; It works like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Spoken production:<ol class="greybullet">
				<li>Student: <em>I go yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Teacher: <em>Are you talking about today or before today?</em></li>
				<li>Student: <em>Before today</em></li>
				<li>Teacher:<em> OK.&nbsp; So what form should the verb be in?</em></li>
				<li>Student: <em>Ah, I <strong>went</strong> yesterday</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Written production:<br />
			<img alt="correction2" height="186" src="../../imagesgraphics/correction2.png" width="620" /></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Although this is slightly less reassuring for learners (because they 
		feel they are being interrogated sometimes), clarification via 
		elicitation has all the advantages listed above.<br />
		It also tackles some of the criticisms because it does require some 
		thought on the learner's part and that may well have a positive 
		long-term effect.<br />
		Learners can, however, often ignore this form of feedback, too, after 
		they have achieved something acceptable.<br />
		It also usually concerns only one learner at a time so others in the 
		group may not benefit or even listen and are unlikely to have access to 
		the written text (although that can be arranged).&nbsp; Nevertheless, 
		there is some evidence that other learners do listen to this kind of 
		feedback, even when it is not directed at them and they benefit from the 
		thinking process it demands.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img height="166" src="../../images/teaching_fronted250.jpg" width="250" alt="teacher" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h2>Metalinguistic feedback</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>This involves some talk about language rather than the insertion of 
		the language itself.&nbsp; It works like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Spoken production:<ol class="greybullet">
				<li>Student: <em>I go yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Teacher: <em>You need the past simple form for completed 
				actions</em></li>
				<li>Student: <em>Ah, I <strong>went</strong> yesterday</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Written production:<br />
			<img alt="3" height="267" src="../../imagesgraphics/correction3.png" width="620" /></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Clearly, this kind of feedback relies on the learners actually 
		knowing what you are talking about.&nbsp; If they do, however, this can be a 
		powerful approach because it forces the learners to apply knowledge 
		about the language to its actual production.&nbsp; That way, they can be 
		alerted to applying their knowledge and noticing how the language 
		functions.</p>
		<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img height="166" src="../../images/man_in_boat250.jpg" width="250" alt="man" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h2>Recasts</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>This is sometimes called reformulation and involves the teacher 
		simply taking the learner's intent and casting it in a more accurate / 
		acceptable form.&nbsp; It works like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Spoken production:<ol class="greybullet">
				<li>Student: <em>I go yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Teacher: <em>You <strong>went</strong> yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Student: <em>Ah, I <strong>went</strong> yesterday</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Written production:<br />
			<img alt="correction4" height="192" src="../../imagesgraphics/correction4.png" width="620" /></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Recasts, of course, suffer somewhat from the same problems that 
		simple corrective feedback exhibits.&nbsp; They can often be ignored and 
		if the recast is too different from the learners' output, it can be 
		difficult for them to identify (i.e., notice) what exactly is being 
		corrected, especially in oral work.<br />
		An advantage of recasting is that the teacher can, by simple repetition, 
		signal the parts of what has been said which are accurate and focus on 
		the issue, like this, for example:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>Student: <em>My friend and I went to the cinema for watching 
			that movie and we loved it.</em></li>
			<li>Teacher: <em>That's nice.&nbsp; So you and your friend went to 
			the cinema </em><strong><em>to see</em></strong><em> that 
			movie, right?</em></li>
		</ul>
		<p>If overused, recast can also become frustrating for learners because 
		they can feel that nothing they say first time around is acceptable.</p>
		<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<img height="166" src="../../images/chairs250.jpg" width="250" alt="seats" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h2>Repetition and highlighting</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Getting learners to notice salient features of language systems or 
		how their production differs from the targets can often be achieved by 
		simple repetition and highlighting.&nbsp; It works like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Spoken production:<ol class="greybullet">
				<li>Student: <em>I go yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Teacher: <em>You <strong>go</strong> yesterday?</em></li>
				<li>Student: <em>Ah, I <strong>went</strong> yesterday</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Written production (usually involving some kind of simple 
			correction code):<br />
			<img alt="5" height="182" src="../../imagesgraphics/correction5.png" width="620" /></li>
		</ol>
			<p>Highlighting through repetition can be an effective aid to 
			noticing (and thus encourage a certain amount of learner autonomy).&nbsp; 
			The trick, as always is to make sure that the focus is maintained 
			and only on manageable parts of the learner's production.<br />
			Unlike recasting, in which learners are being asked to notice the 
			gap between their production and a model, this kind of feedback 
			encourages noticing the language system in its entirety.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="man" height="133" src="../../images/man_sceptical_a200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h3>Non-verbal highlighting</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Often, in the classroom, the highlighting can be achieved 
		non-verbally by a lifting of an eyebrow, banging your head on the board, 
		hand gestures and so on.</p>
		<p>Of course, this kind of feedback is most effective with 
		post-systematic error which the learners can self correct.&nbsp; If 
		learners actually do not have mastery of the issue you are highlighting, 
		everyone's time is being wasted because the learners will be stabbing in 
		the dark and getting frustrated and disheartened.</p>

					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h2>Combining the feedback forms</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>This is common.&nbsp; One might, for example, start the process by 
		repetition and highlighting and then, when it doesn't work, move on to 
		clarification and elicitation and, when that doesn't work, resort to 
		metalanguage or straightforward corrective feedback.<br />
		That's not an admission of failure.</p>

					<h2>Impact</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The question which remains to be addressed concerns which sorts 
			of feedback and correction have the most (i.e., best) impact on the 
			learning process.<br />
			To consider that we need to consider uptake.<br />
			If feedback is simply ignored or the learner is not given the 
			opportunity to rephrase and reconsider what has been said, then 
			uptake is effectively zero because we can say nothing about whether 
			the error is likely to recur or even whether the learner has noticed 
			the feedback given.&nbsp; It is true that the learner <em>may</em> 
			have taken the correction on board but we have no way of knowing.<br />
			Lyster and Ranta, 1997:54, attempted to measure the impact of 
			correction routines in classes in Canada where French was being 
			taught in an immersion programme (i.e., through the use of 
			French-only lessons in school).&nbsp; The focus was on whether there 
			was evidence of uptake by the learner with, for example, repetition 
			of the correct form, self-repair and so on.<br />
			Although the circumstances were rather unusual, here's what they 
			found:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Explicit correction<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resulted in 50% uptake by the learner</li>
				<li>Clarification requests and elicitation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resulted in 88% uptake</li>
				<li>Metalinguistic feedback<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resulted in 86% uptake</li>
				<li>Recast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resulted in 31% uptake</li>
				<li>Repetition<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resulted in 78% uptake</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">The authors concluded that:</p>
			<p class="auto-style73">The most successful technique for eliciting 
			uptake is elicitation<br />
			<span class="auto-style75">(Ibid)</span></p>
			<p class="auto-style74">They also noted, as should we, that 
			metalinguistic feedback is almost as good (and within the bounds of 
			statistical error, just as good) because both clarification and 
			metalinguistic feedback force the learners to focus on the language 
			system and apply their knowledge of it consciously to their 
			production.<br />
			The most ineffective routine was recast (although it was found to be 
			a popular one among teachers) with nearly 70% ineffectiveness in 
			showing that the learners had learned anything at all from the 
			recasting.</p>
			<p>We should not necessarily read too much into these numbers 
			because the skill with which the various forms of feedback 
			correction is conducted may be quite different in different cases.&nbsp; 
			The art, for example, of choosing the focus of the correction 
			carefully and forcing the learners to notice the gap between a model 
			and their production should not be underestimated.<br />
			For more on that, follow the guide to noticing, linked below.</p>
			<p>Another variable is, naturally, how one measures uptake.&nbsp; It 
			may be demonstrated by the learner's overt use of the correction at 
			the time but how long the effect lasts and how permanent the 
			improvement is, is much more difficult to estimate, let alone 
			measure.</p>
