		You'd be wise to work through 
		<a href="../lexicogrammar/lexis_relationships.html" target="_blank">the guide to lexical 
		relationships</a> before you follow this guide but if concepts such as 
		synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, metonymy and so on are familiar to you,

		<p>
		Much is made of things like false friends and the fact that your 
		learners' first languages may interfere with their ability to acquire 
		lexis in English.&nbsp; To an extent, that is true.&nbsp; For learners 
		with an Indo-European language spoken in Europe or ex-European colonies 
		in other continents (i.e., excluding the Indo-Iranian branch), however, there are many more true friends than false.</p>
		<h3>
		Cognate words</h3>
		<p>
		<img alt="cognate words" height="124" src="../../imagesgraphics/cognates.png" width="465" /></p>
		<p>
		Words which have a common origin and, therefore, look, sound and mean 
		alike are called cognates (from the Latin <em>cognatus</em> (<em>blood 
		relation</em>)).<br />
		True and false friends are often cognate words.&nbsp; For example, the English word <em>
		night</em> has cognates in French (<em>nuit</em>), German (<em>Nacht</em>), Dutch 
		(<em>nacht</em>), Swedish (<em>nat</em>), Polish (<em>noc</em>), Spanish (<em>noche</em>) and so on 
		and these are all true friends because meaning is unchanged but the form 
		is recognisably related and that makes the items easy to learn.</p>
		<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
		<img alt="friends" height="166" src="../../images/three_friends_dogs_250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style6">
				<h2>
		True friends</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
		<p>
		Briefly, the list of languages with many true friends will include:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>The Romance languages</strong>: French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, 
			Romanian etc.<br />
			There are many words, especially those of Latin, Greek or Norman-French origin which will be recognisable in English to speakers of 
			these languages.&nbsp; These particularly occur in technical and 
			'intellectual' areas but also include large numbers of very common 
			words.<br />
			Speakers of these languages sometimes show a tendency to select 
			familiar, cognate words rather than the more stylistically appropriate 
			English words so we get<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I entered the house and extinguished the 
			fire<br />
			</em>instead of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went in and put the fire out<br />
			</em>which is also neatly avoiding the phrasal verb, of course.</li>
			<li><strong>Germanic languages</strong> fall into two categories with similar 
			vocabularies (and much else).&nbsp; North Germanic or Scandinavian 
			languages and West Germanic languages which include English 
			(allegedly &ndash; there are those who prefer to call it a North Germanic 
			language), Dutch 
			and German as well as a host of small dialects and languages.<br />
			There are many thousands of cognate words across these languages.&nbsp; 
			Many of these words refer to some of the most basic concepts such as
			<em>land, day, hand, old, young, many, good, glass, gold </em>etc.&nbsp; 
			The languages also share scientific and 'scholarly' terms.</li>
			<li><strong>Slavic languages</strong> exhibit far fewer recognisable cognate words 
			(although there are, in fact, very many hidden by orthographic and 
			phonological changes over the centuries).&nbsp; Recognisable words 
			in English for speakers of these languages will mainly be scientific 
			and scholarly terms of the sort shared by other European languages.&nbsp; 
			These languages are also rich in borrowings from English.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		Other languages (i.e., most of them) will not exhibit any significant 
		overlap in lexemes.&nbsp; The implication is clear: learners from most 
		language backgrounds will encounter significantly more difficulty 
		acquiring English words than their more fortunate European colleagues.&nbsp; 
		They will need more time, more recycling and more patience.</p>

		False friends</h2>

			</table>
			
		<p>
		This is not the place to list false friends for all the languages in the 
		world.&nbsp; There are numerous websites that will do that for specific 
		languages.&nbsp; Another good source is The Cambridge International 
		Dictionary of English.</p>
		<p>
		It is, however, worth noting that false friends come in a range of 
		falseness.&nbsp; Many are only false friends in certain circumstances.&nbsp; 
		This includes words which are restricted to some contexts in certain 
		languages, e.g., <em>angst</em> in English is borrowed from the German 
		word meaning <em>anxiety</em> but only used in psychological senses.<br />
		It is often noted, for example, that the English word <em>sensitive</em> 
		is problematic for speakers of many European languages because of 
		confusion with a word similar to <em>sensible</em> in those languages.&nbsp; 
		However, <em>sensibility</em> <span class="style_underline">is</span> 
		used in English in the same way and refers to sensitivity of feeling.&nbsp; 
		That's how Jane Austen used it, incidentally.<br />
		The English <em>sensibility</em> is rendered in German as <em>
		Sensibilität</em> but the English word <em>sensitive</em> may be 
		translated as <em>sensibel</em>.&nbsp; For example, the two words <em>
		sensitive</em> and <em>sensibility</em> are translated in French as <em>
		sensible</em> and <em>sensibilité,</em> in Spanish as <em>sensible</em> 
		and <em>sensibilidad</em> and in Italian as <em>sensibile</em> and <em>
		sensibilità</em>.<br />
		There is a separate guide to 
		cognates and false friends on this site, linked at the end of this guide.<br />
		There are also some exercises on this site concerning false friends in the 
		section for learners.&nbsp;

		The reason nearly all people use the same categories is that this is how 
		we organise the universe &ndash; by <strong>use</strong> (buildings), by
		<strong>appearance</strong> (plants / flowers) and by <strong>place</strong> 
		(garden stuff).&nbsp; If this is true, it seems logical to teach sets of

			In theory, this task should have been 
			getting easier as you went along.&nbsp; Why should that be?<br />
			<strong>Set 1</strong> contained nonsense words and they are harder 
			to remember because you have no meaning to attach to them.<br />
			Moral: we all need meaning to help us recall words.&nbsp; This is 
			what your students have to do if you don't make meaning clear.<br />
			<strong>Set 2</strong> contained real words but with no meaning 
			connections between them.<br />
			Moral: disconnected words are difficult to remember.<br />
			<strong>Set 3</strong> contained a set of hyponyms for <em>hat</em>.<br />
			Moral: words connected to each other because they fall in the same 
			set are easier to recall.<br />
			<strong>Set 4 </strong>was a short narrative with lexis embedded in 
			it.<br />
			Moral: words which appear in some kind of narrative are easy to 
			recall because of the context and we can visualise what happened.<br />
			General moral: CONNECT and CONTEXTUALISE.</p>

			That sounds an easy question but, apart from the simple denotational 
			meaning of a word, what else do we need to know about it to be sure

			have in certain cultures and for certain people.&nbsp; What else?&nbsp; 
			When you have made some notes, click to

		<div id="meaning" style="visibility: hidden">
		
		<ol class="style_brown">
			<li>We need to know what a word means – what it denotes and what it 
			connotes (if appropriate).<br />
			There is a good deal of difference between <em>pig-headed</em> and
			<em>determined</em> although they denote much the same 
			characteristic.</li>
			<li>We need to know how it is connected to other words which mean 
			similar things (e.g., <em>buy, purchase, bargain, discount</em> etc.).<br />
			The words <em>get</em> and <em>acquire</em> are synonymous in many 
			cases but obviously not in all, for example.</li>
			<li>We need to know what words it commonly goes with (collocation) 
			so we know we can't have <em>a high tree</em> but prefer <em>tall</em> 
			as the adjective, for example.</li>
			<li>We need to know what other meanings it can have (e.g., <em>shop, 
			bank</em> etc. can have different meanings and fall into different 
			word classes: nouns and verbs here).<br />
			Most words in English are polysemous, having slightly different but 
			connected meanings.&nbsp; We may know, for example, the meaning of 			<em>ceiling</em> when applied to a room in a building but may not 
			realise what its use is in a term such as <em>an aircraft's ceiling</em> 
			or <em>a glass ceiling</em> in a working environment.</li>
			<li>We need to know how the word changes depending on its grammar 
			(e.g., <em>shop, shops, shopping, shopped </em>etc.).&nbsp; 
			Orthography and pronunciation have a role here, too.</li>
			<li>We need to know what grammar the word uses (e.g., does it take 
			a direct object, an indirect object, both, a preposition, does it 
			have an odd plural or an irregularity? etc.).&nbsp; In other words, 
			we need to know about its colligational characteristics.&nbsp; For 
			example, the words <em>hide</em> and <em>conceal</em>  mean much the 
			same in many circumstances but only <em>hide</em> can be used 
			intransitively.</li>
			<li>We need to know how to pronounce the word.&nbsp; This also 
			applies to derived forms so we need to realise the changes that 
			occur, for example, in making a verb from a noun or a noun from an 
			adjective and so on.&nbsp; There are significant differences, for 
			example between <em>photograph</em> and <em>photographer</em> and 
			between <em>contract</em> (verb) and <em>contract</em> (noun).</li>
			<li>We need to know how to spell the word.</li>
			<li>We need to know what kind of situations the word is used in and 
			who might use it.&nbsp; Is it, for example, typical of a certain 
			register or stylistically affected?</li>
		</ol>

			<p>In addition to the nine points above, learners also need to grasp 
			what is known as a word's semantic space.&nbsp; This concerns what 
			prototypical features of a word determine the limits of its use.&nbsp; 
			Children, learning their first language, often make errors in this 
			regard, calling, for example, all four-legged creatures <em>horses</em> 
			or all adults apart from mother and father, <em>uncle</em> and so 
			on.&nbsp; Quite rapidly, children learn to identify the prototypical 
			features of lexemes and limit their use to within conventional, 
			culturally determined boundaries.&nbsp; This goes on through life 
			and most native speakers are frequently faced with uses of words 
			outside the fields in which they have previously been encountered.<br />
			Unfortunately, semantic space varies across languages and adults 
			already have a set of prototypical features which they employ 
			frequently to distinguish, for example between a <em>cup</em> and a
			<em>glass</em> (using ideas such as with or without a handle, 
			transparent or opaque, porcelain or not etc.).<br />
			For example, in German, the word <em>vegetable</em> does not include 
			the term <em>potato</em> and in Swedish, the word <em>wood</em> for 
			the material and for a small group of trees is not the same although 
			it is, for example, in French.<br />
			Applying the conventional prototypical features that one has 
			acquired with one's first language to a second is, therefore, often 
			perilous.<br />
			Moreover, determining the boundaries of closely connected words such 
			as <em>railing</em> and <em>fence</em>, <em>shade</em> and <em>
			shadow</em>, <em>job</em> and <em>career</em>, <em>position</em> and
			<em>post</em> and so on is difficult and requires repeated exposure 
			to the lexemes in context.&nbsp; Even native speakers may disagree 
			about the determining features which distinguish a <em>tree</em> 
			from a <em>shrub</em> or a <em>leaflet</em> from a <em>tract</em>, 
			for example, and the distinguishing features of such terms are very 
			unlikely to be parallelled in the learners' first language(s).&nbsp; 
			This is not a phenomenon confined to nouns and the distinctions 
			between <em>stroll, saunter</em> and <em>wander</em> and <em>chilly, 
			cool </em>and <em>fresh</em> are not immediately apparent from 
			context.<br />
			The core meanings of <em>railing</em> and <em>fence</em> are 
			virtually identical (involving concepts of a barrier delineating 
			spaces) so only secondary features (such as the materials from which 
			it is made, the purposes to which it is put and its design), which 
			may not always be present, can be used to disambiguate.&nbsp; 
			Hunting the internet for images of either will often throw up the 
			same images in different categories.<br />

			</table>
			
			<p>The distinction between active and passive vocabulary use is one 
			that is probably familiar to most of us in our first languages.&nbsp; 
			In English, for example, a word such as <em>nomenclature</em> is 
			probably known to most speakers of the language but few will have 
			the need, the ability, the confidence or the will to use the word actively in everyday speech.&nbsp; 
			Many people would be able to assert that the word has something to 
			do with naming things but few would be able to provide a succinct 
			and accurate definition (i.e., that it refers to the body or system 
			of names used in a particular specialist field).&nbsp; The reason is 
			simple: most people do not need to use the word so precisely and 
			will have little difficulty understanding it in context.&nbsp; Most 
			users of the language do not need, either, to see the word as also 
			meaning the act of devising a system of naming or, indeed, the 
			procedure for doing so but both these extra meanings are in a 
			dictionary definition of the lexeme.<br />
			As Pooh has notably pointed out:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I am a bear of 
			very little brain, and long words bother me.<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style16">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AA Milne (1926), Winnie the Pooh</span></span><br />Learners 
			of a language have traditionally been held to have larger passive 
			vocabularies than is optimum for communication so a good deal of 
			effort and thought has gone into ways to make passive vocabulary 
			active.</p>
			<p>However, in common with many dichotomies in the field, this one 
			between active and passive use may be too simplistic and unsustainable.&nbsp; 
			There are three views, in essence:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Passive and active vocabulary are distinguishable by whether 
				a learner can use a word orally and in writing or simply 
				understand it when it is seen in its written form.</li>
				<li>Passive and active vocabulary exists on a cline from 
				understanding a lexeme in a familiar context when seen through 
				to complete mastery of its form, use, grammar, pronunciation and 
				orthography.&nbsp; This means, for example that at various 
				stages in the trek to full mastery, a learner may be able to 
				recognise a word in written contexts, spell it successfully, 
				pronounce it acceptably and (usually later) recognise it when it 
				is heard.&nbsp; Later, the learner may become aware of any of 
				the word's metaphorical uses, its connection to other words in 
				the same field of meaning, any cultural connotations the word 
				may have and so on.&nbsp; Finally, the word becomes embedded in 
				the learner's personal lexicon and is used at will with very 
				little thought and delay in retrieving it from memory.&nbsp; In 
				other words, the learner has achieved native-speaker-like 
				mastery of the item.</li>
				<li>A lexeme exists as part of a learner's passive vocabulary 
				until enough about it has been acquired for it to make the 
				qualitative leap from passive to active use.&nbsp; Where exactly 
				that point is is not clear but, anecdotally, learners will often 
				point to a time at which the item became so familiar that they 
				quite suddenly began to use it easily and without a great deal 
				of searching and effort.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>The view taken here is that the second definition makes the most 
			sense for the practicalities of classroom use because the focus can 
			be on extending learners along the cline from wholly passive to 
			masterfully active use of a lexeme in stages rather than making an 
			effort to leap directly from wholly unknown to full usable lexemes.&nbsp; 
			The third view is compatible with that, of course, because the aim 
			is precisely to reach the point of take-off from passive to active 
			use.&nbsp; The view is, however, not compatible with the first 
			assumption.</p>
			<p>The other issue with the dichotomy concerns the assumption, often 
			made, rarely shown to be true, that learners' passive vocabularies 
			always exceed their active ones.&nbsp; While this is intuitively the 
			case, it may not be as clear cut as it seems.&nbsp; It can be the 
			case, for example, that a learner can use a word in one sense 
			actively and with little effort at retrieval but may be confused by 
			the same item when it appears in a different setting and is used 
			with a slightly different meaning or used figuratively.&nbsp; So, 
			for example, while the verb in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I packed my suitcase</em><br />
			may be readily used and understood, the same verb in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theatre was packed</em><br />
			may constitute an unknown blocking item in a text.</p>

				<h2>Processing depth&nbsp;</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>The assumption, and it is often just that, is that the greater 
			the depth of processing that is asked of learners, the more secure 
			will be their understanding of a lexeme and the more likely it is 
			that they will be able to use it in their production (i.e., make it 
			an active item) rather than simply understand it when the hear or 
			see it (i.e., leave it as a passive item).</p>
			<p>A good deal of research has been done on the ways in which new 
			words are understood and learned.&nbsp; Mostly, the research has 
			focused on cognitive processing phenomena and revolves around the 
			concept of depth of processing.&nbsp; The concern is to discover 
			what depth of processing and what cognitive effort is involved in 
			moving a word from passive understanding to active use.<br />
			Thornbury (2002:25) puts it like this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The more decisions the learner makes about a 
			word, and the more cognitively demanding these decisions, the better 
			the word is remembered.</p>
			<p>However, we are not only looking for a word to be well 
			remembered; we are also trying to make sure that a word is available 
			to a learners for active use.</p>
			<p>A distinction needs to be made here between incidental and 
			explicit learning of items.<br />
			Incidental learning is the major way in which children acquire the 
			lexicon of their first languages.&nbsp; It is rare for carers to 
			provide explicit teaching of any words (although simplification is 
			often observed).<br />
			Explicit learning, on the other hand, involves the deliberate focus 
			on the meaning, form and use of lexeme.<br />
			It should not be assumed that we are only focused on explicit 
			learning of the lexis.&nbsp; Incidental learning also plays a 
			classroom role and it has been shown that frequent exposure to an 
			item even without an explicit focus on meaning and use can often 
			result in acquisition into passive <em><strong>and</strong></em> 
			active vocabulary.&nbsp; The spelling and pronunciation of lexemes 
			are, for example, often acquired incidentally while the main focus 
			may be on comprehension followed by use.<br />
			What is done with a newly encountered item, the theory goes, is 
			crucial to whether the item is more or less immediately forgotten, 
			remains as a passively understood lexeme or enters the learners' 
			active production store.<br />
			For example, if one encounters a new item in a reading text, looks 
			it up in a bilingual dictionary and then moves on, it is unlikely 
			that the word will be remembered, although it may if the event 
			happens frequently enough.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, you are 
			required to use a word to say something personal and important about 
			yourself and communicate the thought to others, the word will 
			probably have a much greater chance of remaining in your active 
			vocabulary.<br />
			Again, annoyingly, it is difficult to identify activities and tasks 
			which are easily consigned to one category or another because depth 
			is, of course, a relative phenomenon.&nbsp; A deep puddle is rather 
			less deep than a deep chasm.<br />
			When we look at activity types, then, we can place them on a cline, 
			like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="depth" height="458" src="../../imagesgraphics/processing_depth.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>Diagrams like that one are helpful as an <em>aide memoire </em>
			but do not tell the whole story.&nbsp; Much depends on how the 
			techniques are used.<br />
			People also think and learn differently so a technique that works 
			for one learner may not be effective for another.</p>

				<h2>Recycling</h2>

			</table>
			
			<p>If it is true that vocabulary expands incrementally beginning 
			with recognition and passing through stages at which an item becomes 
			more and more familiar and more is known about it, including word 
			class, spelling, pronunciation, collocational characteristics and so 
			on, then there is a clear case to be made for recycling vocabulary 
			frequently.<br />
			Some have claimed that a new word needs to be encountered 6 or 7 
			times before it can be committed to long-term memory and used at 
			will.&nbsp; Nation, cited in Schmitt (2000:137) suggests that up to 
			16 repetitions may be required for a word to be learned.&nbsp; The 
			nature of the repetitions is, however, not described.<br />
			The most obvious implication for teachers is that the introduction 
			of a new item should not be a one-off event that is then forgotten 
			about because the item itself will be almost instantly forgotten.<br />
			What this does not mean, naturally, is that repetition of the same 
			event is effective.&nbsp; Simply writing a word seven times in a 
			notebook may be an effective way of learning its spelling 
			(especially if it is very irregular) but adds nothing at all to the 
			learner's ability to use the word and does nothing to increase the 
			sophistication of the learner's understanding of the item's 
			characteristics.</p>
			<p>When a word is first encountered, it may be enough for it to be 
			addressed quite shallowly with reference only to its meaning (via 
			translation in some circumstances) and its word class.&nbsp; A 
			rule-of-thumb procedure for the nature of the recycling events might 
			look something like:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Inferring the items' denotational meaning <em>via</em> 
				co-text, visual stimuli, L1 cognates or the use of reference 
				texts.&nbsp; Noting word class.</li>
				<li>Encountering the item in a memorable context: songs, poems, 
				stories, relevant texts etc.</li>
				<li>Searching for synonyms, co-hyponyms, constructing 
				paraphrases, matching exercises, comparing ideas with the 
				teacher and colleagues.</li>
				<li>Pronouncing the item acceptably and spelling it correctly.</li>
				<li>Pronouncing and spelling derivatives and stems.&nbsp; 
				Considering affixation, conversion (word class) and compounding.&nbsp; 
				Using a mind map and identifying derived words or stems, 
				categorising the item with others in the same word family or 
				lexical set.</li>
				<li>Word grammar analysis.</li>
				<li>Identifying the items' connotations (if any) and figurative 
				or metaphorical uses (if any).</li>
				<li>Categorisation exercises with other known items 
				incorporating the new item(s).&nbsp; Transferring the item's 
				meaning to a visual or physical representation.</li>
				<li>Connecting a word with personal experiences and relating 
				them to others.&nbsp; Using the word in simulated or real 
				communicative events.</li>
				<li>Revising the word at a later stage and constructing tests 
				for others.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Things do not need to happen precisely in that order, of course, 
			and it is unlikely that opportunities to deploy all these procedures 
			will occur in a single lesson (although they might if the target set 
			of items is small enough).</p>

				<h2>Strategies for learning and remembering lexis</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Here are some strategies 
			commonly used by learners divided into those which may help to 
			unpack the meaning of unknown items and those which may help to 
			consolidate learning once the meaning is known.<br />
			Some of the following are exemplified in the teaching ideas which 
			follow.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Unpacking meaning<br />
				Most of these are at the shallow end of the spectrum because 
				they are identification rather than learning approaches to 
				lexis.<br />
				<img alt="case" height="133" src="../../images/case_unpack200.jpg" width="200" /><ol>
					<li>Word class<br />Identifying word class is a small help to understanding meaning 
				and a greater one in deciding whether it is important to 
				understand the word or not and can be done in two main ways:<ol>
						<li>By using the co-text:<br />For example<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any word which appears between a determiner and a noun is 
				almost certainly an adjective as in, e.g.:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that
						</em><span class="style_underline"><em>horrendous</em></span><em> storm</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any word which immediately precedes or follows a verb is 
				almost certainly an adverb, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she 
						</em><span class="style_underline"><em>promptly</em></span><em> left</em><br />etc.</li>
						<li>By using word shape and an understanding of affixation and 
				compounding.&nbsp; For example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prefixes almost always change a word's meaning, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; productive &rarr; counterproductive</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffixes almost always affect word class but not meaning, 
				e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; courage &rarr; 
						courageous</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; English is right-headed so the right-hand word signifies word 
						class and meaning (usually), e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <em>doorman</em> is a type of <em>
						man</em> not a type of <em>door</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <em>fencepost</em> is a type of <em>
						post</em>, not a type of <em>fence</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only nouns and verbs inflect in English so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an <em>-s</em> or -<em>es</em> ending 
						is either a plural noun or a verb in the third person 
						singular and an <em>-ed</em> ending on a word usually 
						signified a past tense or past participle while <em>-ing</em> 
						signifies a progressive form</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Cognates<br />
					Some cognate words are instantly recognisable but others 
					require a little understanding of the patterns.&nbsp; 
					Cognate words between languages often follow simple rules so 
					a final '<em>d</em>' in German is often a final '<em>th</em>' 
					in English and the ending- <em>ion</em> in English will 
					usually be -<em>zione</em> in Italian and -<em>ção</em> in 
					Portuguese.</li>
					<li>Using pictures and other graphics helps to:<ol class="auto-style23">
						<li>Recognise the register of a text and predict the 
						kinds of lexis that it will contain</li>
						<li>Recognise how words such as, e.g., <em>pass, score
						</em>and <em>goal</em> are being used</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Gaining an understanding of gist by skimming a text 
					helps to get a sense of the author's purpose and likely 
					meanings so one is able to predict whether, e.g., adjectives 
					are likely to be positive (as, in an advertisement, for 
					example) or negative (as in an argument against something, 
					for example).</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Consolidating learning<br />
				Many of the techniques and activities to the right of the diagram 
				above fall into consolidation strategies.<br />
				<img alt="link" height="133" src="../../images/link_rope_binding200.jpg" width="200" /><ol>
					<li>Personalising words to connect them to one's own 
					experience.&nbsp; A learner may, for example, understand the 
					word <em>delightful</em>  but until they can apply it to something 
					they personal found delightful, it may remain as a passive 
					item with a rather distant meaning for them.<br />
					Affective factors play a role here, too.&nbsp; Some words 
					are simply more appealing to some learners, either because 
					they connect them with pleasant memories or because they 
					simply like the sound and shape of a word.</li>
					<li>Using hyponymy and meronymy helps to fix words in terms 
					of meaning so knowing, e.g., that both <em>buses</em> and
					<em>cars</em> are type of <em>vehicles</em> and that they 
					both have <em>steering wheels, tyres, windscreens</em> and 
					so on creates a web of associations.</li>
					<li>Using antonymy and synonymy can also help to fix a 
					word's meaning by what it is similar to or not.</li>
					<li>Testing others on meaning and use is a powerful 
					consolidation strategy because it requires the learners to 
					face up to whether they have really understood and can use 
					an item themselves and also requires evaluation of other 
					people's use of the item.</li>
					<li>Focusing on collocation can involve quite deep 
					processing because it requires active use of an item bearing 
					in mind word class, meaning, style and register 
					simultaneously.</li>
					<li>Writing words down is a well-known aid to memory and 
					writing two or more sentences or short clauses to show the word's meaning is 
					even better.&nbsp; Simply writing down a word is not enough.</li>
					<li>Using a word freely in a spoken activity is a powerful 
					aid because it automatically requires the learner to make it 
					active and at the same time focus on meaning, pronunciation 
					and appropriacy.</li>
					<li>Mentally or aloud repeating a word may help to fix 
					it in the memory.</li>
					<li>Organising vocabulary notebooks by categories of meaning 
					rather than word class or spelling is effective for some 
					learners.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Many words (particularly adjectives) live on a cline between a 
			minimal use and a more extreme meaning of the concept.&nbsp; For 
			example, words which describe size may be set on a cline from very 
			small to very large, like this:<br />
			<img alt="size" height="133" src="../../imagesgraphics/cline_size.png" width="465" /><br />
			and words which refer to movement can be similarly arranged, like 
			this, for example:<br />
			<img alt="move" height="133" src="../../imagesgraphics/cline_move.png" width="465" /><br />
			and those to do with the size of entities can be show as:<br />
			<img alt="places" height="87" src="../../imagesgraphics/cline_places.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>You could probably draw similar diagrams to express concepts such 
			as heat (<em>freezing</em> up to <em>boiling</em>), light (<em>pitch 
			black </em>up to <em>blinding</em>), wetness (<em>arid</em> up to
			<em>inundated</em>), feelings (<em>detest</em> up to <em>adore</em>), 
			houses (<em>slum</em> up to <em>palace</em>) and so on.<br />
			As a quick way of making the relative strengths of words or the 
			attributes to describe these notions, clines like this are 
			easy to draw on a whiteboard even if you do not have time 
			to prepare them beforehand.</p>
			<p>However, there are some issues to consider:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Collocation:<br />
				Not all the words will naturally operate in the same 
				relationships.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mouse ran across the room</em><br />
				but not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The mouse galloped across the room</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A minute speck of dust</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A minute stone</em><br />
				and both<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pretty village<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pretty hamlet</em><br />
				but not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; A pretty city</em></li>
				<li>Connotation:<br />
				Some words carry positive or negative senses for most speakers 
				so while:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ambled down to the pub</em><br />
				implies a pleasant, unhurried movement,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She crawled into the garage</em><br />
				implies an uncomfortably slow manoeuvre.<br />
				Equally, <em>infinitesimal</em> implies unimportant in a way 
				that <em>microscopic</em> does not.</li>
				<li>Definitions and relativity:<br />
				Any two speakers of English are unlikely to agree exactly where 
				on the cline certain words fit and, moreover, many are relative 
				so, for example, while a mouse is <em>tiny</em> in comparison to 
				a horse, it is <em>huge</em> in comparison to a flea.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Nevertheless, dealt with sensibly with due regard to these 
			issues, clines are a useful way to focus on notional categories.</p>
