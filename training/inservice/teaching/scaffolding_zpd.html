		<p>The term scaffolding is now used so loosely in English Language 
		Teaching that it is beginning to lose any proper meaning at all.&nbsp; 
		This guide attempts to get at what it should mean and how it 
		differs from helping, supporting, guiding and discovery learning.<br />
		It is not often noted that Vygotsky never used the term 
		scaffolding at all.&nbsp; That term was introduced long after Vygotsky's 
		death (1934) by Jerome Bruner in around 1967 to describe the process of 
		carefully chosen levels of support which allow the learner to carry on 
		with a task and which is judiciously reduced as the learner progresses.</p>

			</table>
		<p>This is the key term, without which we cannot distinguish exactly 
		what scaffolding is and how it differs from merely helping learners 
		along the path to learning.</p>
			<p>Lev Vygotsky, 1836 &ndash; 1934, (1962 [originally published in the 
			1930s]) posited the Zone of Proximal Development 
		or the ZPD.<br />
			Briefly explained, it is the learning zone in which the learner can 
			achieve the task with input 
			from someone who knows more (you).&nbsp; That person is described as 
			a More Knowledgeable Other or MKO and need not, in fact, be a person 
			at all: it can be a book, a worksheet or any other kind of resource 
			(such as the one you are reading).&nbsp; The ZPD lies between tasks which the 
		learner can already do without help (so won't learn much) and tasks 
		which the learner cannot even attempt (so won't learn much).&nbsp; If 
		the task is too easy, the learner will get bored.&nbsp; If it's too hard 
		the learner will become anxious and frustrated.<br />
			The zone is referred to proximal because it concerns the skills or 
			knowledge that a learner is close to mastering.</p>

		<p>This example is from <span class="auto-style4">McLeod (2012)</span>:</p>
		<p class="indentpara">Maria just entered college this semester and 
		decided to take an introductory tennis course. Her class spends each 
		week learning and practicing a different shot. Weeks go by, and they 
		learn how to properly serve and hit a backhand.<br />
		During the week of learning the forehand, the instructor notices that 
		Maria is very frustrated because she keeps hitting her forehand shots 
		either into the net or far past the baseline. He examines her 
		preparation and swing. He notices that her stance is perfect, she 
		prepares early, she turns her torso appropriately, and she hits the ball 
		at precisely the right height.<br />
		However, he notices that she is still gripping her racquet the same way 
		she hits her backhand, so he goes over to her and shows her how to 
		reposition her hand to hit a proper forehand, stressing that she should 
		keep her index finger parallel to the racquet. He models a good forehand 
		for her, and then assists her in changing her grip. With a little 
		practice, Maria's forehand turns into a formidable weapon for her!<br />
		In this case, Maria was in the zone of proximal development for 
		successfully hitting a forehand shot. She was doing everything else 
		correctly, but just needed a little coaching and scaffolding from a 
		"More Knowledgeable Other" to help her succeed in this task.<br />
		When that assistance was given, she became able to achieve her goal. 
		Provided with appropriate support at the right moments, so too will 
		students in classrooms be able to achieve tasks that would otherwise be 
		too difficult for them.</p>

					<h3>An example from the language classroom</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>And here's an example (from a real lesson) of how the same phenomenon 
		may function in the English language classroom:</p>
		<p class="indentpara">Andr&eacute; is quite an advanced learner getting close to C1 level 
		on the CEF and he has produced the following in class:<br />
		<span class="style_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Pierre isn't coming</span><br />
		The teacher notices that Andr&eacute; has used a natural contraction, 
		the utterance is appropriate in terms of style and relevance to what has 
		come before, the individual phonemes (including the tricky, for Andr&eacute;, 
		<span class="auto-style40">/θ/</span> sound) are mostly correctly produced and it sounds close to the 
		standard form:<br />
		<span class="auto-style40">&nbsp;<span class="style_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp; /aɪ.ˈθɪŋk.pi.ˈer.ˈɪznt.ˈkʌm.ɪŋ/</span></span><br />
		Even the stress patterns and overall intonation contour on what's been 
		said are correct (within tolerance).<br />
		However, what he has said still doesn't sound English and the teacher 
		knows why: transferred negation.<br />
		So, the teacher, being alert to the small amount of help that Andr&eacute; 
		needs, prompts like this:<br />
		<span class="style_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>In English, we 
		usually make verbs like </em><span class="auto-style40">believe, 
		suppose, fancy, imagine, reckon, expect </span> <em>negative and leave 
		the rest of the sentence positive.&nbsp; We start with </em>
		<span class="auto-style40">I don't</span> ... <em>in this case. </em>&nbsp;</span><span class="auto-style39">(She 
		then writes an example on the board.)<br />
		</span><em>
		<span class="style_blue">Try 
		again.</span></em><br />
		And, André, a trusting soul, produces:<br /><em><span class="style_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think 
		Pierre's coming.</span><br />
		</em>perfectly acceptably.<br />
		Later, of course the teacher will have to insert the information that we 
		do not do this with all verbs of thinking or perception such as
		<span class="auto-style40">hope</span> and 
		<span class="auto-style40">assume</span> and the fact that 
		there is sometimes a difference in meaning between the ways of 
		constructing the clause.&nbsp; However, for the moment, André has learnt 
		a useful rule which will make what he says sound more natural.<br />
		In the jargon, his interlanguage has moved another small step towards 
		mastery.</p>
		<p> In both these examples, the teacher / trainer has noticed and been 
		alert to exactly what help is needed and when it should be supplied.&nbsp; 
		That is being sensitive to learners' Zones of Proximal Development and 
		scaffolding their learning.</p>
		<p>The ZPD can be visualised like this:<br />
		<img alt="zpd" src="../../imagesgraphics/zpd_red_zone425.png" /></p>
		<p>
		The tricks, of course, are</p>
		<ol>
			<li>To design tasks which are situated in the red zone.</li>
			<li>To be alert to how much help a learner needs to improve in an 
			incremental fashion.</li>
			<li>Choosing materials which do not stray too far (if at all) 
			outside the red zone.</li>
			<li>Designing practice materials which are firmly within the red 
			zone.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The scaffolding that takes place in the ZPD need not come from the 
		teacher.&nbsp; It can come from peers who simply happen to know a little 
		more.</p>
		<p>Now we need to look at what scaffolding is not.</p>

					<h2>Scaffolding <em>vs.</em> Discovery Learning / Guided 
					discovery</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>These are allied concepts but not (in this analysis) synonyms.</p>
		<p>Discovery learning comes in two flavours:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Independent discovery learning:<br />
			This, as the name implies, is learning by doing tasks independently 
			of any instruction (other than task setting before the activity and 
			feedback after it).<br />For example:<br />The teacher sets a reading task which involves the learners 
			accessing a text to identify long noun phrases acting as subjects of 
			verbs.&nbsp; In this text, for example, the learners are asked to 
			identify phrases such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>
			<span class="style_underline"><em>The 
			amount of difficulty this policy has given the minister</em></span><em> 
			means that ...</em><br />in which the long noun phrase can be replaced simply with 
				<em>the</em> 
				<em>difficulty</em>.<br />and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">That 
				the newspapers have taken a negative view of what the minister 
				said
			</span> </em>
				<em>should not ...</em><br />in which we have a nominalised <em>
				that</em>-clause acting as the subject of <em>should</em>.<br />
				The phrases are 
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>not</strong></span> underlined in the text the students work with.<br />The object of the exercise is to alert the learners to how this kind 
			of complex nominalisation functions in English in the hope that they 
			may be able to transfer some of the strategies to their own writing.<br />
				At the end of the task, learners compare what they have 
				identified in small groups and then there is some kind of 
				whole-class feedback and presentation.</li>
				<li>Assisted discovery learning:<br />
				This is what most people think of as Guided discovery.<br />
				In this example, the learners are given a text like this:<p class="indentpara"><em><span class="style_underline">This 
				week</span>, I decided to organise the books
				<span class="style_underline">in my small library</span>.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_underline">Over the years</span> it has 
				become <span class="style_underline">more and more difficult</span> 
				for me to find what I am looking for because I have put the 
				books <span class="style_underline">on the shelf </span>pretty 
				much <span class="style_underline">at random</span>.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_underline">At the beginning</span>, I just 
				took all the books down and piled them up
				<span class="style_underline">on the floor</span>.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_underline">After that</span>, I found all the 
				history books and put them <span class="style_underline">on one 
				side</span> <span class="style_underline">in alphabetical order 
				of titles</span>.&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">Having done 
				that</span>, I started on the novels and put them
				<span class="style_underline">in order of the authors' names</span>.&nbsp; 
				And so on.&nbsp; <span class="style_underline">By the end of the 
				afternoon</span>, I had everything <span class="style_underline">
				where I wanted it</span> and now I can find things.</em></p>
				The learners' task was to work together and classify the 
				preposition-phrase and other adverbials into those which express 
				time, those expressing place and those referring to manner.<br />
				This is an assisted task because three things have happened:<ol class="auto-style90">
					<li>The learners have been assisted by the underlining of 
					the targets.</li>
					<li>They learners are collaborating and helping each other.</li>
					<li>There is a clear categorising task to accomplish which is 
					language based.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The temptation you will find in many references is to suggest 
			that assisted discovery learning is the same as scaffolding and it 
			is an understandable confusion because it is certainly closer to 
			real scaffolding than independent discovery learning.<br />
			Nevertheless, it is not true scaffolding because there is no 
			evidence that the task lies within the learners ZPD or that they 
			could not do the task without the assistance provided by 
			underlining.&nbsp; There is also no evidence that the learners can 
			do the task at all because the concepts the phrases express are 
			somewhat blurred at the edges.<br />
			It could easily become a proper scaffolding event if the teacher, 
			during feedback, focuses only on the small extra details and help 
			that the class needs to complete the task successfully.&nbsp; As it 
			stands, however, it is assistance, not scaffolding.</p>
			<p>There is mounting evidence, at least in the area of teaching 
			children, incidentally, that assisted discovery work is generally 
			more effective in terms of learning and retention than independent 
			work.</p>

					<h2>Scaffolding <em>vs.</em> Socratic (leading) questioning 
					and IRF sequences</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The process of elicitation through leading questions is another 
			routine often described as scaffolding and, again, it is closely 
			related but not quite the same thing.<br />
			This sort of questioning to lead a learner to the truth (or 
			something near it) is sometimes called Socratic questioning and is a 
			very ancient technique.&nbsp; Socratic questioning works on a cycle 
			of <span class="style_black"><strong>question &rarr; response → 
			objection → question → refined response → objection → question → 
			refined response</strong></span> and so on.</p>
			<p>Here's an example from Ellis (although he doesn't call this 
			Socratic questioning):</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="auto-style40">Teacher</span>: I want you to tell me what you can 
			see in the picture or what’s wrong with the picture.<br />
			<span class="auto-style40">Learner</span>: A /paik/ (= bike)<br />
			<span class="auto-style40">Teacher</span>: A cycle, yes. But what’s wrong?<br />
			<span class="auto-style40">Learner</span>: /ret/ (= red)<br />
			<span class="auto-style40">Teacher</span>: It’s red yes. What’s wrong with it?<br />
			<span class="auto-style40">Learner</span>: Black<br />
			<span class="auto-style40">Teacher</span>: Black. Good. Black what?<br />
			<span class="auto-style40">Learner</span>: Black /taes/ (= tyres)<br />
			<span class="auto-style91">(Ellis, 2003, p. 181)</span></p>
			<p>What is actually happening here is not really scaffolding 
			(although it is obviously an attempt to help and lead the learners 
			to the 'right' answer, whatever that is).<br />
			All this really is is what many teachers do in the classroom 
			repeatedly and is an example of what is called a classroom IRF 
			sequence (Initiation&nbsp;&rarr; Response&nbsp;&rarr; Follow-up) and 
			is not even a very good example of that.<br />
			In fact, an IRF sequence is often used as a Socratic method when it 
			consists of:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>Initiation&nbsp;→ Response&nbsp;→ 
			Initiation&nbsp;→ Response&nbsp;→ Initiation&nbsp;→ Response&nbsp;→ Follow-up evaluation</strong></span>.&nbsp; 
			For example (teacher's utterances 			<span class="style_black">
			<strong>in black</strong></span>):</p>
			<p><span class="style_black">Initiation: <strong>What can you see, Mario?</strong></span><br />
			Response: I can see a policeman.<br />
			<span class="style_black">Response:<strong> OK.</strong><br />
			Initiation: <strong>What's he doing?</strong></span><br />
			Response: He's talking.<br />
			<span class="style_black">Response.&nbsp; <strong>I see.</strong><br />
			Initiation: <strong>Who's he talking to?</strong></span><br />
			Response: A shopkeeper<br />
			<span class="style_black">Response: <strong>I see.</strong><br />
			Initiation: <strong>Now, listen: You can see a policeman who is talking to a 
			shopkeeper.&nbsp; Can you make a sentence like that?</strong></span><br />
			Response: I can see a policeman and who is talk to a shopkeeper<br />
			<span class="style_black">Initiation: <strong>Try again.&nbsp; You don't 
			need </strong> <em><strong>and</strong></em><strong> and get the verb form right.</strong></span><br />
			Response: I can see a policeman, err, who is talking to a 
			shopkeeper.<br />
			<span class="style_black">Follow up: <strong>Great, well done.&nbsp; That's 
			good.</strong></span></p>
			<p>Although this is an example of supporting a learner and guiding 
			to the correct answer, it is not scaffolding.&nbsp; Scaffolding refers to more than leading learners to the right 
			answer by elicitation because the latter often results in random 
			guessing until the learner hits on what it is that the teacher wants 
			to hear.</p>

					<h2>Scaffolding<em> vs.</em> Prompting</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Scaffolding proper is also not the same as prompting learners 
			with the right answer or a clue to where to find it.<br />
			There is little doubt that prompting can be helpful and lead 
			learners to discover the right answer for themselves but it differs 
			from scaffolding insofar as the object is not to teach but to 
			provide the learner with some data to use now, rather than extend 
			their interlanguage into new areas permanently.</p>
			<p>Prompting can take a number of forms, none of them differs from 
			helping or nudging rather than scaffolding:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>directing</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is merely telling learners a short-cut way to finding 
				the answer they need.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Look in the last paragraph for the answer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the word </em>abstain<em>.&nbsp; What's its preposition?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this word followed by a noun?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Direction can aid discovery but it's not scaffolding.</dd>
				<dt><strong>whispering</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is often done while monitoring or watching a role play.&nbsp; 
				It involves a more or less theatrical <em>sotto voce</em> prompt 
				routine such as whispering:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past tense<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Damage<em> not </em>break<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You need an object</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>drilling</strong></dt>
				<dd>Prompting often forms part of a drilling sequence as in, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher: I saw Petra today (haven't ... 
				years)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learners: I haven't seen her for years.</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>hinting</strong></dt>
				<dd>When learners are searching for words an oft-used technique 
				is to give them the opening sound of the item (because there is 
				some evidence that opening sound and the word itself are stored 
				together in the brain).&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Learner: I ate in the, erm ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher: /k/, /k/, /k/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learner: Canteen!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher: Well done.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>starting</strong></dt>
				<dd>Another frequently used technique is for the teacher to 
				provide the beginning of what the learner is meant to produce so 
				that she / he can complete the clause as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learner: I go to the market on Sunday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher: I went ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learner: I went to the market on Sunday</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher: He wasn't there on time because 
				the bus was ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learner(s): Delayed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher: Right</em>!</dd>
				<dt><strong>recasting</strong></dt>
				<dd>This involves the teacher repeating the learner's utterance 
				but altering it to conform to the rules of the language.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learner: I have saw him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher: Oh, you have <span class="style_underline"><strong>
				seen</strong></span> him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learner: Yes, I have seen him</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>None of these techniques is being disparaged here because they 
			can all be efficacious in extracting language from learners or 
			correcting their production.&nbsp; What they are not, however, is 
			scaffolding.</p>

					<h2>Scaffolding and Dogme</h2>

			</table>
			<p>It is slightly concerning and slightly interesting that one of 
			the originators of a Dogme approach to teaching, Scott Thornbury, 
			does not mention scaffolding anywhere in his definition of the Dogme 
			approach and, incidentally, manages not to mention Dogme, Vygotsky 
			or the ZPD in his article on scaffolding itself.<br />
			However, in one article, the following appears:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Learning can be mediated through talk, 
			especially talk that is shaped and supported (i.e. <em>scaffolded</em>) 
			by the teacher.<br />
			<span class="auto-style91">Thornbury 2005:1</span></p>
			<p>The key here is <span class="style_underline"><strong>shaped</strong></span>, 
			not just supported.<br />
			Too often Dogme lessons, while being undeniably communicative and 
			focused on the language and language needs that emerge from the 
			learners, fail to take the learners forward in any meaningful sense.<br />
			For scaffolding to be effective in such lessons, the language which 
			emerges must be refined and shaped, not just practised.&nbsp; 
			Otherwise a Dogme lesson is akin to what used to be termed 
			'conversation hours' in which a teacher, usually undertrained and 
			under-supported, would lead a chat about topics of interest to the 
			learners who then practised what they already knew without making 
			any discernible progress.</p>
			<p>Well conducted by an experienced and sensitive teacher, Dogme is 
			just the environment in which scaffolding should happen, of course.&nbsp; 
			As Thornbury points out:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The teacher's primary function, apart from 
			promoting the kind of classroom dynamic which is conducive to a 
			dialogic and emergent pedagogy, is to optimise language learning 
			affordances, by, for example, directing attention to features of the 
			emergent language.<br />
			<span class="auto-style91">(Ibid)</span></p>
			<p>The term affordance needs defining.&nbsp; It refers to the 
			possibilities you see in the environment around you.&nbsp; For 
			example, if you see a plant pot, you may note that its main 
			affordance is a container to keep plants in but it could also be 
			used as a doorstop, a paperweight and a number of other things.&nbsp; 
			All these are affordances.&nbsp; Language learning affordances are, 
			then, the usabilities that the learner perceives in the language he 
			or she is exposed to.</p>
			<p>Scaffolding, properly understood, however, is more than
			<span class="style_black"><em>directing attention</em></span>.&nbsp; 
			It needs to go on from there to focus on extending and refining 
			learners' output.&nbsp; That is perfectly doable in a Dogme lesson, 
			indeed, it is a primary aim of a Dogme lesson, 
			but only if the teacher is aware of how to scaffold rather than 
			simply supply, correct and direct attention.<br />
			Well run, Dogme includes but is not limited to scaffolding.</p>
			<p>There is a little more on Dogme in the guide linked at the end.</p>

					<h2>So, what <span class="style_underline"><em>is</em></span> scaffolding?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Now we are rid of what scaffolding is not, we can look at the 
			characteristics of the technique.&nbsp; The following is based 
			on Wood, Bruner and Ross, 1976:98, who set out six 
			characteristics of effective classroom scaffolding.&nbsp; Citations 
			within the following are <span class="style_black"><em>in black</em></span>.<br />
			It should remembered, however, that their study was concerned with 
			how scaffolding worked in teaching:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">children aged 3, 4 and 5 yr to build a 
			particular three-dimensional structure that requires a degree of 
			skill that is initially beyond them. It is the usual type of 
			tutoring situation in which one member "knows the answer" and the 
			other does not, rather like a "practical" in which only the 
			instructor "knows how".<br />
			<span class="auto-style91">(Op cit. p89)</span></p>
			<p>so not all of it may be relevant to teaching languages 
			(especially to adults) and not all the characteristics that they 
			identify need always be present.<br />
			The six are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Recruitment</strong><br />
				<img alt="recruit" height="133" src="../../images/woman_apple_focus200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This involves getting learners to understand and adhere to what 
				is needed as well as raising their interest in doing any kind of 
				task.<br />
				It may, for example, involve the teacher making it clear that 
				polishing and improving their production will make them more 
				effective speakers or writers in English or convincing them that 
				the target item is worth learning.&nbsp; A Test–Teach–Test approach 
				may do that. of course, by raising the learners' awareness of 
				what they <strong>should</strong> be able to do.</li>
				<li><strong>Reduction in degrees of freedom</strong><br />
				<img alt="free" height="133" src="../../images/woman_happy_jump200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This involves <span class="style_black"><em>simplifying the task 
				by reducing the number of constituent acts required to reach 
				a solution</em></span><br />
				As we saw above, with the examples of transferred negation and a 
				tennis forehand, the learners had already mastered many of the 
				skills and needed only to focus on something instantly 
				achievable.&nbsp; In the writers' words:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>it involved reducing the size of 
				the task to the level where the learner could recognize whether 
				or not he had achieved a "fit" with task requirements</em></span>.</li>
				<li><strong>Direction maintenance</strong><br />
				<img alt="follow" height="133" src="../../images/sign_follow_me200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>The tutor has the role of keeping 
				them in pursuit of a particular objective. Partly it involves 
				keeping the child "in the field" and partly deployment of zest 
				and sympathy to keep him motivated.</em></span><br />
				In a language classroom, this will be most relevant to longer 
				and more complex tasks in which it is easy for learners to 
				become distracted and sidetracked.&nbsp; Part of scaffolding an 
				activity is to make sure this doesn't happen.<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Action, of course, tends to follow 
				the line of previous success.</em></span><br />
				In other words, chopping a task into achievable (with a little 
				help) sections encourages the learners to stay focused and 
				motivated.</li>
				<li><strong>Marking critical features<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="mark" height="133" src="../../images/mark_200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>A tutor ... provides information 
				about the discrepancy between what the child has produced and 
				what he would recognize as a correct production.</em></span><br />
				This is, in the language classroom a matter of what is called 
				noticing the gap.&nbsp; There is a guide to noticing on this 
				site, linked below.&nbsp; Here, the learners need to be alert (or 
				directed towards) the differences between a model and their own 
				production.</li>
				<li><strong>Frustration control</strong><br />
				<img alt="angry" height="133" src="../../images/woman_angry_smoke200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The key is that the teacher's assistance should make the 
				acquisition of the target language or skill less, not more, 
				stressful than working alone or simply being told the right 
				answer.&nbsp; In other words, it involves sensitive support 
				rather than criticism and overt correction.<br />
				The authors, however, caution that:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>The major risk is in creating too 
				much dependency on the tutor.</em></span><br />
				so we need to be sensitive to not allowing the task to wander to 
				the right of the ZPD and become frustrating and demotivating.</li>
				<li><strong>Demonstration</strong><br />
				<img alt="demo" height="133" src="../../images/man_notice200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is more than a monkey-see-monkey-do approach.&nbsp; That's 
				simply modelling and it has its place in the classroom, but not 
				here.<br />
				It <span class="style_black"><em>involves considerably more than 
				simply performing.<br />
				</em></span>It may also involve presenting an idealised version of the 
				language you want the learners to acquire (for example, 
				exaggerated intonation patterns or vowel lengthening).<br />
				It may also involve, for example, demonstrating part of a task 
				but not all of it, in order to make the task doable at all.</li>

			<p>Here's a summary of the ways to help learners to the answer and,

			</table>
			<ol>
				<li>Scaffolding is not just helping and supporting.&nbsp; It is 
				a targeted process aimed at exploiting the learners' Zone of 
				Proximal Development to extend and improve their interlanguage 
				and skills development.&nbsp; It does help, but it does much 
				more.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Scaffolding not only produces 
				immediate results, but also instills the skills necessary for 
				independent problem solving in the future.</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style92">McLeod 2012</span><br />
				This is a key point because successful scaffolding results in 
				increasing learner independence as tasks become less challenging 
				and more immediately doable (with a small amount of assistance).</li>
				<li>Scaffolding is not the teacher's preserve.&nbsp; Scaffolding 
				can support learner differentiation policies in the classroom.&nbsp; 
				Mixed ability groups are the norm not the exception and getting 
				learners to collaborate and peer teach is an effective way of 
				overcoming the disadvantages of heterogeneous groups.<br />
				Peer teaching has to be set up carefully, however, to make sure 
				that both 'teacher' and learner are operating just inside their 
				respective ZPDs.</li>
				<li>Scaffolding can be achieved in a number of ways, through 
				demonstration, hinting, information giving, drilling or simply 
				clever task design.&nbsp; No single strategy will always be 
				effective for all targets.</li>
				<li>Scaffolding is only effective within the ZPD.&nbsp; Straying 
				outside it is wasting your and your learners' time.</li>
				<li>Scaffolding is an opportunity for learning.&nbsp; It is not 
				merely imitation or practice.</li>
				<li>Scaffolding is not a one-off event like drilling, correcting 
				or modelling.&nbsp; It is an ongoing process in the sensitive 
				teacher's classroom.</li>
				<li>Scaffolding is a metaphor.&nbsp; When each stage of the 
				construction is completed, the scaffolding is dismantled until 
				the building can stand alone.</li>
				<li>Finally:<br />
				Control <span class="style_black"><em>those elements of the task 
				that are initially beyond the learner's capacity, thus 
				permitting him to concentrate upon and complete only those 
				elements that are within his range of competence. The task thus 
				proceeds to a successful conclusion</em></span>.<br />
				<span class="auto-style92">Wood, Bruner and Ross op 
				cit. p90</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>and a successful conclusion is just what we need.</p>
