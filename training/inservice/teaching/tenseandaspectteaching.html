	<h1>Teaching tense and aspect</h1>

		<img alt="aspect" height="208" src="../../images/aspect310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p>If you have it in mind to teach a particular tense, there are guides 
		to most of them on this site.&nbsp; The links are from
		<a href="../../initial/indexes_ip/verbsindex_ip.html">the initial plus index</a>.</p>

		</table>
		
		<p>If you have learned another language, you will be aware that this is 
		an area in which languages differ quite dramatically in how they 
		conceptualise time.<br />
		There is something of a debate concerning whether the ways in which our 
		first languages chop up and conceptualise time affect the way we think 
		about time or whether the way we conceptualise time determines how our 
		language evolves its tense system.&nbsp; The jury is still out on this.</p>
		<p>All languages have a way of dealing with past, present and future 
		concepts.&nbsp; There the similarities end, unfortunately.<br />
		In general terms, inflecting languages such as the European italic 
		languages like French, Italian and Spanish, as well as Greek, will typically 
		denote tense markers by amending the verb in some way, often by using different suffixes 
		or prefixes.&nbsp; 
		Other European languages, notably Germanic ones, may also insert 
		various auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; English operates similarly with the 
		exception of not having a specific form to denote the future.&nbsp; So 
		we get, for example:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style3" style="width: 70%">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style4" style="width: 108px">English</td>
				<td class="auto-style4" style="width: 109px"><em>I see</em></td>

		<p>The difficulty will probably become apparent when you insert any 
		other language you know or speak in the last row.&nbsp; Even in that 
		simple table, there are obvious issues:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Aspect:</strong><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was living<br />
			</em>is a <span class="auto-style6">progressive 
			or continuous aspect</span> form and implies, usually, that this was a long-term 
			state in something like<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was living in France when I met her<br />
			</em>This is also sometimes called the <span class="auto-style6">durative</span> 
			aspect.&nbsp; Note, however, that German uses the same form for both
			<em>I lived</em> and <em>I was living</em>, relying on context to 
			determine the nature of the state.&nbsp; There is no marker for the 
			progressive in standard German (although there are dialects which do 
			have the form).<br />
			French, arguably, does not really have a present progressive aspect 
			either, often preferring to use a phrase to mean something like <em>
			to be in the middle of doing</em> (<em>en train de</em>).&nbsp; The 
			imperfect ending on the verb, <em>ais</em>, above, does, however, carry some sense 
			of duration or an interruptible event.<br />
			The <span class="auto-style6">perfect aspect</span><em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have 
			lived<br />
			</em>for example, will also be problematic because German and 
			English exhibit parallel forms but in German the concept is not 
			parallel at all.<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ich habe gesehen<br />
			</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ich sah<br />
			</em>are functionally the same tense and mean either<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen</em><br />
			depending on the context and meaning intended.<br />
			The French<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; j'ai parle<br />
			</em>is also just as 
			easily rendered in English as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke<br />
			</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spoken.</em></li>
			<li><strong>Auxiliary verbs:</strong><br />
			English uses an auxiliary to denote the 
			future but can, and frequently does, just use a present tense 
			with a future time marker such as <em>tomorrow</em> as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He leaves next week</em><br />
			In fact, 
			nearly all languages do that.</li>

		<br />
		This is not the end of the story.&nbsp; Other languages may signal 
		aspects which are not signalled by verb changes in English such as:<dl>
			<dt>Discontinuous</dt>
			<dd>signalling that an action was completed but the state is also 
			terminated.&nbsp; For example, in this aspect, in some languages:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put on my coat</em><br />
			implies that I am no longer wearing my coat.<br />
			English has no way to signal this aspect by changes to the verb 
			form.&nbsp; The language is forced to insert a new clause as in, 
			e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and then took it off</em></dd>
			<dt>Gnomic</dt>
			<dd>signalling an established fact, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A square has four sides</em><br />
			English uses the present simple to express this aspect or modal 
			auxiliary verbs such as <em>must, can, have to</em>, as in e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parallel lines cannot meet</em></dd>
			<dt>Episodic</dt>
			<dd>signalling a one-off event rather than iterative or gnomic 
			aspects as in, e.g.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottle broke</em><br />
			English uses the past simple form for this.</dd>
			<dt>Continuative</dt>
			<dd>signalling an ongoing action.&nbsp; English uses adverbials with 
			the progressive form to show this aspect as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is still asking questions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He isn't here yet</em></dd>
			<dt>Inceptive</dt>
			<dd>signalling the beginning of something.<br />
			English signals this aspect semantically by verb choice, often with 
			the<em> to-</em>infinitive,<em> </em>as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It started to rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began to wonder</em></dd>
			<dt>Terminative</dt>
			<dd>signalling the end of an action or event.<br />
			English signals the aspect semantically by verb choice, often with 
			an -<em>ing</em> form, as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It stopped raining<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finished working</em></dd>
			<dt>Defective</dt>
			<dd>signalling an action or event that was not successful or did not 
			actually occur.<br />
			English signals this with adverbials as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She almost lost her temper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nearly got the answer right</em><br />
			or with the future-in-the-past formulation as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to telephone you</em></dd>
			<dt>Pausative</dt>
			<dd>signalling an interrupted action which then continued.&nbsp; 
			English uses adverbials or non-finite forms to show this aspect as 
			in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stopped to look in the window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave up smoking for a long time</em></dd>
			<dt>Resumptive</dt>
			<dd>signalling an action or event that resumes.<br />
			English often signals this semantically by the choice of verb, which 
			may be followed by a non-finite -<em>ing</em> form, or a noun phrase 
			as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I carried on walking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She resumed eating<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He continued his speech</em></dd>
		</dl>
		Learners whose first language(s) signal some of these aspects by changes 
		to the verb forms may have difficulty selecting which form in English 
		signals the same sort of aspectual meaning or in interpreting what the changes (or 
		non-changes) to the verb form in English mean.<br />
		<br />
		<hr />
		<h3>Avoidance</h3>
		<p>English tense forms and their concepts are difficult to grasp but the 
		verb itself has few inflexions.<br />
		Learning the forms of <em>be</em> and <em>have</em> and the single 
		change between the infinitive and past participle, along with the -<em>ing</em> 
		ending makes it simple to form lots of tenses.&nbsp; Expect some 
		avoidance, therefore, and the use of the perfect and progressive aspects 
		where the simple aspect is desirable.&nbsp; It is easier to form, for 
		example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was choosing</em><br />
		than to remember the past-tense of the verb and form<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I chose</em></p>

		<p>There are three main issues:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Many languages have similar forms to English (especially the 
			perfect aspect forms) but use them in significantly different ways 
			and often don't distinguish one form from another conceptually</li>
			<li>Many languages, while having a conceptual difference similar to 
			English, will form the aspects in radically different 
			ways (and some make distinctions between aspects that 
			simply do not exists in English)</li>
			<li>English aspect forms are used for a variety of functions 
			(consider, e.g., the uses of the present perfect)</li>

		<p>
		Some languages, of course, will present double problems, using a similar 
		form with a different concept <strong><em>and</em></strong> having 
		similar concepts realised in different forms.&nbsp; We need to take

		<p>As you can see, concept needs to be made clear from the outset 
		and that usually means setting the language in a context which makes the
		<strong>meaning</strong> and the <strong>intention of the speaker</strong> 
		explicit.</p>
		<h3>Meaning and intention</h3>
		<p><strong>Time lines</strong></p>
		<p>are invaluable to help people grasp the concept of time 
		realised by the target tense form.&nbsp; Consider the following and ask 
		yourself whether the explanation is clear.&nbsp; Then hover on the 
		explanation to see the picture:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style3" style="width: 95%">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style4" onmouseover="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'tl1',1,'style.visibility','visible')">This tense is used in English to make it 
				clear that one event occurred many times in the past but is 
				probably not still happening</td>
				<td class="auto-style4" style="width: 450px">
				<img id="tl1" style="visibility:hidden" alt="time line" height="106" src="../../imagesgraphics/pasttimeline4crop.png" width="450" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style4" >
				Example<em>:<br />
				John cycled to school when he was a boy.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style4" onmouseover="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'tl2',1,'style.visibility','visible')">These two tenses are used when 
				a long 
				event is stopped by a short event</td>
				<td class="auto-style4" style="width: 450px">
				<img id="tl2" style="visibility:hidden" alt="time line" class="auto-style8" height="103" src="../../imagesgraphics/pasttimeline6crop.png" width="450" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style4" >

				He was skiing when he broke his leg.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style4" onmouseover="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'tl3',1,'style.visibility','visible')">This tense is used when we want to look 
				back from the future to an event occurring before the future</td>

				<img id="tl3" style="visibility:hidden" alt="time line" height="239" src="../../imagesgraphics/bookfinished.png" width="450" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style4" >
				Example<em>:<br />
				The town will have changed a lot by the end of the decade.</em></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
				<p><strong>Concept-check questions</strong></p>
		<p>are equally necessary to allow you and the learner to see if the 
		concept has been grasped.&nbsp; For example, what questions would you 
		use to check the following tense meanings are understood?</p>
		<p>Think what questions you would ask and then hover over the example 
		sentences when you want to see suggestions.&nbsp; (There's
		<a href="../../initial/teaching/checklearning.html">a guide to checking 
		learning and understanding</a> on this site.)</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style3" style="width: 70%">

				<h3>Context</h3>
		<p>When you plan a lesson on any particular tense form, time is well 
		spent thinking about a clear context in which to set the language.&nbsp; 
		For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style12" style="width: 95%" cellspacing="0">
				<tr >
					<td class="auto-style10">Present perfect for life 
					experiences up to now</td>
					<td class="auto-style10">Exotic foods (<em>I've never eaten</em> 
					etc.)<br />
					Cultural event (<em>I've seen ..., I've visited the British 
					Museum</em> etc.)<br />
					Conversational gambits (<em>You've been to ..., haven't you?</em> 
					etc.)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr >
					<td class="auto-style10">Past perfect</td>
					<td class="auto-style10">Sequences of events in which 
					subsequent ones depend on early ones:<br />
					Absent-minded people (<em>He had to go back because he'd 
					forgotten ...</em> etc.)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="auto-style5">
					<td class="auto-style10"><em>going to </em>future based on 
					present evidence</td>
					<td class="auto-style10">
					Forecasting weather from sky pictures<br />
					Pictures of unstable events: volcanoes, inattentive drivers, 
					children playing ball games near windows etc.</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			
				<h3>Practice</h3>
		<p>Practice also has to be in a context and have meaning for the learners or it's 
		just form manipulation.&nbsp; This is particularly important if the 
		learners' first language has a similar form used differently.&nbsp; For 
		example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style12" style="width: 95%" cellspacing="0">
				<tr class="concoursebluepara">
					<td class="auto-style10">Present perfect (life experiences 
					up to now)</td>
					<td class="auto-style10">Learners make lists of things they have never done, have 
					done, have done only once/twice etc.&nbsp;
					They then mingle with other students to see if their lists 
					overlap or not, asking and answering questions in the form.<br />
					You can extend this activity to make sure that people ask 
					where? when? etc. in order to be definite and, accordingly, 
					select the past simple.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="auto-style5">
					<td class="auto-style10"><em>will</em> to show willingness</td>
					<td class="auto-style10">Learners role-play a willing person 
					and a demanding person:<br />
					<em>A: There's no air in here.<br />
					B: I'll open a window.<br />
					A: I haven't got a pen.<br />
					B: I'll get you one.</em><br />
					etc.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="auto-style5">
					<td class="auto-style10">Present perfect as a conversational 
					gambit</td>
					<td class="auto-style10"><span class="concoursebluepara">Learners decide on pieces of 
					information they need to know about something and then find 
					out who can tell them by asking things 
					like <em>You've been to France, haven't you?&nbsp; Well, I've 
					been wondering ...<br />
					</em>Learners invent gossipy stories about each other / teachers 
					etc. and then pass them on to a colleague who in turn 
					embellishes the snippet of scandal and passes it on again.<br />
					E.g., <em>Did you know that John has moved in with Mary?&nbsp; 
					Yes, and she has decided he can't stay much longer.</em></span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="auto-style5">
					<td class="auto-style10">Future perfect for changes by a 
					time</td>
					<td class="auto-style10">Learners make predictions about how 
					they, their home town, their countries, the world will have 
					changed by (date).</td>
				</tr>

		<p>A structural approach to teaching English focuses on the form and then considers its meaning.&nbsp; 
		For example, we teach the form <span class="auto-style6">subject + be + 
		-<em>ing</em></span> (<em>They are talking</em>) and then consider what 
		it might mean (future arrangement, current event etc.)<br />
		A communicative / functional approach may reverse this and focus on the function to be expressed and see what ways the language has to express it.&nbsp; For example, we might start by focusing on making very polite requests and then teach a range of grammatical realisations such as<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you mind awfully ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask you to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it too much trouble to ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if ...<br />
		</em>etc.<br />
It is often the case, however, that we don't do this with aspect.&nbsp; Aspect is 
		usually taught structurally as something secondary to the form of the verb:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a present perfect.  What does it tell us about the speaker's view of the event?</em><br />
		We can, however, focus on the aspect and look at the various ways English has of signalling it because it, too, has a functional, communicative role.&nbsp; Two examples:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>How can English signal that an action is iterative (i.e., repeated)?</li>
			<li>How can English signal that an action is prospective (i.e., 
			imminent)?</li>
		</ol>

			<table id="backtofront" style="visibility:hidden" cellpadding="3" class="auto-style12" style="width: 60%" cellspacing="0">
				<tr class="concoursebluepara">
					<td class="auto-style10">Iterative</td>
					<td class="auto-style10"><em>She went on and on asking.<br />
					They did it continually / repeatedly.<br />
					I said it again and again.<br />
					He banged the drum for hours.<br />
					I mow the lawn every Friday.<br />
					I used to get up late on Sundays.<br />
					We would take long walks in the country every week</em><br />
					etc.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="auto-style5">
					<td class="auto-style10">Prospective</td>
					<td class="auto-style10"><em>It's going to rain.<br />
					She's about to get very angry.<br />
					He's on the verge of applying.<br />
					We're nearly at the point where ...<br />
					I'll be with you presently. (British English)<br />
					I was on the point of when ...</em><br />
					etc.</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			
				<p>You may have thought of others.<br />
				An approach like this which identifies a communicative function 
				and then focuses on the language to achieve it, is perfectly 
				legitimate in ELT and may be very fruitful as well as helpful 
				for learners whose first-language backgrounds lead them to focus more explicitly on aspects not often identified as core aspects in English.<br />
