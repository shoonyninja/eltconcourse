		<p>The concept of modality is common to all languages.&nbsp; We all have 
		a need to express things like willingness, probability, likelihood, 
		obligation, requirement and 
		so on.&nbsp; Modality may not only be achieved by the use of modal 
		auxiliary verbs, of course.&nbsp; Saying something like:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm almost certain 
		he'll be late<br />
		</em>instead of<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll be late<br />
		</em>is still using 
		modality in language.<br />
		Modal auxiliary <span class="style_underline">verbs</span> are, however, very 
		variable across languages.&nbsp; Here's a brief run-down by major 
		language groupings explaining a little of how it all works.&nbsp; There 
		won't be enough detail here for your particular students and your 
		setting but it is somewhere to start.&nbsp; You can get more on line but 
		beware the unreliability of many sites.<br />
		Swan and Smith, 2001, is a usually reliable source albeit frustratingly 
		inconsistent in covering modality.</p>

				<td class="auto-style2">Arabic<br />
				</td>
				<td class="auto-style5">Standard Arabic does not have modal 
				auxiliary verbs which correspond exactly to English modal auxiliaries.<br />
				However, it does have many precise and detailed ways to express 
				modal concepts.&nbsp; For example<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">must, have to, should, might, may, it is possible to, it is 
				impossible to, it is expected that, it is easy to, it is hard 
				to, it's worth mentioning that, it's well-established that, it's 
				most likely that, it's forbidden to, it's permitted to, it's 
				more proper to</span><br />
				</em>and a range of other concepts are all 
				expressed through a form of modal construction.<br />
				The problem, of course, is that these categories do not mirror 
				the modal categories of English so expect a good deal of 
				confusion, especially with modal auxiliary verbs like <em>may</em> and <em>
				could</em> which have a range of functions.<br />
				The concept of having a large range of modality in the language 
				will not be mysterious to learners from an Arabic background.<br />

			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style2">Chinese languages</td>
				<td class="auto-style5">Modern Standard Chinese, too, has a 
				range of modal auxiliary verbs, as one would expect of an isolating 
				language.&nbsp; They are, however, not at all parallel to those 
				in English.&nbsp; There are, for example, three modal auxiliary verbs 
				which perform the functions associated with <em>can</em> (ability, 
				permission, possibility) in English.&nbsp; The most commonly 
				used modal auxiliaries in Chinese languages express<br />
				<span class="style_black">
				<em>want; ask for; wish; desire<br />
				want to; would like to; feel like (something)<br />
				should; ought to; must<br />
				can; be able to; be capable of<br />
				like; love; prefer; enjoy; be fond of<br />
				can; may<br />
				be good at; be skilful in<br />
				be willing to </em></span><br />
				Conceptually, modality poses no problems but overlapping 
				meanings will make life difficult.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style2">Slavonic languages including Russian, 
				Polish, Ukrainian, Czech, Slovak etc.</td>
				<td class="auto-style5">Slavonic languages also have modal 
				auxiliary verbs but, as usual, the categories don't exactly match 
				(although they are closer than many languages).&nbsp; A single 
				verb form (roughly translatable as <em>must</em>) serves in 
				Polish for the English verbs <em>must, need to </em>and<em> 
				ought to</em>, 
				for example.<br />
				In Czech, there is a clear distinction between externally and 
				internally imposed obligations, often rendered in English by <em>
				must</em> vs. <em>have to, should</em> or <em>ought to</em>.<br />
				Russian has a simpler modal system than English so you may 
				encounter, e.g., <em>He must not</em> used to mean <em>He needn't 
				/ doesn't have to.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style2">Germanic languages</td>
				<td class="auto-style5">These languages use modality is ways 
				quite similar to English which makes life easier for learners 
				from these language backgrounds.&nbsp; The most important exceptions often 
				concern the negative uses.&nbsp; For example, in German the 
				translation of <em>needn't / don't have to</em>, expressing the 
				lack of obligation either way,<em> </em>would be<em> must not</em> 
				[<em>muss nicht</em>] and 
				that causes confusion.&nbsp; To translate the English sense of
				<em>must not</em> meaning prohibition, German uses a different 
				modal auxiliary verb [<em>darf nicht</em>], roughly translatable as <em>
				may not</em>.<em><br />
				</em>In Swedish, the verb used for the sense of <em>needn't </em>
				is cognate with the English expression <em>behove</em>.<em><br />
				</em>In these languages, too, there are usually more tense forms 
				available so an equivalent of <em>had to </em>may be rendered as
				<em>'*musted'</em>.&nbsp; Learners may be confused by a logically 
				constructed tense form in their first language, the past or 
				future of <em>must</em>, for example, not existing in 
				English.<br />
				The overlap in meanings between cognate modal auxiliary verbs is not 
				precise so expect errors such as <em>It can be</em> used to mean
				<em>It might be</em>.<br />
				There are few serious conceptual difficulties otherwise.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style2">Italic languages including French, 
				Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian etc.</td>
				<td class="auto-style5">These languages do not have a separate 
				grammatical category for modal auxiliary verbs and usually render the 
				concepts as a verb followed by an infinitive form, e.g., in 
				French <em>Je peux aller (I can go) </em>or in Spanish <em>Puedo 
				ir.&nbsp; </em>Expect, therefore, errors such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I can to 
				eat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *You must to enter<br />
				</em>etc.<em> </em>because many learners 
				perceive the <em>to-</em>form as the infinitive in English.<em><br />
				</em>Some modal concepts, e.g., for obligation, are expressed in 
				the passive (<em>It is necessary that ...</em>).</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style2">Swedish, Danish and Norwegian</td>
				<td class="auto-style5">Scandinavian languages have a separate 
				class of modal auxiliary verbs although use is an issue.&nbsp; The verb
				<em>kan</em>, for example, is used to talk about the possible 
				future where English would use <em>may</em> or <em>might.&nbsp;
				</em>Expect, therefore,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It can rain tomorrow.<br />
				</em>Other uses of modal auxiliaries are close parallels with English.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style2">Japanese </td>
				<td class="auto-style5">Japanese has two classes of modal 
				auxiliary verbs: those which are attached to stems and cannot function 
				independently and those which are ordinary verbs which lose 
				their meanings when acting as auxiliaries.&nbsp; We have, 
				therefore, structures such as <em>miru</em>&nbsp;(<em>to see</em>) leading to
				<em>mirareru</em>&nbsp;(<em>to 
				be able to see</em>).<br />
				The concept of modality will not be strange but the form will 
				cause problems in English.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style1">Other languages</td>
				<td class="auto-style6">Some languages have a very reduced set 
				of modal auxiliary verbs to call on.&nbsp; Greek, e.g., really has only two (<em>must</em> 
				and <em>can</em>), one of which only exists in the <em>It is necessary 
				/ necessarily true that </em>sense 
				in the third person.&nbsp; Added to these problems is the 
				tendency to make past modal auxiliary verbs in completely different ways (often 
				rendering the modal auxiliary in the present with the main verb in the past) so 
				mistakes such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I can saw it</em> (for <em>I was able to 
				see it</em>)<br />
				are possible.<br />
				Turkish speakers will have few problems with the modal system of 
				English as such because the language has many parallel structures.</td>

		<li>The modal system in English exhibits a range of anomalies.&nbsp; For 
		example, the negative of<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be him<br />
		</em>used for deduction is<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can't be him<br />
		</em>not<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It mustn't be him</em>.<br />
		There are 
		numerous other cases of non-parallel structures.</li>
			<li>Modal auxiliary verbs are often contracted and, in natural speech, often 
			rendered with weak-form vowels.&nbsp; So we get <em>must</em> 
			pronounced as /məs/ and <em>can</em> as /kən/ or even /kn/ etc. as well as <em>
			needn't've</em> or <em>couldn't've</em> etc. which are hard to perceive 
			and even harder to produce.</li>
			<li>Few languages have verb forms analogous to English semi-modal 
			auxiliaries (<em>dare, 
			need, used to</em>) and the forms will be 
			difficult to master.</li>

				<h2>Approaches to teaching modal auxiliary verbs</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Fundamentally, there are two ways to approach the teaching of modal 
		auxiliary verbs (and all modality expressions for that matter):</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Form first:</strong> take each modal auxiliary verb as a separate 
			entity and present its various functions logically and 
			appropriately, considering the level of the learners<br />
			For example:<br />
			Consider the modal auxiliary verb can and then teach the functions of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can swim<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It can get cold in the winter here<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			You can't be serious<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He can't have missed the train again</em><br />
			and so on.</li>
			<li><strong>Function first:</strong> decide on the type of modality 
			you want to tackle and then select the modal auxiliary verbs which express the 
			function appropriately, considering the level of the learners<br />
			For example:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Obligation: teach <em>must, have to, should, ought to, had better</em> 
			etc. according to level and previous learning<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Ability: teach<em> can, could, be able to, could have, was able to</em> 
			etc. according to level and previous learning<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Possibility: teach <em>might, could, must, can't have, couldn't 
			have, will</em> etc. according to level and previous learning<br />
			and so on.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>To illustrate, you can conceive the relationship in these two ways:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style33">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style36">
				<h3>Approach 1</h3>

			</tr>
		</table>
		<br />
		If some of the terms are unfamiliar to you, follow <a href="../modality/typesofmodality.html">guide to 
		types of modality</a> or simply ignore them.&nbsp; The following will 
		still make sense.<p>Each has advantages and drawbacks.</p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li>If you take Approach 1:<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>you risk encouraging your learners to think that there is a 
				one-to-one relationship between the verbs and their functions</li>
				<li>you are going from form to function rather than function to 
				form and that's not how the mind operates</li>
				<li>it will be reassuring because this is the way many courses 
				are structured and many coursebooks written so it's familiar to 
				both learners and teachers</li>
				<li>it allows for bite-sized lessons focusing on a single use of 
				a single verb</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If you take Approach 2:<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>you need to make intelligent decisions regarding which and 
				how many verbs to present for each type of modal function</li>
				<li>you may find it difficult to fit the approach within a 
				school syllabus because that is not how they are usually 
				constructed</li>
				<li>you will be moving from function to form and that fits with 
				how the mind operates in this area</li>
				<li>you will be giving your learners an appropriate range of 
				ways to realise the functions they need to communicate</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Some people may take, of course, Approach 1 at lower levels and move 
		to Approach 2 when the learners have succeeded in mastering a range of 
		simple modal auxiliary verbs expressing a limited range of functions.<br />
		Whichever route you choose, the considerations which follow are

		<p><a name="teachingmodals1"></a>To master any modal-verb use we need to know two things:</p>
		<ul class="greybulletlist">
			<li><strong>the speaker/writer's perception of reality</strong><br />
			If a speaker chooses to say<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll rain<br />
			</em>rather than<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
			might well rain<br />
			</em>the intention (arising from the speaker's view 
			of the future) is subtly different</li>
			<li><strong>the context in which it is used</strong><br />
			It is impossible to interpret something like<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could leave 
			earlier<br />
			</em>without knowing the context.&nbsp; It can mean<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			was given permission to leave earlier<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to leave earlier<br />
			</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may </em>(in future) <em>leave earlier<br />
			</em>We need 
			to supply a good deal of information for learners to be able to 
			interpret the sentence accurately:<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
				<li>How is the event situated in time (future or past)?</li>
				<li>What is the speaker's relationship in terms of authority 
				with others?</li>
				<li>Is the speaker likely to be talking about ability or 
				permission, given the preceding text?</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example, the statement<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She must write to her mother<br />
		</em>has 
		a number of possible interpretations.&nbsp; What are they and how does 
		the hearer unpack the meaning?&nbsp;

			<li><em>She should write to her mother</em></li>
			<li><em>She ought to / it is her duty to write to her mother</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p><span class="auto-style29">Only knowledge of the context of the 
		utterance and the speaker's relationship to events (and perception of 
		them) can tell us which meaning is intended.&nbsp; We may also draw on 
		our knowledge of the speaker's habitual responses to events and

		</table>
		<ol>
		<li>The one-form-many-functions and one-function-many-forms problems 
			need careful handling.&nbsp; It is unwise to try to teach any modal 
			in isolation.&nbsp; What we need to do is to focus on particular 
			functions of the form independently.&nbsp; Trying to teach <em>may</em> 
			in contexts where it means both possibility and permission:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
			may rain<br />
		</em>vs<em>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask a question?<br />
		</em>is a 
			recipe for disaster.&nbsp; We have seen above that many languages 
			will reserve separate structures for these functions.<br />
		A much better approach is to focus on the concepts of types of modality 
		and teach, say, <em>may</em> for epistemic modality:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That may be 
		true<br />
		</em>separately from <em>may</em> for deontic modality:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not 
		leave yet<br />
		</em>This way, logical constructs will not be 
		confused.&nbsp; If terms like epistemic and deontic are new to you, 
		follow the <a href="../modality/typesofmodality.html">guide to 
		types of modality</a>.</li>
			<li>Anomalous forms such as the difference between <em>must not </em>and 
			<em>don't have to / needn't </em>also need careful handling in context.&nbsp; 
			The context must make it clear what sort of obligation (if any) is 
			present.<br />
			Equally, modal auxiliary verbs of deduction must be presented in a way that makes 
			it clear what sort of deduction can be made with what level of 
			certainty.&nbsp; Here's an example of something commonly used.&nbsp; 
			What are the problems?<br />
			<a name="musthave"></a>
			<img alt="must have etc." height="387" src="../../imagesgraphics/musthave.png" width="500" /><br />
			<a href="#musthave" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'problem',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have detected the two 
			problems with exercises like this</a>.<br />
			<div id="problem" style="visibility:hidden"><p>
				<span class="auto-style29">Problems:</span></p>
				<ol class="auto-style27">
					<li>There is a mix of tenses.&nbsp; Are the learners 
					expected to produce the perfect forms (or the perfect progressive) or the present tense 
					forms?</li>
					<li>What level of certainty is permitted?&nbsp; Some people 
					are happy to make assertions based on very little evidence; 
					others are more cautious.&nbsp; If you find cosmetics, how 
					sure can you be that the tenant left them (or that the 
					tenant was female)?&nbsp; Was the tenant Spanish or learning 
					Spanish?&nbsp; Given the inexactitude, you can never be sure 
					that the learners' responses are 'correct' in the sense of 
					matching what their thought processes are.</li>
				</ol>
				<p><span class="auto-style29">There are ways to make such exercises work well and be 
				intriguing but it needs a bit more effort:</span></p>
				<ol class="auto-style27">
					<li>We need to make the context clearer.&nbsp; One way is to 
					kill off the ex-tenant so deductions can only be in the 
					past!</li>
					<li>To tackle issues of certainty (epistemic modality), learners can be asked to 
					express in percentage terms how certain they are and compare 
					their responses with others so that in feedback you can 
					judge whether the statement matches the perception.&nbsp; 
					Additionally, giving a little information about the previous 
					tenant would help.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			</li>
			<li>We need to provide lots of targeted listening and production 
			practice in the weak and contracted forms of modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; 
			Drilling is one way but getting learners to select from a multiple-choice list whether they heard, e.g., <em>must've, mustn't've, 
			could've, couldn't've </em>etc. embedded in natural-speed utterances 
			is another way to prepare them for listening in 'the real world'.</li>
			<li>Semi-modal forms are increasingly rarely produced as pure modal 
			auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; 
			For example, <em>dared not</em> is usually now <em>didn't dare, 
			didn't used to</em> is preferred to <em>usedn't to</em> and so on.&nbsp; 
			We need to ask ourselves whether at most levels it is wise to 
			introduce the modal forms at all (except where they may occur and 
			then only for comprehension).&nbsp; This means de-selecting texts 
			which contain them.<br />
			The subtle difference between <em>needn't have</em> and <em>didn't 
			need to</em> is another issue we could leave well alone until 
			learners are really competent in using modal auxiliary verbs.</li>

		</table>
		<p>This is an area which deeply confuses many learners for a number of 
		reasons:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style32">
			<li>Because many languages have only one modal to talk about 
			probability and use adverbials to increase / lessen the sense of how 
			probable something is.</li>
			<li>Because English uses at least 4 separate modal auxiliary verbs to express 
			probability: <em>might, may, could </em>and <em>can</em>.&nbsp; It 
			also uses <em>will</em>, incidentally in, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will be the 
			postman at the door</em>.</li>
			<li>Because it is often taught in a confusing manner providing 
			false, or at least questionable, information.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>There is a school of thought which attempts to represent degrees of 
		probability along some kind of cline from, say, 10% probability up to 
		90% probability and then arrange the modal auxiliary verbs on the cline so we get 
		something like:</p>
		<a name="probability"></a>
		<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style33" style="width: 400px">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style52"><strong>0%</strong></td>

		This is actually misinformation and only serves to confuse the learner, 
		primarily because it isn't true. When you have thought about why this is 
		the case,

		<ol id="probable_nonsense" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
			<li>Intonation, stress, body language and facial expression all play 
			a crucial role.<br />
			For example, if you stress the modal, especially with a rising or 
			falling tone on it, you change, sometimes dramatically, the degree 
			of doubt or uncertainty you are expressing.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <strong>might&uarr;</strong> come<br />
			</em>but I very much doubt it<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the world <strong>could&darr;</strong> end tomorrow<br />
			</em>but I doubt it will<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <strong>may&uarr;</strong> be an engineer<br />
			</em>but I have 
			no idea one way or the other and if I draw out the word <em>may</em>, 
			I can often imply that I doubt someone is telling the truth<br />
			<em>She <strong>must&uarr;</strong> be there by now!<br />
			</em>and I’d 
			be astonished if she wasn’t.&nbsp; This example is actually 
			deduction rather than probability <em>per se</em> but the concepts 
			are closely related and the source of more confusion if handled 
			carelessly.<br />
			Accompany the statement with a shrug and it usually implies 50-50 
			certainty whichever modal auxiliary verb you use.</li>
			<li>In the negative, something else happens.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <strong>might&uarr;</strong> not come<br />
			but I think 
			he will</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He might <strong>not&uarr;</strong> come<br />
			but I’m 
			almost certain he will</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could not come</em> = <em>He wasn’t able to<br />
			</em>and isn’t to 
			do with probability<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <strong>may</strong> not come</em> =<br />
			Either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He isn’t 
			allowed to come<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He might not come</em></li>
			<li>In written English (if you exclude underlining and bold text) 
			it’s the co-text, adverbial use, topic and tense which matters.&nbsp; 
			For example,<br />
			When talking about events far in the future, uncertainty is 
			naturally greater whatever verb is used, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Global warming 
			may / might / could result in serious problems over the coming 
			century</em>.<br />
			If we use an adverbial, we can alter the sense dramatically in 
			things such as:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It could easily rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She might conceivably fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			You may naturally be wondering<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There’s an outside chance that it 
			could arrive today<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I think it’s almost certain 
			that he won’t have the money but he could<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Not all adverbials can be used with all modal auxiliary verbs:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She 
			might easily fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *You may easily be wondering</em> etc.<br />
			All three of these verbs, incidentally, refer to future 
			possibilities not present ones so the speaker’s choice will often be 
			determined by how he/she feels about the future.&nbsp; Only <em>can</em> 
			is used to talk about present possibility / probability as in things 
			like<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be cold here in winter</em>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The general rule is that these modal auxiliaries do not represent different 
		levels of uncertainty or probability <strong>in themselves</strong>.&nbsp; 
		What matters are all the other signals in the text or in the speaker’s 
		tone and or gesture / expression.&nbsp; In fact, they can all vary 
		between 1% and 99%.&nbsp; Both <em>might</em> and <em>could</em> are 
		used almost interchangeably in English although in plain written text 
		there are those who say <em>might</em> sounds more improbable.&nbsp; 
		That is arguable.&nbsp; The verb <em>may</em> is almost always more 
		formal.</p>

		<p>If you have followed <a href="../discourse/genre1.html">the guide to 
		genre</a>, you will aware that certain text types will use modality in 
		very different ways.<br />
		When we teach modal auxiliary verbs, especially to learners who need to write 
		conventional texts, it is worth bearing this in mind.</p>
		<ul class="greybulletlist">
			<li><span class="auto-style31">Instructions</span> sometimes employ 
			deontic or alethic modal uses such as <em>must:<br />
			</em>often in 
			passives:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the flame must not be allowed to touch the oil</em> 
			etc.<br />
			or as imperatives:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do not over tighten the screw</em></li>
			<li><span class="auto-style31">Discussion</span> texts (arguing both sides of a case) will 
		often contain 'hedging' modal auxiliary verbs:<br />
			epistemically: in expressions such as:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might be 
		argued that ...<br />
			</em>or dynamically: in formulations like:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One could consider ...</em></li>
			<li><span class="auto-style31">Recounts and Narratives</span> may employ modal 
			auxiliary verbs:<br />
			epistemically for speculation and 
			deduction as well as possibility:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what I must have 
			been thinking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must have been mad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It couldn't have been worse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			can't tell you<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			and dynamically:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't able to catch the train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't 
			get to the station in time<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li><span class="auto-style31">Information reports</span> contain 
			very little modality normally because they don't usually deal with 
			possibilities and so on, confining themselves to facts.<br />
			When modality is employed, it is often alethic:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The eggs must be 
			incubated for 20 days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution has to be heated to 150 °C</em></li>
			<li><span class="auto-style31">Explanations</span> often involve 
			modal auxiliary verbs:<br />
			epistemically of possibility: <em>can cause 
			... , may result in</em> ... etc.<br />
			or dynamically of ability / willingness: <em>can't break, won't be 
			airtight </em>etc.</li>
			<li><span class="auto-style31">Expositions</span> (arguing one side of a case) employ<br />
			deontic modality to make a 
			case:<em> should be, cannot be, must be, ought to be </em>etc.<br />
			and epistemic modality to appear certain: <em>this will surely 
			result in ..., that must lead to ... </em>etc.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In writing lessons, in particular, it is useful to focus on modality because a genre approach, by its nature, points learners towards 
		noticing how the intention of the writer is realised in the use of 
		language structure.</p>
