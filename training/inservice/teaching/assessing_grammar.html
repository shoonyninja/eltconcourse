			<h1>Testing and assessing grammar</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="test" height="207" src="../../images/test_tube_glow310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Grammar is tested directly or 
			indirectly in all tests of a learner's language ability.&nbsp; It is 
			difficult to conceive of any type of test in which there is no 
			consideration of the grammatical abilities of the test takers.&nbsp; 
			Even when a test item looks like this, for example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Select the correct 
			answer:<br />
			Please ________ me the answer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) talk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) tell</p>
			<p>and is presumably designed to test the subject's knowledge of 
			vocabulary rather than grammar in English, it requires the test 
			taker to understand issues of transitivity surrounding these four 
			troublesome verbs and the effect intransitivity, mono-transitivity 
			and di-transitivity has on the selection of the correct form.</p>
		
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="indirect" height="133" src="../../images/road_indirect200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h3>Indirect grammar testing</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Even tests of reading skills which are designed to test the 
			learner's ability to unpack a sentence such as:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The appalling and 
			unusual winter weather has caused the extensive delays on the trains</em></span><br />
			require sensitivity to word ordering (what caused what), noun pre- 
			and post-modification as well as the ability to break the clause 
			into its constituents (subject and object noun phrases and verb phrases) and these are, 
			of course, grammatical not skills issues.</p>
			<p>Tests of speaking and writing ability will also require the 
			learners to apply grammatical knowledge, of course, in order to make 
			the messages clear so that the meaning of, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long are you staying?</em><br />
			is understood to refer to the future as well as the present and 
			tense forms are, of course, centrally a grammatical issue.</p>
			<p>Tests of listening, ostensibly designed only to assess the 
			ability to unpack the spoken word, also rely for their successful 
			achievement on a good deal of bottom-up processing of the grammar of 
			the language to make meaning accessible (not to mention a good deal 
			knowledge of the phonological systems of the language).</p>
			<p>The examples above are of ways in which, wittingly or not, many 
			assessment procedures <strong>indirectly</strong> assess the test 
			takers' ability to use grammatical knowledge to access and express 
			meaning.&nbsp; This guide is, however, concerned with ways to test 
			grammatical competence <strong>directly</strong> by designing and 
			administering tests which focus on identifiable grammatical targets.</p>
			<p>Before we can consider how we test grammar, however, we need 
			briefly to define our 
			terms.</p>
			<hr />
		
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="grammar" height="166" src="../../images/dictionary_grammar250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>What to test: what is grammar?</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>By some definitions, the grammar of the language will include its 
			phonology, its lexical systems and its discourse systems so we need 
			to decide from the outset just what our parameters are and where we 
			draw the line.&nbsp; In what follows, we will exemplify testing of 
			grammatical structures and discourse functions but will exclude as far as possible 
			consideration of lexical relationships (such as synonymy, polysemy, 
			collocation and hyponymy) which lie in the realm of vocabulary 
			testing.&nbsp; We will also exclude the testing of phonology and 
			prosody as those forms require a rather different approach.</p>
			<p>In many cases, grammar and lexis can be tested together because 
			it is difficult to establish with any certainty where the dividing 
			lines are.&nbsp; Hence the use of the term lexicogrammar to refer to 
			the systems of the language.&nbsp; There is a guide to what 
			constitutes lexicogrammar on this site, linked below.&nbsp; From 
			that guide, the following examples are extracted to make the point 
			when we consider these four simple clauses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>I am feeling ill</em></li>
				<li><em>I feel ill</em></li>
				<li><em>I am living in Paris</em></li>
				<li><em>I live in Paris</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The issue is not purely grammatical in terms of whether the speaker chooses to use a 
			progressive or simple aspect of the verb.<br />
			Sentences 1. and 2. are, for most purposes, synonymous and it makes 
			little difference whether the speaker chooses to use the verb 
			dynamically, as in 1., or statively, as in 2.<br />
			However, sentences 3. and 4. are different in meaning as well as 
			structure.&nbsp; Sentence 3. implies a temporary condition but 
			sentence 4. implies a permanent one.<br />
			The essence of the difference lies not in the grammar, which is 
			common to both pairs, but in the meaning of the verbs.<br />
			Put another way, the grammar and the meaning of words are not 
			separate systems treatable as discrete units but are interdependent.<br />
			We need, therefore, to design tests of grammar (i.e., the sum of the 
			language's structures) which do not stray too far into the lexical 
			systems but focus on a rule-based system rather than one concerned 
			overly with semantic considerations.<br />
			However, almost any structural area we care to consider will have 
			implications for meaning so, for example, asking a learner to form a 
			relative clause structure from:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman is by the window.&nbsp; The woman 
			told us the story.</em><br />
			and produce:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman who told us the story is by the 
			window.</em><br />
			requires a good deal of fairly sophisticated manipulation of the 
			language's grammatical structure so is quite a good test of whether 
			the test taker has the ability to do that.<br />
			Because the items are essentially synonymous in terms of meaning, 
			the test can be said to be one purely of grammar.<br />
			However, asking a learner to transform:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That man sold us the car</em><br />
			into<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car was sold to us by that man</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were sold the car by that man</em><br />
			requires a similarly sophisticated manipulation but ignores the fact 
			that structures are not selected at random but carry pragmatic 
			implications concerning which constituent of the clause the speaker 
			/ writer intends to mark as important and that can either be <em>the 
			car</em> (because it is placed in the theme position at the 
			beginning), <em>the man</em> (because it is placed in end-focus 
			position and, in speech, probably stressed) or <em>We</em> (because 
			that, too, is fronted to the theme position).</p>
			<p>The moral of all this is that it is <strong>in principle</strong> 
			almost impossible to test grammar discretely unless we ignore the 
			unbreakable connection between grammar and meaning.<br />
			We can do that, of course, but we need to know we are doing it.</p>
			<p>So, ...</p>

			<p>This is not the place to set out the different purposes that 
			tests fulfil, whether they are achievement, diagnostic, proficiency 
			or progress tests.&nbsp; Nor is this the place to discuss the motivating 
			factors that tests sometimes enhance.&nbsp; We are concerned here 
			with testing grammar in particular, not testing in general.<br />
			Guides to general areas of testing and lexis are linked in the list 
			of related guides at the end.</p>
			<p>There are a number of good reasons for testing grammar 
			discretely from other skills and abilities.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Backwash:<br />
				<img alt="wave" height="133" src="../../images/sea_wave200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Explicitly grammar testing often results in teachers and 
				learners paying 
				more attention to its teaching and being more consistent and 
				discerning about what items they focus on.<br />
				Backwash may also have an effect on the learners.&nbsp; If they 
				know that grammar is going to tested discretely, they may 
				well be motivated to review what they have encountered in terms 
				of tense forms, transitivity, discourse and much more and 
				consigned to sparse notes probably jotted down in no particular order.&nbsp; 
				They may even be persuaded to revisit and reorganise their 
				notebooks.</li>
				<li>As a measure of overall ability:<br />
				<img alt="measure" height="133" src="../../images/measure_scales200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Grammatical knowledge has been shown to be an excellent indicator of a 
				learner's overall ability in a language, even more so than 
				lexical knowledge so, for achievement, diagnostic and 
				placement purposes, grammar testing is a useful tool.</li>
				<li>Face validity:<br />
				<img alt="face" height="133" src="../../images/face_blank200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Some learners make very great efforts to understand the grammar 
				of the language, especially those areas of it which differ 
				fundamentally from the grammar of their first languages, because they 
				recognise, quite rightly, that grammatical accuracy, while not 
				always vital for communication, is a required skill.&nbsp; 
				If we do not test grammar in an identifiably discrete way, 
				learners may not feel that their abilities are being fairly 
				assessed.</li>
				<li>Depth vs. breadth:<br />
				<img alt="deep" height="133" src="../../images/staircase_deep200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Testing grammar incidentally, in a mix of other test types 
				concerning, say, reading, writing, listening, 
				speaking and lexical knowledge may give us some measure of the breadth of learners' 
				grammatical 
				knowledge but 
				is unlikely to provide anything like the precision we require if 
				we want to measure the depth of their knowledge of grammar and 
				their ability to apply the rules to their production and 
				reception.&nbsp; 
				This means testing grammar separately, both in terms of 
				understanding and production of language, so we can get some 
				estimation of how well items are known, not just how many are 
				recognised.</li>
				<li>Learning grammar is more than just remembering items:<br />
				<img alt="forget" height="133" src="../../images/forget200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The grammar of any language is a rule-based system which can be 
				learned.&nbsp; Other systems, such as the lexical system and the 
				phonological system are, in this respect, more difficult to 
				acquire, because they are not subject to the same constraints.&nbsp; 
				There are systems, of course, or at least distinct patterns, such as 
				collocational aspects, affixation, multi-word verbs, synonymy, homonymy and 
				so on but, essentially, learning other parts of the language 
				relies more on remembering 
				items and patterns rather than rules.</li>
				<li>Revision and review:<br />
				<img alt="revise" height="133" src="../../images/revise200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Grammar learning involves not only recalling the rules but 
				applying the rules consistently and with the minimum of 
				consideration and thought to the lexicon of the language.&nbsp; 
				In order that the rules can be become automated to some extent, 
				at least, practice is essential.&nbsp; Testing grammar allows 
				for practice, too, and feedback from a test also provides a 
				valuable opportunity to review, recycle and consolidate learners' knowledge.</li>
				<li>The centrality of grammar:<br />
				<img alt="centre" height="133" src="../../images/centre_graphic200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Finally, we need get away from the assumption that teaching and 
				testing grammar are unnecessary in a communicative classroom.&nbsp; 
				Here are two opinions to consider:<p class="auto-style54">
				<span class="style_black">
				<em>... language learning is essentially 
			learning how grammar functions in the achievement of meaning and it 
			is a mistake to suppose otherwise. .... A communicative approach 
			does not involve the rejection of grammar.&nbsp; On the contrary, it 
			involves a recognition of its central mediating role in the use of 
			and learning of language.<br />
				</em><span class="auto-style42">(Widdowson, 1990: 97/8)</span></span></p>
				<p class="noparaspace">and</p>
				<p class="auto-style53">Knowing how to build and use certain

			<p class="auto-style55">When it comes to testing grammar, we need a clear focus on 
			construct validity of our test.&nbsp; That is to say, we need to be 
			sure that we can identify and articulate the targets of every item 
			in our test.&nbsp; For example, in:</p>
			<p class="auto-style54">Fill the gaps with a suitable word:<br />
			John walked ________ the house and _________ the back garden.</p>
			<p class="auto-style56">we have, ostensibly, a test of prepositions and, because they are 
			functional rather than content words, that qualifies as a test of 
			grammar rather than lexis.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the number of items 
			that could sensibly fill the gaps is too large for us to be sure 
			what we are testing.&nbsp; We could, for example, have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John walked into the house and into the back 
			garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John walked by the house and then the back garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John walked past the house and 
			around the back garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John walked to the house and 
			up the back garden<br />
			</em>and quite a few other solutions.<br />
			We can't be sure from an item like this exactly what we are testing.&nbsp; 
			The second possible example answer only contains one preposition 
			because <em>then</em> is an adverb so we are not even sure about the 
			word class target.<br />
			We could increase the construct validity of the test by having 
			something like:<br />
			<img alt="house" height="98" src="../../imagesgraphics/house_garden310.jpg" width="310" /><br />
			to make it clearer what is required because it should evince only:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John walked through the house and into the 
			back garden.</em><br />
			although<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John walked through the house and to the back 
			garden</em><br />
			is still a possible correct alternative which precludes us from 
			testing whether the test takers can distinguish the fact that <em>
			into</em> is a preposition of movement only.<br />
			That is, also, cumbersome and somewhat time-consuming to prepare, 
			especially if we are intending to test a wide range of different 
			sorts of prepositions.</p>

			<p>If achievement testing is the concern, it is obviously important

				items we can sensibly test in the time available.</li>
				<li>We need to make sure that the contexts in which we test the 
				items closely parallel the contexts in which they have been 
				taught.&nbsp; For example, if we have taught a preposition such 
				as <em>beyond</em> in the context of spatial relationships, we 
				cannot test it in a context such as:<p class="auto-style54">Fill the gap with a suitable word:<br />
				That is ________ belief!</p>
				because that is a metaphorical use of the item so we need to design an item such as:<p class="auto-style53">Fill the gap with a suitable word:<br />
				The house is just ________ the hill</p>

			<p>What we need, therefore, is a set of test items which are valid

			</table>
			<p>Not all tests of grammar have to be discrete item tests open to 
			objective marking because the answers are right or wrong with no 
			alternative correct solutions.<br />
			Grammar testing does, however, lend itself to objectively marked 
			discrete item tests because it is much easier to contrive tests of 
			grammar and structure which allow of only one correct answer.&nbsp; 
			This, of course, makes marking more reliable because no judgements 
			have to made.<br />
			Skills testing, by contrast, often relies on holistic marking of 
			learner production even when it is strictly criterion referenced.<br />
			Naturally, one can take a piece of student production, written or 
			spoken and assess the use of grammar within it but it requires quite 
			a sophisticated marking procedure if it is to be fair.<br />
			Grammatical accuracy is often one of the criteria against which 
			students' production is assessed but that is too loose a term for 
			any great precision.&nbsp; It can be broken down, like this, for 
			example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>use of tense forms</li>
				<li>prepositional phrase use</li>
				<li>word ordering</li>
				<li>conjunction and linking</li>
				<li>pronoun use</li>
				<li>verb form use</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on but the list will be different depending on what has 
			been taught and what needs to be discovered.<br />
			For this reason, what follows is a set of test types that are, in 
			general terms at least, reasonably open to objective marking against 
			a single right-or-wrong criterion.</p>

			<p>Grammar is a huge topic and we are usually not trying to test

			Proficiency-only tests are frequently used to set benchmarks (often 
			via public examinations) or as diagnostic or placement tests.&nbsp; 
			Achievement tests are more often used in formative assessment to see 
			how well items have been mastered and what needs revision and

			<p>The items are, of course, cumulative so knowledge of the forms at 
			lower levels is assumed in the higher levels and does not need to be 
			re-tested.</p>
			<p>There are some problems in selection from list such as these 
			(many more of which you will find <em>via</em> a short web search).</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Exhaustiveness:<br />
				No such list can ever be exhaustive especially as one goes up 
				the levels.&nbsp; An exhaustive list of all the possible 
				grammatical structures in English that learners may have 
				encountered would run to thousands of pages.</li>
				<li>Judgements:<br />
				Teachers have continually to make judgements concerning the 
				sorts of grammatical items that their learners need to master so 
				expressions such as <em>SIMPLE PREPOSITIONS </em>which appear at 
				A1 / A2 level need to be interpreted.</li>
				<li>Lexicogrammar:<br />
				As we noted above, meaning can rarely if ever be separated 
				neatly from structure so we also need to test whether our 
				learners can use the forms appropriately rather than merely 
				mechanically.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The moral is to try as far as possible in the selections of items 
			to test to avoid reliance on lists and to 
			focus only on the items which have been taught, or at least 
			encountered, on the course.&nbsp; That is feasible if one is 
			designing a progress or achievement test, less so in designing 
			placement, diagnostic or proficiency tests.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p class="auto-style55"><strong>Gap-fill tests</strong> are simple to design and 
			administer but some care has to be used to make sure they are 
			reliable tests and that the gaps can only be filled with the target 
			item or items.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style54">Fill the gaps with the correct determiner:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			We are having __________ problems with the system than before<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She has __________ interest in it now 
			than she had so won't study economics<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			We only have __________ time but it should be enough<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I have __________ Euros left over from my holiday which you can have</p>
			<p class="noparaspace">which attempts to focus only on a range of 
			four possible determiner choices.&nbsp; Even here, the gaps could be 
			filled with other determiners (and this is a consistent problem with 
			attempts to test determiners and pronouns) so the rubric could be 
			changed to include:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">select from <em>fewer, a few, less, 
			a little</em> 
			and<em> little</em> only.</span><br />
			and that will target the items we have in mind but also makes the test somewhat easier.<br />
			To get around that problem, we can extend the fill items to choose 
			from to include some distractors, ensuring that only the targets 
			will be reasonable solutions so we extend the range to something 
			like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">select four from <em>few, a few, little, 
			much, many, each, every, enough</em> 
			and <em>a little</em></span>.<br />
			which make the test slightly more searching.<br />
			One obvious advantage of gap-fill tests is that they come with 
			ready-made co-text so we can also test trickier items such as 
			aspects of tenses in English.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style54">Fill the gaps with the correct form of the 
			verbs (in brackets):<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We (have) __________ lunch in the garden later 
			today<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She (arrive) __________ so let's start the 
			meeting<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			We (marry) __________ for ten years in October<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They (recognise) __________ her immediately because they 
			(met) __________ before</p>
			<p class="auto-style56">and so on.</p>
			<p class="auto-style55">One way of getting the test taker to settle 
			on a predictable response is to provide only one or two alternative 
			answers and the distracting items can be chosen to be structurally 
			impossible in English.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style54">Cross out the incorrect terms in these 
			sentences:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They denied stealing <strong>anything / nothing</strong><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave the two children a cake <strong>each / 
			every / both</strong><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <strong>hid / concealed / secreted</strong> 
			behind the curtain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came <strong>across / along / by</strong> the old letters 
			in my overcoat</p>
			<p class="auto-style56">The last two examples above are indicative 
			of the difficulty of separating grammar from meaning which was 
			discussed above.&nbsp; In the third example, we have an issue of 
			colligation (specifically transitivity) and in the fourth we need to 
			decide whether phrasal verb structures are lexical or grammatical 
			issues.&nbsp; Arguments can be made on both sides.</p>
			<p class="auto-style55">An alternative workaround for the problem of 
			limiting the test-takers' choices is to provide the first letter of 
			the target item and, to make it even easier, also provide the number 
			of letters in the item.&nbsp; This makes the test quite simple but 
			allows the test designer to be able to claim that only one possible 
			answer is allowed.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style54">Fill the gaps with the correct words:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They denied stealing a _ _ _ _ _ _ _ at all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He photographed h _ _ _ _ _ _ using his phone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have time e____________ to catch the train<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw him last Monday but haven't s__________</p>
			<p>Gap-fill tests in which alternatives or strong hints are provided often test 
			receptive skill (i.e., recognition of the correct item) rather than 
			productive skill.</p>

			</table>
			<p class="auto-style55"><strong>Completion tests</strong> are an 
			allied form but instead of gaps to fill, the test taker is 
			constrained by how a clause or sentence begins.&nbsp; Many 
			structures in English can be tested this way.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style57"><em>Use six or more words to complete these 
			sentences.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's high time 
				_______________________________________________________<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I enjoyed most 
				_________________________________________________<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under no circumstances 
				______________________________________________<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look forward 
				______________________________________________________</em></p>
			<p class="auto-style56">Such tests may constrain the learner to produce a target 
			structure but they require careful marking so that the focus remains 
			on the structure rather than any peripheral matter so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style_black"> It's high time you left for catching the 
			train in time</span></em><br />
			is correct because the test taker has got the target simple past 
			structure right although the form is flawed elsewhere in the 
			response.</p>
			<p class="auto-style55">Completion tests can also be varied to include sections at the 
			beginning or in the middle of a clause or sentence such as in:</p>
			<p class="auto-style53">Fill the gaps with at least three words:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came in order _____________________________ the furniture<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be _____________________________ unless 
			_____________________________ late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _____________________________ providing the money arrives on

					<td class="auto-style3"><h3>Error correction tests</h3></td>

			<p><strong>Error correction tests</strong> can be finely targeted 
			because usually only one item is being tested at a time.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style12"><em>Correct the following sentences:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enjoyed to see the film<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __________________________________________________________<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They travelled for 20 hours so were very tired<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __________________________________________________________<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We abstained to vote in the election<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __________________________________________________________</em></p>
			<p>and so on.<br />
			It is also possible to vary such tests, making them easier by 
			highlighting the error or having paragraphs of text containing a set 
			number of errors for the learners to correct.&nbsp; If you don't 
			tell them how many errors to find in such texts, they can become 
			very difficult and searching tests.<br />
			For example:</p>
		
			<p class="auto-style61">There are eight errors in this paragraph.&nbsp; 
			Underline them and write the correct paragraph:<br /><em>My wife and I spending the whole morning to work in the garden.&nbsp; 
			We cleared the flowering beds by the patio firstly and then planted 
			along some flowers at the side of the shed.&nbsp; After, we took 
			coffee and admired at the results of our work<br />
			</em>Write the correct paragraph here:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __________________________________________________________________________________<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __________________________________________________________________________________<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __________________________________________________________________________________<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __________________________________________________________________________________<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __________________________________________________________________________________</em></p>
			<p>An alternative:</p>
			<p class="auto-style61">There are eight errors in this paragraph,
			<span class="style_underline">underlined</span>.&nbsp; Correct them 
			and write the correct paragraph:<br /><em>My wife and I <span class="style_underline">spending</span> the 
			whole morning <span class="style_underline">to work</span> in the 
			garden.&nbsp; We cleared the <span class="style_underline">flowering</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __________________________________________________________________________________<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __________________________________________________________________________________</em></p>
			<p>Clearly, leaving out either the number of errors of the 
			underlining from the rubric makes the task much more difficult.<br />
			The issue, however, is often to confine the errors to one or two 
			identifiable grammatical targets.&nbsp; In the examples above we 
			have a mix of items including tense and aspect forms, non-finite 
			verb forms, classifier use, sequencers, prepositional use, conjunct 
			use and dependent preposition use.&nbsp; That is probably much too 
			much so a better and more targeted test might be:</p>
			<p class="auto-style61">There are errors with all the prepositions 
			in this.&nbsp; Underline them and write the correct paragraph:<br /><em>My wife and I spent the whole morning working at the garden.&nbsp; 
			We cleared the flower beds between the patio and then planted some

			<p>There is an argument that tests focusing on word formation and 
			morphology lie in the realm of lexis rather than grammar testing but 
			others may consider these matters to be grammatical.&nbsp; We'll 
			include them here.<br />
			Such tests are quite simple to construct and can be very finely 
			targeted to focus only on a small range of morphemes (i.e., the ones 
			that have been taught).<br />
			Here are some examples:</p>
			<p>Prefixation:</p>
			<p class="auto-style54">Add a prefix in the gaps so that the words 
			mean the opposite:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's ___possible to explain this ___fair and 
			___comprehensible decision<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The machine has been ___used and now it ___functions</em></p>
			<p>Suffixation:</p>
			<p class="auto-style53">Add a suffix to the words so that they are 
			in the correct classes:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please supply the inform____ we need 
			immediate____ for the employ___ who work for us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inhabit____ of the Africa____ village were sold into 
			slave____ in the fourteen____ century by trade____ from Europe____ 
			countries</em></p>
			<p>The following suggestions are taken from the guide to testing and 
			assessing vocabulary and focus on similar issues rather more 
			deliberately and obviously.&nbsp; In this, the choices are not 
			contextualised so the focus is firmly on form alone.&nbsp; In the 
			first example, the learners have to populate a grid with some of the target 
			stems or derivatives with a word 
			or a
					<em>
					<img alt="x" class="auto-style17" height="15" src="../../../gfx/cross.png" width="16" /></em> 
			if no possible form exists.&nbsp; Not all the answers rely on 
			affixation so if that is the focus, amendments to the items are in 
			order.<br />
			Like this:</p>
			<p class="auto-style18">Fill the gaps with the correct form of the 
			words.&nbsp; Put a
					<em>
					<img alt="x" class="auto-style17" height="15" src="../../../gfx/cross.png" width="16" /></em> 
			where it is not possible to make a word.<br />
			The first one is an example.</p>

			</table>
			<p class="auto-style55">Multiple-choice tests are a very common way 
			to test grammar (and much else, of course) and can be very flexible 
			as well as finely targeted.<br />
			The trick lies in choosing the distractors more than in designing 
			the item itself because they need to be believable but not 
			alternative correct answers if we are concerned to have only one 
			right answer per item.<br />
			It is possible, of course, deliberately to construct items with more 
			than one correct answer but that slightly complicates marking and 
			may confuse learners unused to such a variation in format.<br />
			For example 1:</p>
			<p class="auto-style58">Choose the item 
			to fill the gap in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left _________ catch her bus</em></p>
			<ol class="auto-style9">
				<li>because</li>
				<li>for</li>
				<li>from</li>
				<li>to</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style55">For example 2:</p>
			<p class="auto-style58">Choose the sentence which is correct:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style9">
				<li>I hope see you</li>
				<li>I hope seeing you</li>
				<li>I hope to see you</li>
				<li>I hope to seeing you</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style55">For example 3:</p>
			<p class="auto-style58">Choose the <strong>wrong</strong> sentence:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style9">
				<li>She bought a drink for us</li>
				<li>She bought us a drink</li>
				<li>She bought a drink to us</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style55">For example 4:</p>
			<p class="auto-style58">Choose the <strong>two correct items</strong> 
			to complete the sentence:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left without _______________________</em></p>
			<ol class="auto-style9">
				<li>her coat</li>
				<li>saying goodbye</li>
				<li>to speak to me</li>
				<li>she had her money</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style55">For example 5:</p>
			<p class="auto-style58">Choose the correct tense for the verb in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If she hadn't come so late she 
			_________________ the dancers</em></p>
			<ol class="auto-style9">
				<li>would see</li>
				<li>would have seen</li>
				<li>will have seen</li>
				<li>saw</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you can see, multiple-choice formats for items can be very 
			variable and introduce a little variety into a test.<br />
			However, unlike many test items such as gap-fills and skeleton 
			tasks, they focus almost entirely on recognition of a correct or 
			incorrect forms rather than testing the ability to use the grammar.</p>

			<p class="auto-style55"><strong>Rearrangement tests </strong>are 
			infrequently used but can be quite finely targeted on certain types 
			of construction in English.&nbsp; They will not be useable for a 
			very wide range, however.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style58"><em>Put the following phrases in the right order 
			to make a good sentence:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			10<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

			to go<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			we had<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			without<br />
			___________________________________________________________________________________</em></p>
			<p>As you can see, such tasks can be very exacting but there is a 
			reliability problem insofar as they require multiple grammatical 
			decisions from the test takers.<br />
			The issue with such tests is to choose the items carefully.&nbsp; 
			Separating out individual words is a very exacting task but the item 
			can be made somewhat easier (and theoretically more defensible) if 
			the focus is on phrases rather than words so, instead of breaking:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man came into the bar and sat in the 
			corner</em><br />
			into 12 separate words as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the</em><br />
			a more useful test of syntax is to break it into six phrases 
			representing sense units as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into the bar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the old man</em><br />
			Naturally, however, if the targets of the test include the 
			construction of prepositional phrases, the sentence can be broken 
			down differently as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the old man came<br />
			</em>in which we still have only six items to arrange and the focus 
			is firmly on prepositions referring to place or movement.</p>

			<p class="auto-style55"><strong>Combination tests </strong>also have 
			limited flexibility in terms of the targets that are most suitable

			He failed the examination.&nbsp; He worked very hard.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __________________________________________________________</em></p>
			<p class="auto-style55">Such tests are productive because the test 
			taker has to invent a virtually new sentence but there is often more 
			than one way to join two clauses by combining them into a single

			<p class="auto-style60">Make one sentence from the two you are
