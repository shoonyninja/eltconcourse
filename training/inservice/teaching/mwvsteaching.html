	<h1>Teaching multi-word verbs (MWVs)</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="multi-word verbs" height="168" src="../../imagesgraphics/mwvscloud.JPG" width="263" /></p>
		<p>If you have followed the language analysis
		<a href="../verbs/mwvs.html">guide to multi-word verbs</a> you will 
		be aware that it is not always easy to disentangle the 3 sorts of these:</p>
		<ul class="auto-style21">
			<li><strong>phrasal verbs </strong>which can be intransitive (e.g.,
			<em>Look out!</em>) or transitive and must be separated by the 
			pronoun (e.g.,<em> look it up</em>)</li>
			<li><strong>prepositional verbs </strong>which are not separable and 
			can be transitive (e.g., <em>account for</em>) or transitive and 
			intransitive, with or without the preposition (e.g., <em>insist</em> 
			and<em> insist on</em>)</li>
			<li><strong>phrasal-prepositional verbs</strong> which work 
			similarly (e.g., <em>run out of, look forward to</em>)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Before you go on, 
		you should have the distinctions clear in your head.<br />
		You should also be clear why the verb in <em>He turned down the lane</em> 
		is not a multi-word verb but the one in <em>He turned down the offer</em> 
		is.<br />
		You have to understand this area before you can hope to teach it 
		successfully.</p>

			</table>
		<p>One obvious reason is that lots of languages don't have them.<br />
		Something like MWVs do exist in a number of Germanic languages (of which 
		English is one) so learners with those languages will not be surprised 
		by them.&nbsp; Usually, in these languages, these sorts of verbs are 
		simply called separable verbs.&nbsp; There is some evidence of a few 
		verb + particle combinations in Polish, Italian, Spanish and French but 
		they are not of the type of complexity and commonness we find in 
		English.<br />
		Other languages (Japanese and Hindi, for example) do exhibit something 
		called compound verbs made up of two related words but they are a far 
		cry from multi-word verbs in English.<br />
		In summary, <strong>most</strong> learners of English will find MWVs novel and taxing to 
		learn.</p>

		analysis guide:</p>

				<li>
				<strong>Separability</strong><br />
				We can have<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled up the lever<br />
				</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled 
				the lever up<br />
				</em>but<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He pushed it for<br />
				</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He 
				pushed over them<br />
				</em>are not possible (and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?He pushed away 
				the boat<br />
				</em>is a slightly doubtful case.<br />
				Learners have to know a) what sorts of MWVs are separable and b) 
				what can be used to separate the verb from its particle.<br />
				A phrasal verb, strictly speaking, must be separated from its 
				particle when the object is a pronoun.&nbsp; We can't have<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*He looked up it in the dictionary<br />
				</em>When the object is 
				not a pronoun, the verb can optionally be separated so we can 
				have either<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked the word up<br />
				</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked up 
				the word</em>.<br />
				A prepositional verb, on the other hand, is not separated from 
				its particle by the object at all so we can't have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He looked 
				it at<br />
				</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He looked the timetable at<br />
				</em>The 
				same applies to phrasal-prepositional verbs such as <em>run out 
				of</em>.<br />
				That's just hard to learn.<br />
				The result of the complication is that learners will separate 
				when they shouldn't or not separate when they should.</li>
				<li>
				<strong>Transitivity</strong><br />
				We can have<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled up the lever<br />
				</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled up 
				at the parking space<br />
				</em>but intransitivity in the second case changes the verb's 
				meaning.<br />
				Intransitive phrasal verbs (such as those in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plane took 
				off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car broke down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get up early<br />
				</em>etc.) are possibly 
				easier to learn because there's no problem with separability of 
				course, but remembering which particle goes with which for each 
				meaning is still difficult.&nbsp; There is a problem with the 
				inappropriate insertion of adverbs:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He's growing quickly up</em><br />
				However, prepositional verbs are a different matter.<br />
				Some are always transitive and take their particle with them 
				wherever they go.&nbsp; For example, <em>rely on, account for</em> 
				and <em>long for</em> are always transitive and occur with the 
				prepositions.<br />
				Others are less accommodating.&nbsp; For example, <em>insist, object</em> 
				and <em>complain</em> can be used intransitively<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I</em> <em>insisted</em> 
				/ <em>objected</em> / <em>complained<br />
				</em>but when they take an 
				object, learners need to remember which preposition to tack on 
				to the verb (<em>on, to, about</em>, respectively).<br />
				One result of this complication is that learners may pick the 
				wrong particle.&nbsp; If I can say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inscription wore away<br />
				</em>why can't I say<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The painkiller wore away</em>?<br />
				Another result is that learners will use intransitive verbs 
				transitively<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I insisted the changes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I argued him<br />
				</em>and the other way around<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I relied for the information<br />
				</em>Often, this is because transitivity is variable across even 
				closely related languages.<br />
				To add fuel to the fire, many verbs can be used both ways.&nbsp; 
				For example, something can<em> blow up</em> and you can <em>blow 
				something up</em>.&nbsp; Some will also change the meaning when 
				transitivity changes: <em>work out</em> means to discover 
				something when it's transitive but means either <em>exercise</em> or 
				<em>succeed</em> when it's used intransitively.</li>
				<li>
				<strong>Pronunciation</strong><br />
				In MWVs we do not usually reduce the vowel in the particle to 
				its weak form.&nbsp; Compare the pronunciation of <em>for</em> 
				in<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waited for ages<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waited for his friend</em>.</li>
				<li>
				<strong>Where does the verb stop?</strong><br />
				It's not always easy for learners to identify which bit is the 
				MWV and which is a following prepositional phrase.&nbsp; In 
				something like<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled up by the church<br />
				</em>some might 
				be tempted to try to learn <em>pull up by</em> as a MWV and 
				produce<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He pulled up by outside<br />
				</em>After all, we 
				can have three-part phrasal-prepositional verbs such as <em>get 
				on with, stick up for</em> and <em>put up with</em> so it's not 
				a mysterious error.&nbsp; The reason for it is that the learner 
				has not recognised that <em>by the church</em> is a prepositional 
				phrase replaceable by many others (<em>in the garden, on the 
				bridge, outside the police station</em> etc.) and <em>up</em> 
				here is an adverb particle.&nbsp; Telling learners about 
				prepositions and adverbs is rarely productive.&nbsp; It's better 
				to make sure that the presentation and practice make the 
				distinctions clear &ndash; context and co-text, yet again.</li>
				<li>
				<strong>Where <em>is</em> the verb?</strong><br />
				This appears under Form but could just as well be under Meaning.&nbsp; 
				Consider a sentence like<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had to give their dream of 
				saving up enough money to buy their first house in London up<br />
				</em>The main verb here is <em>give up</em> but the object (<em>the 
				dream</em>) separates the particle from the verb by 14 words.&nbsp; 
				There's also another MWV in the sentence to confuse the learner.</li>

			<ol class="auto-style14">
				<li>
				<strong>Noncompositionality</strong><br />
				That's a nice, long technical word
				which simply means that many MWVs cannot be understood by 
				knowing the meaning of the verb and the usual significance of 
				the particle.&nbsp; This is not always true: some MWVs are 
				transparent in meaning and some are wholly opaque but most fall 
				somewhere in between.<br />
				For example,<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the cat<br />
				</em>can be readily understood, as can<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Load up the car<br />
				</em>but<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't put up with it<br />
				</em>is probably completely 
				opaque and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand by your decision<br />
				</em>is only interpreted with some 
				understanding of metaphorical use.&nbsp; The fact of the matter 
				is that most so-called opaque meanings can be traced to a 
				more transparent use of the MWV, often a prepositional verb 
				which has evolved other meanings.</li>
				<li>
				<strong>Polysemy</strong><br />
				While not unique to MWVs, of course, multiple meanings of a 
				single item can cause problems.&nbsp; For example, <em>give in</em> can 
				be used transitively to mean <em>hand in</em> (an essay, for example) and 
				intransitively to mean <em>surrender</em>.&nbsp; In the same way, we can 
				have<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll break down the figures<br />
				</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car broke down<br />
				</em>This problem is also one of form because the 
				meaning in which the verb is used may affect transitivity and 
				separability.&nbsp; See above under transitivity for another 
				example.<br />
				This also applies to the particles.&nbsp; For example, the 
				distinction between <em>I give up</em> and <em>I give in</em> is 
				sometimes so subtle as to be almost invisible.</li>
				<li>
				<strong>Style</strong><br />
				It is often stated that MWVs are stylistically less formal than 
				any one-word equivalents.&nbsp; That's often true but not always 
				the case.&nbsp; Corpus research has done much to explode this 
				myth.&nbsp; MWVs appear in even the most formal academic texts 
				and, in any case, there isn't always a one-word equivalent for 
				some MWVs.&nbsp; For example, what one-word equivalent can you 
				think of for <em>slow down, take off </em>(clothes)<em>, deal 
				with, consist of</em>?<br />
				A term such as <em>slow 
				down</em>, for example, is just as likely to appear in an 
				academic text as an informal text.&nbsp; In fact, <em>decelerate</em>, 
				is really very uncommon.&nbsp; The truth of the matter is that 
				MWVs are not some kind of substandard colloquialisms; they are 
				important and indispensable lexemes in their own right.<br />
				Learners who have been told that MWVs are always informal may be 
				tempted to produce pompous prose such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She donned her 
				track suit<br />
				</em>rather than using <em>put on</em> in a natural 
				way.<br />
				On the other hand, in an effort to substitute a one-word 
				equivalent and avoid using a MWV at all, learners can also sound 
				overly formal and distant.<br />
				The moral: don't give learners half-truths.&nbsp; Treat each 
				item in terms of its style as you would for any lexis.</li>
				<li>
				<strong>Collocation</strong><br />
				Allied to the style issue is the one of collocation.&nbsp; Many 
				MWVs and their one-word 'equivalents' collocate very 
				differently.&nbsp; For example, this is OK:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He decelerated 
				coming into the hairpin<br />
				</em>but this is not acceptable:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He 
				knew he was talking too fast for me to understand so he 
				decelerated<br />
				</em>As another example, you can <em>call off</em> 
				a wedding, a party, a meeting and a trip but you can't <em>call 
				off</em> a holiday or a private lesson.&nbsp; Then you have to 
				use <em>cancel</em>.</li>

				<p>There's quite a strong argument in favour of not deliberately 
				focusing on MWVs at all but treating them as and when they arise 
				in the same way as any other lexeme.&nbsp; This view is based on 
				some underlying beliefs:</p>
				<ol class="auto-style16">
					<li>that MWVs are so complex in form and meaning that any 
					lesson which attempts to cover the ground is doomed to fail</li>
					<li>that learners will become disheartened and demoralised 
					by the sheer number of form and meaning complexities</li>
					<li>that focusing on a single verb such as <em>set</em> and then 
					adding particles to it (<em>set off, set up, set by </em>etc.) will actually encourage confusion</li>
					<li>that, equally, focusing on a particle and then on verbs 
					that go with it (<em>set down, bring down, put down, hold 
					down</em> etc.) will be confusing</li>
				</ol>
				<p>What counter arguments can you develop for these four views?&nbsp;

				<p><span class="auto-style14">Here are some thoughts:</span></p>
					<ol class="auto-style17">
						<li>Yes, MWVs are complex but so are a number of 
						structures in every language (tense forms and affixation rules in English, cases in German, irregular verbs in Greek
						 etc.) but that doesn't stop you 
						teaching them.&nbsp; It's just a matter of breaking 
						things down and teaching bit by bit</li>
						<li>If this is true, then we wouldn't teach words at all.&nbsp; 
						There are millions of them and they nearly all have associated 
						grammar and collocational issues</li>
						<li>This may be true if you overdo it (as some coursebooks do) but teaching sets 
						such as <em>drive off, drive back, drive away, drive 
						over, drive by</em> etc. makes perfect sense in terms of 
						how the brain stores concepts together</li>
						<li>But actually, as we saw, the particles often do have 
						similar meanings with a range of verbs.&nbsp; For 
						example, <em>off</em> is usually associated with a 
						concept of detachment or separation in verbs like <em>
						break off</em> (a piece), <em>put off</em> (a meeting),
						<em>switch off</em> (a light), <em>turn off </em>(a 
						tap), <em>take off</em> (leave the ground), <em>call off</em> 
						(a dog), <em>clear off</em> (go away) etc.</li>
					</ol>
					</div>
					<p>Even if you take the first view, you are going to have to deal 
					with MWVs in some way or other.&nbsp; If you take the second 
					view, i.e., that we should focus on this important and 
					difficult area explicitly, then we need some strategies to 
					help.&nbsp; Here are some ideas.</p>

				<p>There's little point in planning a lesson which includes 
				separable, transitive, prepositional, phrasal and 
				phrasal-prepositional verbs all in the same materials &ndash; 
				that <em>will</em> confuse your learners.&nbsp; So introduce 
				verbs which share formal characteristics together.</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Dealing with separability and intransitivity</strong>.<br />
					Idea 1<br />
					You could focus a lesson on transitive prepositional 
				verbs such as <em>abstain from, comment on, quarrel about, react 
				to </em>and <em>talk about</em> in a lesson on the topic of 
				friends meeting and talking to plan an event or a formal meeting to discuss a 
				local problem or whatever.&nbsp; It's not difficult to develop a 
				text containing them if the context is clear.&nbsp; For 
					example:<br />
					<span class="auto-style14"><em>They met to </em> </span>
					<span class="auto-style18"><em>talk about</em></span><span class="auto-style14"><em> 
					the party they were planning for John's 50th but soon began
					</em>
					</span><span class="auto-style18"><em>quarrelling about</em></span><span class="auto-style14"><em> 
					whether it should be a surprise or not.&nbsp; Mary, in 
					particular </em> </span><span class="auto-style18"><em>reacted badly 
					to </em> </span><span class="auto-style14"><em>the idea saying that 
					John hated being </em> </span><span class="auto-style18">
					<em>surprised 
					by</em></span><span class="auto-style14"><em> events like this ...</em></span> 
					etc.<br />All these <span class="style_underline">
					prepositional</span> verbs share a common structure: they are both 
					<strong>transitive</strong> and <strong>inseparable</strong>.&nbsp; Your 
				learners will not be tempted into mistakes such as <em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They 
				talked the problem about<br />
					</em>by analogy with a transitive 
				separable verb such as in<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They tossed the ball about</em>.</li>
					<li><strong>Dealing with separability and intransitivity</strong>.<br />
					Idea 2<br />
					Equally, you could plan a lesson which does focus on 
					separability of transitive MWVs such as <em>call off, think 
					through, call up, count in, pass on, set up </em>etc. and 
					the same idea of planning a party for someone would work 
					well as a topic to hang it on along the lines of:<span class="auto-style14"><em><br />
					They decided not to </em> </span>
					<span class="auto-style19"><em>give</em></span><em><span class="auto-style14"> 
					the party idea </span><span class="auto-style19">up</span><span class="auto-style14"> 
					but to </span> </em><span class="auto-style19"><em>set</em></span><span class="auto-style14"><em> 
					it </em> </span><span class="auto-style19"><em>up</em></span><span class="auto-style14"><em> 
					for the following Saturday.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they had to
					</em>
					</span><span class="auto-style19"><em>call</em></span><span class="auto-style14"><em> 
					the event </em> </span><span class="auto-style19"><em>off</em></span><span class="auto-style14"><em> 
					when it was clear ... </em> </span>etc.<br />
					All these <span class="style_underline">phrasal</span> verbs share a common structure: they are both 
					<strong>transitive</strong> and <strong>separable</strong>.</li>
					<li><strong>Dealing with noncompositionality</strong>.<br />
					Idea 
					1<br />
					Focus on a particle, such as the example of <em>off</em> 
					above, and choose to introduce verbs which show the gradual 
					transition from literal to metaphorical meaning.<br />
					For 
					example, for the idea of progress towards a target, you 
					could select <em>get on</em>, then <em>go on</em>, then <em>
					carry on</em>, then <em>keep on</em>, then <em>move on </em>
					then<em> hurry on</em>.&nbsp; The idea that <em>on</em> 
					often has the sense of towards a goal (but some meanings are slightly 
					metaphorical) is easy to grasp.<br />
					Later, you could select another meaning of <em>on</em>, that 
					of connection or joining, and introduce <em>tie on, stick on, 
					turn on, switch on, hold on</em> etc.&nbsp; If you look at 
					the final table in the analysis guide, you'll find some more 
					candidates.<br />
					Although it looks nice, the following sort of presentation 
					is flawed<br />
					<img alt="out" height="161" src="../../imagesgraphics/out.png" width="250" /><br />
					for two reasons:<br />
					a) we actually have multiple meanings of 
					the particle <em>out</em> (exit, emerge, clearness, 
					disappearance) and<br />
					b) there's no exemplification or context 
					to help the learners.<br />
					There's nothing wrong in principle with this kind of 
					presentation or in getting your students to construct one 
					but you have to maintain focus and contextualise with 
					examples.&nbsp; It would be better like this<br />
					<img alt="out 2" height="163" src="../../imagesgraphics/out2.png" width="250" /><br />
					because here we have one meaning only of <em>out</em> (the 
					idea of making something disappear or go away) and there are 
					examples to help the learners.</li>
					<li><strong>Dealing with noncompositionality</strong>.<br />
					Idea 
					2<br />
					If you focus on a verb rather than a particle then you 
					need to show the connected meanings of the particles in the 
					same way.&nbsp; You can, for example use the sense of <em>
					break</em> (as in destroy or interrupt) to show how the 
					particles alter its meaning with, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break into a 
					meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break out of a meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break up a meeting<br />
					</em>and 
					then go on to try a different verb such as <em>call</em> 
					with<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call someone up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call on someone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call someone in<br />
					</em>etc.&nbsp; There are (in)separability issues with this 
					approach with both verbs.<br />
					You can use the same kind of presentation (or get your 
					learners to construct one) as above but again, you need to 
					keep the focus and exemplify.</li>
					<li><strong>Dealing with polysemy</strong><br />
					Try to make sure that the materials you use don't confuse, 
					especially at early stages.&nbsp; It may be tempting to add, 
					when explaining<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car broke down<br />
					</em>"But understand 
					that this verb can be used with an object to mean something 
					completely different, you know."<br />
					That's very rarely 
					helpful.&nbsp; Make sure you have context and co-text to 
					help understanding.</li>
					<li><strong>Dealing with collocation and style</strong><br />
					Not telling learners that MWVs are always informal is a good 
					beginning (see above).<br />
					When you do use the one-word equivalent to explain, e.g., 
					the meaning of <em>speed up</em> as 
					<em>accelerate</em>, make sure that you focus on the fact that you 
					can't accelerate your speaking or reading but you can 
					accelerate a car or an object in a physics lesson.</li>
					<li><strong>Remembering the particles</strong><br />
					Intransitive phrasal verbs and transitive prepositional 
					verbs are not separable.&nbsp; In the first case, of course, 
					because they have no object.&nbsp; This means they can be 
					taught, practised and remembered as single items.<br />
					There's no need to teach people that<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wake up at six 
					every morning<br />
					</em>is an example of <em>wake</em> plus an 
					adverb particle.&nbsp; It, along with a host of other verbs 
					can be taught as a single word with a space in the middle.<br />
					Equally, <em>rely on, account for, talk about</em> etc. can 
					be taught and practised as if they were single words.<br />
					Doing this may help your learners not to separate the verbs 
					with other adverbs and say things like<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I get early up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She relies definitely on him<br />
					</em>and so on.<br />
					It is
					<span class="style_underline">possible</span> to use adverbs 
					in this way <em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked loudly about ...<br />
					</em>but never
					<span class="style_underline">necessary</span> so why 
					confuse people when they are acquiring the system?&nbsp; 
					Such subtleties can wait till advanced levels (or even 
					longer).</li>
					<li><strong>Finding the verb</strong>.<br />
					Idea 1<br />
					If you are dealing with a complex expression such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
					dropped me off by the cinema<br />
					</em>get 
					students to notice the difference between a preposition 
					introducing a phrase such as <em>by the </em>cinema and get 
					them to come up with alternatives (<em>near, next to, 
					opposite the cinema</em> etc.).<br />
					That will help them to 
					understand that <em>drop off</em> is actually the verb they 
					should learn.</li>
					<li><strong>Finding the verb</strong>.<br />
					Idea 2<br />
					The problem of verbs being separated by lots of text from 
					their adverb such as the example above<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had to give 
					their dream of saving up enough money to buy their first 
					house in London up<br />
					</em>is not easy to tackle but once the 
					learners are alerted to the fact that the meaning of the 
					main verb is <em>relinquish</em>, they can begin to look for the MWV 
					that they know.&nbsp; Exposure to already known MWVs in this 
					kind of environment is useful but if the MWV is not known 
					it's far too challenging to find it.&nbsp; Build up the 
					challenge slowly and focus on simple ones that are already 
					familiar in sentences such as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_black">handed</span> his essay and mine
					<span class="style_black">in</span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					He <span class="style_black">handed</span> his essay and the ones that his classmates gave 
					him <span class="style_black">in</span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					He <span class="style_black">gave</span> all the sweets and chocolate
					<span class="style_black">away</span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					He <span class="style_black">gave</span> all the sweets, the chocolate, the cakes and most of 
					the rest of the food <span class="style_black">away</span><br />
					</em>An alternative is to start with a 'normal' ordering 
					such as<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					They had to give up their dream of saving up 
					enough money to buy their first house in London<br />
					</em>and 
					then focus on the fact that it is possible to move the 
					particle to the end without changing the meaning.&nbsp; Then 
					get the students to do it with, e.g., a sentence or two like<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					He pointed out the new buildings and many of the other 
					surprising changes in the city to me.<br />
					</em>Practice of this sort will help learners to avoid 
					panicking when they are reading texts that do this and to 
					keep calm and look for the particle if the verb alone is 
					making no sense.</li>

					<li>MWVs, despite what is said above under problems of style, are 
				very common in spoken communication and it's tempting only to 
				introduce and practise them that way.&nbsp; Remember, however, that they are 
				difficult, especially for learners whose languages don't use 
				them (i.e., the majority) so it makes sense to introduce them 
				and practise them in writing before asking people to produce 
				them orally.<br />Learners need space and time to absorb hard concepts and forms.</li>
					<li>Make sure that what you are dealing with actually
					<strong>is</strong> a MWV.&nbsp; We started the analysis in 
					the guide with the distinction between<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn down the 
					lane<br />
					</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn down the offer</em>.<br />
					Look carefully at lexemes that come up in a text or in a 
					lesson and ask yourself if it really is a MWV.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked across the road<br />
					</em>is <strong>not</strong> an instance of a 
					MWV; it is the verb <em>walk</em> followed by a 
					prepositional phrase telling you where and could be replaced 
					with <em>through the park, down the street, up the hill, 
					over the bridge</em> and many other phrases.<br />
					However, in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked me through the procedure<br />
					</em>we
					<strong>are</strong> dealing with a MWV, meaning to show or 
					guide, and if we substitute something else we change the 
					meaning of the verb, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked me over the road</em> 
					/ <em>through the park<br />
					</em>meaning helped me or accompanied me.<br />
					If you don't do this, you will actually be wasting your learners' time getting them to remember <em>
					walk across</em> as if it were a single lexeme rather than 
					being able to deploy prepositional phrases to say what they 
					mean.</li>

					Does it jumble up

					<li>If it focuses on a verb, does it make the meaning clear?<br />
					Does it use the verb to cover many different meanings?</li>
					<li>If it focuses on particles, does it do so in a way which 
					shows a single significance, such as connection or superior 
					relationship etc. which will help learners to grasp its 
					essential meaning?<br />
					Does it jumble, say,<em> up</em> to 
					mean 'higher' (<em>bring up, hold up, look up to, sit up, set 
					up</em> etc.) with<em> up</em> meaning 'complete' as in <em>
					clean up, blow up, cover up, finish up, clear up, lock up</em> 
					and <em>wash up</em>?</li>
