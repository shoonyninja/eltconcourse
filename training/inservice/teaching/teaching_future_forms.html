		through.</p>
		<p>If you are at all unsure about the three main uses of <em>going to,</em> 
		the three main uses of <em>will </em>and the way the present progressive 
		and simple forms are used to talk about the future, 
		you should go to

		<ol class="style_brown">
			<li><em>I'll be at the meeting this afternoon at 4.<br />
			</em>This is clearly an expression of willingness and a promise to 
			fulfil an arrangement rather than anything else.&nbsp; 
			It's <strong>not</strong> a prediction in the accepted use of the term but we have to 
			use <em>will/shall</em> in this case because we have a stative use 
			of the verb <em>be</em>.<br />
			For an arrangement like this with a 
			dynamically used verb, we would normally select the present 
			progressive:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm presenting the report at the meeting<br />
			</em>for 
			example.<br />
			However, it is unlikely to cause a communication 
			problem or sound odd if we choose to say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to present 
			the report at the meeting<br />
			</em>is it?<br />
			<strong>All three of these forms can all be used to talk about 
			arrangements quite naturally because <span class="style_underline">
			arrangements are premised on people's <em>current</em> willingness 
			and ability</span>.</strong></li>
			<li><em>We're having a meeting at 4.<br />
			</em>This is a example of what is usually called the arranged future 
			with the present progressive.&nbsp; However, here there is one 
			oddity: the verb <em>have</em> is being used dynamically (to mean 
			something like <em>hold</em>) so we can use the progressive form.&nbsp; 
			If you try to make <em>the meeting </em>the subject, the problem 
			reveals itself:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *There is being a meeting at 4<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The meeting is 
			being at 4<br />
			</em>The passive is also a problem: we can have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting is being held at 4<br />
			</em>but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The meeting is 
			being had at 4<br />
			</em>Normally, in fact, we select the simple 
			present to do this:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting is at 4<br />
			</em>It is also 
			possible to have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There'll be a meeting at 4<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll have a 
			meeting at 4<br />
			</em>especially if 
			the information about the arrangement is new to the hearer and there 
			is a clear prediction.<br />
			All three forms can be used to talk about arrangements but a 4th 
			form, the present simple, is preferred with the verb <em>be</em>, and 
			can, in fact, be used for many arrangements, especially formal ones:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This meeting is / takes place at 4 / in Room 3 / with her in the 
			chair<br />
			</em>etc.&nbsp; This is not quite the same as a 
			timetabled event because it is not a repeated circumstance.&nbsp; It 
			could be a one-off event.<br />
			<strong>We can use all 4 forms to talk about arranged events.</strong></li>
			<li><em>I'm going to come to the meeting at 4.<br /></em>Traditionally, the 
			<em>going to </em>formulation is explained 
			as being used for <strong>current</strong> intentions.&nbsp; It may have that flavour here 
			but it needn't.&nbsp; This form is also used to talk about arranged 
			events and actions.&nbsp; If the speaker had said:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll come to 
			the meeting at 4<br />
			</em>the meaning shows willingness.<br />We can also use the <em>going to</em> and
			<em>will</em> structures to talk about timetables, incidentally:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train's 
			going to arrive on Platform 6 at 4:15<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train will arrive on 
			Platform 6 at 4:15<br />
			</em>Those are both predictions <strong>
			based on</strong> the <strong>present</strong> timetable.</li>
			<li><em>I'm going fishing alone tomorrow.<br />
			</em>This is the use of the present progressive to talk about the 
			future but it is probably not an arranged event because of the word
			<em>alone</em>.&nbsp; The issue here is twofold:<ol class="auto-style4">
				<li>The use of the present progressive for intentions is often 
				preferred with the verb <em>go</em> to avoid the clumsy <em>
				going to go fishing</em> formulation.</li>
				<li>We can use the present progressive to talk 
				about present intentions rather than arrangements because it's not 
				always clear what level of arrangement is meant and how firmly 
				fixed it is.&nbsp; For example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I'm taking a holiday in 
				Spain where I'm going to use a hire car to get around<br />
				</em>In that sentence we cannot be sure one way or the other whether the hire 
				car has actually been booked.&nbsp; It may be an arrangement or 
				it may be a current intention.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><em>I'll have my phone with me if you need anything.<br />
			</em>You may be tempted to see this as the conventional use of <em>
			will/shall</em> to express a condition, but it isn't, actually.&nbsp; 
			The sentence means something like<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll have my phone with me so 
			call me in the event that you need anything.<br />
			</em>Having the phone with me is not contingent on your needing 
			anything because it is clear that this will happen whatever the 
			circumstances.&nbsp; It is not, therefore, a conditional sentence at 
			all in the proper sense.<br />The form 
			here is used to show willingness to be 
			contacted.<br />
			It is often hard to distinguish between <em>will/shall</em> to 
			express willingness:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll help you do this<br />
			</em>and the form of
			<em>going to</em> to mean something very similar:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to 
			help you do this<br />
			</em>The reason for this is that both <em>will</em> and <em>going to</em> 
			can function as primary auxiliary verbs to form a prospective tense 
			aspect just as <em>have</em> and <em>be</em> function to form, 
			respectively, a perfect aspect and a progressive one.&nbsp; 
			Confusing the modal auxiliary function of <em>will</em> with its 
			function as a primary auxiliary verb is not helpful.</li>
			<li><em>He's going to be delighted with the result.</em></li>
			<li><em>He'll be delighted with the result.<br />
			</em>It's almost impossible to distinguish a difference in meaning 
			between 6. and 7.<br />
			Both are clearly predictions and both are 
			based on some knowledge of the nature of <em>the result</em> and some knowledge of the 
			person in question.<br />
			<strong>Both </strong><em><strong>going to</strong></em><strong> and
			</strong><em><strong>will/shall</strong></em><strong> can be used 
			for predictions based on experience.</strong></li>
			<li><em>She's having a birthday party in June.</em></li>
			<li><em>She's having a baby in June.<br />
			</em>8. is probably a current arrangement of some sort (although it could 
			only be her intention and no invitations have been sent).<br />
			9., however, is not an arrangement in any accepted sense and we 
			could use the predictive future with <em>will</em> to express the same 
			idea.<br />
			We could also say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's going to have a baby in June<br />
			</em>although that clearly has nothing to do with intentionality because 
			it is a prediction.</li>
		</ol>
			<p>You can visualise the overlap something like this:</p>
		</div>
		<p>
		<img alt="overlap" height="460" src="../../imagesgraphics/overlapping_futures.png" width="620" /></p>
		<p>(For more on the times when the progressive form of the present and 
		the going to structure are <strong>not</strong> interchangeable, see
		<a href="../../tenses/tenses_aspects/present_time.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
		talking about the present</a> (new tab).&nbsp; The discussion appears there 
		because both forms are present tenses relating to future events or 
		states.)</p>
		<p>This is not an easy area to understand, is it?<br />
		It can be unravelled slightly by considering two sorts of futures 
		rather than a lot of conflicting and overlapping forms.<br />

		<p>When we say something like<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The temperature will drop to zero tonight<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The train arrives at 6<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		They are staying for a week<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		It's going to rain<br />
		</em>etc.<br />
		we are referring to things outside our current control.&nbsp; They are
		<strong>extrinsic</strong> to us.&nbsp; For futures of these sorts, the 
		form we choose depends on the nature of the event.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>If we are talking about a simple fact, we'll select <em>will</em> or the 
		present simple:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be wet on the road because it's been raining.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She'll be 97 next birthday<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The plane arrives at 7<br /></em>etc.</li>
				<li>If we are talking about a prediction based on current or past evidence, we'll often 
		select the <em>going to</em> form:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've seen the forecast and the weather's going to turn nasty<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		He's going to win because he's the fastest</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You father is going to be very angry 
				about that</em><br />etc.</li>
				<li>If we are talking about something fixed and arranged, we'll often select 
		the progressive form:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's studying Latin next year at Oxford<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		She's taking the train because her car's in the garage</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm taking my annual leave in July</em><br />etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="see" height="133" src="../../images/eye_look_forward200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h3>The future as we see it</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>This is a form of modality because it concerns how the speaker 
		perceives an event.&nbsp; This is where the <em>going to</em> future is 
		common because it concerns <strong>intrinsic</strong> matters.&nbsp; For 
		example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm spending my holiday in Scotland where I'm renting a cottage<br />
		</em>these are my <strong>current</strong> plans for the future<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I'm there, I'm going to take lots of long walks and I'm going 
		to try to work on my novel<br />
		</em>the events are not arranged because 
		they exist only in my head <strong>at the moment</strong><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I finish school, I'm going to university<br />
		</em>my place is 
		assured <strong>now</strong><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I grow up, I'm going to be a train driver<br />
		</em>nothing is 
		fixed and arranged but this is what's in my head right <strong>now</strong><br />
		In all these cases the future is seen through the lens of the 
		present.&nbsp; This goes a long way to explaining why present forms are 
		selected.</p>
		<p>The generally accepted use of the <em>will/shall</em> future to show 
		willingness (or spontaneous decision) also falls into 
		intrinsic meaning because it refers to my perception of the future and 
		my <strong>current</strong> mood concerning willingness to do something 
		now or in the future.&nbsp; 
		For example<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll come early to help you get ready</em><br />
		is not a determined future of any sort.&nbsp; At this stage, it's a 
		current 
		offer.&nbsp; If you accept, it may well become a fixed future and we'll

		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm coming early to help you get ready, aren't I?</em></p>
		<h3>Summary of types of meaning</h3>

		<h3>Diaries</h3>
		<p>Just about the most popular way of trying to make the concepts of 
		these two future forms clear to learners is to use some form of diary.&nbsp; 
		Usually, this is set up in such a way that learners have different diary 
		plans and have to negotiate a good time to meet using language such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		I'm sorry, no, I'm watching the football tomorrow night.&nbsp; What 
		about Thursday?<br />
		</em>and replying with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, I'm sorry, I'm visiting 
		my mother then<br />
		</em>etc.<br />
		If you don't believe this is popular, try putting "present continuous 
		for the future using diaries" into an internet search engine and see some of the thousands of hits 
		it records.<br />
		So what's the problem?<br />
		It doesn't work, that's the problem.</p>
		<p>This is because the writers of such exercises have usually lost sight 
		of the fact that diaries used in this way (to project forward) are not 
		actually diaries at all &ndash; they are <strong>planners</strong>.&nbsp; 
		And the problem with plans is that they cover things <em>I am doing</em> 
		and things <em>I am going to do</em>.&nbsp; In other words, we use 
		planners for <strong>both </strong>intrinsic futures and extrinsic ones.&nbsp; 
		The difference can never be 
		made clear this way.</p>
		<p>Say, for example, you have a planner entry for Saturday afternoon which 
		states:<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><strong>VISIT MUM</strong></span><br />Now, you might have written that because you have arranged with your 
		mother to visit or because it is your intention to visit her but no 
		arrangement has yet been made firm.&nbsp; It may even be the case that 
		you are going to drop in unannounced.&nbsp; Who can tell?<br />
		So the 'correct' response for Saturday afternoon could be:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>I'm visiting my mum on Saturday afternoon<br />
			</em>I've arranged this</li>
			<li><em>I'm going to visit my mum on Saturday afternoon<br />
			</em>I intend to do this and may or may not have arranged it</li>
			<li><em>I'll visit my mum on Saturday afternoon<br />
			</em>I have had the intention for some time and I'm only now telling 
			you about it</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If you are trying to use the diary to focus on 1. or 2., you will 
		find yourself in the position of rejecting the other responses.&nbsp; 
		But they are just as 'right'.</p>
		<p><strong>Moral: don't use diaries.&nbsp; They confuse more than they 
		enlighten.</strong></p>
		<p>This is not confined to the use of diaries (although that's very 
		common).<br />
		The problem with many course materials is that they focus on the time 
		and the event not on the internal processes in speakers.</p>
		<h3>A better idea</h3>
		<p>The concept to make clear to learners is:<br />
		<strong><em>Is this an event that which is a real fact 
		about the future or does it only exist in my head at the moment?</em></strong></p>
		<p>Here's one way to make it clear:</p>

		<h3>Introducing the forms</h3>
		<p>The ideas above focus on contrasting the forms and that makes good 
		sense because, when we are talking about the future, what <em>will 
		happen</em> and what <em>we are going to do</em> about it occur 
		naturally together.&nbsp; In natural communication, therefore, we might 
		get something like:</p>
		<p class="auto-style56"><em>A: On the TV, they said it'll be wet and windy tomorrow, you 
		know.<br />
		B: Well, if it is, I won't play golf.<br />
		A: Golf?&nbsp; I thought you were taking the kids to the park tomorrow.<br />
		B: No, I'm taking them on Monday.&nbsp; That's what we talked about 
		yesterday.<br />
		A: We did?&nbsp; OK but what are you going to do, then?<br />
		B: I don't know. I guess I'll take the kids to the cinema.&nbsp; I'll 
		phone the guys and tell them I won't be free till Monday for the golf.</em></p>
		<p>In that short exchange, we have three future forms being used in 
		different ways to express different ideas. It sounds reasonably natural 
		because the topic stays firmly on the future seen in different ways.<br />
		The problem, of course, is to introduce the forms rather than contrast 
		them, especially for lower-level learners.</p>
		<h4>Keep it focused</h4>
		<p>At the beginning, try not to have a context where more than one form 
		is possible.&nbsp; For example, don't mix planning and intentionality.&nbsp; 
		It's fine to use planning a trip and booking things to set the idea of 
		the present progressive but if you mix in intentionality people will 
		either get confused or use the wrong form for their meaning.<br />
		If you have something like a focus on the idea of booking something, the 
		concept of present progressive for the future becomes clearer.<br />
		For example, planning a holiday or a journey requires things to be 
		booked in advance and once that’s done, we can naturally use the tense 
		form for arrangements.&nbsp; E.g.<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are holidaying in the Scottish Highlands, staying in a cottage 
		and spending our time walking and fishing<br />
		</em>etc.&nbsp; The idea to get 
		across is one of extrinsic meaning.&nbsp; These things refer to a fixed 
		future, not to someone's view of it.<br />
		It is fatal, however, to mix in speculation about what will happen once 
		you get there, because that will usually involve <em>going to</em> as in<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we get to the cottage, the first thing I'm going to do is find 
		out where the nearest pub is.</em><br />
		That is what happens when you try to use diaries for the contrast.</p>
		<p>The <em>going to</em> form should be carefully split between the use 
		for prediction based on evidence / experience and use for intentions.&nbsp; 
		The first is extrinsic, the second is intrinsic.</p>
		<p>For the prediction use, images are good because we can actually see the 
		evidence:</p>

			<p>The idea of volition is central.&nbsp; In all of these, it's possible to use
		<em>want to</em> instead of <em>going to</em> so it's a short step to 
		the idea.<br />
		Teaching the verb <em>intend</em> is quite a useful thing to do in this 
		context.&nbsp; Then you can say how it differs from <em>arrange</em>.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
		<strong>The present simple</strong> is easily presented using timetables but 
		they don't have to be transport timetables.&nbsp; School timetables work well, 
		too, and are often a bit more interesting and familiar, especially to 
		younger learners.</p>
		<p><em><strong>will/shall</strong></em><strong> for willingness</strong> 
		can also be set in a present 
		context of <strong>situation &gt; problem &gt; offer / suggestion</strong><br />
		<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Situation: People planning a dinner party.</span><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Problem: <em>There's no beer in the fridge!</em><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Solution: <em>Don't worry, I'll get some on my way home.</em></p>
		<p>
		<em><strong>will/shall</strong></em><strong> for prediction </strong>can often be effectively taught 
		within the conditional but it doesn't have to be.&nbsp; We can extend 
		the little dinner-party problem to<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it won't be cold.</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes it will, I'll get it from the place with a fridge</em>.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
		doesn't matter, anyway, because we'll have two hours to let it cool 
		before they come.</em></p>
		<h3>Using these ideas</h3>
		<p>Keeping the context very tight and being very controlled will help you 
		get the various concepts and uses of the forms across but remember that 
		it is only possible fully to grasp the ideas when used in contrast to 
		other forms and uses.&nbsp; Sooner, rather than later, you will have to 
		present and practise the forms together.</p>
		<p>There's no rule.&nbsp; Use them as you will, or not.<br />
		A simple approach is to take one scenario and present it, practising the 
		language as you go along, and then get the learners to reconstruct the 
		things said and the reasons for the use of each form with a second set 
		of picture prompts.<br />
		It is critical that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You have a clear, memorable context and that's where the picture 
			prompts come in.</li>
			<li>You have a way or ways to alert your learners to whether the 
			future is an internally imagined one or an external reality.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If you have taught successful lessons introducing or contrasting the 
		various futures, why not send the ideas to <strong><span class="auto-style9">
