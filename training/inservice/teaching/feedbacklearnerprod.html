	<h1>Feedback on learner production</h1>
		<p>
		<img height="207" src="../../images/feedback310.jpg" width="310" alt="feedback" /></p>
		<p>This guide does not cover the sorts of tasks that require 
		comprehensive feedback and those which require little or none.&nbsp; All 
		of that is covered in <a href="../../initial/teaching/feedback.html">the 
		guide to managing feedback</a> on and from tasks.</p>
		<p>The concern here is with the form of feedback learners get on their 
		production, not the feedback you give on whole tasks and activities 
		concerning what people got right, half right and wrong.</p>
		<p>We shall also not be commenting here on the feedback you give to 
		production which is acceptable or very good and needs no improvement.</p>
		<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img height="166" src="../../images/five_bottles250.jpg" width="250" alt="5" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h2>Five sorts of feedback</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Five!<br />
		Relax, these are not complicated but having some way to classify what we 
		are doing when we give feedback and what learners expect us to be doing 
		helps in the thinking process.&nbsp; In what follows, we'll be 
		considering both feedback on spoken production and on written work.</p>

					<h2>corrective feedback</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
		Corrective feedback is usually the novice teacher's first port of call 
		and the form that many get stuck with throughout their teaching careers.&nbsp; 
		It works like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Spoken production:<ol class="greybulletlist">
				<li>Student: <em>I go yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Teacher: <em>NO, that should be 'I went yesterday'</em></li>
				<li>Student: <em>Ah, I went yesterday</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Written Production:<br />
			<img height="81" src="../../imagesgraphics/correction.png" width="500" alt="eg" /></li>
		</ol>
		<p>There are, of course, some issues with this on both sides of the 
		argument.</p>
		<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style22" style="width: 80%">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 226px">For corrective

				feedback</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style23" style="width: 226px">It's familiar and 
				expected:<br />
				<em>This is the kind of feedback many learners are familiar with 
				since their early school days.&nbsp; It is also the type of 
				correction many say they actually want.</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style27" style="width: 226px">It's easy to 
				ignore<br />
				<em>Learners may ignore both spoken and written feedback like 
				this either by simply parroting what the teacher said or 
				glancing at their writing and setting it aside.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style28" style="width: 226px">It's quick:<br />
				<em>for spoken language, providing the error is obvious.&nbsp; 
				In written language it is slightly more cumbersome but the 
				teacher needn't correct everything.</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style25" style="width: 226px">It doesn't help 
				the learner notice the gap:<br />
				<em>Because the correction is done for them, learners may well 
				not notice the important differences between their production 
				and the target they were aiming for.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style28" style="width: 226px">It's immediate:<br />
				<em>There is usually little delay between production and 
				feedback and even written feedback correction can be done in 
				class.</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style25" style="width: 226px">It involves only 
				one learner:<br />
				<em>Other learners do not usually get to see written feedback 
				and may well ignore someone else's oral feedback because it 
				doesn't concern them.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style28" style="width: 226px">It's easy to do:<br />
				<em>With a little practice, this kind of feedback can become 
				almost automatic and call for little judgement from the teacher.</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style25" style="width: 226px">It has little 
				long-term effect:<br />
				<em>Because the feedback is so immediate and brief, learners are 
				not being challenged to improve and develop their language 
				skills and knowledge.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style28" style="width: 226px">It provides 
				reassurance:<br />
				<em>because learners get clear and unambiguous answers to 
				issues.</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style25" style="width: 226px">It's demotivating:<br />
				<em>simply to be told you are wrong or to receive written work 
				covered in red pencil comments.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style28" style="width: 226px"><em>The teacher 
				can control the amount and sophistication of the correction 
				given.</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style25" style="width: 226px"><em>It is

			</tr>

					<td class="auto-style21">
		<h2>clarification / elicitation routines</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
		These call for a little more work on the learners' (and teacher's) part.&nbsp; 
		The object is to lead people to the right formulation rather than 
		supplying it.&nbsp; It works like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Spoken production:<ol class="greybulletlist">
				<li>Student: <em>I go yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Teacher: <em>Are you talking about today or before today?</em></li>
				<li>Student: <em>Before today</em></li>
				<li>Teacher:<em> OK.&nbsp; So what form should the verb be in?</em></li>
				<li>Student: <em>Ah, I <strong>went</strong> yesterday</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Written production:<em><br />
			</em>
			<img height="143" src="../../imagesgraphics/correction2.png" width="500" alt="eg" /></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Although this is slightly less reassuring for learners (because they 
		feel they are being interrogated sometimes), clarification via 
		elicitation has all the advantages listed above.<br />
		It also tackles some of the criticism because it does require some 
		thought on the learner's part and that may well have a positive 
		long-term effect.<br />
		Learners can, however, often ignore this form of feedback, too, after 
		they have achieved something acceptable.<br />
		It also usually concerns only one learner at a time so others in the 
		group may not benefit or even listen and are unlikely to have access to 
		the written text (although that can be arranged).</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img height="166" src="../../images/teacher_fronted250.jpg" width="250" alt="teacher" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h2>metalinguistic feedback</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>This involves some talk about language rather than the insertion of 
		the language itself.&nbsp; It works like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Spoken production:<ol class="greybulletlist">
				<li>Student: <em>I go yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Teacher: <em>You need the past simple form for completed 
				actions</em></li>
				<li>Student: <em>Ah, I <strong>went</strong> yesterday</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Written production:<em><br />
			</em>
			<img height="214" src="../../imagesgraphics/correction3.png" width="500" alt="eg" /></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Clearly, this kind of feedback relies on the learners actually 
		knowing what you are talking about.&nbsp; If they do, however, this can be a 
		powerful approach because it forces the learners to apply knowledge 
		about the language to its actual production.&nbsp; That way, they can be 
		alerted to applying their knowledge and noticing how the language 
		functions.</p>
		<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img height="166" src="../../images/man_in_boat250.jpg" width="250" alt="man" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h2>recasts</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>This is sometimes called reformulation and involves the teacher 
		simply taking the learner's intent and casting it in a more accurate / 
		acceptable form.&nbsp; It works like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Spoken production:<ol class="greybulletlist">
				<li>Student: <em>I go yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Teacher: <em>You <strong>went</strong> yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Student: <em>Ah, I <strong>went</strong> yesterday</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Written production:<em><br />
			</em>
			<img height="146" src="../../imagesgraphics/correction4.png" width="500" alt="example" /></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Recasts, of course, suffer somewhat from the same problems that 
		simple corrective feedback exhibits.&nbsp; They can often be ignored and 
		if the recast is too different from the learners' output, it can be 
		difficult for them to identify (i.e., notice) what exactly is being 
		corrected, especially in oral work.<br />
		An advantage of recasting is that the teacher can, by simple repetition, 
		signal the parts of what has been said which are accurate and focus on 
		the issue, like this, for example:</p>
		<ul class="greybulletlist">
			<li>Student: <em>My friend and I went to the cinema for watching 
			that movie and we loved it.</em></li>
			<li>Teacher: <em>That's nice.&nbsp; So you and your friend went to 
			the cinema just </em><strong><em>to see</em></strong><em> that 
			movie, right?</em></li>
		</ul>
		<p>If overused, recast can also become frustrating for learners because 
		they can feel that nothing they say first time around is acceptable.</p>
		<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img height="166" src="../../images/chairs250.jpg" width="250" alt="seats" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h2>repetition and highlighting</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Getting learners to notice salient features of language systems or 
		how their production differs from the targets can often be achieved by 
		simple repetition and highlighting.&nbsp; It works like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Spoken production:<ol class="greybulletlist">
				<li>Student: <em>I go yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Teacher: <em>You <strong>go</strong> yesterday?</em></li>
				<li>Student: <em>Ah, I <strong>went</strong> yesterday</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Written production (usually involving some kind of simple 
			correction code):<em><br />
			</em>
			<img height="138" src="../../imagesgraphics/correction5.png" width="500" alt="eg" /></li>
		</ol>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img height="133" src="../../images/finger_point_statue200.jpg" width="200" alt="hand" /><img height="133" src="../../images/man_sceptical_a200.jpg" width="200" alt="face" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h2>non-verbal highlighting</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Often, in the classroom, the highlighting can be achieved 
		non-verbally by a lifting of an eyebrow, banging your head on the board, 
		hand gestures and so on.</p>
		<p>Of course, this kind of feedback is most effective with 
		post-systematic error which the learners can self correct.&nbsp; If 
		learners actually do not have mastery of the issue you are highlighting, 
		everyone's time is being wasted because the learners will be stabbing in 
		the dark and getting frustrated and disheartened.</p>
		<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img height="166" src="../../images/mix250.jpg" width="250" alt="mix" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h2>combining the feedback forms</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>This is common.&nbsp; One might, for example, start the process by 
		repetition and highlighting and then, when it doesn't work, move on to 
		clarification and elicitation and, when that doesn't work, resort to 
		metalanguage or straightforward corrective feedback.<br />
		That's not an admission of failure.</p>
