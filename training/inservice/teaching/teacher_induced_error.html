			<p>Learners of English have more than enough problems to contend 
			with without their teachers (and the materials their teachers use) 
			making things worse.<br />
			A major source of error is, unfortunately, teachers and materials.<br />
			The following sets out to describe the sources of this sort of error 
			and suggest some ways of eradicating them or at least reducing their 
			impact.</p>

			<p>There are a number of overlapping and linked sources of error 
			that may be caused either by the teacher's behaviour or encouraged by the 
			teacher's materials.&nbsp; We'll identify and describe the main 
			ones, describe their impact and suggest ways they might be avoided, 
			if only partially.<br />

					<td class="auto-style64">
					<div id="intel" style="visibility:hidden
" class="auto-style14"> The problem here is twofold:<br />
						Firstly, the teacher has ignored a malformed question 
						from a learner obviously able to ask it correctly.&nbsp; 
						That can lead to fossilization of the error.<br />
						Secondly, the teacher did not supply the word grammar 
						and used a sloppy approach to synonymy.&nbsp; With no
						<strong>co-text</strong> for the learner to work with, 
						error is inevitable.<br />
						The verbs are very similar in meaning but <em>hide</em> can be 
						both intransitive and transitive whereas <em>conceal</em> is 
						always transitive.&nbsp; The issue is one of 
						colligation, specifically transitivity and, because 
						languages work so differently, it is essential that 
						learners who encounter a new verb are told explicitly 
						whether it takes, or can take, no, one or two objects.<br />
						<strong>This is what should have happened:</strong><br /><em><span class="style_black">Learner: What means 'conceal'<br />
						Teacher: What ...?<br />
						Learner: Sorry.&nbsp; What does 'conceal' mean?<br />
						Teacher: The meaning is close to 'hide' but the grammar 
						is a little different.<br />
						You can hide <strong>something</strong> or you can just
						<strong>hide</strong> so nobody can see you but you must 
						always have an object with 'conceal'.&nbsp; You can't 
						say 'he concealed' because I must know <strong>what</strong> 
						he concealed.<br />
						The word 'conceal' is also a bit more formal</span></em><span class="style_black">.<br /><em>Can I say, "He concealed the book in the kitchen"?<br />
						Learner: Yes.<br />
						Teacher: Can I say, "He concealed in the kitchen"?<br />
						Learner: No, I must say what he concealed.<br />
						Teacher: Right, good.&nbsp; Make a note and let's move 
						on.<br />
						</em></span>The other issue is whether all the learners 
						needed to be aware of this information.&nbsp; In the 
						event, they didn't because it was an individual, not a 
						group, issue.</div>

					<td class="auto-style27">
					<div id="intel0" style="visibility:hidden
" class="auto-style14"> The teacher was right, of course, to draw the learner's 
						attention to issues of style but ignored the key issue 
						of connotation.&nbsp; The word, in fact, means not just 
						a friend but a long-standing friend and that might have 
						been helpful information.<br />
						The word <em>crony</em> is almost always used in a 
						negative sense as in, e.g.,<br />
						<em>The Prime Minister has promoted all her cronies 
						rather than looking for the best people.<br />
						My husband plays golf every Sunday with his horrible 
						cronies.</em><br />
						etc.<br />
						The teacher needed to provide a <strong>context</strong> 
						or two in which the word is used.&nbsp; Without context, 
						it's not possible for the learner to acquire an adequate 
						knowledge of the term and the error is the inevitable 
						result.</div>

					<div id="intel1" style="visibility:hidden
" class="auto-style14"> 
						The problem, again, comes down to the quality of 
						information.&nbsp; Nothing the teacher said is actually 
						wrong, but the data are incomplete and consequently 
						confusing, leading to inevitable error.<br />
						<strong>This is what should have happened:</strong><br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>Teacher: No, that's wrong.&nbsp; 
						If we use a negative adverb like 'never', to start a 
						sentence, we are making it more important.&nbsp; The 
						grammar changes because we make what looks like a 
						question form following the adverb.&nbsp; For example 
						(on the board):<br />
						</em>Never do I see him alone<br />
						Barely have I been able to finish<br />
						At no time can you ask to leave early<br /><em>Can you see what's happening?&nbsp; Mary?<br />
						Mary: We make the question.<br />
						Teacher: Yes.&nbsp; But we only do this with words that 
						are <strong>negative</strong>.<br />
						Do I say (writes on board), "Rarely do I see him alone" 
						or "Rarely, I see him alone?"<br />
						Class: The first one.<br />
						Teacher: Why? (wait 10 seconds) John?<br />
						John: Because 'rarely' is negative?<br />
						Teacher: Yes, it means <strong>NOT</strong> often, 
						doesn't it?<br />
						Do I say, "Frequently am I there early" or "Frequently, 
						I am there early"?<br />
						Class: "Frequently, I am there early."<br />
						Teacher: Why is that? Mary?<br />
						Mary: Because 'frequently' is positive?<br />
						Teacher: Yes, it means <strong>often</strong> doesn't 
						it?<br />
						Now, what's the difference in meaning between<br />
						"I see him rarely"<br />
						and<br />
						"Rarely do I see him?"<br />
						Learner: It's stronger.<br />
						Teacher: What is stronger?<br />
						Learner: The word 'rarely'.<br />

			<p>Error can be encouraged if learners do not have enough context to 
			make sense of the data they receive.<br />
			Lack of context frequently leads to stylistic errors because there 
			aren't enough data for learners to perceive whether something is 
			appropriate or not in a given setting.<br />
			Introducing or presenting especially functional language without 
			adequate contextual clues will produce error.<br />
			Lack of co-text will mean that learners cannot see how the grammar 
			of words and their natural connections occur.<br />
			This produces:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Errors in colligation such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*I let him to go</em><br />
				by analogy with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I permitted him to go</em><br />
				because there hasn't been enough co-text to notice the patterns.</li>
				<li>Errors in collocation such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*a heavy wind</em><br />
				by analogy with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a heavy rainfall / snowfall</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Stylistically, too, the failure to make a context clear in terms 
			of the roles of participants, the power relationship and the setting 
			can also encourage errors, especially in terms of formality.&nbsp; 
			Utterances such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I make a point here?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sorry to interrupt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if you've considered ...</em><br />
			etc. are perfectly correct grammatically and appropriate to formal 
			settings with more or less equal power relationships but 
			inappropriate in an informal situation where:<br />

		</table>
			<p>We saw above an example of the danger of taking an unclassified, 
			phrase-book approach to teaching exponents of functions.<br />
			Even at the word level, the issue is important.&nbsp; Learners need 
			to know word class and word grammar at the very least so that they 
			can avoid errors such as</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Noun problems like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*The cattles are on the farm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have the informations I need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The plane's late departing was an inconvenience</em></li>
				<li>Verb problems like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*He arrived the hotel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I paid the drinks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I made him to come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I enjoyed to see you</em></li>
				<li>Adjective / adverb problems like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>The police arrested the concerned criminals<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He worked hardly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *An asleep dog</em></li>
				<li>Preposition issues like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*They relied us on</em> (by analogy with <em>They turned 
				us down</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*The keys were below the newspaper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The pen of Mary</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Classifying the nature of functions, too, needs some thought.<br />
			For example, ways of making apologies vary depending on the <strong>
			type</strong> of apology that is being made:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry</em><br />
			is generally acceptable for all sorts of apology but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pardon me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I apologise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would like to express our sincere sympathy</em><br />
			are all only appropriate to a limited range of apology types.&nbsp; 
			If learners aren't told that, they'll naturally make errors.</p>
			<p>The morals are:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Break down functions to allow people to see what they are 
				trying to do <strong>within</strong> the function</li>
				<li>Supply the information learners need to form mental 
				categories and put things where they belong</li>

		</table>
			<p>A widely accepted theory is that learners are actively processing 
			what they hear and read and forming and refining hypotheses about 
			language form and structure.&nbsp; If that is the case, denying them 
			enough information to do so adequately is perverse.<br />
			It leads especially to errors of analogy and over generalisation 
			because the learners will not know where the rule's limits are.&nbsp; 
			So we get, e.g.:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>*The children became border and border</em><br />
				because the learner doesn't know that all participle adjectives, 
				whatever their syllable count, make comparative forms with <em>
				more</em></li>
				<li><em>*Half all the food was eaten</em><br />
				because the learner doesn't know that the pre-determiner <em>
				half</em> cannot be used with other quantifiers but is confined 
				to use with other determiners such as articles and 
				demonstratives (<em>half the people, half these eggs</em> etc.)</li>
				<li><em>*She presented me the book</em><br />
				because the learner hasn't noticed, or been led to notice, that
				<em>give</em> is ditransitive but <em>present</em> is 
				monotransitive</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The morals are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbullet">Listen to your learners and identify 
				their current hypotheses (i.e., the nature of their 
				interlanguage or what is sometimes called their approximative 
				system)</li>
				<li class="redbullet">Work on the hypotheses you know your 
				learners already have and give them the facts they need to

			<p>Poor language analysis leads to all kinds of learner error 
			because it results in dirty, inadequate or plainly false 
			information.<br />
			An additional factor is that materials, not solely those encountered 
			out here on the web, are too often written by people who have 
			themselves done inadequate analysis of that which they purport to 
			teach.&nbsp; We saw above how a failure to analyse functions and 
			forms adequately can lead to poor materials and encourage aberrant 
			language.<br />
			We get, at the very best, unnatural or ill-formed language such as:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>John having the courage to ask a question surprised me</em><br />
				which ignores the usual tendency in English to put complex 
				clauses to the end of sentences (end weighting).&nbsp; More 
				naturally, this would be<br />
				<em>I was surprised at John's having the courage to ask a question</em></li>
				<li><em>I expected his arriving late</em><br />
				which uses a gerund (by analogy with something like<em> We are 
				expecting rain</em>) where English would prefer a non-finite 
				clause as in<br />
				<em>I expected him to arrive late</em></li>
				<li><em>I must say he should be there by now<br />

				<h3>Exemplification and models</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>An inductive approach to learning is premised on the theory that 
			people can, given enough precise exemplification of a rule, work out 
			what the rule is and apply it, deductively, elsewhere.&nbsp; If the examples are 
			ambiguous or mixed, however, the process falls to pieces.<br />
			Consider this dialogue, for example, intended to focus on the use of
			<em>will</em> and the rules for its meaning.</p>
			<p class="auto-style30"><span class="style_black">Alan: </span><em>
			There's no butter in the fridge!</em><br />
			Fred: <em>OK, don't worry, I'll go to the corner shop.&nbsp; They'll 
			have some.</em><br />
			Alan: <em>They won't be open, will they?&nbsp; It's gone 6.</em><br />
			Fred: <em>Yes they will.&nbsp; They open late on Fridays so I'll be 
			OK.</em><br />
			Alan: <em>Great.&nbsp; Will you get some currants while you are 
			there?</em><br />
			Fred: <em>I don't know if they'll have any but I'll try.</em></p>
			<p>There are lots of examples of the target verb in this contrived 
			dialogue but, unfortunately and misleadingly for the learners, they 
			are of two sorts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The use of will to express willingness or an offer<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll try<br />
				</em>This is the verb functioning as a modal auxiliary and it 
				expresses dynamic modality.</li>
				<li>The use of will to express the likelihood of a future event 
				or state<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'll have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They won't ... will they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be OK<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they'll have<br />
				</em>In this case the verb is functioning as a primary auxiliary 
				verb making a prospective aspect form.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Mixing up uses of a target structure like this sends mixed 
			messages and if you want the learners to induce the fact that <em>
			will</em> is used for one or other of the purposes, they won't be 
			able to do it from these data.<br />
			Other tense forms also cause difficulties so beware, in particular, 
			the use of present forms to talk about present arrangements and 
			arrangements for the future presently agreed on.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm seeing the doctor this afternoon</em><br />
			refers to a current arrangement affecting the future and:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She'll be angry if you say that</em><br />
			refers to a current prediction based on experience.</p>
			<p>Modal auxiliary verbs also present difficulties.&nbsp; 
			Presenting, for example, the use of verbs like <em>must, ought </em>
			and <em>should</em> to express epistemic modality (the likelihood in 
			the speaker's view of an event being true) and deontic modality (the 
			speaker's view of the desirability of an event happening) is a 
			recipe for bewildering rather than enlightening your learners.&nbsp; 
			For example, presenting:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must get the car fixed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She must be here soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A triangle must have three sides</em><br />
			mixes up the use of <em>must</em> in three types of modality 
			(deontic, epistemic and alethic, respectively).</p>
			<p>The morals are:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Check all examples to see that they really do exemplify your 
				targets</li>
				<li>Do not carelessly mix examples of the same structure 
				performing various functions or the same function being realised 
				in too many different ways</li>

			<p>Whether materials are bought and paid for, taken from the 
			institution's shelves or downloaded, they need inspecting for their 
			propensity to give false, inadequate or misleading information.<br />
			One example will suffice.&nbsp; An internet search for 'ways to 
			express obligation in English' brings this up in first place:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The difference between "Have to" and "must" 
			is that "have to"indicates that someone else has imposed conditions 
			on us.</p>
			<p>later in the same page we find:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">must / have to = 100% obligation. "When the 
			traffic light turn red, you must stop."<br />
			should = 50% obligation. It's more an advice than an obligation. " 
			You look tired. you should have a rest."<br />
			<span class="auto-style56">(Both from myenglishpages.com 
			[punctuation, spacing, grammar and capitalisation as in the original])</span></p>
			<p>The first point is arguable at best and oversimplified to the 
			point of inaccuracy.&nbsp; The fact is that the forms are used in 
			free variation by native speakers most of the time and the 
			distinction between<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to see the dentist about this tooth</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I must see the dentist about this tooth<br />
			</em>is not immediately discernible except by those who believe this 
			stuff.<br />
			Revealingly, the example in the second part uses <em>must</em> to 
			express an obligation that is clearly extrinsic to the person 
			involved (to do with the law about obeying traffic light colours).&nbsp; 
			If the first assertion is true that should be:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to stop</em></p>
			<p>The second assertion is even less trustworthy.&nbsp; One of the 
			central issues of deontic modality (which is what we are talking 
			about) is that its expression and strength relies on the role 
			relationships and intentions of the speakers, and is not dependent 
			on the verbs chosen.&nbsp; For example, it is hard to say that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You really must get your hair cut</em><br />
			represents the 100% obligation described or that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children should not be allowed to play 
			with fireworks</em><br />
			expresses some form of 50-50 advice which you are free to ignore.</p>
			<p>Any materials, including those on this site, should be checked 
			for accuracy and appropriacy before being risked in the 
			classroom.&nbsp; Not doing so is perilous.</p>

		</table>
			<p>This, the final point, underlies all the points made above.&nbsp; 
			Learners cannot learn well unless the data they get are clear and 
			they are explicitly asked to look at it.<br />
			Here's an example from a reading skills lesson:</p>
			<p>Learners are given a text about a significant battle and the task 
			set is:</p>
			<p><span class="style_black"><em>Read the text and put the following 
			into two columns: people and places.</em></span><br />
			(The items were things like <em>Waterloo, Blücher, Wellington, 
			Brussels, Bonaparte, Ligny, Richmond, Grouchy, Charleroi </em>etc.)</p>
			<p>That's it.</p>
			<p>We can assume that the learners are expected to 
			deploy three separate subskills:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>scanning the text to find the items quickly</li>
				<li>reading small sections around the items intensively to 
				answer the question and make the classification</li>
				<li>using their knowledge of text structure to guess that the 
				data they needed would be in the body of the text rather than 
				the introduction or conclusion</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sharper learners may also have checked to see if there was a map 
			with the text but, regrettably, there was none.<br />
			The outcome was, predictably, that most learners simply did as they 
			were told, i.e., 'read the text', with no attempt to deploy any 
			particular strategy.&nbsp; When the teacher called 'Time up!', of 
			course, most of the learners hadn't finished the second short 
			paragraph and the exercise, such as it is, was wasted.<br />
			All that was needed was for the teacher to take three minutes to 
			explain, elicit from or remind the learners of what they should be 
			doing.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>Will you read every word?</em></li>
				<li><em>What are you looking for?</em></li>
				<li><em>What will you do when you find one of the words?</em></li>
				<li><em>Where do you think the information will be?</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The same sort of lack of explicitness can equally apply to 
			language systems focuses in which the learners are being encouraged 
			to notice some aspect of the structural or lexical system.<br />
			Just presenting the information and hoping that the learners will 
			guess what is being asked of them lacks adequate explicitness and is 
			useless.&nbsp; You can't notice much if you don't know what you are 
			looking for.</p>
			<p>The morals are:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Present clear data</li>
				<li>Be explicit about what you want your learners to do with the 
				information you present</li>
				<li>Make sure you help the noticing process along</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Here's the picture.&nbsp; Any failings in one or more of the 
			areas in blue boxes can lead to teacher-induced error.&nbsp; All 
			such failings are avoidable.</p>

				<h3>The sunk-cost fallacy</h3>

		</table>
			<p>
			The sunk-cost fallacy refers to humans' reluctance to cut their 
			losses.&nbsp; Briefly put, it describes the error of valuing the 
			investment already made over the benefits of abandoning something 
			that is not working.<br />
			For example, governments around the world are reluctant to 
			abandon vast infrastructure projects, the costs of which are 
			ballooning out of control and whose utility is, in any case, 
			doubtful for two connected reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The amount already invested will be lost if the project is 
				abandoned and that is seen as an unacceptable cost even if the 
				cost of continuing will be greater than the loss.</li>
				<li>Cancelling a project implies that you have made a 
				poor decision and going back on it will be seen as losing face.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Less grandly, the syndrome is observable in, for example, staying 
			to the end of a film you hate because you have invested in a cinema 
			ticket, going to an event you are not interested in because you have 
			acquired a ticket, continuing to invest money in an old vehicle you know 
			should be sold and replaced and so on.</p>
			<p>In the classroom, the same fallacy is often observable and 
			involves the teacher sticking with an activity, text or set of 
			materials which is patently not working and not contributing to the 
			learning that was intended.&nbsp; It may even be operating 
			counterproductively and producing error.&nbsp; There are many reasons why things 
			are not doing what they were planned to do, for example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The material is too easy or too difficult so the learners 
				are operating outside the optimum learning zone.&nbsp; They will 
				either be over challenged by the material and gain little or 
				under challenged, gain nothing and be bored.</li>
				<li>The material is flawed in terms of the language or skill it 
				should targeting and not actually evincing what it should.</li>
				<li>The learners are approaching the materials or tasks in a way 
				you did not intend and not gaining what you thought they would 
				gain.</li>
				<li>The material is actually producing errors in language or 
				making the learners produce language which is inappropriate.</li>
				<li>The materials are not forcing the learners to use the 
				subskills which were the intended targets of the lesson.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			There is a great temptation to look on the bright side and think,<span class="style_black"><br /></span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_black"><em>Well, it's not 
			working but I'll stick with it because it might get better</em></span>.<br />
			when you know it won't,
			or<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took ages to 
			prepare all this stuff and my time will have been wasted if I stop 
			the activity now.</em></span><br />
			and so on.<br />
			And these are not very good reasons to spend time in a classroom 
			doing something that isn't helping.</p>
			<p>
			Bite the bullet, cut your losses and do something useful.</p>
