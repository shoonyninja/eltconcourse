		<p>
		Much is made of things like false friends and the fact that your 
		learners' first languages may interfere with their ability to acquire 
		lexis in English.&nbsp; To an extent, that is true.&nbsp; For learners 
		with an Indo-European language spoken in Europe or ex-European colonies 
		in other continents (i.e., excluding the Indo-Iranian branch), however, there are many more true friends than false.</p>
		<h3>
		Cognate words</h3>
		<p class="auto-style25">
		<img alt="cognate words" height="134" src="../../imagesgraphics/cognates.png" width="500" /></p>
		<p>
		Words which have a common origin and, therefore, look, sound and mean 
		alike are called cognates (from the Latin <em>cognatus</em> (blood 
		relation)).<br />
		True and false friends are often cognate words.&nbsp; For example, the English word <em>
		night</em> has cognates in French (<em>nuit</em>), German (<em>Nacht</em>), Dutch 
		(<em>nacht</em>), Swedish (<em>nat</em>), Polish (<em>noc</em>), Spanish (<em>noche</em>) and so on 
		and these are all true friends because meaning is unchanged.</p>
		<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
		<img alt="friends" height="166" src="../../images/three_friends_dogs_250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style31">
				<h2>
		True friends</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
		<p>
		Briefly, the list of languages with many true friends will include:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>The Italic languages</strong>: French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, 
			Romanian etc.<br />
			There are many words, especially those of Latin, Greek or Norman-French origin which will be recognisable in English to speakers of 
			these languages.&nbsp; These particularly occur in technical and 
			'intellectual' areas but also include large numbers of very common 
			words.<br />
			Speakers of these languages sometimes show a tendency to select 
			familiar, cognate words rather than the more stylistically appropriate 
			English words so we get<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I entered the house and extinguished the 
			fire<br />
			</em>instead of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went in and put the fire out<br />
			</em>which is also neatly avoiding the phrasal verb, of course.</li>
			<li><strong>Germanic languages</strong> fall into two categories with similar 
			vocabularies (and much else).&nbsp; North Germanic or Scandinavian 
			languages and West Germanic languages which include English, Dutch 
			and German as well as a host of small dialects and languages.<br />
			There are many thousands of cognate words across these languages.&nbsp; 
			Many of these words refer to some of the most basic concepts such as
			<em>land, day, hand, old, young, many, good, glass, gold </em>etc.&nbsp; 
			The languages also share scientific and 'scholarly' terms.</li>
			<li><strong>Slavic languages</strong> exhibit far fewer recognisable cognate words 
			(although there are, in fact, very many hidden by orthographic and 
			phonological changes over the centuries).&nbsp; Recognisable words 
			in English for speakers of these languages will mainly be scientific 
			and scholarly terms of the sort shared by other European languages.&nbsp; 
			These languages are also rich in borrowings from English.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		Other languages (i.e., most of them) will not exhibit any significant 
		overlap in lexemes.&nbsp; The implication is clear: learners from most 
		language backgrounds will encounter significantly more difficulty 
		acquiring English words than their more fortunate European colleagues.&nbsp; 
		They will need more time, more recycling and more patience.</p>

		False friends</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
		<p>
		This is not the place to list false friends for all the languages in the 
		world.&nbsp; There are numerous websites that will do that for specific 
		languages.&nbsp; Another good source is The Cambridge International 
		Dictionary of English.</p>
		<p>
		It is, however, worth noting that false friends come in a range of 
		falseness.&nbsp; Many are only false friends in certain circumstances.&nbsp; 
		This includes words which are restricted to some contexts in certain 
		languages, e.g., <em>angst</em> in English is borrowed from the German 
		word meaning <em>anxiety</em> but only used in psychological senses.<br />
		It is often noted, for example, that the English word <em>sensitive</em> 
		is problematic for speakers of many European languages because of 
		confusion with a word similar to <em>sensible</em> in those languages.&nbsp; 
		However, <em>sensibility</em> <span class="style_underline">is</span> 
		used in English in the same way and refers to sensitivity of feeling.&nbsp; 
		That's how Jane Austen used it, incidentally.<br />
		The English <em>sensibility</em> is rendered in German as <em>
		Sensibilität</em> but the English word <em>sensitive</em> may be 
		translated as <em>sensibel</em>.&nbsp; For example, the two words <em>
		sensitive</em> and <em>sensibility</em> are translated in French as <em>
		sensible</em> and <em>sensibilité,</em> in Spanish as <em>sensible</em> 
		and <em>sensibilidad</em> and in Italian as <em>sensibile</em> and <em>
		sensibilità</em>.<br />
		There is a separate guide to 
		cognates and false friends on this site, linked at the end of this guide.<br />
		There are also some exercises on this site concerning false friends in the 
		section for learners.&nbsp;

		</em>is a good guess unless you

		The reason nearly all people use the same categories is that this is how

		<strong>appearance</strong> (plants / flowers) and by <strong>place</strong> 
		(garden stuff).&nbsp; If this is true, it seems logical to teach sets of

			In theory, this task should have been 
			getting easier as you went along.&nbsp; Why should that be?<br />
			<strong>Set 1</strong> contained nonsense words and they are harder 
			to remember because you have no meaning to attach to them.<br />
			Moral: we all need meaning to help us recall words.&nbsp; This is 
			what your students have to do if you don't make meaning clear.<br />
			<strong>Set 2</strong> contained real words but with no meaning 
			connections between them.<br />
			Moral: disconnected words are difficult to remember.<br />
			<strong>Set 3</strong> contained a set of hyponyms for <em>hat</em>.<br />
			Moral: words connected to each other because they fall in the same 
			set are easier to recall.<br />
			<strong>Set 4 </strong>was a short narrative with lexis embedded in 
			it.<br />
			Moral: words which appear in some kind of narrative are easy to 
			recall because of the context.<br />
			General moral: CONNECT and CONTEXTUALISE.</p>

				<h2>Strategies for learning and remembering lexis</h2>

			</table>
			
			<p>A good deal of research has been done on the ways in which new 
			words are understood and learned.&nbsp; Here are some strategies 
			commonly used by learners divided into those which may help to 
			unpack the meaning of unknown items and those which may help to 
			consolidate learning once the meaning is known.<br />
			Some of the following are exemplified in the teaching ideas which 
			follow.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Unpacking meaning<br />
				<img alt="unpack" height="133" src="../../images/suitcase_unpack200.jpg" width="200" /><ol class="auto-style60">
					<li>Word class<br />Identifying word class is a small help to understanding meaning 
				and a greater one in deciding whether it is important to 
				understand the word or not and can be done in two main ways:<ol class="auto-style61">
						<li>By using the co-text:<br />For example<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any word which appears between a determiner and a noun is 
				almost certainly an adjective as in, e.g.:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that
						</em><span class="style_underline"><em>horrendous</em></span><em> storm</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any word which immediately precedes or follows a verb is 
				almost certainly an adverb, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she 
						</em><span class="style_underline"><em>promptly</em></span><em> left</em><br />etc.</li>
						<li>By using word shape and an understanding of affixation and 
				compounding.&nbsp; For example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prefixes almost always change a word's meaning, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; productive &rarr; counterproductive</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffixes almost always affect word class but not meaning, 
				e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; courage &rarr; 
						courageous</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; English is right-headed so the right-hand word signifies word 
						class and meaning (usually), e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <em>doorman</em> is a type of <em>
						man</em> not a type of <em>door</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <em>fencepost</em> is a type of <em>
						post</em>, not a type of <em>fence</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only nouns and verbs inflect in English so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an <em>-s</em> or -<em>es</em> ending 
						is either a plural noun or a verb in the third person 
						singular and an <em>-ed</em> ending on a word usually 
						signified a past tense or past participle while <em>-ing</em> 
						signifies a progressive form</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Cognates<br />
					Some cognate words are instantly recognisable but others 
					require a little understanding of the patterns.&nbsp; 
					Cognate words between languages often follow simple rules so 
					a final '<em>d</em>' in in German is often a final '<em>th</em>' 
					in English and the ending- <em>ion</em> in English will 
					usually be -<em>zione</em> in Italian and -<em>ção</em> in 
					Portuguese.</li>
					<li>Using pictures and other graphics helps to:<ol class="auto-style61">
						<li>Recognise the register of a text and predict the 
						kinds of lexis that it will contain</li>
						<li>Recognise how words such as, e.g., <em>pass, score
						</em>and <em>goal</em> are being used</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Gaining an understanding of gist by skimming a text 
					helps to get a sense of the author's purpose and likely 
					meanings so one is able to predict whether, e.g., adjectives 
					are likely to be positive (as, in an advertisement, for 
					example) or negative (as in an argument against something, 
					for example).</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Consolidating learning<br />
				<img alt="link" height="133" src="../../images/rope_binding200.jpg" width="200" /><ol class="auto-style60">
					<li>Personalising words to connect them to one's own 
					experience.</li>
					<li>Using hyponymy and meronymy helps to fix words in terms 
					of meaning so knowing, e.g., that both <em>buses</em> and
					<em>cars</em> are type of <em>vehicles</em> and that they 
					both have <em>steering wheels, tyres, windscreens</em> and 
					so on creates a web of associations.</li>
					<li>Using antonymy and synonymy can also help to fix a 
					word's meaning by what it is similar to or not.</li>
					<li>Writing words down is a well-known aid to memory and 
					writing two or more sentences to show the word's meaning is 
					even better.</li>
					<li>Mentally or aloud repeating&nbsp; word may help to fix 
					it in the memory.</li>
					<li>Organising vocabulary notebooks by categories of meaning 
					rather than word class or spelling is effective.</li>
