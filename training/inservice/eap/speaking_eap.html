			<img alt="speaking" height="207" src="../../images/presentation_310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide will not attempt to repeat the content of guides to 
			speaking skills in general (for which there are links at the end) 
			but will focus on the settings and purposes of speaking in an 
			academic environment, i.e., for learners of English studying in an 
			English-medium institution.<br />
			A further omission from this guide is the kind of speaking skills 
			that learners will need when interacting with their peers informally 
			as those do not differ from generalised speaking skills covered 
			elsewhere on <strong><span class="orange">ELT </span>Concourse.</strong></p>

					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>Three settings</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Essentially, there are three settings in which our learners will 
			need to speak:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In lectures</li>
				<li>In small-group seminars</li>
				<li>When giving and attending presentations</li>
			</ol>
			<p>What the learner will have to do with the language in these 
			settings will vary but there are commonalities, as we shall see.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It is possible to divide speaking skills for EAP into those 
			skills most obviously needed in the three settings identified above.&nbsp; 
			That is not the approach taken here.<br />
			Here we shall consider the purposes learners have when speaking, and 
			therefore the functions they will need to be able to perform in all 
			these settings.&nbsp; Where necessary, we shall consider which 
			settings are most likely to call on which purposes but that is not 
			the fundamental organising criterion.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>What follows here applies to lectures, seminars, presentations by 
			peers and even one-to-one tutorials.</p>
			<p>Forming the question grammatically is not usually the issue.&nbsp; 
			The issues are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Recognising when and if questioning is invited</li>
				<li>Sending a signal that one wishes to pose or interpose a 
				question</li>
				<li>Phrasing the question appropriately, not just structurally 
				accurately</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These need explicit treatment on an EAP course.</p>

					<img alt="signal" height="133" src="../../images/signal_railway200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h3>Recognising the signals</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Speakers have a number of ways of signalling that questions or 
			interruptions are welcome.<br />
			Cultures vary in how it is done (or even if it is done) and within 
			cultures, individuals will vary in the signals they send so there 
			are few fixed rules.<br />
			Setting, too, will have a significant effect.&nbsp; In EAP settings, 
			there is frequently a rather formal set of signals for people to 
			notice and tutors and lecturers often take on the role of a chair of 
			a meeting.&nbsp; This means they will use strategies for inviting 
			questions such as</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>Ways of including quieter participants and demanding 
				participation: e.g., <em>Fred.&nbsp; 
				Do you have a question?</em></li>
				<li>Ways of silencing the over-enthusiastic questioner: e.g., <em>
				Thanks, Jane.&nbsp; Let's get some other questions now, huh?</em></li>
				<li>Ways of signalling transitions: e.g., <em>Right.&nbsp; 
				Before we go on to the reasons for all this, does anyone have a 
				question?</em></li>
				<li>Ways of keeping the questions on track: e.g., <em>We are 
				getting off the topic.&nbsp; Let's go back a bit.</em></li>
				<li>Ways of moving things on and requiring a current questioner 
				to give up the turn: e.g., <em>Right, let's move on.</em></li>
				<li>Ways of closing a topic: e.g., <em>Does anyone have anything 
				to ask before we move on?</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lecturers and tutors in group seminars or teaching roles usually 
			assume control not only over who speaks 
			next but what they say.&nbsp; This is done in three ways:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Selection and constraint</strong></dt>
				<dd>In small-groups, i.e., around twenty or fewer, tutors may select the next person to take a turn, either 
				by naming them or by alluding to them in some way.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the question we should be asking, John?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Well, we have two people here who have been reading the text.&nbsp; 
				Does either of you have a question?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do those who will actually do the work want to know?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Tutors may signal who is to respond to something said by using 
				gaze, focusing on whoever is required to contribute.&nbsp; Being 
				alert to what shifting gaze means is a cultural issue in part 
				but can be taught.<br />
				In this case, the learner needs to recognise two important 
				points: not only that it is his or her turn to ask a question or 
				make a point but also that the topic of the question has been constrained by what the 
				tutor is currently talking about.&nbsp; Off-topic questions are 
				not usually welcome.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Constraint</strong></dt>
				<dd>In lecture settings, a speaker may not have the luxury of 
				selecting questioners because participant names are unknown or 
				because the audience is simply too large.<br />
				In this case the speaker needs to rely on constraint alone but 
				the constraint is often signalled explicitly, by the parts 
				underlined in the following examples:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone have a question
				<span class="style_underline">about these figures</span>?</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Bearing </em><span class="style_underline"><em>this</em></span><em> 
				in mind, does anyone have a question?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone need to ask anything about </em>
				<span class="style_underline"><em>the results so far</em></span><em> 
				before we go on?</em><br />
				Failure to notice question-topic constraint is quite serious 
				because it irritates the tutor / lecturer as well as other 
				participants.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Open-ended invitation</strong></dt>
				<dd>A tutor may do neither of the above and simply signal the 
				fact that a question from anyone on any topic is welcome.&nbsp; 
				This may occur at the end of teaching phases by the tutor 
				falling silent or signalling open endedness by, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Is there anything at all anyone wants to ask?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any questions about anything?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Recognising the lack of topic constraint may be as important as 
				recognising its existence.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>These three turn passing mechanisms come in order of precedence.&nbsp; 
			Selection of questioner overrides constraint by topic and selection 
			plus constraint is the most powerful strategy.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>

					<img alt="signalling" height="133" src="../../images/signal_semaphore200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h3>Sending the signals</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Lecturers and tutors need to know when someone needs to ask a 
			question (although they are not universally good at doing so).<br />
			Four of the ways learners can signal that they want to ask 
			something, providing the speaker has signalled that questions are 
			welcome, are:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>taking a sharp intake of breath (small groups only)</li>
				<li>leaning forward (small groups or front-row occupiers of 
				lecture theatre groups)</li>
				<li>raising a finger (small groups)</li>
				<li>raising a hand (larger groups)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Again, this is a culturally determined issue.&nbsp; In most 
			English-speaking societies, power distances are low and the posing 
			of a question carries little threat to the speaker.&nbsp; In fact, 
			questions are often welcomed and in some contexts, even planted.<br />
			In other cultures, questioning implies that the speaker has been 
			unclear or what has been said is incomplete.&nbsp; In that 
			circumstance, asking a question threatens the speaker's face and 
			needs to be done with great care.</p>

					<td class="auto-style3"><h3>Forming the question</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<ol>
				<li>People like to know what they are about to be asked.<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>Questions such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; What the significance?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it important?</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					are unwelcome because the questioner has not signalled the 
					topic carefully enough.</li>
					<li>Questions framed in these ways are more welcome:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My question concerns the first set of 
					data and I'd like to know ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you believe the significance of the second kind of 
					response is?</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					are more welcome because the speaker knows instantly what 
					the topic is and can spot off-topic questions and act 
					accordingly.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Even lecturers like a complement.&nbsp; Questions preceded 
				with, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that's really interesting.&nbsp; 
				What ...?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's very helpful.&nbsp; How much ...?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				are usually more welcome than just jumping in.</li>
				<li>It is easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.<br />
				Off-topic questions may be tolerated if they are properly 
				framed.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realise this is a bit off topic but may 
				I ask ...?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This might not be relevant but do you know ...?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				may be allowable.</li>
				<li>Most interactions between educators and students in 
				English-speaking cultures may be described semi-formal so the 
				question needs to be properly phrased.<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>So, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the importance of ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why ...?</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>Are less appropriate than, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can ask whether ...?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you tell us if ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you say that ...?</em><br />
					etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Learners need to know that, especially, but not exclusively, 
				in small-group settings, the questioner needs to acknowledge 
				whatever response has been given so something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; That's clearer now.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, I see.&nbsp; Thank you.</em><br />
				is appropriate.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All of this is eminently teachable and learnable.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Questions are not confined to the elicitation of information.&nbsp; 
			For EAP learners in particular, other question types can be more 
			important because language issues may obstruct comprehension.&nbsp; 
			Different types of questions and their formulations need to be 
			taught.&nbsp; There are three main sorts</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Checking one's own comprehension.<br />
				Questions such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I right in thinking ...?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would I be wrong if I assumed ...?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I assume that ...</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				are all ways to check that one has understood accurately.</li>
				<li>Requesting repetition or reformulation.<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>Questions such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you go over that point again?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you explain again what ...?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you say that again?</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					ask for repetition and are requests, not questions.</li>
					<li>Questions such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you put that another way?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there another way you could explain this?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that the same as saying ...?</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					ask for reformulation and are requests not questions.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Challenging.<br />
				Questions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that always the case?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we to believe that ...?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How reliable are the data?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What evidence do we have that ...?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				are all ways of challenging the speaker to justify comments 
				made.<br />
				They should be handled with care, even in low-power-distance 
				settings such as listening to a peer's presentation.</li>
			</ol>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Sooner or later in most educational settings, students are 
			expected to present data to their tutors and colleagues.&nbsp; This 
			is, for the EAP learner, pretty scary.<br />
			There are ways to prepare learners for this kind of event whatever 
			subject matter they are having to present.&nbsp; Usually, 
			presentations are of two types:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Formal presentations to groups of peers (and the tutor(s)) 
				in which the speaker takes a central position and is backed up 
				by data, audio-visual aids and so on.</li>
				<li>Less formal situations in which the learner is expected to 
				present a prepared answer to colleagues and the tutor in a 
				seminar setting.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Considerations are the same for both types of presentation.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style3"><h3>Genre</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Presentations will usually fall into one of these categories and their 
			staging will be predictable and conventional.&nbsp; Straying from 
			conventional staging will confuse and bewilder listeners.&nbsp; 
			Longer and more complex presentations may embed, for example, 
			discussion of controversies within an information report, but the 
			general outlines of each type will be unaffected.<br />
			It is important to recognise that the conventional staging set out 
			here concerns life in an English-speaking environment.&nbsp; 
			Conventional staging of generic categories is culturally variable so 
			this has to be taught, not assumed.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Recount</strong></dt>
				<dd>A recount is intended to set out clearly what has happened.&nbsp; 
				It is the format for reporting back on experiments conducted, 
				surveys carried out and work done.<br />
				It works like this:<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>Orientation (what was done):<br />
					For example:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>This survey was carried out to discover how the populations 
					of seals in the sea off Malta has varied over the year.</em></span></li>
					<li>Records of events (in chronological order):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>The first measures were taken 
					on [date] and further counts were made at monthly intervals 
					until ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Reorientation (a summary referring to what was done):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>From the data we gathered, it 
					is possible to see how the population has varied over the 
					year.&nbsp; The data are ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Coda (evaluation of results):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>We feel that this data should 
					be used by government in order to ...<br />
					Further studies will be needed to know if ...</em></span></li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Procedure</strong></dt>
				<dd>A procedure text (spoken or written) is intended to explain 
				how something is done.<br />
				It works like this:<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>Goal (what the procedure is intended to achieve):<br />
					For example:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>This presentation focuses on how meteorological measurements 
					are taken and recorded.</em></span></li>
					<li>Materials (what is required):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>We need normally to have a 
					pluviometer to record rainfall, a minimum-maximum 
					thermometer to record temperatures, ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Steps (in a logical sequence):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>Setting up the equipment is 
					done as follows ...<br />
					Measurements are taken by ...<br />
					Records are kept in the form of ...</em></span></li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Information report</strong></dt>
				<dd>An information report is intended to present data logically 
				and has a simple structure although the ordering of information 
				in the second stage needs careful attention.<br />
				It works like this:<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>General statement (identification of the subject):<br />
					For example:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>Internet-enhanced learning may be defined as ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Description (these data need to be logically categorised):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>Most internet-enhanced 
					learning programmes have three elements.&nbsp; The first is 
					the transmission of data, the second is the ability to 
					submit online assignments and the third is the ability to 
					interact with teachers and other students.&nbsp; I'll take 
					these in turn ...</em></span><br />
					Then the presentation will follow the pattern set out here 
					by the speaker.&nbsp; Straying from it will confuse and 
					irritate the audience.</li>
					<li>Evaluation and suggestion (this is optional)<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>From these data, it seems 
					logical to use a full enhanced learning programme with these 
					learners.</em></span></li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Discussion</strong></dt>
				<dd>A discussion is intended to present both sides of a 
				controversy and is more common in the humanities than the 
				sciences.<br />
				It has two possible structures because stages two and three may be combined with 
				the arguments for and against presented in pairs.&nbsp; It works 
				like this:<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>Issue (what I am discussing):<br />
					For example:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>Whether health care should remain free at the point of need 
					is not a new controversy but ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Arguments for (each point requires some 
					exemplification):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>A free healthcare service has 
					four distinct advantages for society:<br />
					Firstly, it provides ... .&nbsp; For example, ...</em></span><br />
					This section and the next may also include some 
					consideration of causes and effects.&nbsp; There is a 
					separate guide on this site concerning the ways English does 
					this linked in the list of related guides at the end.</li>
					<li>Arguments against (exemplified):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>There are also four major 
					drawbacks:<br />
					Firstly, the expense ... .&nbsp; For example, a single 
					cataract operation costs ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Coda (this is an optional stage)<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>On the whole, I feel that ...</em></span></li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>There is a fifth category which may be considered: <strong>
			exposition</strong>.<br />
			This is rarer because the speaker is presenting a one-sided 
			argument, not discussing an issue objectively.&nbsp; The staging is 
			similar to that of a discussion text except that the thesis to be 
			argued comes at the beginning and one set of arguments, either those 
			for or against, is excluded.&nbsp; The final coda is replaced by a

			<p>There are some commonalities to consider when teaching this type 
			of structuring and practising the skill of presenting.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>All presentations begin with a statement of the topic: 
				orientation, goal, identification of topic or issue to be 
				discussed.</li>
				<li>Logical staging is essential to maintain coherence: 
				switching stages around or mixing them up will result in 
				incoherence.</li>
				<li>Most presentations will end with a summary and/or some 
				kind of coda to signal the end.</li>
				<li>Most presentations will allow time for and invite questions 
				from the audience.</li>
				<li>Many presentations will be followed by a general discussion 
				in which turn-taking skills will be at a premium.&nbsp; See the 
				link below for a guide to more on that.</li>

					<td class="auto-style3"><h3>Pressures</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are a number of pressures on anyone speaking in public.&nbsp; 
			In the classroom, we can reduce them somewhat.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Preparation level<br />
				Off-the-cuff presentations are not for most people.&nbsp; 
				Learners operating in a foreign language are even less able to 
				present <em>impromptu</em> and it isn't fair to ask them to do 
				so.<br />
				It is important, therefore to build in preparation time to any 
				teaching programme aimed at presentation techniques.<br />
				Being well prepared and knowing that you are, reduces the 
				pressure considerably.</li>
				<li>Topic familiarity<br />
				Trying simultaneously to research a new topic and prepare a 
				presentation on it is an unnecessary pressure in the classroom 
				so care should be taken, especially at the beginning, to allow 
				the learner to decide on the topic.&nbsp; That way, they can 
				focus on the presentation not the data because the latter are 
				well known to them.</li>
				<li>Audience size<br />
				Pressure increases in direct ratio to audience size so one way 
				to reduce the pressure is to get people to practise their 
				presentations in small groups of three or four before they have 
				to take the step up to presenting to the whole group.&nbsp; 
				Repeating a presentation may seem somewhat dull to us but it is 
				not seen that way by learners who appreciate the opportunity to 
				repeat a presentation more than once.</li>
				<li>Using visual aids<br />
				Visual aids can be extremely helpful or just an irritation 
				depending on how well they are designed.&nbsp; There are two 
				issues:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>They act as an irritation when they are used <strong>
					instead of</strong> explanation and description; they are 
					helpful when they are used <strong>to supplement</strong> 
					explanation and description to present data which cannot (or 
					should not) simply be read out.&nbsp; We have probably all 
					attended a presentation in which the speaker projects a 
					slogan and then reads it to us.&nbsp; That's a waste of 
					everyone's time.</li>
					<li>They have a further useful function when used well and 
					that is to replace the speaker's notes.&nbsp; If, for 
					example, slides are projected which refer to key data and 
					ideas, they will serve to remind the speaker of what should 
					be emphasised.&nbsp; If they are used indiscriminately, they 
					simply overwhelm the audience with detail and people lose 
					the thread.&nbsp; A rough rule of thumb is not to use more 
					than one slide per five minutes of the presentation.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Language unfamiliarity<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>The first area of language which needs to be tackled 
					before most people can even begin a presentation is that of 
					verbalising graphical data.<br />
					Practising the skill of looking at, say, a graph such as:<br />
					<img alt="bar chart" height="194" src="../../imagesgraphics/bar_chart.png" width="310" /><br />
					and being able to say something like<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>As can be seen, Series 3 
					remained around 2.0 for the first two Categories but 
					increased by 50% in the third Category and had more than 
					doubled by Category 4.</em></span><br />
					is valuable practice for anyone aiming to be able to present 
					data verbally.&nbsp; We need to do more than show the data, 
					we need to be able to explain them.</li>
					<li>Secondly, learners need to master a range of 
					prefabricated language to increase their fluency.&nbsp; 
					Examples are:<ol class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>To gather one's thoughts when questioned:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style6">Well, let me see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for the question.&nbsp; It's an important one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm, that's an 
				interesting question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, now, what I can say is ...</span></em></li>
						<li>To present a personal opinion (a coda, usually):<br /><em><span class="auto-style6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as far as I'm concerned<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				to my mind<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				in my view<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				as far as I can see<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				it seems to me that</span></em></li>
						<li>To orientate the audience:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">&nbsp;Now we 
						can move on to the second issue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarise ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essential point is ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way of saying this is ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example of what I mean is ...</span></em></li>
						<li>To invite questions:<br /><em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy 
						to try to answer any questions you may have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone have a question they'd like to ask?</span></em></li>
						<li>To deal with interruption:<br /><em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll come 
						to that at the end, if I may<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll take that point later.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's an interesting point but we don't have time for a full 
						discussion now.</span></em></li>

					<h3>Visualising a presentation</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>A useful technique for EAP learners asked to give a presentation 
			is to get them to visualise it before they deliver it.&nbsp; It has 
			advantages:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It makes them less reliant on their notes, helping them to 
				be more mobile and maintain eye contact with the audience</li>
				<li>It increases their confidence because they will feel better 
				prepared</li>
				<li>It lets them see where they may need more content (or fewer 
				PowerPoint slides)</li>
				<li>It allows them to predict what people may ask and prepare 
				some kind of answer</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It works like this:</p>
			<h4>Step 1: learn the presentation</h4>
			<p>Learners should sit with their plan for the presentation and make 
			sure they can, without looking at it, recite the essential stages of 
			the talk.&nbsp; Depending on the genre (see above), this will 
			require four or five stages to be recited.</p>
			<h4>Step 2: run through the stages</h4>
			<p>This is where the use of visual aids such as projected slides is 
			most helpful.&nbsp; As was noted above, slides and other graphics 
			can replace the speaker's notes altogether if they are confined to 
			the key ideas in the talk.</p>
			<p>Once the staging is clear and memorised, learners need to focus 
			on</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>what they will say at the beginning of the presentation</li>
				<li>what they will say when displaying any data graphically (see 
				above under language familiarity)</li>
				<li>what they will say at the beginning of each stage</li>
				<li>how they will signal transitions between stages</li>
				<li>how they will signal the end and invite questions and 
				comments</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Step 3: reduce the notes</h4>
			<p>Learners can now re-visit their notes and reduce them to key words 
			on cards.&nbsp; If this procedure has been followed to the end, they 
			may not need the cards, but most people like some reassurance.</p>
			<h4>Step 4: visualise the whole presentation</h4>
			<p>The learners should now find somewhere comfortable to sit or lie and, with 
			their eyes 
			closed, visualise the whole presentation from start to finish.&nbsp; In 
			particular focusing on getting the order and staging right and going 
			over in their minds the short language chunks they need to memorise 
			to help them speak fluently</p>
			<h4>Step 5: questions</h4>
			<p>The final stage, before repeating Step 4 as often as necessary, 
			is to try to imagine what questions people are likely to ask and how 
			they will field them.</p>

			</table>
			<p>There are a few logistical matters to attend to, not least:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>Setting up the room appropriately so the presenter is 
				comfortable with the arrangement.</li>
				<li>Making sure the equipment is functioning as it should and 
				knowing what to do if it doesn't.</li>
				<li>Making sure everyone shows respect by turning up on time and 
				being quiet and attentive.&nbsp; It'll be their turn soon.</li>
				<li>Allowing for overrunning.&nbsp; Novice presenters, in any 
				language, are often poor at knowing how long something will 
				take.&nbsp; It's disturbing and can even be distressing to be 
				hurried along or cut short.</li>
				<li>Having a question or two in mind yourself to get the ball 
				rolling at the end of the presentation.</li>
				<li>Making sure the topic of the presentation is known to 
				everyone in the group.&nbsp; This simulates what will happen 
				when they attend lectures or lessons for real.</li>
				<li>During and before any student-led presentation, we should 
				not forego the opportunity for the other learners to practise 
				their note-making skills and their questioning strategies.&nbsp; 
				See <a href="listening_eap.html">the separate guide</a> for the 
				former and above for the latter.</li>

			<p>That is obviously not the end of the range of speaking skills 
			that learners will need when attending an English-speaking 
			educational institution.&nbsp; However, most other speaking skills 
			do not lie specifically in the realm of English for Academic 
			Purposes.&nbsp; They include:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>Cooperating in peer groups to get tasks done<ul class="greybullet">
					<li class="smallgreybullet">starting tasks</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">planning</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">setting aims</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">agreeing</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">suggesting</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">negotiating</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">objecting</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">encouraging</li>
					<li class="smallgreybullet">volunteering</li>
				</ul>

				<li>Interacting with authorities<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>getting permission</li>
					<li>getting help</li>
					<li>explaining</li>
					<li>getting information</li>
					<li>complaining</li>

					<li>apologising</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Socialising</li>
				<li>Living in an English-speaking society</li>

			English programme as they will form part of an EAP course.</p>
