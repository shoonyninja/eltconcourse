			<h1>Writing in EAP: understanding generic structures</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="structure" height="207" src="../../images/structure_staircase310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p class="indentpara"><em>When texts share the same
		general purpose in the culture, they 
		will often share the same obligatory 
		and optional structural elements and so 
		they belong to the same genre or text type.</em><br />
		<span class="smallfont"><span class="auto-style17">(Butt </span> 
		<em>et al</em><span class="auto-style17">, p9)</span></span></p>
			<p>This guide focuses in particular on the generic structures that 
			most EAP learners will need to produce.&nbsp; These structures are 
			not confined to EAP, of course, as they are conventional across the 
			whole speech community.&nbsp; In particular, some public 
			examinations in General English require adhesion to a conventional 
			structure and staging.<br />
			This guide is concerned with:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Identifying the generic structures which EAP students may be 
				required to employ</li>
				<li>Identifying within those genres (or text types, if you 
				prefer) the conventional way(s) in 
				which information is staged</li>
				<li>Identifying the critical language structures and lexis 
				within each genre that the EAP student needs to master</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Student writing will usually fall into one of the categories 
			mapped out below and their 
			staging will be predictable and conventional.&nbsp; Straying from 
			conventional generic structure will result in an unacceptable loss 
			of coherence for readers who operate in an English-speaking 
			environment.<br />
			It is important to recognise that the conventional staging set out 
			here concerns life in an English-speaking environment.&nbsp; 
			Conventional staging of generic categories is culturally variable so 
			this has to be taught, not assumed.</p>

			<p>Probably in five and they may be required to embed one generic 
			form in another so the variations are large but not unpredictable.<br />
			Here are the five with their purposes outlined:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Recount</strong></dt>
				<dd>A recount is intended to set out clearly what has happened.&nbsp; 
				It is the format for reporting back on experiments conducted, 
				surveys carried out and work done.<br />
				The same structure is often used in retailing anecdotes and 
				stories in informal speech but that is not something that 
				concerns us here.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Procedure</strong></dt>
				<dd>A procedure text (spoken or written) is intended to explain 
				how something is done.&nbsp; This form of writing may well be 
				embedded in a different structure because digressions to explain 
				how something works are common in other forms of writing.&nbsp; 
				We'll come to that.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Information report / Explanation</strong></dt>
				<dd>An information report is intended to present data logically 
				and has a simple structure although the ordering of information 
				needs careful attention.&nbsp; This form of writing is common 
				when a student is asked to summarise the results of reading and 
				research to demonstrate understanding.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Discussion</strong></dt>
				<dd>A discussion is intended to present both sides of a 
				controversy and is more common in the humanities than the 
				sciences.<br />
				This kind of text is, naturally, what is required when 
				departments issue essay titles containing the word <em>Discuss</em>.&nbsp; 
				Often, within a discussion, it is necessary to embed other text 
				forms as digressions or explanation phases.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Exposition</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is a less likely format for a full essay but may form 
				part of a thesis or statement of view after an information 
				report, for example.&nbsp; In this, writer presents a one-sided 
				argument, not discussing an issue objectively from both sides 
				but attempting to persuade the reader.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>There are some commonalities:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>All academic writing, whatever its structure and topic, needs 
				to be clearly signposted and ordered for the reader to make 
				sense of the progression of the argument or the presentation of 
				information.</li>
				<li>Most writing of this type will begin with an introduction 
				setting out the definition of the theme and saying what will be 
				covered in what follows (as well as what may be excluded for any 
				reason).</li>
				<li>Most writing of this type requires a conclusion alluding to 
				the main points and, sometimes, mapping a way forward.</li>
				<li>Logical staging is essential to maintain coherence: 
				switching stages around or mixing them up will result in 
				incoherence.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We can take the five structures in turn, considering their 
			staging.<br />
			Then we can take a look at the critical language systems learners 
			need to master to successfully use the conventions.<br />
			At the end, we'll turn to the question of embedding generic 
			structures within each other to signal changes of topic and 
			digressions.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Recounts</strong></dt>
				<dd>Because recounts essentially tell a story, they tend to take 
				on a chronological structure and are mostly written in past 
				tenses.&nbsp; It should be noted that recounts are not the same 
				as narratives or stories, however.&nbsp; Narratives usually 
				contain a complication to be resolved (hence their fairytale 
				nature).&nbsp; Recounts are more sober and objective.<br />
				The example we will use here is a recount of how a survey was 
				carried out but the form will be unchanged for recounting how an 
				experiment was conducted or a piece of design work accomplished.<br />
				Recounts are often inserted at the beginning of a discussion of 
				the outcomes of the survey or experiment to orientate the reader 
				and describe the background.<br />
				Recounts work this way:<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>Orientation (what was done, when and why):<br />
					For example:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>This survey was carried out to discover how the views of 
					workers in the industry influence management decisions over 
					a period of three weeks in ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Records of events (in chronological order):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>The first polling of views 
					took place in ... and was designed to provide data to refine 
					the second stage of the survey<br />
					Next, ...<br />
					Finally ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Reorientation (a summary referring to what was done):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>In all, over 300 sets of data 
					were gathered to show whether and how the views have been 
					influential in ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Coda (evaluation of results):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>The results are as yet not 
					firm evidence for the theory that ...<br />
					Further studies will be needed to know if ...</em></span></li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Procedures</strong></dt>
				<dd>A procedure text is intended to explain <strong>how</strong> something is done, 
				not what was done.&nbsp; In other words, it acts as a handbook 
				from which anyone else could perform the procedure successfully 
				and often answers an essay rubric contain the word <em>Explain</em>.&nbsp; 
				By their nature, therefore, procedure texts are often written in 
				the present tense to imply that this <strong>is</strong> how 
				something is done not how something <strong>was</strong> 
				done.<br />
				It works like this:<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>Goal (what the procedure is intended to achieve):<br />
					For example:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>This procedure is intended to show how library resources can 
					be shared more widely in educational institutions.</em></span></li>
					<li>Materials (what is required):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>IT resources, adequate 
					staffing and a reliable on-site digital information 
					distribution system needs to be in place before any further 
					consideration can be given to a project.</em></span></li>
					<li>Steps (in a logical sequence):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>The first step is to set aims 
					for the project in terms of the numbers of participants, the 
					range of resources that will initially be available and the 
					types of data registered users will require.<br />
					Secondly, ...<br />
					Thirdly, ...<br />
					...<br />
					Finally, ...</em></span></li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Information reports and Explanations</strong></dt>
				<dd>An information report is an extremely common form of student 
				essay because it demonstrates reading and research and tells the 
				tutorial staff what has been learned.&nbsp; It is, of itself, a 
				form of learning exercise.&nbsp; The tutors, after all, are 
				familiar with the topic so it is also an assessment tool.<br />
				An information report can also take the form of an <strong>
				Explanation</strong>.&nbsp; In that case, the text's purpose is 
				to explain how something happens.&nbsp;
				This is also the format in which so-called cause-and-effect 
				texts are produced.&nbsp; These texts follow the same pattern 
				but have an alternate presentation of the data, divided into 
				sections Cause 1 → Effect 1, Cause 2 → Effect 2 etc.&nbsp; More 
				rarely, the ordering is reversed to list the effects first and 
				link the causes to them in the following text.<br />
				It works like this:<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>General statement (identification of the subject):<br />
					For example, for an Information report:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>The origins of the English language can be traced to the 
					early 5th century when Frisians, Saxons, Angles and Jutes 
					first began to invade the south of Great Britain.<br />
					</em></span>Or, for an Explanation:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>Sand dunes track across territory in predictable ways.</em></span></li>
					<li>Description.&nbsp; These data need to be logically categorised.&nbsp; 
					Here, because of the topic, the most logical system may be 
					chronological but different topics will call for varied 
					ordering.<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>A chronological approach to 
					the subject shows that ....</em></span><br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>By the 6th century, ....<br />
					Thereafter, ...<br />
					Towards the end of this period ...<br />
					</em></span>
					Or, for an Explanation with a Cause → Effect structure:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>Sand is blown by the prevailing wind, is stripped from the 
					base of the dune and deposited over the crest.&nbsp; In this 
					way, the dune slowly tracks across the landscape ...<br /></em></span>
					Then the writing will follow the pattern set out in the 
					introduction.&nbsp; Straying from it will confuse and 
					irritate the reader.</li>
					<li>In academic texts, there will often be a 
					conclusion or coda in which the writer sums up the most 
					important information and suggests a way forward to gather 
					more.<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>We can see, therefore, that 
					...<br />
					More research is needed to discover ...</em></span><br />
					</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Discussions</strong></dt>
				<dd>A discussion is intended to present both sides of a 
				controversy and is more common in the humanities than the 
				sciences.<br />
				This kind of text may stand alone or be part of any of the other 
				text types so far considered.&nbsp; In some cases, discussion 
				routines may be inserted at various stages of, for example, a 
				recount of an experiment or survey or an information report when 
				a summing up of the information presented so far is required or 
				the methodology needs to be discussed.<br />
				It has two possible structures because stages two and three may be combined with 
				the arguments for and against presented in pairs.&nbsp; It works 
				like this:<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>Issue (what I am discussing):<br />
					For example:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>Whether the evidence for mass extinction around this time in 
					earth's history is reliable is mostly an issue of ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Arguments for (each point requires some 
					exemplification):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>Some authorities, ... and ... 
					for example highlight the parallel findings of ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Arguments against (exemplified):<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>Others, particularly 
					researchers in ... point to large discrepancies between ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Coda (this is an optional stage)<br />
					For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>While no firm conclusions can 
					yet be drawn, it seems eminently arguable that ...</em></span></li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				
				<dt><strong>Expositions</strong></dt>
				<dd>We have noted that this form of text is less likely to 
					be required in a full essay format but exposition may be 
					asked for in prepared answers to tutorial questions or as 
					part of a longer text whose overall structure is discursive 
					rather than argumentative.<br />The staging is 
			similar to that of a discussion text except that the thesis to be 
			argued comes at the beginning and one set of arguments, either those 
			for or against, is excluded.&nbsp; The final coda is replaced by a 
			statement reinforcing the speaker's thesis and is usually not 
			optional.&nbsp; Like this:<ul class="greenbullet">
						<li>Issue (what I am arguing):<br />For example:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>The case for asserting that second or subsequent languages 
					cannot be learned by adults in the same way as their first 
					language was acquired is unanswerable.</em></span></li>
						<li>Arguments for the thesis (each point requires some 
					exemplification):<br />For example:<br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>There is, firstly, no reliable 
					evidence to show ...<br />In the second place, research by ... has leads firmly to the 
					conclusion that ...<br />Furthermore, ...<br />...<br />And finally, ...</em></span></li>
						<li>Coda (this is not an optional stage)<br />For example:<br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>From the evidence presented 
					here, it seems perverse not to accept that ...</em></span></li>
					</ul>
					</dd>
			</dl>
			
			<p>The first danger many EAP students need to avoid is to slip from 
			a discussion format into an exposition.&nbsp; The use of terms such as
			<em>Obviously, ..., Clearly, ..., It therefore follows that ..</em>. 
			etc. is a sure sign that this is what has happened.&nbsp; Equally, 
			the insertion of deontic modality (<em>we should, we must, it is 
			vital</em> to etc.) is another sign that the writer is indulging in 
			exposition rather than discussion.&nbsp; See below.</p>
			<p>We shall consider below what the implications of understanding 
			text staging are when it comes to planning, drafting and reviewing 
			writing.</p>

			<p>The issue here is maintaining coherence <strong>within</strong> the sections of a text.</p>
			<p>You are probably familiar with the idea that the first sentence 
			of many paragraphs in written texts signals the writer's theme for 
			the paragraph.&nbsp; This is often called the 'topic sentence'.</p>
			<p>Here is an example from Wikipedia concerning the formation of sea 
			and land breezes.&nbsp; You will recognise instantly now that this 
			is an Explanation text.&nbsp; Sentence numbers have been inserted
			<span class="auto-style69">{n} </span>to make the analysis that 
			follows easier to understand.&nbsp; Otherwise the text is unchanged.</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="auto-style69">{1} </span>A sea 
			breeze or onshore breeze is any wind that blows from a large body of 
			water toward or onto a landmass; <span class="auto-style69">{2}
			</span>it develops due to differences in air pressure created by the 
			differing heat capacities of water and dry land.
			<span class="auto-style69">{3} </span>As such, sea breezes are more 
			localised than prevailing winds. <span class="auto-style69">{4}
			</span>Because land absorbs solar radiation far more quickly than 
			water, a sea breeze is a common occurrence along coasts after 
			sunrise.</p>
			<p>Here, the writer of this has maintained cohesion with the 
			use of a single pronoun reference.&nbsp; The writer has, more 
			importantly, maintained coherence by logically 
			linking the text together so the reader is led through it.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first clause sets the scene and is called the theme 
				(it's the nominalised <span class="style_black"><em>A sea breeze 
				or onshore breeze ...</em></span>).<br />
				The rheme of that is<em><span class="style_black"> is any wind that blows 
				from a large body of water toward or onto a landmass</span>;<br />
				</em>This is the topic sentence and carries the essential definition.</li>
				<li>This rheme functions as the theme of the following sentence 
				(in this case, separated by a semi-colon which could just as 
				well be a full stop).&nbsp; The theme of this part is just 				<span class="style_black"><em>it</em></span>.<br />
				This has the rheme <em><span class="style_black">develops due to 
				differences in air pressure created by the differing heat 
				capacities of water and dry land.</span></em></li>
				<li>The same theme, <span class="style_black"><em>sea breezes</em></span>, 
				is used for the next sentence and that has the rheme,
				<span class="style_black"><em>are more localised than prevailing 
				winds</em></span>.</li>
				<li>Now the writer uses the uses part of the rheme of sentence 
				2., <span class="style_black"><em>land</em></span>, as the theme 
				of sentence 4.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The text continues to contrast sea and land breezes before 
			returning to the rheme of sentence 3 as the theme of a sentence 
			concerning <span class="style_black"><em>prevailing winds</em></span>.</p>
			<p>This is how well written paragraphs hang together and guide the 
			reader smoothly through the text.&nbsp; There is much more to it 
			than this and not all texts will conform to such a neat structure.&nbsp; 
			It is possible, for example, for theme 1 to have rheme 1 and for 
			that to become theme 5 later in the text and so on.&nbsp; Theme-rheme 
			structures can look nice and tidy, like this:<br />
			<img alt="theme rheme" src="../../imagesgraphics/theme_rheme.png" /><br />
			with each sentence neatly divided into a theme and its rheme, 
			following a simple format.&nbsp; This need not be the case because 
			coordinated clauses can have their own internal theme-rheme 
			structure.&nbsp; For example, the compound-complex sentence such as</p>
			<p class="auto-style73"><span class="style_red"><strong><em>The 
			accuracy of the reading </em></strong></span>
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>was compromised</em></strong></span><em> 
			and </em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>this</em></strong></span>
			<strong><em>led to some reduction in reliability </em></strong>
			<span class="style_underline"><em>which</em></span>
			<span class="auto-style70"><strong><em>led to this experiment being 
			repeated</em></strong></span><em> and </em>
			<span class="auto-style70"><strong><em>the new experiment </em>
			</strong></span><span class="auto-style74"><strong><em>produced 
			better results</em></strong></span><em>.&nbsp; </em>
			<span class="auto-style74"><strong><em>These results</em></strong></span><em> 
			...</em></p>
			<p>has an initial theme (<span class="style_red"><strong>in red</strong></span>) 
			with its rheme (<span class="style_black"><strong>in black</strong></span>) 
			becoming a new theme after the conjunction (<span class="style_black"><strong><em>this</em></strong></span>) with a new rheme (<strong>in 
			blue</strong>) which is the theme of the following clause (<span class="style_underline">underlined</span>).&nbsp; 
			This has a rheme (<span class="auto-style70"><strong>in green</strong></span>) 
			which forms the theme following the conjunction which has a rheme (<span class="auto-style74"><strong>in 
			pink</strong></span>) forming the theme of the next sentence.<br />
			That's quite complicated but not impossible for learners to notice 
			and emulate.</p>
			<p>The situations can also be more complex, like this:<br />
			<img alt="theme rheme" src="../../imagesgraphics/theme_rheme3.png" /><br />
			where:<br />
			Theme 1 has rheme 1 which becomes theme 2 with a new rheme 2.<br />
			Rheme 2 becomes both theme 3 and theme 4.<br />
			Then rheme 3 becomes theme 5 and rheme 4 becomes theme 8 and so on.<br />
			The more the theme-rheme structure is disturbed, the more difficult 
			the text is to navigate and comprehend and the more lost the writer 
			can become.</p>
			<p>At the beginning of a writing course, learners should 
			be encouraged to link things simply.&nbsp; Later, they can 
			experiment with making rheme 2 into theme 6 and so on.<br />
			They can't do this unless they have been led to notice how 
			theme-rheme structuring works, of course, and that is a matter for a 
			bit of classroom text analysis to which we shall come.</p>

			<p>You can't teach people to write well quickly.&nbsp; Teaching 
			writing requires a series of connected lessons which build gradually 
			on what has been covered before.&nbsp; The following is concerned, 
			therefore, with an approach, not a lesson or even a series of 
			lessons.<br />
			Such a course can be structured in two ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Start from the text types and take each in turn focusing on 
				its typical structure and staging and on its typical language 
				exponents separately.</li>
				<li>Start with structure first and analyse the structure of each 
				text type before going on to repeat the process with the typical 
				language content.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There's no right way (sorry) but the approaches can be combined.&nbsp; 
			Whichever procedure is used, the work starts with analysis and 
			modelling.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="analysis" height="133" src="../../images/test_dropper200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h3>Analyse</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Whether you are looking at structure or content, one effective 
			way forward is to start with a model text in the target genre.&nbsp; 
			Choose something easily understood by and relevant to your learners.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			This is an awareness raising exercise, not an attempt to teach 
			new language from scratch.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first thing to do is to get the learners to identify the 
				text's purpose.&nbsp; This is not as easy as it sounds, 
				sometimes, because many people are unused to looking at texts 
				this way.<br />
				Given, however, one example of each text type and being asked to 
				match a purpose to the text is a beginning.<br />
				Then you can try the exercise again with some other texts and 
				get the learners to recall the categories you gave them to match 
				in the first exercise.</li>
				<li>At this stage, you need to focus very explicitly on what 
				phenomena in the text betrayed its purpose.&nbsp; This might be 
				the title, the introduction, the structure of the staging of 
				information, the kinds of verbal processes used and so on.&nbsp; 
				It is usually a combination of signals and learners need to be 
				able to unravel them.</li>
				<li>For text structure and staging:<ol class="auto-style16">
					<li>Cut up the text into its constituent stages and get the 
					students to arrange it logically.</li>
					<li>Get the learners to match given stage purposes to each 
					part they have put in order.&nbsp; For example, Statement of 
					goal, Personal evaluation, First argument against and so on.</li>
					<li>Get the students to write, individually, on single slips 
					of paper, the first sentence of each stage of the essay they 
					are planning.</li>
					<li>Now get them to exchange the slips of paper to see if 
					their colleagues can identify which sentence belongs in 
					which part.</li>
					<li>Repeat for as many text types as you need to have the 
					learners recognise and produce.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>For some theme and rheme work:<ol class="auto-style16">
					<li><span class="style_black">Highlighting theme-rheme 
					structures in sentences like this</span>
					<span class="style_red"><strong>is a place to begin</strong></span>.&nbsp;
					<span class="style_red"><strong>This</strong></span> <strong>
					helps learners to notice how the language is arranged</strong>.&nbsp;
					<strong>This arrangement</strong> <span class="auto-style70">
					<strong>is common to almost all written texts</strong></span>.&nbsp;
					<span class="auto-style70"><strong>The texts</strong></span>
					<span class="auto-style74"><strong>will be easier to 
					navigate if learners are aware of the organisation</strong>.&nbsp;
					<strong>Awareness of organisation</strong></span> 
					will lead to more cohesive texts in their own writing.</li>
					<li>Re-ordering of the sentences of a paragraph can be 
					revealing in terms of getting learners to notice how rhemes 
					become later themes and keep a text coherent.</li>
					<li>As we saw above, Wikipedia is a good source of short, 
					well-written texts which exemplify theme-rheme structures.</li>
					<li>Being alert to failures in theme-rheme structures when 
					you are reading your students' work is also helpful because 
					it allows you to scaffold their efforts by drawing their 
					attention to any breakdown in coherence.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>For typical language content:<ol class="auto-style16">
					<li>Take the sample text and highlight in different colours 
					typical language uses.&nbsp; For example, 
					<span class="auto-style70">present tense 
					material verb processes</span>, <span class="style_red">adverbials of time</span>, 
					<span class="style_black">causality 
					signalling conjuncts</span> and <span class="auto-style74">conjunctions</span> etc.</li>
					<li>Lead the learners to identifying what the colour-coded 
					bits have in common.</li>
					<li>Teach the forms if necessary.&nbsp; Discuss the effects 
					of each target language item type and its role in the text.</li>
					<li>Get the learners to write some of the content of the 
					essay they are planning using the same (or the same type) of 
					language items.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can't possibly do the above thoroughly in less than a whole 
			series of writing lessons.</p>
			<p>Now we can get on to producing texts.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>

			</table>
			<p>This is another long process.<br />
			At the outset, writers need <strong>explicitly</strong> to be able 
			to say what the overall purpose of the text they are going to write 
			is.&nbsp; Getting learners to articulate the purpose is very 
			valuable because they can then refer to the handout you gave them of 
			the stages of a text type and make sure that their texts conform.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>At first, narrow down the writing task to each part of a 
				particular text type making sure that the overall purpose of the 
				text is clear and that the stage of the text also has a clear 
				aim which the learners can articulate.</li>
				<li>Remind the learners of the types of language (tenses, 
				adverbials, verbal processes, lexis, modality [or its lack], 
				conjunctions etc. that they need to deploy in this text type.</li>
				<li>Carry out a process approach of drafting, redrafting, 
				getting suggestions from colleagues and so forth until the text, 
				with your help, fulfils its particular function and fits within 
				the overall text purpose.</li>
				<li>Move on to the next stage of the text and repeat until a 
				whole text, properly staged and with appropriate language forms 
				is produced.&nbsp; This will take a long time so be thorough and 
				patient.&nbsp; Academic writing in a foreign language is hard.</li>
				<li>At the end, put away the text and focus on hedging, modality 
				and nominalisation strategies for a lesson or two or three or four ...</li>
				<li>Return to the texts and, with the latest series of lessons 
				in mind, get the learners to hone them with suitable hedges and 
				modal expressions.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>(See the other guides in this section for help with hedging, 
			modality and nominalisation.)</p>
			<p>Before setting out to plan and write an essay, it helps, at least 
			initially, if the learners can draw a diagram of how their essay 
			will develop from its title.&nbsp; Here's an example of a discussion 
			text and another for an information report:<br />
			</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="examples" height="419" src="../../imagesgraphics/genre_2_examples.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>It doesn't take long to produce drafts like this and they will 
			help learners stay on track.&nbsp; At the beginning of a writing 
			course, it may even be appropriate to give the learners a diagram to 
			work from.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>

					<img alt="combine" height="166" src="../../images/combine_ceiling250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>Combining text types</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Longer documents, such as theses, dissertations or end-of-year 
			papers may require the writer to combine one or more of these text 
			types because different parts of the text are performing different 
			functions.<br />
			For example, a recount may be inserted easily into an information 
			report to inform the reader how the information was obtained.<br />
			Likewise, a procedure (or proposed procedure) may follow an 
			information report to set out what information is still needed and 
			how it might best be obtained.<br />
			A recount may be followed by a discussion of the outcomes of a 
			survey and so on.<br />
			However, unless the writer has a good grasp of which text types 
			conform to which purposes before attempting to do this, the result 
			is often incoherent chaos.<br />
			When writing lengthy multi-purpose texts, therefore, learners will 
			need help.&nbsp; A planning stage in which the learners draw a 
			diagram of how their text will work is valuable.&nbsp; Such a 
			diagram might look like this for a text which is fundamentally an 
			information report concerning a survey and its results but which has 
			an inserted discussion of the methodology used for the survey.<br />
			<img alt="mixed genres" height="338" src="../../imagesgraphics/genre_mixed.png" width="500" /></p>
			<p>As you can see, and so can the learners if they produce charts 
			like this for themselves, the overall structure of the information 
			report has been maintained and so has the structure of a discussion.&nbsp; 
			All that has happened is that the discussion is inserted by way of a 
			digression from the information report.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>Here's a summary of the process of using a genre approach to 
			teaching writing skills for any purposes (not just EAP).<br />
			<img alt="summary" height="456" src="../../imagesgraphics/genre_approach.png" width="620" /></p>
			<hr />
			<p>There are <a href="genre_eaphp.htm">two short tests</a> to see 
			whether you can match structures and purposes to genres.<br />
			It might be helpful if your students did these, too.</p>
