			<h1>Reporting verbs in EAP</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="reporting verbs" height="207" src="../../images/reporting310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide is not to do with reported or indirect speech and will 
			not cover the simpler reporting verbs such as <em>say, tell, 
			exclaim, ask, enquire</em> etc.&nbsp; For a guide to those matters
			<a href="../verbs/reportedspeech.html">click here</a>.<br />
			What follows assumes that the rules for reporting direct speech are familiar.<br />
			The following is most relevant to formal academic writing although 
			the concepts are generalisable.&nbsp; It is, therefore, of most 
			interest to people teaching EAP (English for Academic Purposes).</p>
			<hr />
		
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="why" height="166" src="../../images/animals_meerkat_why250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Consider this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara" ><em>Even the most 
			original academic paper integrates facts, ideas, concepts, and 
			theories from other sources by means of quotations, paraphrases, 
			summaries, and brief references.<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style21">(Campbell 1990, in Jordan, 1997:171)</span></p>
			<p>It is unlikely, but not impossible, that learners of English for 
			Academic Purposes will be producing <span class="style_black"><em>the most original academic 
			paper</em></span> so the ability to insert summaries, paraphrases and citation 
			appropriately, using the right reporting verb, is a key writing 
			skill.&nbsp; Not least, of course, to avoid any whiff of plagiarism.&nbsp; 
			Understanding the implications of reporting verbs is also a key 
			reading skill to identify slant and angle.</p>
			<p>Reporting verbs can be classified and presented in a number of 
			ways and we can also, as we shall see, combine elements of the 
			analysis to make the area accessible to learners.</p>
			<hr />
		
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="attitude" height="166" src="../../images/four_men250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Classifying reporting verbs: attitude</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Reporting verbs are subtle but powerful signals of the writer's 
			attitude to the message being sent by a paraphrase or citation.&nbsp; 
			Compare, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru states that ...<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Guru presumes that ...<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Guru claims that ...<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Guru suggests that ...<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Guru mentions that ...<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Guru hypothesises that ...</em></p>
			<p>One way to classify such verbs is to arrange them on a cline from 
			tentative, through neutral to assertive.&nbsp; Something like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="reporting verbs" height="231" src="../../imagesgraphics/reportingverbs1.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>There are obvious problems with this, not least that opinions may 
			differ concerning the exact connotation each verb carries.<br />
			Such a classification does, however, have some classroom utility.</p>
			<hr />
		
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="function" height="166" src="../../images/fountain250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Classifying reporting verbs: function</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Reporting verbs are used for a range of communicative functions.&nbsp; 
			Presenting them from this standpoint, we can get something like:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="reporting verbs - function" height="189" src="../../imagesgraphics/reportingverbs2.png" width="930" /></p>
			<p>
			This sort of presentation and analysis sits well with a 
			communicative approach because it focuses clearly on the 
			communicative value of the verbs.</p>
			<p>However, one obvious problem is that some verbs can be synonyms 
			and some can perform multiple functions.&nbsp; There is not a great 
			deal of difference in meaning between, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru proposes that we ...</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru suggests that we ...</em><br />
			However, <em>suggest</em> is also polysemous in a way that <em>
			propose</em> is not so we can also have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data suggest that ...</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The data propose that ...</em></p>
			<hr />
		
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="form" height="166" src="../../images/form_statue250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Classifying reporting verbs: form</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The final way to classify these verbs in this guide is by 
			grammatical and lexical form.&nbsp; We need to look at concepts of 
			collocation and colligation here, especially the latter.&nbsp; This 
			might result in this kind of analysis:<br />
			<img alt="colligation" height="343" src="../../imagesgraphics/reportingverbscolligation1.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>but there are problems with that, too, some colligational, some 
			collocational:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Transitivity<ol class="auto-style17">
					<li>Some verbs in the lists are both transitive and 
					intransitive.&nbsp; We can have<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru concedes the point that ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru concedes that ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru questions the conclusion<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru questions whether ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru proposes a solution<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru proposes that ...</em></li>
					<li>Some verbs are only intransitive.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					G<em>uru observes that ...</em><br />
					but not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Guru observes the conclusion that ...</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Guru theorises a solution</em></li>
					<li>Some verbs are only transitive.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru recommends a solution</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru recommends that ...</em><br />
					but not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Guru discounts that ...</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Guru discusses that ...</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Appropriacy of subject:<ol class="auto-style17">
					<li>Some of these verbs will collocate with inanimate 
					subjects, some with animate only and some with both.</li>
					<li>Animate subjects can be used for most of them but some 
					can also take inanimate subjects.&nbsp; We can have, e.g.,<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The study shows ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru shows ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The evidence indicates ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru indicates</em> ...<br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>Some may only have animate subjects.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru hypothesises ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Guru maintains ...</em><br />
					but not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The evidence comments ...<br />
					</em>or<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*The facts allege ...</em></li>
					<li>Some are <span lang="x-none"></span>open to metaphorical use, 
					assigning an action to an inanimate subject normally 
					reserved for people (pathetic 
					fallacy):<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The study argues ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The facts imply ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The findings argue for ...</em><br />
					and some are not:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The evidence describes ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*The findings believe ...</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Combining the analyses</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We can weave aspects of all three analyses together to produce 
			quite sophisticated analysis.&nbsp; For example, if we combine 
			attitude with function we can produce something like:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="disagree" height="156" src="../../imagesgraphics/reportingverbsdisagree.png" width="620" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="suggest" height="146" src="../../imagesgraphics/reportingverbssuggest.png" width="620" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>and we can do similar things with many of the other functions.<br />
			It is also possible to combine functional and formal analyses:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="form and function" height="228" src="../../imagesgraphics/reportingverbsformandfunction.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>It is even possible to go one step further and combine all three 
			analyses but, at that stage, the data start to get impenetrable.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Reporting verbs are frequently used in the present simple so that 
			is not difficult to teach.&nbsp; Perversely, some lists of reporting 
			verbs put all of them in the present simple 3rd person which is 
			misleading at best.&nbsp; Two other tenses are also frequently used 
			and multiple authorship is common.&nbsp; Here are examples of all 
			three:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Present simple.&nbsp; This is the most frequent form:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru notes that ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The data imply ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				In that paper, Guru and Mentor propose ...</em></li>
				<li>Past simple.&nbsp; This is frequently used for sources which 
				are older and have become seminal authorities in some way.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru (1949) identified ...</em></li>
				<li>Present perfect.&nbsp; This is used a) when the writer needs 
				to emphasise the present relevance of a source or b) when the 
				sources are varied and (sometimes) not individually identified.&nbsp; 
				It is often used in the passive voice but need not be.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been noted (Guru, 2016) that ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Guru (2010) has discovered that ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Guru and Mentor (2000) investigated the structure of these 
				complex substances and have shown that they are ... <br />

			This list is also available
			<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_reporting_verbs_academic.pdf" target="_blank">as a PDF document</a> for reference.<br />
			A list which is categorised by function is available by clicking
			<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_reporting_verbs_academic_classified.pdf" target="_blank">
			here</a>.<p>Clearly, presenting learners with a list like this is not going 
			to be a very productive approach.&nbsp; Somehow we have to help our 
			learners eat the elephant so a piecemeal approach is the only 
			practical way forward.</p>
			<p>Before you can begin, you need to make a selection of the 
			reporting verbs which will form the target of a teaching sequence.&nbsp; 
			This site can't do that for you because there are some variables to 
			consider first:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>Level:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>At lower levels, it may be adequate to focus on a short 
					list of frequently used neutral verbs.&nbsp; This might 
					include, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state, mention, discuss, comment, show, suggest</em> 
					etc.</li>
					<li>At higher levels, your learners need to start learning 
					about the attitudes that verb-use implies so the list can 
					start to extend to verbs like:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; question, intimate, assert, demonstrate, discount, 
					hypothesise</em> etc.</li>
					<li>Later yet, learners need to be alert to degrees of 
					assertion and argumentation so the list gets extended again 
					to include, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maintain, portray, take issue with, profess, presume</em> 
					and so on.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Register:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>Within the natural sciences, certain reporting verbs are 
					more frequently found.&nbsp; Often, they have inanimate 
					subjects such as <em>data, experimental investigation, 
					observations</em> and so on.&nbsp; Verbs commonly used with 
					inanimate subjects might include:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reveal, show, suggest, demonstrate, explain, confirm, 
					(dis)prove</em> etc.<br />
					so these become the targets for learners in those 
					disciplines</li>
					<li>within the social sciences, more tentative verbs are 
					frequent and they come with animate subjects so verbs like:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; propose, suggest, imply, interpret, posit, postulate</em> 
					etc.<br />
					are more useful targets.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Colligation:<br />
				It makes sense to introduce and practise those verbs which share 
				colligational characteristics so, for example, one could focus 
				on those verbs which are normally followed by <em>that</em>-clauses 
				and separately on those which are following by noun phrases.<br />
				Focusing on those which are prepositional is also an option.<br />
				See the diagram above for examples of all of these.</li>
				<li>Function:<br />
				You may prefer a logical approach to the function of verbs so 
				you consider, for example, a set of verbs appropriate to the 
				learners' level which perform similar functions or form 
				adjacency pairings such as, e.g., agreeing and disagreeing.<br />
				Helpfully, the verbs above are classified on this site in that 
				way and you can get the list to select from by clicking
				<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_reporting_verbs_academic_classified.pdf" target="_blank">
				here</a>.</li>
			</ul>
		
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Approach</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>You can approach the verbs from any of the three analyses above 
			by considering attitude, function and form separately.&nbsp; A 
			combined approach is often productive <strong>providing</strong> the 
			number of target verbs is limited and carefully selected.</p>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Start with a shortlist of verbs which function to state what 
				an author believes (<em>say, hold, assert, believe, claim, 
				declare, maintain</em> etc.) and introduce them in context to 
				show the colligations (see above for that).&nbsp; At lower 
				levels, some focus on tense, aspect and voice is appropriate at 
				this stage.</li>
				<li>Move on to presenting them on a cline from tentative, 
				through neutral to assertive (see above).</li>
				<li>Then, once the function, form and meaning are clear, 
				learners can proceed to practising them.&nbsp; A simple way to 
				do that is to present a text which only uses a simple verb like
				<em>say</em> and get learners to replace the verb with something 
				more appropriate.&nbsp; It could look something like this:<br />
