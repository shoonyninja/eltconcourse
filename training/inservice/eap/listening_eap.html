			<h1>Listening and note-making skills for EAP</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="listen" height="207" src="../../images/listen_walls310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>The following concerns listening skills in 
			English for Academic Purposes but some of the skills required to 
			listen attentively to and comprehend long stretches of fluent native-speaker-level 
			language are applicable beyond an academic setting.&nbsp; News 
			reports, documentary films, political comment programmes and so on 
			spring to mind.</p>
			<p>It is possible to analyse the listening skills EAP students need 
			by categorising them under the settings in which they are deployed &ndash;
			lectures, seminars, one-to-one tutorials etc.&nbsp; That is not the 
			approach taken here because the skills are often needed in all these 
			settings, although some may be at more of a premium than others.&nbsp; 
			Here, we look at the settings first and then at the skills, 
			simultaneously considering which ones are most applicable in which 
			settings.</p>

					<img alt="lecture" height="166" src="../../images/teaching_lecturer250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>Settings</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Learners in an EAP setting are likely to find themselves in three 
			situations in which they will be required to listen and comprehend:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A formal lecture</li>
				<li>A seminar or individual tutorial where communication can be 
				two way and is often required to be so</li>
				<li>A presentation given by a peer which is often followed by a 
				free-for-all discussion</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All the skills which are discussed below are applicable in all situations.</p>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We will distinguish here between understanding and comprehending 
			in this way:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Understanding</strong></dt>
				<dd>involves decoding what has been said, identifying lexis and 
				structure and extracting meaning.&nbsp; It is a complex of 
				bottom-up processing to identify language items and top-down 
				processing to follow the gist and bring knowledge of the subject 
				and the world in general to bear on the text.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Comprehending</strong></dt>
				<dd>involves understanding but also means extracting the central 
				material while ignoring the incidental and identifying main and 
				subsidiary points.&nbsp; It will also often involve identifying 
				relationships between ideas and concepts and their basis in 
				evidence or otherwise.&nbsp; Comprehending also involves the 
				ability to recall essentials and that, in turn, often means good 
				note-taking (or note-making) abilities.&nbsp; It is, in short, 
				an academic skill.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>It is the second of these which is one target of teaching English 
			for Academic Purposes.</p>
			<p>Above and beyond the listening skills required by all learners of 
			English, there are some which are of particular importance in an 
			academic setting and it is on these that we shall concentrate this 
			analysis.&nbsp; This list assumes that the ability to recognise the 
			topic, deduce meaning from context and recognise conjunction etc. 
			are or have been the aims of a General English study programme.&nbsp; 
			They do not concern us here but are covered in guides elsewhere on 
			this site to which there are links at the end.</p>
			<p>Lectures and lessons are not the sole content of a course.&nbsp; 
			They are, often, an overview of an area which students will be 
			expected to research and read about.</p>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Good lecturers and seminar leaders use explicit signposting to 
			keep people informed and let people know what is coming next.&nbsp; 
			Poor ones don't, unfortunately, but we'll assume here that the EAP 
			learner finds him or herself in the hands of one of the better ones.<br />
			Signposts are not really a language category and can't be taught as 
			such but there are some obvious ways that good speakers use them and 
			they perform a range of important functions:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style69">
				<li>Introducing the topic.<br />
				This can be done in many ways and they are mostly quite 
				explicit.&nbsp; A few common ones are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My topic today is ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning, we are going to look at ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I want to address ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this lecture / talk / seminar is ...<br />
				</em>Of course, properly prepared learners will not need to know 
				any of these things because they will know what the lecture is 
				about before they arrive.</li>
				<li>Outlining the structure (only very good lecturers do this 
				well or even at all).<br />
				It is worth training learners, however, to listen out for 
				expressions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to focus on three main ideas.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lecture is divided as follows ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first area we have to consider is ... and then I'll get 
				on to ... and ...</em></li>
				<li>Introducing discrete sections.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to begin by considering ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, ...</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we can move on to ...</em></li>
				<li>Signalling transitions (more on this below).<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK.&nbsp; Now let's move on to consider 
				...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have considered this in some detail so now we can ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I turn to the third section of this lecture.</em></li>
				<li>Summing up (only the best do this well).<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK.&nbsp; Now let me recap the important 
				points.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, we can see that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary / conclusion, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three main takeaway points are ...</em></li>

			</table>
			<p>The sources allowing us to do this are quite plentiful.&nbsp; 
			Some of these sources can be used before and some during the lecture 
			process.&nbsp; Some attention also needs to be paid to what learners 
			do after a session.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Preparation before the event</strong>.&nbsp; Using 
				the background data already available.<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>the title of a lecture or the stage of teaching programme 
				will often tell us precisely what the main thrust of a lecture 
				or seminar concerns.<br />It is not uncommon for learners simply to ignore the lecture 
				title and go in, so to speak, blind.&nbsp; That's unhelpful, 
				naturally.&nbsp; EAP learners can, in fact, start their notes 
				before the lecture by predicting content from the title and 
				making headings in a notebook.&nbsp; It is not difficult to give 
				them a little practice in doing so by presenting a range of 
					appropriate and relevant titles and getting them to 
					brainstorm headings for a note book..</li>
					<li>helpful lecturers and teachers often provide an outline of 
				what it is that will be discussed and this will usually contain 
				headings and subheadings to guide the listening process.<br />These, too, can be used as a basis for notes by simply 
				transferring the outline topics to a notebook.&nbsp; However one 
				makes notes, it is useful to have somewhere to start.</li>
					<li>the stage in a course can usually be matched to the course 
				syllabus and a good deal of the content of a lesson or lecture 
				can be inferred by looking there.&nbsp; Syllabus elements can form part of the note-making 
				process.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>During the event</strong>.&nbsp; Using linguistic 
				clues to help the learner to listen to what is really 
			important, ignore irrelevance or detail available elsewhere and take 
			/ make good notes.<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>good lecturers and teachers will use clear verbal signals to 
				identify the core ideas.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li><em>This lecture concerns ...</em></li>
						<li><em>The main point I want to stress is ...</em></li>
						<li><em>There are two competing theories.</em></li>
						<li><em>By the end of this session we will be able to see that 
					...<br /></em>What follows signals like these will often be the basis 
					for note-making subheadings and headings.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>lecturers will also explicitly signal subsidiary points.&nbsp; 
				For example:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li><em>You may like to know that ...</em></li>
						<li><em>Incidentally ...</em></li>
						<li><em>A less important factor is ...</em></li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li><em>We are not concerned today with ...<br /></em>What follows comments like these can safely be left out 
					of the student's notes altogether.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>lecturers will also, if they are any good, signal 
				exemplification which is not central to the argument.&nbsp; For 
				example (!):<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li><em>For example, ...</em></li>
						<li><em>Another instance of this is ...</em></li>
						<li><em>Another case in point might be ...<br /></em>For note-making, it is useful to signal examples by 
					highlighting or indenting them in some way.&nbsp; See below 
					for more.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>prosodic features are important here because lecturers will 
				often signal important information and recognising the signals 
					can help to make headings and subheadings in notes.&nbsp; 
					These features include:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>stress on particular words: <em>and </em>
						<span class="style_underline"><strong><em>THAT</em></strong></span><em> 
					is what caused the ...</em></li>
						<li>rising intonation across a clause</li>
						<li>higher key on critical terms</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>After the event</strong>.&nbsp; Reviewing 
				re-organising and revising.&nbsp; Good learners will take the 
				time to review their notes and, if necessary, re-write them for 
				future revision.&nbsp; There are three benefits:<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>What is clear on the day may be mysterious weeks later 
					when it comes to re-reading notes or using them to write 
					essays, take examinations or prepare for seminars and 
					presentations so clearly re-written notes will help.</li>
					<li>Re-writing notes helps to fix salient facts in the mind 
					and dismiss peripheral data to a foot note.</li>
					<li>Re-organising notes requires the learner not only to 
					recall facts but to understand and apply them.&nbsp; 
					Fundamental re-organisation can also require the note-taker 
					to analyse the data and evaluate it.</li>
				</ol>

			<p>It is important that EAP learners are trained to recognise three 
			common devices which signal the existence and the direction of 
			causality and restrictions on the truth of statements.&nbsp; Two are 
			to do with forms of subordination, the third is semantically rather 
			than syntactically driven.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>subordinating conjunctions</strong><br />
				There is a guide on this site which considers subordination in 
				some detail linked in the list of related guides at the end but a short list of these devices which 
				can form part of a training programme is<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>condition and concession signals: <em>if, providing, 
					unless, but for, assuming</em> etc.<br />
					For example:<br />
					<em>If the material is exposed to heat ...<br />
					But for the king's actions ...<br />
					Assuming the figures are accurate ...</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>causal connectors: <em>because, as, since, so (that). in 
					order that</em> etc.<br />
					<em>This happened because ...<br />
					So that this can happen ...<br />
					In order for the data to be analysed ...</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>temporal connections: <em>after, before, now that, once, 
					since, till / until</em> etc.<br />
					<em>The reaction continues until ...<br />
					Once mobilisation had begun ...<br />
					Since the beginning of the century ...</em><br />
					etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>relative clauses</strong><br />
				Speakers often signal the existence of causality by the used of 
				relative clauses as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>This information which allowed this conclusion was ...<br />
				The experiment which confirmed the result was ...</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li><strong>lexical devices</strong> of two types<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>verbal processes such as:<br />
					<em>The data allow us to ...<br />
					The results of the study led to ...<br />
					This caused ...<br />
					This triggered ...<br />
					The queen's death set off ...<br />
					The rebellion was instigated by ...<br />
					The reaction was initiated by ...</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>nominalisation such as:<br />
					<em>The root cause was ...<br />
					The result of all these conflicting factors was ...<br />
					The origins of the revolution lie in ...</em><br />
					etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Prosodic features, too, will play a role just as they do in the 
			signalling of key facts and ideas.<br />
			All of these can be taught, of course, but the focus is on 
			comprehension in the first place, not simple recall.</p>

			<p>Few talks, lessons or lectures focus on a single topic and, even 
			when they do, there are usually sub-topics contained within the 
			whole.&nbsp; EAP learners need to be able to recognise the point at 
			which the topic is changing because that allows them to follow and 
			make / take orderly notes.</p>
			<p>To be able to recognise transition, some training in the use of 
			adjuncts, disjuncts and conjuncts is in order because these are the 
			main ways transitions are signalled</p>

				<li><strong>adjuncts</strong>:<ol class="auto-style4">

				<li>Understanding<br />
				involves the ability to  rephrase, summarise and illustrate 
				ideas.&nbsp; Learners should be asked, therefore, not just to 
				make notes but to review them and use them to explain what they 
				have heard.&nbsp; This might involve transferring data from 
				prose to diagrams or vice versa and  rephrasing what they have 
				encountered in their own words or their own language.</li>
				<li>Applying<br />
				involves the ability to use notes to ask questions, research 
				further and read more widely.&nbsp; Learners need practice in 
				this skill level so that the road map that a lecture or seminar 
				has given them can be used to investigate further.&nbsp; That's 
				the application of data, and it's more than retention and 
				understanding.</li>
				<li>Analysing<br />
				involves breaking down data into parts and understanding how 
				things fit together.&nbsp; It is not enough to come out of a 
				session armed with a set of facts.&nbsp; The facts need to be 
				analysed and organised.&nbsp; They may need arranging, testing, 
				classifying and categorising and practice needs to be provided.</li>
				<li>Evaluating<br />
				involves judging what is central and important and 
				distinguishing it from peripheral and inessential information.&nbsp; 
				Learners need to practise the ability to look at what they have 
				gleaned and prioritise things to bring out essential points.</li>
				<li>Creating<br />
				involves using the notes to synthesise something new.&nbsp; That 
				may be a presentation at a seminar, an essay or an answer to an 
				examination question.&nbsp; You can't do this without practice 
				and lots of it because it also involves recalling, 
				understanding, applying, analysing and evaluating what you have 
				encountered.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is important that learners are aware of the levels of 
			cognition at which they are working.</p>

			<h4>Linear note taking and making</h4>
			<p>This is a familiar form of note making and taking but has a few 
			variables:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Simple sentence making.<br />
				In this form, note takers simply write a new sentence for every 
				idea they encounter.&nbsp; The result will be a page of 
				sentences, each distinct from the neighbouring sentences and 
				each representing a single idea.&nbsp; Even when the speaker has 
				carefully explained a causal relationship between two ideas, 
				they will appear in separate sentences but be linked with a 
				simple arrow to show the direction of causality.</li>
				<li>Paragraphing and indenting.<br />
				In this form, notes are organised like this:<ol class="auto-style5">
					<li>First main point<ol class="auto-style7">
						<li>Subheading<ol class="auto-style6">
							<li>First example and result</li>
							<li>Second example</li>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Next sub heading</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Second main point</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Focused notes.<br />
				These require a selection of pretty pen colours with the 
				note-maker / taker selecting the appropriate one for each type 
				of meaning.&nbsp; It ends up looking something like this:<br />
				<span class="auto-style8">Event or Fact</span><br />
				<span class="auto-style9">Consequence</span><br />
				<span class="auto-style10">Implication</span><br />
				It can, of course be combined with either of the first two 
				approaches, and often is.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Linear note making and taking gets a bad press because of some 
			suppositions about how the human brain processes information.<br />
			The system can, however, become quite sophisticated with 
			combinations of the three basic approaches, the use of arrows and 
			other graphics to show equality, superiority, connections and so on.<br />
			Some people who use this system use the reverse of each page of a 
			notebook for making revision notes by refining what it faces, like 
			this:<br />
			<img alt="notes 1" height="204" src="../../imagesgraphics/notetaking1.png" width="310" /><br />
			and so on for the rest of the notebook.<br />
			It is easy to insert additions into linear notes as one reads and 
			researches.&nbsp; It is far more difficult and sometimes impossible 
			to do that with ...</p>
			<h4>Diagrammatic note taking and making</h4>
			<p>There are a number of approaches to this which result in slightly 
			different outcomes.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Branching notes:<br />
				These begin with the main topic in a central box from which the 
				note-taker / maker draws lines, placing text on them.&nbsp; It 
				looks like this:<br />
				<img alt="note 2" height="255" src="../../imagesgraphics/notetaking2.png" width="310" /></li>
				<li>Mind- or concept-maps.<br />
				These extend the branching system and can become quite 
				sophisticated (and quite messy).<br />
				They might end up like:<br />
				<img alt="note 3" height="261" src="../../imagesgraphics/notetaking3.png" width="310" /><br />
				Hand drawn rather than produced like this they can be very 
				sophisticated indeed.&nbsp; The issue is that the user has to 
				develop a shape and colour system which is memorable but not too 
				complex to be remembered.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are an infinite number (almost) of ways that the systems 
			can be refined and combined to suit the user.<br />
			Linear notes are easier to draw on for revision and later 
			extension and refinement.&nbsp; Graphical notes are helpful to see connections and 
			similarities.<br />
			Some users convert linear to graphical or <em>vice versa</em> for 
			revision purposes.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Many note-takers settle into their seats with a blank page in the 
			notebook open in front of them.&nbsp; This is slightly bizarre 
			behaviour because it implies that they have no preconceptions about 
			what they are going to experience and have made no predictions 
			concerning the lecture's focus and probable content.</p>
			<p>We saw above that there are three sources of information to draw 
			on before the lecture begins:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The title<br />
				which will tell us something about the content and from which we 
				can predict the focus.</li>
				<li>Any summary the lecturer / teacher has been good enough to 
				provide<br />
				from which we can start with a few headings and subheadings.</li>
				<li>The syllabus<br />
				from which we set the lecture / lesson in context and make some 
				connections to other topics.&nbsp; This, too, can be used to 
				plan our note-making in advance.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Furthermore, even a poor lecture will have some kind of 
			predictable structure to the information to be presented.&nbsp; 
			Almost all lectures / lessons in academic contexts will contain at 
			least:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>An introduction to focus the audience, probably including 
				some consideration of why it's important.&nbsp; From knowing 
				this, we already have a title and two headings for our notes:<br />
				<em>Title:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why:</em></li>
				<li>Some detail concerning the definition of the focus of the 
				lecture.&nbsp; From this we can refine our headings:<br />
				<em>Title:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Point 1:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Point 2:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Importance 1:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Importance 2:</em></li>
				<li>Some consideration of contrasts with other ideas / theories 
				/ hypotheses.&nbsp; From this, we can add another section to the 
				skeleton of the notes:<br />
				<em>Other theories / ideas:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Different:</em></li>
				<li>The implications of the focus so we can add another section:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implication 1:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implication 2:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implication 3:</em></li>
				<li>Some indication of chronology may be provided so we need 
				another subheading:<br />
				<em>Chronology:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When:</em></li>
				<li>The lecturer's emphasis will usually be clear, too, so we 
				can add:<br />
				<em>Most important issues:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3</em></li>
				<li>A summary at the end from which we can check that we have 
				made a note of the most important issues.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If we reserve a separate page in our notebook for each of these 
			sections, we will be well prepared because we know what we are 
			listening for and we won't waste time writing down the headings.&nbsp; 
			It's helpful to do that because lecturers may present the 
			information in a different order.&nbsp; All we need to do then is 
			flip forward or back through the notebook to assign the thoughts and 
			comments to the right parts of our notes.<br />
			If we prefer diagrammatic notes, of course, the headings and 
			subheadings will appear on branches and sub-branches.&nbsp; In that 
			case, each of the six or so pages of the notebook that we have 
			prepared will contain a separate tree.<br />
			It may, naturally, be the case that they are not all relevant.&nbsp; 
			Much will depend on the topic, the length of the presentation and 
			the skill of the lecturer / teacher.&nbsp; If that is the case, we 
			shall have wasted a bit of paper.&nbsp; So be it.</p>

			<p>Many people develop their note-making skills at school and stick 
			with the pattern that they first used.&nbsp; That may be a mistake 
			because, as with most other skills, practice and experimentation 
			usually lead to improvement.&nbsp; Here's an outline for a 
			mini-course in note-making skills.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Raising awareness of the alternatives.<br />
				Have to hand an example or two of each type of notes which refer 
				to the same mini-lecture or part of a lecture.<br />
				Get the learners to discuss their relative merits and how they 
				respond to them.<br />
				For many, this may be the first time they have seen a set of 
				notes which differ from how they make notes.</li>
				<li>Forcing the issue.<br />
				Using short texts (fewer than 100 words is usually enough) 
				compel learners to take notes in at least three different ways.&nbsp; 
				The aim here is to force them to consider and experiment with 
				alternatives.<br />
				Texts can be generalised or specific to the domain in which your 
				students need to operate but should contain at least:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>One main point</li>
					<li>One consequence of it</li>
					<li>Two examples</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Not starting with a blank piece of paper.<br />
				If we give the learners the title of what they are going to hear 
				and some indication of its content, then they can start to 
				construct their note skeleton before they hear a word of it.&nbsp; 
				It doesn't matter which form of note-making they are going to 
				use.&nbsp; The principles are the same.</li>
				<li>Responding.<br />
				Learners now need to be given the opportunity to respond 
				personally to the three types of notes they have taken and 
				discuss or reflect on (or both) which suits their learning style 
				and which sort of note-making they find accessible later on when 
				they come to review what they have written.<br />
				Learners need to be directed to considering not only how easy 
				they find taking notes using the methods but also to how easy 
				they find it making notes to highlight the main issues and 
				review their notes for revision / extension.</li>
				<li>Finally, practice can be provided starting with short 
				read-aloud texts (or video clips) and slowly working up to more 
				extensive and complex presentations.&nbsp; Learners should be 
				practising using the one or two styles they have identified in 
				the previous exercises.<br />
				Some of this stage can involve the learners being asked to make 
				notes on your lessons and each other's practice presentations, 
				for example.&nbsp; For more on presentation skills, see the 
				guide in this section to speaking skills in EAP.</li>

			<p>Finally, learners need to be aware of the possible styles of 
			lectures and lecturers that they are likely to encounter.<br />
			Dudley-Evans and Johns (1981:34) identified three styles, all of 
			which pose problems for (especially) EAP learners.&nbsp; They are:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Style A — 'Reading Style'.</dt>
				<dd><span class="style_black"><em>The lecturer reads from notes, 
				or speaks as if he was reading from notes.&nbsp; Characterised 
				by short tone groups, and narrowness of intonational range.&nbsp; 
				Falling tone predominates</em></span><br />
				The issue for learners they identify is that it<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>may make it difficult for the 
				listener to distinguish between what is presented as 
				'contrastive' and what is 'non-contrastive': without such 
				pointing-up of the essential points, the overall structure of 
				argument may not be perceived</em></span></dd>
				<dt>Style B — 'Conversational Style'</dt>
				<dd><span class="style_black"><em>The lecturer speaks 
				informally, with or without notes.&nbsp; Characterised by longer 
				tone groups and key-sequences from high to low</em></span><br />
				The main issue for learners they identify is<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>there is the danger that matter 
				hurried-over towards the end of the key sequence, but 
				nevertheless necessary for the understanding of the lecture as a 
				whole, may be missed.</em></span></dd>
				<dt>Style C — 'Rhetorical Style'. The lecturer as performer</dt>
				<dd><span class="style_black"><em>Characterised by wide 
				intonational range.&nbsp; The lecturer often exploiting high key, and 
				a 'boosted high key'.&nbsp; Frequent asides and digressions marked by 
				key and tempo shift — sometimes also by voice-quantity shift.</em></span><br />
				The issue for learners with this style is that it<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>involves the difficult task of 
				perceiving the asides and digressions, of assessing their 
				relevance or otherwise to the main argument, and — most 
				important — of being able to pick up the argument after the 
				digression.</em></span></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>To this should be added that the Reading Style lecture will often 
			be akin to writing read aloud and that may lead to clearer 
			linguistic clues regarding connections, subordination and causality 
			and that this may, in fact, make it easier for the EAP student to 
			follow the thread.<br />
			The other two lecture styles will contain a good deal of colloquial 
			language and even a joke or two that may be lost on all but the most 
			advanced users of a second language.</p>
			<p>Knowing this is helpful but not as helpful as actually exposing 
			EAP learners to the three styles and giving them some way of 
			recognising them and adjusting their listening strategies 
			accordingly.<br />
			Practice in doing that is now available easily on the web.&nbsp; 
			There are hundreds of sites containing everything from short 
			presentations to full-length academic lectures.&nbsp; Some, on 
			ted.com, for example, are presentations given by very skilled 
			lecturers, others may be less accessible or enthralling but learners 
			need all sorts of practice.<br />
			What's more, of course, such examples cover a huge range of topic 
			and specialist areas so your students can access the ones which are 
			relevant to their expertise in their subject.</p>
