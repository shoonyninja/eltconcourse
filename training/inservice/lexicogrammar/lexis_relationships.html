		<ol>
			<li><em>He immediately bought a smart hat.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>What words (lexemes, if you will) can we use to replace <em>bought, 
		immediately, smart</em> 
		and <em>hat</em>?</p>
		<p><em>hat</em> can be replaced by almost any noun, but it <strong>must</strong> 
		be a noun or a noun phrase.<br />
		<em>immediately</em> can be replaced by any adverb but it <strong>must</strong> 
		be an adverbial of some kind<br />
		<em>smart</em> can be replaced by a wide range of adjectives but they
		<strong>must</strong> be adjectives<br />
		<em>bought</em> can be replaced by many verbs, but they <strong>must</strong> 
		be verbs or a verb phrases (and they must be transitive).</p>
		<p>So we can get, e.g.:</p>
		<ol start="2">
			<li><em>He eventually sold a new hat.</em></li>
			<li><em>He bought a brand-new Daimler car.</em></li>
			<li><em>He surreptitiously stole a useful gadget.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>... and so on and on and on.&nbsp; We can actually replace all the 
		words in the sentence and providing we exchange word or phrase class on 
		a like-for-like basis we will not affect the basic structure although 
		meaning will change fundamentally.</p>
		<p>There are two types of relationship at work here:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Syntagmatic relationship</strong></dt>
			<dd>This describes the relationship between, e.g., <em>He</em> and
			<em>bought</em> in <strong>Sentence 1</strong>, <em>sold</em> and
			<em>a new hat</em> in <strong>Sentence 2</strong> and <em>
			surreptitiously</em> and <em>stole</em> in <strong>Sentence 4</strong>.<br />
			These relationships work horizontally between words.&nbsp; Subjects 
			use Verbs, Verbs sometimes take Objects, Adjectives modify Nouns, 
			Adverbs modify Verbs and so on.&nbsp; The relationship is to do with
			<strong>syntax</strong> (from the Greek meaning to arrange 
			together).</dd>
			<dt><strong>Paradigmatic relationships</strong></dt>
			<dd>These are exemplified by the changes we have made between the 
			sentences and describe the relationships between:<br />
			<em>bought, sold </em>and <em>stole</em><br />
			<em>surreptitiously</em> and <em>eventually</em><br />
			<em>useful, brand-new</em> and <em>new</em><br />
			<em>car, gadget </em>and <em>hat<br />
			</em>These relationships work vertically in the sense that Noun 
			phrases can be replaced by other Noun phrases, Verb phrases by other 
			Verb phrases, Adjectives by other Adjectives, Adverbs by other 
			Adverbs and so on.&nbsp; The relationship is to do with <strong>word 
			and phrase class</strong>.&nbsp; The word paradigmatic derives from
			<strong>paradigm</strong> (from the Greek meaning to show 
			side by side).<br />
			It works like this:</dd>
</dl><p><img alt="syntagmatic" height="226" src="../../imagesgraphics/syntagmatic.png" width="620" /></p>
		<p>Each slot in the sentence can be replaced by words and phrases in the 
		same classes to 
		make new sentences (some of which might make sense) virtually <em>ad 
		infinitum</em>.&nbsp; The boxes give examples of items in a paradigmatic 
		relationship; the red arrows show the syntagmatic relationships.</p>
		<p>Because this guide is to do with lexis, it is paradigmatic 
		relationships between words that concern us most here.&nbsp; However, 
		when words are combined with grammar to make meaning, syntagmatic 
		relationships become important.</p>

	<dt>HOMOGRAPH</dt>
	<dd>words which are <span class="style_underline">written identically but
	<strong>may or may not</strong> be differently pronounced</span> and which have different 
	meanings<br />
	For example:<br />
	<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The </em><span class="style_brown"><em>mean </em></span><em>temperature 
	is over 20.<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I </em><span class="style_brown"><em>mean </em></span><em>to buy some new

			<dt>HOMOPHONE</dt>
			<dd>words which <span class="style_underline">sound the same but are written differently</span> and have different meanings<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The religion's </em> <span class="style_brown"><em>rites</em></span>.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

			</em>
			<span class="style_brown"><em>know</em></span><em> them.<br />
			</em>(both pronounced as /nəʊ/)<br />Homophones can be notorious traps, not only for learners of 
			English, and sets such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pours, pores, pause
	</em>and<em> paws</em><br />
			cause a good deal of difficulty, sometimes because speakers think 
			they <span class="style_underline">ought</span> to be pronounced 
			differently (they are all pronounced /pɔːz/ in standard English).</dd>
			<dt>HOMONYM</dt>
			<dd>Strictly speaking, these are words which 
			<span class="style_underline">look and sound the same</span> but have different

		<p>Warning: In casual, non-technical parlance, the term <em>homonym </em>
		is used for all three categories but there are differences and you should 
		be aware of them.&nbsp; Obviously, there is some overlap between the 
		terms:</p>

		<img alt="homo-" height="182" src="../../imagesgraphics/homo.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>If you would like to see a short lesson for more advanced learners focusing on homophones 
			<a href="../../../learners/lessons/c1c2lessons/c1c2vocabulary/c1c2homophones1.html" target="_blank">there is one here</a>.&nbsp; You could integrate into your teaching quite easily.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><a name="heteronym"></a>HETERONYM</dt>
				<dd>Heteronyms are sometimes called heterophones and are words 
				written identically but which have different pronunciations
				<strong>and</strong> meanings.&nbsp; They are, to put it another 
				way, homographs that are not homophones and may be considered a 
				sub-set of homographs.<br />
				(Technically, the term heterophone applies to all words in a 
				language which are pronounced differently and that would include 
				all the words of the language, of course, barring 
				homophones.)<br />
				Examples include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had a terrible <span class="style_brown">row</span> </em>
				(/raʊ/)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They'll <span class="style_brown">row </span>the boat</em> (/rəʊ/)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Don't stand to <span class="style_brown">close </span>to the 
				fire </em>(/kləʊs/)<br /><em><span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close </span>the door behind you </em>
				(/kləʊz/)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Don't <span class="style_brown">abuse </span>the your authority </em>(/əˈbjuːz//)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				That's <span class="style_brown">abuse </span>of authority</em> (/əˈbjuːs/)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They made a <span class="style_brown">record</span></em> (/ˈrek.ɔːd/)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please <span class="style_brown">record </span>the most important points</em> (/rɪk.ˈɔːd/)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of Scotland's most important 				<span class="style_brown">exports 
				</span>is whisky and the firm
				<span class="style_brown">exports </span>it all over the world
				</em>(/ˈek.spɔːts/ vs. /ɪk.ˈspɔːts/)<br />
				The last two of these, <em>record</em> and <em>export</em>, 
				are examples of <strong>stress shifting</strong>  
				which often occurs (along with other changes) when a word can be 
				both a verb (with the stress on the second syllable) and a noun 
				or adjective (with the stress on the first syllable).<br />For more on this and the other changes which occur, see 				
				the guide to word 
				stress, linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
				Another definition of heteronyms not further considered here is 
				two words which mean the same but are used in different 
				varieties of a language.&nbsp; For example, in Britain the term
				<em>nappy</em> is used to describe baby clothing but in the USA 
				the term is <em>diaper</em>.&nbsp; In Scotland the word <em>wee</em> 
				is often used to mean what elsewhere in the English-speaking 
				world is just described as <em>small</em>.&nbsp; The words are 
				heteronyms, referring to the same idea in different ways.</dd>

			<p>We saw above that homonyms are words which look and sound the same but have different 
			and unrelated meanings.</p>
			<p>However, there is a cline between completely unrelated meanings 
			and meanings which are obviously related.&nbsp; The problem is that 
			this is a continuum, not an either-or issue.<br />
			For example, you may feel that the use of <em>umbrella</em> in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Take an umbrella in case it rains</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This all comes under the umbrella of lexical 
			relationships</em><br />
			is the same word used with a slightly different (metaphorical) 
			meaning and many would agree with you.&nbsp; They do not, 
			therefore, count as homonyms.&nbsp; However, the situation is far 
			less clear with a word like <em>screen</em> in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The film was first screened last year</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We screened the new plants from the wind</em><br />
			You may feel that the word is used in such a different way in these 
			sentences (projecting and protecting respectively) that it is an 
			example of homonymy.<br />
			Others may feel that, because both words refer to a flat surface of 
			some kind, they are clearly not wholly different and qualify as 
			polysemes (words used with different but related meanings), rather 
			than homonyms.<br />
			There is a guide to polysemy, linked below, which considers this 
			matter in much more detail and concludes, <em>inter alia</em>, that 
			the distinction is <span class="style_underline">in principle</span> 
			impossible to identify precisely.</p>

			<p>The situation can be complicated because it is not always a 
			simple two-level relationship.&nbsp; Hyponyms can themselves be 
			hypernyms so we may have, for example:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="hyponymy levels" height="231" src="../../imagesgraphics/hyponymy_levels.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>
			Levels 1, 2 and 3 may also be described as superordinate (level 1), 
			coordinate (level 2) and subordinate (level 3).</p>
			</div>
			<p>
			Often as the examples show, the superordinate is a mass noun but the 
			levels below, the hyponyms of each other, are count nouns.&nbsp; So, 
			for example, the subordinate mass noun <em>equipment</em> will have 
			a set of count-noun hyponyms below it which might include <em>tool, 
			oil, screwdriver, hammer, wrench</em> and so on.</p>
			<p>
			It is possible to trace hyponymy relationships back and back (up and 
			up in trees like the one above) until one arrives at superordinates 
			so large in their coverage that they become unusable for any 
			day-to-day purposes.&nbsp; So, for example, we can have:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style60">Level</td>
					<td class="auto-style58">Superordinate</td>
					<td class="auto-style64">Hyponyms</td>

				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style63">1</td>
					<td class="auto-style61"><strong>lubricants</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style65"><em>oil, grease, fat</em></td>

					<td class="auto-style66">4</td>
					<td class="auto-style67"><strong>inanimate substances</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style62"><em>liquid, solids, gases</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			and any of the hyponyms above Level 1 can themselves form hypernyms 
			and generate more subcategories virtually <em>ad infinitum</em>.</p>
			<p>
			This relationship is not, of course, confined to nouns.&nbsp; We can 
			also have:</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Adjectives</strong><br />
			<img alt="colours" height="169" src="../../imagesgraphics/colour_hyponymy.png" width="620" /><br />
			In the case of adjectives, it is often important to consider their 
			collocational characteristics because, for example, hyponyms of <em>
			big</em> will collocate differently and be dependent on the noun 
			they modify:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>huge tree</em>, not <em>*great tree</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>great problem</em>, not <em>*full-sized problem<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<p><a href="#top" style="color:#ff3300">-top-</a></p>
			
			<p>
			<strong><a name="troponymy"></a>Verbs</strong><br />
			<img alt="troponymy" height="223" src="../../imagesgraphics/troponymy.png" width="310" /><br />
			and in this case, there is what is known as a relationship of
			<strong>troponymy</strong> because all the second-level hyponyms are 
			expressive of the manner of doing something, i.e., they are 
			different ways of <em>cleaning</em>.&nbsp; Other examples include 
			different ways of <em>eating, walking</em>, <em>sleeping</em> etc. 
			which would include <em>nibble, gorge; saunter, stroll; nap, doze</em> 
			respectively.<br />
			Troponymy makes a useful teaching aim, especially at more advanced 
			levels, because there is some evidence that we store and retrieve 
			verb lexemes by conceptual association.</p>
			<h4>
		Teaching implications</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Hypernyms have greater range (they describe <span lang="x-none">
			</span>more of 
			reality) so they are important to know.&nbsp; If learners don't 
			know the exact word for something, it's useful if they have a 
			hypernym to hand.&nbsp; You may not know what sort of tree you are 
			sitting under but you <em>do</em> know it's a tree.</li>
			<li>Unfortunately, many hypernyms sound unnatural when used in 
			informal speech.&nbsp; Would you prefer<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need a new goods vehicle<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need a new truck</em>?</li>
			<li>There is some evidence that one of the many ways the brain 
			stores lexis is related to hyponymy so it makes sense to teach 
			hyponyms together.<br />
			This is especially true when we consider various levels of hyponymy 
			(as above) because the brain can make sense of this sort of 
			categorisation into subgroups.<br />
			It can be productive as a classroom research exercise to get 
			learners to develop their own hyponym trees as the ones above and 
			see how they can build pictures of the relationships between words 
			and add to their own lexicons in so doing.</li>
			<li>Hyponymy is variable across cultures and from individual to 
			individual in many cases, so learners need the data to refine their 
			understanding of what may <strong>and may not</strong> be included under 
			a particular hypernym or superordinate.&nbsp; For example, in 
			English, the hypernym <em>furniture</em> will not include <em>wall 
			hangings, carpet</em>s or<em> filing cabinets</em> (probably) but some individuals 
			and some cultures will include these lexemes.&nbsp; For more, see 
			the guide to semantics linked in the list of related guides at the end.</li>

			<p>Allied to the concept of hyponymy is that of meronymy which 
			relates to the whole and its parts.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="meronymy tricycle" height="82" src="../../imagesgraphics/meronymy.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>In this case, the technical term for the <em>tricycle</em> is the 
			holonym (whole name) and each of the parts are described as meronyms 
			of it.</p>
			<p>There is some evidence, too, that the brain stores vocabulary in 
			this way (among others) by a process akin to word association so 
			that, for example, it becomes easier to recall words such as <em>
			wings, beak, feathers, crop, claws</em> etc. when the memory has 
			been primed by the word <em>bird</em>.<br />
			There is a teaching implication here, too, of course, which is that 
			words can often be effectively presented and learned in the context 
			of larger wholes.<br />
			Meronymy is the phenomenon which leads to a form of synonymy known 
			as <strong>synecdoche</strong> in which a part is seen as a synonym 
			for the whole, so, for example, we can use <em>head</em> or <em>face</em> 
			to refer to the whole of a person or people as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some new faces in the class</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do a head count<br />
			</em>Synecdoche also works in reverse by using reference to the 
			whole to refer to a part as in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germany have won the game<br />
			</em>by which is meant, of course, the German team, not the whole 
			country.<br />
			It's pronounced /sɪ.ˈnek.dək.ɪ/, by the way.</p>
			<p>A similar relationship is called metonymy and this refers to the 
			use of a term to mean the greater entity with which it is closely 
			associated.&nbsp; For example,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number 10 has scheduled a vote in the House 
			for next Thursday</em><br />
			where the term <em>Number 10</em> is simply the first part of 
			address of the British Prime Minister's office (<em>10 Downing 
			Street</em>) and is used to refer to the British government in 
			general in the same way that <em>Washington</em> or <em>The White 
			House</em> are used to refer to the American government and the 
			President's office respectively.<br />
			Metonymy is commonly used to refer to the occupants of a place so, 
			for example, we may encounter:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Room 6 will need to move</em><br />
			in which we are not referring to the room but to the people who 
			usually occupy it.<br />
			By the same token, something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The top floor will want to be kept informed<br />
			</em>refers to the people who are to be found there, not the floor.</p>

		<p>This is a notoriously difficult area because different authorities 
		define these terms differently.&nbsp; (So if you are writing or talking about them, 
		make sure you say what you mean by the terms.)&nbsp; On this site, the 
		terms are defined like this because for teaching purposes, it seems the 
		most useful.&nbsp; It is not intended that this is an original 
		contribution to the science of semantics:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="word families etc." height="149" src="../../imagesgraphics/word_families310.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>
			Because the area is replete with conflicting definitions of terms, 
			there's quite a strong argument that the categories are not useful 
			for the purposes of analysing meaning relationships.&nbsp; However, 
			there is some evidence that storage and recall of words may be 
			partly, at least, based on relationships like these.</p>
			<p>
			It is rather difficult to assign certain types of words to all the 
			possible groupings.<br />
			For example, while a term like <em>yellow</em> can easily and 
			obviously be assigned to the lexical set of <em>colour</em>, it is 
			difficult to think of other members of the word family and even more 
			difficult to assign such an adjective to a semantic field.<br />
			Abstract concepts such as <em>interesting</em> can often be assigned 
			to a word family along with<em> interest, disinterested, 
			uninterested</em> etc. but the field into which it could be placed 
			is probably too amorphous to be of much help to learners &ndash; 
			personal reactions, perhaps?&nbsp; It also falls into no obvious 
			semantic field.</p>
			<p>
			The issues:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Word family<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="family" height="133" src="../../images/family200.jpg" width="200" /><ol class="auto-style55">
					<li>the term <em>lexeme</em> differs from what most people 
					understand as <em>word</em> in two ways:<ol class="auto-style56">
						<li>a lexeme may be made of multiple words so, for 
						example<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; off the cuff<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hard up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in spite of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; air conditioning unit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fly in the ointment</em><br />
						and so on are all lexemes because they refer to a single 
						concept.</li>
						<li>a lexeme also includes the inflected forms of the 
						item so, for example:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does, do, did, done, doing</em><br />
						are all just aspects of a single lexeme, <em>do</em>, 
						not separate units of meaning.<br />
						If you look in the dictionary for a definition of, say,
						<em>spoken</em>, you will be well advised to look under 
						the verb <em>speak</em> because that is the central 
						lexeme form.&nbsp; It is known, in the trade, as the 
						lemma or heading.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>The upshot is that it is hard to define where a lexeme 
					(and its various forms) ends and where we are entering the 
					realm of a word family.&nbsp; It is clear that:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speaks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speaking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spoken</em><br />
					are all part of the same lexeme (and will be found under the 
					lemma <em>speak</em>) but less clear whether:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speech<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speechify<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speechless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unspoken<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unspeakable</em><br />
					and so on<br />
					can also be included in the lexeme.<br />
					If they are not and will be found under a separate lemma, 
					then we are dealing with a word family, not a single lexeme.<br />
					A word family is a wider concept and will include all the 
					items derived from the base component.</li>
					<li>Unfortunately, the term word family is also used to 
					refer to a completely different relationship to do with 
					common sound-spelling patterns such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>ate, crate, date, fate, gate, late, plate, skate, state</em><br />
					and so on or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>bloom, boom, broom, doom, gloom, groom, loom, room, zoom</em><br />
					which can be learned as sets by children to help them 
					pronounce and spell words.&nbsp; That doesn’t seem a helpful 
					definition for English language teaching purposes but may 
					have some utility especially if we recognise that there is 
					some evidence to suggest that sounds patterns are also one 
					way in which lexis is memorised, categorised and recalled.<br />
					It may therefore be of some utility to approach patterns of, 
					say, irregular verbs as families such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ring, rang, rung, sing, sang, sung, 
					begin, began, begun, sink, sank, sunk<br />
					</em>and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; send, sent, sent, bend, bent, bent, 
					lend, lent, lent, pend, spent, spent<br />
					</em>which have similar ablaut forms as a way of helping 
					learners to remember patterns.<br />
					Even more confusingly, some people will refer to that 
					relationship as containing words in the same lexical set.&nbsp; 
					That way, madness lies.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Lexical set</strong><br />
				<img alt="set" height="133" src="../../images/knife_set200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This term is sometimes used to mean the same thing as semantic 
				set.&nbsp; It is, unfortunately, an equally variably defined 
				idea, but the line taken on this site is that it refers to words 
				of the same class defined in one of two ways:<ol class="auto-style55">
					<li>By topic or field (in a narrow sense):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>street, alley, square, place, avenue, road, cul-de-sac, 
					crescent</em><br />
					etc. all refer to the same topic and are all nouns making a 
					lexical set.<br />
					A set of hyponyms by this definition, would form a 
		lexical set.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; train, bus, coach, tram, ferry, 
					passenger plane, subway, metro</em><br />
					would be a lexical set derived from the superordinate <em>
					means of public transport</em> and would exclude many other 
					vehicles.&nbsp; If we change the superordinate, the lexical 
					set can shrink or grow accordingly so making the 
					superordinate <em>powered vehicle</em> means that the set 
					grows to include <em>car, truck, liner, cargo ship, lorry</em> 
					and more.&nbsp; Changing it to <em>land-based means of 
					public transport </em>and the lexical set shrinks to exclude 
					some of the items.<br />
					Lexical sets are very useful ways of classifying and 
					presenting lexis in the classroom but a superordinate which 
					includes too many terms under its umbrella will not be very 
					helpful so, for example, the superordinate <em>liquid</em> 
					will include so many possible lexemes in the set that all 
					sense of category is lost whereas, <em>cold drink</em> will 
					result in a manageable and learnable set.<br />
					It is possible to define a lexical set by word class so, for 
					example, we could have a set of similar items which might 
					include<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; dig, cultivate, water, fertilise, rotate, sow<br />
					</em>etc. all functioning as verbs and assignable to a 
					parallel lexical set to the one in the diagram above.<br />
					The same can be done for other word classes including 
					adjectives and adverbs.</li>
					<li>By syntax:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frequently, often, usually, never, 
					seldom</em><br />
					etc. are all adverbs of indefinite frequency sharing certain 
					syntactical characteristics (usually occurring before main 
					verbs and following any auxiliary verbs, for example).&nbsp; 
					Another example is the verbs:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; give, offer, read, sell, send, tell</em><br />
					which are all ditransitive verbs and appear in the same kind 
					of syntactical structures.<br />
					A better way to describe relationships like this is to refer 
					to colligation (common structural characteristics).</li>

				<li>S<strong>emantic or Lexical field</strong><br />
				<img alt="field" height="133" src="../../images/fields200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The problem lies in the way in which ‘field’ is understood.<ol class="auto-style55">
					<li>From a genre perspective, field refers to the topic of a 
					discourse, so some feel justified in referring to a group of 
					any words (whatever their word class) which are typically 
					used in that register as a lexical field.&nbsp; That is the 
					line taken here because it seems a useful concept for 
					teaching purposes.&nbsp; If one were talking or writing, for 
					example, about <em>car production</em>, then it is important 
					to be able to use the lexis related to the area: <em>
					assembly line, design, standardise, model, research, 
					investment, economy, components, version, raw materials, 
					parts suppliers, robots</em> etc.</li>
					<li>From a semantic point of view, that is too loose a 
					definition and a lexical field is confined to a group of 
					words which are related in meaning to each other <strong>
					according to a set of defined features</strong>.<br />
					For example, when talking about <em>horses</em>, one needs 
					to consider <em>stallion, foal, mare, hunter, carthorse, 
					thoroughbred, racehorse</em> etc. which are all defined by 
					age, sex or intended employment.<br />
					In that definition, a term such as <em>Exmoor Pony </em>or
					<em>Arabian</em> would lie outside the field because they 
					refer to particular breeds rather than age, sex and intended 
					employment (which are the only three features we are 
					considering).&nbsp; They can readily be included in the field 
					by widening the range of features one wants to include (and 
					adding ‘breed’).&nbsp; Other common examples of semantic 
					fields (rather than the loose lexical field) are words for 
					different ages and sexes of sheep, human family members, 
					types of software and so on.<br />
					A semantic field can only be determined by knowing the 
					features which the organiser chooses to include.<br />
					That can be very broad and include words of different 
					classes or very narrow and only include closely defined 
					features.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Given this confusion, it is understandable that the terms have 
			fallen out of favour but, providing you define your terms, there is 
			no reasons not to include concepts like these in teaching 
			programmes.</p>

						<strong>Gradable antonyms</strong></dt>
				<dd>don't turn into their opposites 
			when you put <em>not</em> before them.&nbsp; <em>Not short</em> does 
			not mean <em>tall</em>.&nbsp; It could mean <em>of average height, 
				long</em> etc.&nbsp; Another example is <em>wet vs. dry</em> 
				where we imagine a cline with wet at one end and dry at the 
				other with all kinds of degrees of wetness and dryness in 
				between (<em>moist, damp, soggy, clammy</em> etc.).</dd>
				<dt>
			<strong>Converse antonyms</strong></dt>
				<dd>also don't turn into opposites with the addition 
			of <em>not</em>.&nbsp; <em>Not male</em> does not automatically 
			mean <em>female</em>.&nbsp; A rock is <em>not male</em>.&nbsp; They are 
			antonyms which demand the existence of the opposite concept.&nbsp; 
			You can't say <em>his sister </em>without implying <em>her brother</em>.<br />
				A large subset of converse antonyms are sometimes referred to as
				<strong>relational antonyms</strong> because they frequently 
				refer to relationships between the items they refer to.&nbsp; 
				So, for example, <em>employer</em> is a converse antonym of <em>employee</em> 
				because each implies the existence of the other.<br />
				Another subset of converse antonyms is formed by <strong>
				directional antonyms</strong> such as <em>up-down, left-right, 
				north-south, out-in</em> etc. in which one of the pair 
				automatically implies the existence of the other.</dd>
				<dt>
			<strong>Complementary antonyms</strong></dt>
				<dd> <strong>do</strong> become the opposites with 
			the insertion of <em>not</em>.&nbsp; <em>Not reliable</em> has to 
			mean <em>unreliable, not dead</em> means <em>alive</em>&nbsp;and <em>not flawed </em>has to mean
				<em>flawless</em>.&nbsp; As we saw, on the other hand, <em>not my brother</em> and <em>
			not white</em> don't necessarily mean <em>my sister </em>or <em>

			</tr>
			</table>
			
		
			<p>Many antonyms of any of the three sorts so far described are 
			derivational so we get complementary pairs such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasant&ndash;unpleasant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; please–displease<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like–dislike<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friendly–unfriendly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anti-democratic–pro-democratic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possible–impossible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appear–disappear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do–undo</em><br />
			and so on and a few are formed by suffixation with the only 
			negative-forming suffix in English, -<em>less</em>, such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; useful–useless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hopeful–hopeless</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cheerful–cheerless</em><br />
			but this is very inconsistent and there are no pairings with, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clueless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friendless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moneyless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dreadful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; respectful<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beautiful<br />
			</em>although the antonyms may be coined as nonce words from time to 
			time.</p>
			<p>An alternative way to analyse antonymy is into two types only:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Ungraded antonyms </strong>which are exclusive, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>open</em> vs. <em>shut</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>pass</em> vs. <em>fail</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>dead</em> vs. <em>alive</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>married</em> vs. <em>unmarried</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>on</em> vs. off<br />
				etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Graded antonyms </strong>which represent parts of a continuum and are 
				relative terms, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>old</em> vs. <em>young</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>large</em> vs. <em>small</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>hot</em> vs. <em>cold</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sunny</em> vs. <em>cloudy</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>smooth</em> vs. <em>rough</em><br />
				etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the case of graded antonyms, relativity concerns the fact that 
			while a mouse is <em>small</em> relative to a house, it is <em>large</em> 
			relative to a flea and what may be described in Britain as a <em>hot</em> 
			day, would be described as <em>warm</em> in a hotter climate.<br />
			For teaching purposes, the simpler two-category distinction is often 
			enough.</p>

			<h3>Markedness</h3>

			</tr>
			</table>
			
		
			<p>Antonyms are marked in English (and in most languages, although 
			not always in parallel ways) with one of the pair forming the 
			unmarked item and the other being marked.&nbsp; For example, the 
			usual question is:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How old is the dog?</em><br />
			rather than:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How young is the dog?</em><br />
			because, even if the dog in question is obviously a puppy, the 
			second form is marked for a presumption that the dog is young.<br />
			Markedness does not only apply to adjectives, of course, so, for 
			example, <em>lion</em> and <em>lioness</em> may be considered 
			converse antonyms, only the latter is marked for sex.&nbsp; We see 
			the reverse, but rarer, marking in, e.g., <em>bride</em> and <em>
			bridegroom</em>.<br />
			See the guides to markedness and to gender linked below, for more in

			<p>It might be assumed that antonym pairs will exhibit more or less 
			the same collocational aspects as each other but that proves not to 
			be the case when research is done using the data in a corpus.&nbsp; 
			What is found is that some of the words collocate in very different 
			ways from their antonyms.&nbsp; For example, we frequently find:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; big brother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; big mistake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; big picture</em><br />
			and so on but far less frequently encounter:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; small mistake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; small picture</em><br />

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tall trees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tall buildings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wide variety<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wide array</em><br />
			but do not even allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *short trees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *short buildings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *narrow variety<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *narrow array</em><br />
			and conversely,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; narrow path<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; narrow gap</em><br />
			are more frequent than:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wide path<br />

					<p>A final issue with antonymy is the concept of 
					incompatible words.&nbsp; We cannot, for example say:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's a colourful monochrome 
					picture<br />
					</em>because the words <em>colourful</em> and <em>monochrome</em>, 
					while not being antonyms <em>per se</em>, are mutually 
					incompatible and nothing can be described as having both 
					characteristics.<br />
					On the other hand:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a striking monochrome picture<br />
					</em>is acceptable, because <em>striking</em> and <em>
					monochrome</em> are not incompatible.<br />
					With nouns, too, the phenomenon is observable because we can 
					have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a tulip and a real beauty<br />
					</em>but not, of course,<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's a tulip and a daffodil<br />
					</em>The distinction here is sometimes referred to as words 
					which have a relationship known as <strong>taxonomic sisters</strong>.&nbsp; 
					One of the set excludes the others so, for example, nothing 
					can be both blue and red simultaneously.<br />
					There are small semantic sets of multiple incompatible words 
					in all languages which are mutually exclusive without being 
					antonymous.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>seasons, months and days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; items of cutlery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; colours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; types of tree</em><br />

				* The adjective <em>chuffed</em> is recorded from the first

				from the Old English <em>cleofan</em>.&nbsp; The meanings are 
				not connected.<br />
			<p>
			The words are variously known as contronyms, contranyms, autantonyms or Janus 
			words.&nbsp; Longer lists are available by searching the internet, 
			of course, but many of the examples are very questionably true 
			contronyms.&nbsp; Some lists mistakenly include simple homophones.<br />
			There are obvious implications for learner confusion if any of these 
			words have only been met in one sense and are then found in the opposite 
			sense.</p>

		<p>This is a large area and the following only scratches the surface.&nbsp; 
		See the dedicated guides, linked below, for more.<br />
		Essentially, collocational relationships can be show like this:</p>

			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Fixed collocations</strong></dt>
				<dd>are, as in the example above, often binomials such as <em>chalk 
				and cheese, hit and miss, trial and error </em>and so.&nbsp; They are 
				used as if they were single words and you cannot replace a word 
				or reverse the ordering and maintain the same meaning.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Idioms</strong></dt>
				<dd>are also semi-fixed expressions which often represent a single 
				concept.&nbsp; For example<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throw in the towel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bury the hatchet</em><br />
				and in some, such as the first example, you may be able to 
				replace <em>towel</em> with <em>sponge</em> but few other 
				changes are possible although tense and persons can change and 
				we may be able to insert adjectives and adverbs.<br />
				There is a guide to idiomaticity, linked at the end, which also 
				includes consideration of binomials.</dd>
				<dt>
				<strong>Strong collocations</strong></dt>
				<dd>are those that will often immediately spring to a 
				native-speaker's mind when presented with part of the phrase.&nbsp; 
				Other examples might include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay a compliment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; establish rapport<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; light a fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fairy godmother<br />
				</em>etc.</dd>
				<dt>
			<strong>Medium-strength collocations</strong></dt>
				<dd>are those in which there is more flexibility but the 
				selection of items is limited.&nbsp; Other examples include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dense fog<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deadly poison<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; activity holiday<br />
				</em>etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Weak collocations</strong></dt>
				<dd>are those in which a wide range of items are possible but 
				some are excluded.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high building<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; narrow road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arrange the furniture</em><br />
				and so on.</dd>
				<dt>
			<strong>Textual collocation</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to the fact that words 
			in the same field (see above) will occur together in texts on 
			certain topics.&nbsp; For example, a text concerning transport might 
			well contain:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>fuel, public, cars, transport, commute, fare<br />
				</em>etc. and one concerning information technology is likely to 
				include terms such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>network, connection, wi-fi, program, access point, cloud, 
				download, router<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				See above under lexical field for more.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Naturally enough, we cannot categorise every collocation we meet 
			simply into one of six categories.&nbsp; The strength of 
			collocation operates on a cline from non-existent to overwhelming.</p>
			<p>See above under synonyms and antonyms for a little more about 
			collocation in those respects.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Any investigation of lexis will reveal a goodly number of words 
			ending in -<em>nmy</em> or -<em>onomy</em>.&nbsp; Here's a crib 
			sheet:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Acronym [/ˈæ.krə.nɪm/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>A word made of the initial letters 
					of a phrase which are pronounced as one word.<br />
					For example, <em>NATO</em>.<br />
				Words which are so formed but in which each letter is separately 
				pronounced (such as <em>DVD</em>) are called initialisms.<br />
				See the guide to word formation for more.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Antonym [/ˈæn.tə.nɪm/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>A word carrying an opposite meaning (see above).<br />
				For example, <em>good</em> is an antonym of <em>bad</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Autoantonym / Contranym / Contronym [/ˌɔː.təʊ.ˈæn.tə.nɪm/, 
				/ˈkɒn.trə.nɪm/, /ˈkɒn.trəʊ.nɪm/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>A word which has two opposite meanings (see above).<br />
				For example, <em>cleave</em> can mean <em>split</em> or <em>
				stick together with</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Autonym [/ˈɔː.təʊ.nɪm/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>A word used by a group of people to describe themselves.<br />
				For example, <em>Brit</em> is often used by British and other 
				people to describe people from Britain.<br />
				Compare <strong>exonym</strong>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Demonym [/ˈde.məʊ.nɪm/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>An adjective which refers to the people of a country or 
				place.<br />
				For example, <em>Dutch</em> refers to people from The 
				Netherlands, <em>Berliner</em> refers to people from Berlin and
				<em>Liverpudlian</em> refers to people from Liverpool.<br />
				See the guide to adjectives for more.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Econym [/ˈiːk.əʊ.nɪm/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>A word or phrase used only within a family or household and 
				not accessible for outsiders.&nbsp; Often words for gadgets and 
				some favourite dishes are econyms such as <em>Aunt Mabel's Fish 
				Pie</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Eponym [/ˈdep.əʊ.nim/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>These refer to objects closely associated with a person or 
				character or the nature of the person.<br />
				For example, <em>wellington boot</em> is a term associated with 
				its wearer, The Duke of Wellington.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Exonym [/ˈeks.əʊ.nim/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>A name by which one group of people refers to another 
				describe a group of people but which is not used by that group 
				to describe themselves.<br />
				For example, <em>gringo</em> is sometimes used by Latin 
				Americans to describe citizens of the USA.&nbsp; Notoriously, 
				the adjective <em>English</em> is used by non-English people to 
				refer to anyone from Britain and Northern Ireland but no 
				resident of the United Kingdom uses the term that way.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Heteronym [ˈhetər.əʊ.nim/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>a) words which have the same spelling 
					but a different pronunciation and different meanings.<br />
				For example, <em>lead</em> (<em>go before</em>) vs. <em>lead</em> 
				(<em>a metal</em>).<br />
				b) words which refer to the same thing but are used in different 
				dialect or speech communities.<br />
				For example <em>lift</em> (British English) vs. <em>elevator</em> 
				(American English).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Holonym [/ˈhɒ.ləʊ.nim/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>The term to describe the whole of something made up of parts 
				(see under meronym).&nbsp; So, for example, <em>cover, fly leaf, 
				frontispiece, index</em> etc. are all meronyms of the holonym
				<em>book</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Homonym [/ˈhɒ.mə.nɪm/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>A word which is the same in spelling and pronunciation but 
				which is differently derived and has a different meaning (see 
				above).<br />
				For example, <em>bear</em> (<em>carry</em>) and <em>bear</em> (<em>animal</em>).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Hypernym [/ˈhaɪ.pər.nim/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>The overarching word which contains the meanings of 
				second-level words (hyponyms).<br />
				For example, <em>flower</em> is a hypernym of <em>dahlia, 
				buttercup, daffodil </em>etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Hyponym [/ˈhaɪ.pəʊ.nim/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are the second-level word below a hypernym (see 
				above).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Meronym [/ˈme.r.əʊ.nim/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>The part of a whole.<br />
				For example, <em>flat, lift, entrance hall, lobby </em>etc. are 
				parts of the whole <em>apartment block</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Metonym [/ˈmet.əʊ.nym]/</strong></dt>
				<dd>A word closely associated with something and which can be 
				used to refer to it.<br />
				For example, <em>Athens</em> may be used to refer to the Greek 
				government.<br />
				See the guide to synonymy for more.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Paronym [/ˈpæ.rəʊ.nim/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>A cognate word in another language.<br />
				For example, the words <em>paper, papel, papír </em>and <em>
				papier</em> are cognates in English, Spanish, Hungarian and 
				French respectively.<br />
				There is a guide to cognates on this site.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Retronym [/ˈret.rəʊ.nim/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>A word which has been coined to describe something obsolete.<br />
				For example, the lexeme <em>rotary telephone </em>describes what 
				would have been referred to simply as <em>telephone</em> before 
				the advent of touch-button dialling.<br />
				See the guide to word formation for more.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Synonym [/ˈsɪ.nə.nɪm/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>A word which has an identical or nearly identical meaning 
				(see above).<br />
				For example, <em>large</em> and <em>big</em>.<br />
				See the guide to synonymy for more.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Toponym [/ˈtɒp.əʊ.nim/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>A word derived from the name of a place.<br />
				For example, the word <em>marathon</em> is derived from the name 
				of a place in Greece.<br />
				See the guide to word formation for more.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Troponym [/ˈtrɒp.əʊ.nim/]</strong></dt>
				<dd>A word which more narrowly defines another concept.<br />
				For example, the word <em>stroll</em> is a troponym of <em>walk</em> 
				because its meaning contains the idea of walking slowly in a 
				relaxed manner.<br />
				See the guide to synonymy and above for more.</dd>
