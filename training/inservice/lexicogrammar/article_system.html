	<h1>The article system</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="articles" height="207" src="../../images/bricabrac310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p>Articles in English form a sub-class of determiners.&nbsp; 
		If you want the overview first, therefore, you should look at
		<a href="determiners.html" target="_blank">the guide to determiners</a> 
		(new tab).</p>
			<p>Articles are unusual determiners in that they cannot stand alone 
			in English and function as pronouns.&nbsp; Other determiners 
			generally perform both functions as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't lose any money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't lose any<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want that book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have many ideas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have many<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me some sugar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me some</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			but we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She gave me a</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			Other languages, incidentally, do not necessarily have a parallel 
			restriction.</p>
			<p>There are three articles in English that we consider here:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>a / an</em>: the indefinite article</li>
				<li><em>the</em>: the definite article</li>
				<li><em>&Oslash;</em>: the zero article</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In what follows, we shall not be considering the negative article
			<em>no</em> or the partitive article <em>some</em>.</p>
			<hr />
		
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<a name="warning"></a>
				<img alt="warning" height="166" src="../../images/flag_warning250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style27">
				<h2><span class="style_red"><strong>Website </strong>warning</span></h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>There is deep confusion out here on the web about how articles in 
			English are used.&nbsp; There is also a good deal of uncertainty 
			about what articles actually are.<br />
			On many sites you will find a set of rules which, apart from being 
			unnecessary and confusing, are, at times, plain wrong.<br />
			The focus often seems to be on slightly interesting phenomena such 
			as how articles are used with names of families, rivers and 
			countries and so on at the expense of setting out the generally 
			quite simple and transparent rules that we will cover in this guide.<br />
			Guides which focus on quirks and exceptions 
			which depress and confuse learners rather than shining a light on 
			the concepts which underlie the use of articles in English are not 
			very helpful.</p>
			<p>What happens with that approach is that learners are encouraged 
			to commit a range of pseudo-rules to memory and then asked to apply 
			them to the language they know.&nbsp; They can't do that, of course, 
			because the pseudo-rules themselves are obscure and inadequate so 
			they make mistakes.&nbsp; It's a form of internet-induced error.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="6" height="166" src="../../images/six_integer250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>How many possible articles are there?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>English does not use the full range of articles (and it is 
			unlikely that any language does) but there are possibilities in all 
			languages and some will use more or fewer of the possible articles 
			to determine nouns.</p>
			<p>Here they are, with a few comments:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>The indefinite article</strong><br />
				<img alt="snow" height="133" src="../../images/snow200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				In English this is either <em>a</em> or <em>an</em> but some 
				will include <em>some</em> as a plural indefinite article.<br />
				Example are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an interesting book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came to a halt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me some coins<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have wasted an hour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a(n) historic moment<br />
				</em>The issue for some learners is that the article <em>an </em>
				occurs slightly irregularly.<br />
				The general rule is that we use<em> an </em>before a vowel 
				sound, but we use <em>a </em>before a consonant sound and in 
				both cases disregard how the word is spelled because this is a 
				pronunciation issue.&nbsp; So we get, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an artist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sculptor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a European issue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an honourable man<br />
				</em>When the /h/ sound is weakly or not sounded, many BrE speakers will 
				also use <em>an </em>instead of <em>a </em>so we have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an historic moment<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				and some will choose to use <em>an</em> before <em>hotel</em> 
				because the word is quite recently imported from French and the 
				'h' is not sounded in that language.&nbsp; There is a bit more 
				below on this.<br />
				When the /h/ sound is clear, however, the choice falls on <em>a</em> 
				as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a horrible experience</em><br />
				Both <em>a</em> and <em>an</em> are very often reduced to their 
				weak forms and pronounced as /ə/ and /ən/ respectively.<br />
				If, however, the speaker wishes to emphasise the fact that the 
				article refers to only one instance of a specified set of items, 
				then the article is pronounced in its full form as /eɪ/ or /æn/.&nbsp; 
				In writing, this use will usually be shown as emphatic as in, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's <span class="style_underline">
				<strong>a</strong></span> reason but not the only one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's <span class="style_underline"><strong>an</strong></span> 
				idea but not the best one<br />
				</em>In quite a lot of languages which have an indefinite article, it 
				is indistinguishable from the numeral one (and if not 
				the same, then closely related to it).&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, the 
				article <em>a/an</em> is derived from the word for <em>one</em> 
				in English and is a reduced form of it.</li>
				<li><strong>The definite article</strong><br />
				<img alt="finger" height="133" src="../../images/finger_point_left200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				In English this is solely the word <em>the</em> because English 
				does not have alternatives dependent on gender or number so we 
				have e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people all arrived late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car went off the road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The choice is limited</em><br />
				Again, there is a pronunciation issue.<br />
				The article is pronounced /ði/ before a vowel sound and /ðə/ 
				before a consonant sound, again, regardless of how a word is 
				spelled.&nbsp; We have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the apple</em> (/ði.ˈjæp.l̩/)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man</em> (/ðə.mæn/)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Euro</em> (/ðə.ˈjʊə.rəʊ/)<br />
				etc.<br />
				And again, the weak or absent /h/ sound is slightly problematic 
				because some will choose to pronounce<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the historical facts</em><br />
				as /ðə.hɪ.ˈstɒ.rɪk.l̩.fækts/<br />
				and some will prefer /ði.hɪ.ˈstɒ.rɪk.l̩.fækts/.&nbsp; There is 
				more below on this.<br />
				The exception to this rule is when the article is stressed as 
				in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is <span class="style_underline">the</span> tool for the job</em><br />
				as /ðət.s.ˈði.tuːl.fə.ðə.dʒɒb/<br />
				in which case it is marked to signal that it means <em>the best, 
				most appropriate </em>or <em>only</em> tool for the job.&nbsp; 
				In written language, it is normally <em>italicised</em> or
				<span class="style_underline">underlined</span> in the 
				marked form.<br />
				In a range of languages which do not have a definite article (or 
				any article system at all) the equivalent of the definite 
				article is often a demonstrative determiner roughly translatable 
				as <em>this</em> or <em>that, these </em>or <em>those</em>.<br />
				In fact, the definite article in English shares an etymology 
				with the demonstrative determiners and can be seen as a reduced 
				form of them in Modern English.&nbsp; In other words, <em>this, 
				that, these</em> and <em>those</em> can be conceptualised as 
				forms of the definite article marked for spatial relationships 
				(near or far) and number (singular or plural).</li>
				<li><strong>The proper article</strong><br />
				<img alt="building" height="133" src="../../images/buildings_important200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is somewhat rare in English but occurs frequently in other 
				languages leading some into error.<br />
				For example, in Greek, Portuguese and Catalan, it is 
				conventional to use an article before people's name (<em>the 
				Peter, the Maria </em>etc.).&nbsp; This also happens in informal 
				use in German, French, Italian and Spanish.<br />
				The proper article occurs less often in English but examples 
				are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mr Jones I spoke to was very helpful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Strand is a road in London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kremlin is in Moscow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gambia is in Africa</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				It is also possible for <em>a/an</em> to occur as a proper 
				article although it is rare as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Mrs Jones telephoned</em><br />
				in which the speaker is signalling that the person is unknown 
				except by name.<br />
				Usage varies over time and countries once conventionally referred to with 
				the proper article are no longer referred to that way so we 
				have, e.g., <em>Ukraine</em>, not <em>The Ukraine</em> and <em>
				Argentina</em> not <em>The Argentine</em>.<br />
				Modified country names conventional use the proper article:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Soviet Union<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Arab Emirates</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				In this guide, we consider proper articles in English as a 
				subset of the definite article.</li>
				<li><strong>The partitive article</strong><br />
				<img alt="cake" height="120" src="../../images/cake_slice200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This only occurs in English with the determiner <em>some</em> as 
				in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please give me some paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass me some pens</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				However, other languages use the partitive article frequently 
				and these include French, Greek, Italian and a range of others and in 
				many of those languages 
				they consist of a combination of the definite article with a 
				preposition.&nbsp; For example, in French, <em>à + le </em>= <em>
				au</em> and <em>de + le </em>= <em>du</em>.&nbsp; In Italian, 
				the preposition <em>di</em> combines with the definite article 
				to produce <em>dello</em>, <em>della</em> and other forms 
				equivalent to <em>some</em> or <em>any</em> in English and 
				called a partitive article.&nbsp; In Greek, the preposition <em>
				se</em> (<em>at</em> or <em>in</em>) combines with articles to form <em>ston</em>, <em>sti</em> 
				and so on.</li>
				<li><strong>The negative article</strong><br />
				<img alt="negative" height="133" src="../../images/negative_flowers200.jpg" width="200" /><br />In English, this role is taken by the word 
				<em>no</em> which 
				acts as a simple determiner.&nbsp; However, other languages may 
				reserve an article-like item for this function.&nbsp; German, 
				for example has the word <em>kein</em> which is inflected in the 
				same way as the indefinite article to show gender and number.<br />Fundamentally, English does not use a negative article but for 
				those whose languages do, comparing <em>no</em> to the 
				indefinite article has some validity.</li>
				<li><strong>Zero article</strong><br />
				<img alt="0" height="133" src="../../imagesgraphics/zero200.gif" width="200" /><br />
				As the name implies, this is an absence of an obvious article and is 
				usually represented as &Oslash;.&nbsp; Because English has a definite 
				article denoting specificity as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me the money</em><br />
				it also employs the zero article to denote an unspecified object 
				before a count or mass noun as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take books with you</em><br />
				The word <em>some</em> can be used as an indefinite plural 
				article or to determine a mass noun as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me some money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take some books with you</em><br />
				It is unhelpful to describe the lack of an article in languages 
				which do not have an article system or those which have a 
				reduced system as the zero article.<br />
				It is also not the case that proper nouns in English usually take the 
				zero article.&nbsp; Most actually take no article at all so, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter is here</em><br />
				is not an example of the use of the zero article because proper 
				names do not normally take any article at all.&nbsp; However:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rain fell overnight</em><br />
				does contain an example of the zero article because that is 
				often how we signal a mass noun non-specifically and should, if 
				we are being strict be written as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ø Rain fell overnight.<br />
				</em>Compare:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain made the paths muddy<br />
				</em>which is the use of the definite article to refer to a 
				specific mass noun (i.e., the rain that both you and I know 
				about).</li>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In common with other function words, articles are subject to 
			weakening in connected speech in particular.&nbsp; This is what 
			happens:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Before vowel sounds:<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li>The indefinite article,<em> an</em>, is reduced 
					in rapid speech to /ən/ as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>an orange</em> pronounced as /ən.ˈɒ.rɪndʒ/.</li>
					<li>The definite article, <em>the</em>, retains a longer 
					final sound as /ði/ (but is not as long as /ði:/) as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the orange</em> pronounced as /ði.ˈjɒ.rɪndʒ/.</li>
					<li>In both cases there is liaison so for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an apple</em><br />
					sounds more like <em>a napple</em> and there is an intrusive 
					/j/ sound in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the apple</em><br />
					which can be transcribed as /ði.ˈjæp.l̩/, but not all 
					speakers produce the intrusion and more careful speech 
					usually avoids it.<br />
					(Incidentally, the word <em>apron</em> in English was 
					originally <em>a napron</em> but, by a process called 
					misdivision it has become <em>an apron</em>.)</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Before /h/:<br />
				As we saw above, /h/ is often pronounced very weakly so we get, 
				e.g.:<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em><strong>a vs. an</strong> </em>(as /ə/ or /ən/)<em><br />
					How the pronunciation varies when the article falls before 
					/h/ varies</em>, as with many phenomena in connected speech, 
					with the stress patterning.<br />
					When the first syllable of a word beginning with /h/ carries 
					stress, the choice falls on <em>a</em> (not <em>an</em>)<em>
					</em>pronounced as /ə/ in as in<br />
					<em>a history lesson</em> as /ə.ˈhɪ.str̩i.ˈles.n̩/<br />
					When the first syllable is not stressed, however, the 
					preferred form is <em>an </em>and the pronunciation is:<br />
					<em>an historic moment </em>as /ən.hɪ.ˈstɒ.rɪk.ˈməʊ.mənt/<br />
					In more careful speech, however, that might also be 
					pronounced as /æn.hɪ.ˈstɒ.rɪk.ˈməʊ.mənt/ with the article in its full 
					citation form.<br />
					The reason lies in stress as we have said and the unstressed 
					first syllables of words are often reduced.&nbsp; There is 
					evidence to suggest that in earlier times an unstressed 
					syllable with /h/ onset was not pronounced at all.&nbsp; 
					Dialects and varieties vary.<br />
					But when the /h/ is clearly sounded and the stress falls on 
					the syllable it contains, we get, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a horrible experience</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a history lesson</em><br />
					in which the article is reduced to /ə/.<br />
					The British National Corpus of above 100 million words finds 
					rather more incidents of <em>a historical</em> than <em>an 
					historical</em> but not by much.&nbsp; It finds about equal 
					numbers of <em>an habitual </em>as <em>a habitual</em> 
					including dictionary entries, incidentally.</li>
					<li><em>the</em> (as /ðə/ or /ði/)<br />
					&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; the historic moment</em><br />
					is
					pronounced either as /ðə.hɪ.ˈstɒ.rɪk.ˈməʊ.mənt/ or /ði.hɪ.ˈstɒ.rɪk.ˈməʊ.mənt/ 
					depending how careful the speaker is.&nbsp; This also 
					is caused by the stress features set out above.&nbsp; 
					First-syllable stressing usually requires the use of /ðə/ 
					and non-first syllable stressing requires /ði/ so in the case of a clear /h/ as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the horrible experience</em><br />
					the pronunciation remains as /ðə/ as in /ðə.ˈhɒ.rəb.l̩.ɪk.ˈspɪə.rɪəns/ 
					and in the case of:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the horrific experience</em> will usually be /ði.hə.ˈrɪ.fɪk.ɪk.ˈspɪə.rɪəns/<br />
					simply because <em>horrific</em> takes second-syllable 
					stress and <em>horrible</em> takes first-syllable stress.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Before other consonants such as at the beginning of <em>
				sound, bag, cake </em>etc.:<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em>a</em> is pronounced as /ə/ (/ə.ˈsaʊnd/, /ə.bæɡ/, 
					/ə.keɪk/)</li>
					<li><em>the</em> is pronounced as /ðə/ (/ðə.ˈsaʊnd/, /ðə.bæɡ/,

			<p>Languages differ dramatically in the use of articles (and some 
			don't use them at all).&nbsp; Here's a short list but you should 
			rely on your own research into the language(s) of your learners.&nbsp; 
			Asking them is often useful as it alerts them to differences.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Languages with no article system</dt>
				<dd>These include most Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, 
				Bosnian, Czech etc.) as well as Chinese languages, Indonesian, 
				Japanese, Hindi and Urdu.<br />
				For speakers of these languages, using the correct article in 
				English is very challenging because they do not easily 
				conceptualise the need to mark specificity and non-specificity 
				or count <em>vs</em>. mass nouns.</dd>
				<dt>Language with no indefinite article</dt>
				<dd>These include most Celtic languages (Breton, Welsh, Gaelic, 
				Irish etc.) and Turkish, Persian languages and Arabic (which often encodes 
				the definite article as a prefix).</dd>
				<dt>Languages using affixation for articles</dt>
				<dd>Some languages do not have a separate word class of articles 
				but may use a similar system by adding suffixes to nouns.&nbsp; 
				These include Albanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Bengali, Romanian 
				and Scandinavian languages.<br />
				Other languages such as Hebrew and Maltese use prefixes to 
				denote an article system akin to English.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Many languages alter articles to show gender (most European 
			languages) and it is impossible to use any noun, even an invented 
			one, without first considering its gender.&nbsp; European languages 
			have two or three genders normally although more are possible.<br />
			Some languages, such as Basque, Georgian and most Native American 
			languages distinguish between animate and inanimate nouns through 
			the use of gender inflexions on the articles (and elsewhere).</p>
			<p>Languages which are traditionally described as being article-less 
			such as Japanese and Cantonese often use classifiers (sometimes 
			called counters) to denote a 
			wide range of properties in the nouns such as animacy, flatness, 
			stick-like appearance and so on.&nbsp; For more, see
			the guide to classifiers, 
			partitives and group nouns, linked in the list of related guides at 
			the end.</p>

					<h2>Three critical concepts</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>English has no gender marking on articles and we do not mark them 
			for case or number either.<br />
			However, there is a deeply important 
			distinction between three related concepts which determine how the 
			article system functions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>definite and indefinite: <strong>particular</strong> or
				<strong>general</strong></li>
				<li>specific and 
			non-specific (or generic): <strong>which</strong> or <strong>what</strong></li>
				<li>mass and count: <strong>much</strong> or <strong>many</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The three concepts are 
			entirely lacking in many other languages.<br />
			In some languages, it is necessary to decide 
			what the shape of objects is and what other characteristics they exhibit 
			before you can count them or speak about even a single incidence of 
			them.&nbsp; In others, it is necessary to decide what gender to ascribe to a 
			noun before attaching a correct article as well as sometimes what 
			case the noun is in.<br />
			In English, however, these concepts are lacking and it is necessary 
			to decide in terms of these three ideas above before deciding which 
			article is appropriate.</p>
			<p>That is a serious conceptual challenge for many learners who, even 
			at advanced levels, are unable to use the article system with 
			consistent accuracy (or even consistent inaccuracy).<br />
			<strong>You cannot successfully teach the article system in English without 
			making these three ideas clear.</strong></p>

			<p>The rules we follow arise from the three concepts we have 
			identified.<br />
			We will refer here in all that follows to the distinction between 
			indefinite <span class="style_underline">but</span> specific and definite
			<span class="style_underline">and</span> specific.&nbsp; That's the 
			key to have in mind.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Indefinite <span class="style_underline">but</span> 
				specific </strong>reference is to <strong>what</strong> we are 
				talking about but not to <strong>which</strong> we have in mind.&nbsp; 
				I know, for example, that when you say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass me a pen</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me water</em><br />
				that you are referring to something which uses ink for writing 
				but I can pass you any pen that comes to hand because although 
				you have been definite about what you want, you have not told me 
				which you want.<br />
				In the second case, I also know <strong>what</strong> you want 
				but I have no notion of the quantity or source of the water you 
				require.</li>
				<li><strong>Definite </strong>
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>and</strong></span><strong> 
				specific</strong> reference gives me two types of information.&nbsp; 
				So, when you say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass me the pen</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me the water</em><br />
				then:<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>I know <strong>what</strong> you are talking about and 
					will pass you a pen or give you water but ...</li>
					<li>... I also know <strong>which</strong> instance you are 
					talking about and will give you the specific pen or amount 
					or container of water that you asked for.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Unless this distinction lies at the heart of article teaching, 
			the enterprise is doomed.</p>

			</table>
		<p>Decide what you are talking about.&nbsp; There are <strong>only</strong> 
		three choices:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>One of some of many – <strong>indefinite but specific reference</strong><br />
			<img alt="delivery" height="133" src="../../images/delivery_flowers200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>A man brought some flowers</em></span><br />
			This means that the speaker / writer is referring to a specific 
			<strong>class</strong> of nouns but not to the specific <strong>instance</strong> of the noun.&nbsp; 
			In other words, the noun is not identifiable by the reader / hearer 
			other than knowing the class of nouns to which reference is being 
			made.&nbsp; The speaker / writer may or may not know more about the 
			noun but this information is not being communicated to the hearer / 
			reader.&nbsp; Compare this to the third point, below.<br />
			For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A man arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information got lost<br />
			</em>In these examples, the hearer / reader only knows what sort of 
			noun is in question (i.e., specific reference) but does not 
			know any more about the noun (i.e., the reference is indefinite).<br />
			The reference is <strong>indefinite <span class="style_underline">but</span> specific</strong>.</li>
			<li>All of them, everywhere – <strong>indefinite
			<span class="style_underline">but</span> generic reference</strong><br />
			<img alt="wheel" height="133" src="../../images/wheel200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>The wheel was an important invention</em></span><br />
			This 
			also means the speaker / writer is referring to a whole <strong>class</strong> of nouns, 
			not a single <strong>instance</strong> of the class.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A solicitor deals with legal matters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sundial was invented thousands of years ago<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctors charge a lot in my country<br />
			</em>In these examples, the speaker / writer is referring not to 
			single instances of the nouns but to the whole class of nouns in 
			general.<br />
			The reference is, then, <strong>indefinite
			<span class="style_underline">but</span> generic</strong>.</li>
			<li>This one exactly – <strong>definite 
			<span class="style_underline">and</span> specific reference</strong><br />
			<img alt="sun" height="133" src="../../images/sunrise200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>The sun is our nearest star</em></span><br />
			This 
			means the speaker / writer is referring to a single, known instance 
			of the noun.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man spoke to me.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; London lies on the Thames<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind is getting stronger<br />
			</em>Here, the reference is both specific (we know <strong>what</strong> 
			sort of noun is 
			being referred to) and definite (we know <strong>which</strong> noun is in 
			question).&nbsp; Normally, both the writer / speaker and the reader 
			/ hearer are aware of some or all of the noun's characteristics and 
			can use that information to distinguish between instances of the 
			noun in question.<br />
			It will not, therefore, be surprising for you to discover that the 
			definite article, <em>the</em>, is derived from the same source as 
			the demonstrative determiners, <em>this, that </em>etc.<br />
			The reference is <strong>definite <span class="style_underline">and</span> specific</strong> 
			and contains <strong>two</strong> pieces of information.</li>

			<p>It matters if the noun is countable or uncountable (i.e., a mass 
			noun), singular or 
		plural.<br />
			English is not unique but it does have a fundamental and very 
			important distinction between mass and count nouns.&nbsp; Languages 
			which do not have this distinction (or in which the distinction is 
			not grammatically significant) generally have much simpler article 
			systems, or none at all.&nbsp; It is almost impossible to use a noun 
			correctly in English unless one has first considered whether it is 
			being used as a mass noun or a count noun.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, Rule 3 is quite simple:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style72">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style73">&nbsp;</td>
					<td class="auto-style68" style="border-top-color: #000080; border-top-width: 1px">Count nouns</td>

			To put that table into words:<ol>
				<li>Singular count nouns must be determined by <em>a/an</em> or <em>the</em>.&nbsp; 
				We allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parcel is here<br />

			</table>
			<p>People are sometimes confused about which article to use when 
			expressing generic reference because it seems we can use all of 
			them.&nbsp; We allow, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>A</strong></span> 
			computer is a useful thing to have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>The</strong></span> 
			computer has changed everyone's lives<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash; </strong></span>Computers 
			are getting cheaper<br />
			</em>There is a reason for this.<br />
			Providing we do not use the &Oslash; with a singular countable noun and 
			reserve it for mass nouns as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash;</strong></span> 
			Computer memory is now quite cheap</em><br />
			all other possibilities are open to us because the sense of generic 
			reference to every instance of an item everywhere makes 
			considerations of specific <em>vs</em>. non-specific reference and 
			definite <em>vs</em>. indefinite reference irrelevant.&nbsp; In 
			other words, it overrides the necessity to think in those terms at 
			all.</p>
			<p>That is the reason we can say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gorillas are powerful animals<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gorilla is a powerful animal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gorilla is a powerful animal</em><br />
			with no difference in meaning.<br />
			All that remains is to consider ambiguity and style:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>If we use the article <em>a(n)</em> we may be assumed to be 
				referring to an <strong>indefinite <span class="style_underline">
				but</span> specific</strong> member of the class of 
				primates called gorillas, as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a gorilla in the kitchen</em><br />
				If we use <em>the</em> there is a possibility that we may be 
				understood to be referring to a specific, definite gorilla, as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gorilla is in the kitchen</em><br />
				The safest and most common way of using count nouns as generic 
				reference is the plural with zero article as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Gorillas are not something I want in my kitchen</em>.</li>
				<li>Stylistically, that is also the safest option because the 
				use of the articles with count nouns for generic reference is 
				often somewhat stilted and formal.<br />
				It needs to be understood by learners but whether it needs to be 
				taught except at high levels for learners who need to deploy 
				very formal language is very questionable (although course book 
				writers seem oddly attached to it).</li>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			Articles have a discourse function and, as with much in connected 
			discourse, a good deal depends on shared information.</p>
			<p>
			Course books for learners will often have simplified (and often 
			inaccurate) 'rules' for article use and we have set out the main ones above.&nbsp; When these rules are apparently broken, the 
			explanation often lies in the nature of the use of articles in 
			discourse.<br />
			Consider these examples:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>A car arrived outside my door and the 
				driver got out and walked up the path.</em><ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>If we follow the rule that the noun <em>car</em> here is 
					<strong>indefinite <span class="style_underline">but</span> specific 
					</strong>reference (i.e., it refers to one of 
				many countable objects but the speaker and hearer both know
					<strong>what</strong> sort of object it is but not <strong>
					which</strong> one), then that happily explains the use of 
				the indefinite article, <em>a</em>.<br />However, the noun <em>driver</em> is also specific indefinite 
				reference, isn't it?&nbsp; We do not know which of the millions 
				of drivers it is, just that it is one of them.&nbsp; So, why the definite article which in 
				the chart above is not an option because that applies to 
				definite and specific reference?<br />The answer lies in the shared information.&nbsp; We know that 
				only one driver is permitted <em>per</em> car and we also know 
				which car is in question (it is the one which arrived) so we 
				are, in fact, talking about definite and specific reference and the 
				rule above is not broken.&nbsp; It is:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The driver of a car<br />
					</em>just as we can have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mane of a lion<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teacher of a class<br />
					</em>and so on.</li>
					<li>This will also explain the use of <em>the path</em> because, 
				again, the use of the definite article tells the hearer that the 
				speaker has only one path from the car to the house (or, at 
				least, that this path is only one that is relevant to what 
				happened next).&nbsp; If the sentence had been<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A car arrived and a driver got out and 
				walked up a path</em><br />then different messages will be sent:<br />In this case it means that this driver was not actually driving 
				the car at all but is a member of a class of drivers so it then 
				becomes indefinite but specific reference (just as the article in
					<em>a car </em>is being used).&nbsp; It also means that there 
				were more than one paths and the person chose one of them, not a 
				definite one from those available so that, too, is indefinite 
					but specific reference.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>We chose a present for my brother but it was 
				not a present he wanted</em><br />
				Here, we have <em>a present</em> chosen from innumerable 
				possibilities so the first article follows the rule: we are 
				talking about a single <strong>indefinite
				<span class="style_underline">but</span> specific</strong> case so the 
				indefinite article is valid.<br />
				However, we then have <em>a present</em> again and this time it 
				seems that the reference is definite <strong>and</strong> 
				specific because we know what the present was (the one we 
				chose).&nbsp; Should it not, then, be <em>the present</em>?<br />
				It could be, of course, but that would imply that he had other 
				presents in mind that he did want (a definite and specific 
				present) and the use of the article <em>the</em> would imply 
				that.<br />
				However, here, two things are happening:<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>We have the dummy or existential <em>it</em>-clause in
					<em>it was not a present he wanted</em> so that serves to 
					denote the specific nature of the present.&nbsp; In other 
					words, we know <strong>what</strong> we are talking about.</li>
					<li>We then have an indefinite article implying that from a 
					large number of possible presents, this one was not wanted 
					and that is indefinite but specific reference so the rules are 
					not broken, it is the discourse intentions of the statement 
					that leads to the article choice.&nbsp; If we compare:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he didn't want a gift like 
					this</em><br />
					with<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he didn't want the gift</em><br />
					the difference becomes plain.&nbsp; The first is indefinite 
					but specific reference and the second is definite and specific 
					reference.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; A cat can be good company for lonely people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cat is an independent animal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cats are independent animals<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The domestic cat is descended from wild animals in the Middle 
				East</em><br />
				If these are all examples of generic reference to countable 
				nouns, why the difference?<br />
				Partly, as was said above, this is a stylistic issue.<br />
				The use of the indefinite article to refer to a generic case of 
				a countable noun requires the use of the singular form.&nbsp; It 
				is generally considered to be stylistically rarer and more 
				formal.<br />
				The form of choice is usually the plural as in the third example 
				but the second example is common enough.<br />
				In the first example, we have a grey area because it may be 
				assumed that the speaker is referring to indefinite but specific 
				reference (on the left of the diagram above) and suggesting that 
				lonely people should acquire a cat (<em>any</em> cat) for 
				company rather than suggesting that all cats are suitable as 
				company for all lonely people.&nbsp; In this case, however, the 
				speaker probably has a singular cat (rather than lots) in mind and 
				so uses the indefinite article in the way that many other 
				languages would use a numeral.&nbsp; (In French, for example, 
				that would be <em>un chat, </em>in German <em>eine Katze</em>, 
				in Spanish <em>un gato</em> and so on for many other languages 
				in which the indefinite article shares the same form with the 
				numeral 1.)<br />
				The final example, too, verges on definite reference (on the 
				right of the diagram) because of the use of the classifier <em>
				domestic</em>.&nbsp; Classifiers often have the function of 
				moving the generic to the definite and specific in terms of reference so the 
				use of the definite article is appropriate and the rule is not 
				broken.</li>

		</table>
		
			<p>The overarching phenomenon that the examples in this section 
			exhibit is cohesion.&nbsp; Article use contributes powerfully to 
			textual cohesion (written and spoken) by signalling to the reader / 
			hearer that the reference is to a known item or an instance 
			signalling the only possible entity in context (as in the fact that 
			cars only have one driver each).<br />
			The definite article may also, as we saw, refer to something outside the 
			text which is known to both speaker / writer and reader / hearer because 
			they share a common cultural or social milieu.&nbsp; For example,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minister has replied to our letter<br />
			</em>Now, <em>minister</em> can mean a politician or a member of the 
			clergy and there are many thousands of them around the 
			world.&nbsp; It is clear, however, from the use of the definite 
			article that a particular minister, known to both participants in 
			the discourse, is meant here.<br />
			Another example, of what is called homophoric reference is to 
			entities such as <em>the government, the countryside, the north, the Queen, the President, the 
			Czar</em> etc. when knowledge of the culture and national context precludes any other 
			meaning.</p>

		<p>The English article system is often wrongly presented as an 
		impossibly difficult area.&nbsp; As we saw, however, the rules are quite 
		simple.&nbsp; There are, however, a few quirks concerned with the use of 
		the some articles.<br />
		As was explained at the beginning, many of the quasi-rules which infest 
		the web are referenced to these quirks rather than explaining the 
		general rules (see above).<br />
		There are exceptions to grammatical rules in a number of areas of the 
		grammar of all languages as anyone who has tried to learn a second or 
		additional language knows only too well.<br />
		However, labelling a phenomenon as an exception is sometimes the resort 
		of people who have failed to analyse it properly.</p>
			<h4>So-called exceptions with <em>the</em></h4>
		<p>These can 
		all be traced back to the rules above.&nbsp; We will note the rule
		<strong>in bold</strong>.<br />
		These aren't lesson topics &ndash; they should be taught as and when 
		they arise.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>One teachable case of definite and specific reference (this one 
			exactly) is when the noun has been mentioned or it can be assumed 
			that a unique reference is intended <span class="style_underline">and understood</span>.<br />
			So we get, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A car drove by and the driver waved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
			toilet's probably upstairs<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			This is often referred to as the unknown-known rule and can easily 
			be explained that way.&nbsp; The rule, so called, is actually just 
			another way of referring to a <strong>definite and specific item or person 
			and that is simply following the rules</strong>.<br />
			An explanation of a 
			sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bought <span class="style_underline">
			<strong>a</strong></span> new car.&nbsp;
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>The</strong></span> car broke 
			down on her first journey</em>.<br />
			does not require the invocation of a new rule and
			is:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>in the first instance, we are referring to an <strong>
				indefinite but specific reference for a countable noun</strong> and that, as we saw, 
				<strong>requires the indefinite article</strong>.</li>
				<li>in the second instance, we are now referring to a <strong>definite 
				and specific reference for a countable noun</strong> (because we now know 
				that the car was hers) and that <strong>requires the 
				use of the definite article</strong>.</li>
			</ol>We do not need to invoke a special known-unknown rule to explain this.</li>
			<li>When a noun is modified, it's also a sign of <strong>definite 
			and specific reference</strong> and that <strong>requires the definite 
			article </strong>again.<br />
			So we get, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who is married to the Minister<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author of this guide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl in the corner<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Modification takes many forms:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>Modification of country names<br />
				Country names which are modified by an adjective such as 
			<em>United, Islamic, Peoples'</em> or <em>Federal</em> require the definite 
				article because we need to follow the definite and specific 
				reference rule<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Federal Republic of Germany<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Arab Emirates<br />
				</em>etc.<br />In other words we are using <strong>definite and specific reference</strong> 
			and <strong>the use of the definite article is following the rule</strong>.<br />
			Otherwise, nations and 
			languages take no article as we would expect because <strong>proper 
			nouns do not take articles</strong>.</li>
				<li>Modification by name or topic<br />
				We would expect words such as <em>theory, law</em> and <em>
				effect</em> to be <strong>indefinite but specific reference</strong>s 
				to types of ideas so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That a good theory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a new law<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What an interesting effect!</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				When we modify the words, we need <strong>definite and specific 
				reference</strong> so we shouldn't be surprised to find the use 
				of the definite article as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Doppler Effect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Theory of Relativity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hook's Law<br />
				</em>etc. all of which are acting as modifiers of the second nouns so
				<strong>the rule is obeyed for definite and specific reference</strong>.<br />
			When the possessive <em>'s</em> is used there is 
			no article:<em> Einstein's Theory, Murphy's Law </em>and that
				<strong>follows the rule of not using an article with proper nouns</strong>, 
			of course.</li>
				<li>Modification by inflexion or <em>most</em><br />
				Superlative forms are by their nature unique and defined so we should not be 
			surprised that we follow <strong>the rule for definite and specific 
			reference</strong> and have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the biggest building<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the oldest
			man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the most difficult question<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				On the other hand, comparative forms are not unique so we follow 
				the rules again and arrive at:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bigger problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a brighter light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a more interesting idea</em><br />
				etc. and that follows <strong>the rules for indefinite but 
				specific reference</strong>.<br />
				However, if only two items are being compared, then we are 
				signalling that one of them is unique and that requires the 
				definite article rule so we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the better wine of the two<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the more expensive choice of the two<br />
				</em>and, because we are singling out only one of two things, we 
				are referring to definite and specific reference so the use of 
				the definite article follows the rules we have set out.</li>
				<li>Omission of the modifier<br />
			Geographical areas can be explained by noting that the unique 
			identifying modifier has been omitted:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The Atlantic (Ocean)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The (River) Amazon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tate (Gallery)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
			Alps (Range)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hilton (Hotel)</em><strong>.<br />
				All of these follow 
			the rule for definite and specific reference</strong> although the 
				reference is ellipted.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Unique objects (or objects unique in a certain shared setting):<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the moon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Milky Way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Queen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the President<br />
			</em>etc.&nbsp;are all instances of <strong>definite and specific 
			reference</strong> so no rule is broken.</li>
			<li>Nationalities are <strong>definite and specific reference to plural concepts</strong> 
			so the definite article is required:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Greeks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			the French<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Spanish<br />
			</em>etc<em>.</em> and no rule is broken<strong>.</strong></li>
			<li>Plural countries always take the article:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Netherlands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			The Bahamas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Seychelles<br />
			</em>etc. and that <strong>follows the rule 
			of definite and specific reference t<span class="auto-style74">o
			</span>a plural count noun</strong> so no rule is broken.</li>
			<li>Families count as <strong>plural definite and specific reference</strong>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take 
			tea with the Windsors<br />
			</em>and no rule is broken.</li>
			<li>Rivers always take the definite article<em> the</em>, even if 
			they aren't unique because they are <strong>definite and specific reference</strong>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Stour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			The Thames<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nile<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			In the first case here, there are, in Britain, at least five rivers 
			called <em>The Stour</em> but the use of the definite article makes 
			it plain that we are talking about a local instance of such a river 
			so no rule is being broken.</li>
			<li>Lakes are also proper nouns so having no article is following 
			the rule for them.&nbsp; When they are modified and made unique in 
			that way, we <strong>follow the rules</strong> and use the definite 
			article as in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lake Chad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lake Victoria<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loch Ness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lake Windemere<br />
			</em>but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Great Lakes</em>.<br />
			If we ellipt the qualifier <em>Lake</em>, we maintain the rule that 
			proper nouns take no article:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Windemere</em></li>
		</ol>
		<h4>So-called exceptions with<em> &Oslash;</em></h4>
			<p>It has been pointed out that the use of a singular count noun without an 
			article is not usually allowed in English so we do not encounter, 
			e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Person is at the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Letter has been opened</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			Furthermore, we distinguish between indefinite but specific reference by 
			using <em>a(n)</em> and definite and specific reference with <em>the</em>.<br />
			That should all be clear by now.</p>
			<p>The following four areas are, therefore, often despairingly labelled 
			'exceptions' in course books and grammars for learners.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Some common prepositional phrases often with verbs like <em>go, 
			have, get, take, eat, </em>and <em>be </em>involve indefinite but 
			specific reference:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go by 
			bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be in school / church / prison / hospital<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go to university<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eat breakfast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have lunch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have appendicitis<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get flu<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; travel by air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go to college<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			The nouns are nearly always means of transport, meals, illnesses or 
			institutions.</li>
			<li>Parallel structures take &Oslash;:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand in hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man to man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			man and boy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pen in hand<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>Times with the prepositions<em> at, by, after, before</em> 
			take &Oslash; but those following <em>during </em>and<em> in</em> 
			take <em>the</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at dawn / sunset / night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by dusk / sunrise / 
			evening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after dark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before nightfall<br />
			</em> but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; during the day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the 
			morning<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>We use the &Oslash; article for abstract ideas such as<em> 
			danger, joy, hatred, friendliness, friendship</em> etc. even when 
			they are countable ideas.&nbsp; We get, therefore, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was brave in the face of danger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She values friendliness</em><br />
			and so on.</li>
		</ol>
			<p>There is, however, a rule-based explanation for these so-called 
			exceptions.&nbsp; We'll take them one at a time:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Common prepositional phrases<br />
				In all these cases the count nouns are being used 
			not for reference to a singular or plural entity (that's why it is
			<em>on foot</em>, not <em>on feet, by bus</em> not<em> by buses</em> etc.).&nbsp; The count nouns 
			are being used as representatives of the <strong>abstract</strong> idea of something (i.e. a mass 
			concept) rather than an incidence of something identifiable.&nbsp; That is why we 
			can say, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; University is not for him, I suspect</em><br />
			because the noun is being used to describe <em>university education</em> 
			rather than having any specific reference to a particular university at all.<br />
			The same considerations apply to other examples in the list.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be in school</em><br />
			refers to being in education<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to go on foot</em><br />
			refers to a type of mobility<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to go by bus</em><br />
			refers to a type of transport</li>
				<li>Parallel structures<br />
				Expressions like<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arm in arm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pen in hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; woman to woman</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				do not refer to particular <em>hands, arms, pens, women </em>or 
				whatever, they refer to concept of a type of association or 
				relationship and the 
				fact that we can select a mass noun to refer to the same 
				concepts gives the game away: <em>friendliness, readiness, 
				directness</em>.</li>
				<li>Times with the prepositions<em> at, by, after, before<br />
				</em> 
				These are accountable in the same way.&nbsp; Expressions such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after nightfall</em><br />
			and so on refer to states not particular instances of countable 
				events so we would expect a Ø article to be the one of choice 
				and that is what we find.<br />
			When the &Oslash; article is used with time expressions, the same 
			abstraction of the time to a mass concept accounts for the use.&nbsp; 
			The expressions:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in autumn</em><br />
			etc. are slightly quirky prepositional uses but the article use is 
			not.<br />
				When the definite article is being used with time expressions, we are often referring to 
			generic reference so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like to work during the night</em><br />
			refers to all nights, not a specific night.<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He can't get out of bed in the morning</em><br />
			refers to all mornings, not a particular one.<br />
			This may be a slightly unusual use of a generic structure with the 
			definite article but it follows the rule.</li>
				<li>The &Oslash; article for abstract ideas<br />
				This is a pseudo-rule, much favoured on the web, enjoining 
				learners to use a &Oslash; article with abstract ideas and it 
				simply doesn't stand up to scrutiny although it appears in many 
				of the lists of rules you'll find out here.<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>Some of these words (e.g., <em>happiness, friendliness, 
					hatred</em> etc.) are mass nouns so they just follow the 
					rule we have set out.&nbsp; The reference is <strong>
					indefinite and generic</strong> so the &Oslash; 
					article use follows the rule.&nbsp; That leads 
					to, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friendship is important<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happiness is hard to find</em><br />
					and so on.</li>
					<li>When these words refer to abstract ideas and are also 
					usually countable, we need to look at how the word is used.&nbsp; 
					So, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is in danger</em><br />
					contains a use of the word <em>danger</em> as a <strong>mass</strong> 
					noun.&nbsp; It is indefinite but specific use so we would 
					expect a &Oslash; article to refer to a mass indefinite but 
					specific concept and that is exactly what we get.</li>
					<li>However, if we are referring to a <strong>
					definite and specific</strong> <em>danger</em> we would 
					expect (and get) the use of articles to follow the rules 
					either for <strong>definite and specific</strong> reference 
					or to <strong>indefinite but specific</strong> reference for
					<strong>countable</strong> ideas and that leads to:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a danger in expecting too 
					much from him<br />
					</em>(indefinite but specific reference)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dangers with this procedure are obvious</em><br />
					(definite and specific reference to a plural count noun)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most obvious danger is the angry 
					gorilla</em><br />
					(definite and specific reference to singular count nouns in 
					both cases)<br />
					and nothing exceptional is happening here.</li>
				</ol>The root of all this confusion is, naturally, that certain words can be used in mass and count senses with slightly different meanings.&nbsp;  Most of these are abstract concepts but that has nothing to do with article use and inventing yet another rule to deal with the phenomenon is unhelpful and wastes learners' time.<br />
				To exemplify a little more, we can have, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friendship is important</em><br />
				(mass noun used with indefinite but specific reference)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a friendship I value</em><br />
				(count noun used with indefinite but specific reference)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The friendship you showed her was 
				appreciated</em><br />
				(singular count noun used with definite and specific reference)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The friendships I made at university have 
				lasted a long time</em><br />
				(plural count noun used with definite and specific reference)<br />
				Many nouns work this way so there is a distinction between <em>
				life / lives, hate / hates, danger / dangers, prejudice / 
				prejudices, love / loves, delight / delights, sorrow / sorrows</em> 
				and so on, all of which can be used as mass concepts, as 
				singular count nouns and as plural count nouns and when they are 
				used in those grammatical roles, they follow the rules for 
				article use that we have identified.</li>
