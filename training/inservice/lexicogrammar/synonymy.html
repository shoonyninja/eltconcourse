			</table>
			
			<p>All five of these are often considered subsets of synonymy.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Metonymy</strong></dt>
				<dd>the device of using a term <strong>closely associated</strong> with something 
				actually to mean the thing.<br />
				For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				the White House has decided to come clean</em> (Adams, 2015).<br />
				The term <em>The White House</em> (and the addresses of many other 
				government offices) is routinely used as a synonym for <em>The 
				American Government</em>.<br />
				This is also used with many other government addresses around 
				the world, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;No 10 reveals there will be no early general election 
				before 2020</em> (Daily Telegraph website)<br />
				Other examples of metonymy include<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the stage </em>[to mean
				<em>the theatre</em> or <em>the acting profession</em>]<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the 
				crown </em>to mean <em>monarchy / power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bench </em>[to mean <em>
				a judge</em> or <em>group of judges</em>]<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a tongue</em> [to mean <em>
				language</em>]<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table a motion</em> (to mean <em>put a 
				piece of paper on the table for discussion</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>he is fond of the bottle</em> (to mean <em>he drinks too 
				much</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the throne is above politics </em>(to mean <em>the 
				monarchy is independent</em>)<br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Synecdoche</strong></dt>
				<dd>this device involves the use of <strong>part of something to mean 
				the whole or the whole of something to mean a 
				part</strong>.&nbsp; It's pronounced /sɪ.ˈnek.dək.ɪ/, by the way.<br />
				For example:<br />
				Part to stand for whole:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				head count </em>[in which <em>head</em> stands for <em>person</em>]<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transistor</em> [to stand for portable radio]<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glasses</em> 
				[for spectacles]<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; threads</em> [BrE slang for <em>clothes</em>]<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wheels</em> [for <em>motor car</em>]<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wiser heads</em> (for <em>sagacious 
				people</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call the hands</em> (for <em>members of a 
				crew</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boots on the ground </em>(for <em>foot 
				soldiers</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world</em> (for
				<em>mothers</em> in general)<br />
				etc.<br />
				Whole to stand for part:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Britain has won a gold medal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germany lost the race<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the 
				police have arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the army are guarding the port<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paris was starving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington welcomed the idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the union voted to stay out<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				(Synecdoche derives from a lexical relationship in language 
				known as <strong>meronymy</strong> which describes the 
				relationship between, for example, <em>car</em> and <em>
				windscreen, wheel, bonnet, dash board </em>and so on.&nbsp; 
				People have <em>faces, heads, hands, arms </em>and so on and 
				from these we can derive:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there are new faces in the room<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; per head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many hands make light work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong-arm tactics</em><br />
				and more.)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Simile</strong></dt>
				<dd>is the device of <strong>making comparisons</strong>, often with the use of
				<em>as ... as</em> or <em>like</em>.&nbsp; The sense of one item 
				is carried over to the sense of the other so in this way they 
				are synonyms.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he's like a fish out of water<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he's as dull as ditchwater<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				as fast as lightning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it went like the wind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it made a noise like thunder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it sounded thunderous<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her anger was volcanic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he appeared like a ghost<br />
				</em>etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Metaphor</strong></dt>
				<dd>by contrast, metaphor is the device of <strong>using language for an 
				item which actually is appropriate only to the synonym one 
				implies</strong>.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a lot on my plate </em>[<em>I'm very busy</em>]<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				cut and paste </em>[for computerised documents where physically 
				cutting and pasting is not possible]<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a political body blow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				the election is a one-horse race<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he showered her with gifts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				she thundered through her presentation<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				Understanding metaphor is, of course, crucial to comprehending 
				language.&nbsp; There are those who would claim that metaphor 
				is, in fact, the way we make sense of everything.<br />
				Almost all behavioural and material process verbs can be used 
				metaphorically so we have, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pull out of a contest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dive in to an explanation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire questions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shoot arguments down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iron out difficulties<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boil with rage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cook the books</em><br />
				and thousands more.<br />
				Multi-word verbs, too, especially phrasal verbs, are often used 
				metaphorically so we encounter:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pick up a language<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throw out a question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strike up a conversation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get over an illness</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				Metaphor can, of course, be taken too far and result in clumsy, 
				sometimes risible, expression.&nbsp; Here's an example from a 
				communication from Amazon, the mail-order company:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>feedback like yours motivate us 
				to dive deep and unearth ways and means which helps us</em></span><br />
				and that, apart from the two nasty errors in concord, 
				conjures an unlikely picture of people diving deeply into the earth.<br />
				While it is helpful to get learners to understand how verbs in 
				particular may be used metaphorically, examples of that order 
				are unhelpful.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Hyponymy</strong></dt>
				<dd>a relationship between words in which <strong>the meaning of one 
				word includes the meaning of others</strong> which are closely related 
				(compare synecdoche).<br />
				There are two bits to this:<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li>The hypernym is the word which includes the meanings of others 
				(often called the superordinate)</li>
					<li>The hyponyms are all the second-level words which are related to 
				each other and each one may, in turn, act as a superordinate 
					with a third level of hyponyms below it.</li>
				</ul>
				For example, the term <em>vehicle </em>is the hypernym of other 
				terms like <em>car, bus, tram, motorcycle, lorry, coach </em>
				etc. so we can use <em>vehicle</em> as a synonym for <em>bus</em> 
				and<em> lorry </em>in, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bus collided with a lorry 
				outside the shop.&nbsp; Both vehicles were badly damaged</em></dd>

				<td class="auto-style40">
				<h2>Synonymy</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Apart from the five categories above, there is, of course, 
			synonymy proper.&nbsp; For example</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We can say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pub's <span class="style_black">over the hill</span><br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pub's 
				<span class="style_black">beyond the rise</span><br />
				</em>and, in the same context, the two 
				prepositional phrases would be considered functionally 
				synonymous.<br />
				That's phrasal synonymy.</li>
				<li>We can say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm <span class="style_black">eager</span> to go<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm <span class="style_black">keen</span> to go<br />
				</em>and few would argue that <em>keen</em> and <em>eager</em> mean 
				pretty much the same thing<em>.<br />
				</em>That's lexical synonymy.</li>
				<li>Apart from synonymy proper in cases 1. and 2. there is a 
				relationship called troponymy.&nbsp; A troponym is a word which 
				carries the same essential meaning but defines the concept more 
				precisely.<br />
				For example, the word <em>stroll</em> is a troponym of <em>walk</em> 
				because its meaning contains the idea of walking slowly in a 
				relaxed manner.<br />
				As a shortcut in the classroom troponyms are often simply 
				defined as <em>a kind of xxxx</em> and that suffices in many 
				cases but we need to be a bit more careful sometimes because 
				that may lead a learner to errors such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He strolled casually and slowly</em><br />
				which, while not obviously wrong, contains a redundant adverb 
				phrase.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here's the cut-out-and-keep summary:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="summary" height="270" src="../../imagesgraphics/synonymy_summary.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>And here's <a href="synonymy_typeshp.htm">a short test to see if 
			you can identify all seven</a>.</p>
			<p>There are theoretical linguists and others who would not analyse 
			synonymy like this.&nbsp; So be it.&nbsp; This site is concerned 
			with categories which help language teachers understand how the 
			language they are teaching fits together.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="classroom" height="166" src="../../images/teaching_connected250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style40">
				<h2>Synonymy in the classroom</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>As teachers, we are often reduced to explaining new vocabulary by 
			resorting to synonyms that the learner knows and that's legitimate, 
			providing we are careful.&nbsp; So, for example, this exchange is 
			typical of what happens:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style59" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td valign="top">Learner:</td>
					<td valign="top" class="auto-style62"><em>What does 'register' mean?</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td valign="top">Teacher:</td>
					<td valign="top" class="auto-style62"><em>In this case, it means put in a user name and a 
					password on the website.&nbsp; It can also mean just put 
					your name into a list.</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are, however, some problems 
			which a more careful look at synonymy reveals.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="problems" height="166" src="../../images/problem_man250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style40">

				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>It has been claimed that:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>By 
					taking the synonym of a word, and then a synonym of that 
					synonym, and so on, you can ultimately arrive at any other 
					word in the English language.</em></span><span class="smallfont"><br />
					<span class="auto-style6">(Probably Christopher Cinq-Mars, 
			https://www.cinqmarsmedia.com/synonymy/)</span></span></p>
			<p>That can, in fact, only be true if you ignore shades of meaning 
			and word class.&nbsp; Clearly, if synonyms were <strong>exact</strong> 
			matches, with <strong>exactly</strong> the same meanings, the game 
			of hunt-the-synonym-chain could not function.&nbsp; The only way one 
			can arrive at <span class="style_black"><em>any other word in the English language</em></span> is to follow 
			shades of meaning and ignore word-class changes.<br />
			If you ignore the sense relationships, you can get from <em>
			turquoise</em> to <em>depressed</em> via <em>blue</em> (ignoring the 
			dual meaning of <em>blue</em>), from <em>appendage</em> to <em>machine gun</em> 
			via <em>arm</em> and from <em>deposit</em> to <em>rely</em> via <em>
			bank</em> if you ignore the fact that <em>bank</em> is, in this case, a 
			set of homonyms.&nbsp; You can also get from <em>occupation</em> to <em>
			operate</em> via <em>work</em> if you ignore the fact that <em>work</em> 
			is a verb as well as a noun.<br />
			It's a good game but useless for teaching purposes because we are 
			actually very concerned with meaning and word grammar.</p>
			<p>Two lexemes may be synonymous in some senses but not in others.<br />
			For example<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Bring the papers with you = Bring the paperwork 
			with you<br />
			</em>BUT<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I like to read the Sunday papers &ne; I like 
			to read the Sunday paperwork.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The door is open = The door is 
			unlocked<br />
			</em>BUT<br />
			<em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shops are not open on Saturdays &ne; The 
			shop are not unlocked on Saturdays</em></p>
			<p>Some linguists deny the existence of synonymy altogether.&nbsp; 
			They argue that if we have two words then we <em>need</em> two words because 
			they refer to different things.&nbsp; It's a sustainable argument.</p>

				<h3>syntactical / colligational problems</h3>

			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Briefly, colligation refers to similarities of grammatical collocation.<br />
			A popular example of this problem are the words <em>probable</em> 
			and <em>likely</em>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>It's likely John will be late<br />
				It's probable John will be late<br />
				</em>BUT</li>
				<li><em>John will likely be late<br />
				*John will probable be late</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In 1., the two words are synonyms with the same grammatical 
			characteristics but in 2., although the 
			meaning is the same, the grammar isn't.&nbsp; The words form 
			syntactical relationships 
			differently.<br />
			We can't make the 
			subject of the clause be the person identified in both cases but the 
			construction with the dummy <em>it</em> works for both words.<br />
			By some definitions, these two words are not synonyms because full 
			synonymy demands both semantic and structural similarity.&nbsp; If 
			we are only discussing meaning, they are synonyms.<br />
			Here are some more examples (mostly from Hudson <em>et al</em> (1996: 
			442)):</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3"><em>try </em>vs<em>. attempt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's hard to get right but please try to<br />

				BUT<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's hard to get right but please try<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*It's hard to get right but please attempt</em><br />
				The <em>to</em> complement is optional with <em>try</em> but 
				obligatory with <em>attempt</em></li>
				<li><em>ought</em> and <em>should, let 
				</em>and <em>allow<br />
				</em>These are often synonyms but <em>ought </em>requires 
				(usually) the<em> to </em>+ infinitive and <em>should </em>never 
				does; <em>allow</em> needs the <em>to</em> but <em>let</em> does 
				not.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ought to go </em>vs.<em> *I ought go<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I should go </em>vs.<em> *I should to go<br />

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*It stopped to rain<br />
				cease</em> may be followed by an 
				infinitive or an <em>-ing</em> form

				is interpretable as <em>in order to.</em></li>
				<li><em>want </em>vs<em>. wish<br />

				BUT<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want the heater turned on<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*I wish the heater turned on<br />
				wish </em>does not permit a passive participle so the last

				faulty and won't switch on</em></li>
				<li><em>sick, poorly, unwell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child was sick<br />

				<em>very.</em></li>
				<li><em>as well, also, too<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It rained as well<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				</em>Some words can have flexible word ordering; others are

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hid it in the cupboard<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I concealed it in the cupboard<br />
				</em>BUT<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hid in the cupboard<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*I concealed in the cupboard.<br />
				</em>Transitivity with otherwise synonymous verbs is sometimes 
				an issue.&nbsp; The verb <em>conceal</em> is always transitive.</li>
				<li><em>though</em> and <em>although<br />
				</em>are often 
				presented to learners as synonyms.&nbsp; Conceptually, they are 
				but syntactically they are not.&nbsp; The word <em>though</em> 
				can be a conjunct or a conjunction but <em>although</em> is
				<span class="style_underline">only</span> a conjunction.&nbsp; 
				We can accept, therefore:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was done on time.&nbsp; It was more expensive than I expected,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was done on time though it was more expensive than I

&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The work was done on time.&nbsp; It was more expensive 
				than I expected, although.</em></li>
				<li><em>like </em>and<em> as<br />
				</em>are often confused because both function as comparative 
				prepositions so we have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He talked like a teacher</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He talked as a teacher</em><br />
				However, the first means that his manner of talking was similar 
				to a teacher's although he was not one and the second refers to 
				the manner of speaking, too, but suggests he really was a 
				teacher and operating in that role.</li>

				<h3>syntactical homonymy</h3>

			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>This is also a syntax-related issue.<br />
			One example will suffice here.&nbsp; You might assume that the word
			<em>since</em> in:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style58">
				<li><em>I have been here since the beginning of the year</em></li>
				<li><em>I have been here since I was a child</em><br />
				and</li>
				<li><em>I went there five years ago and haven't been back since</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>are examples of the word <em>since</em> all having the same 
			meaning (or even being the same word).<br />
			However, in sentence a., the word is a preposition, in sentence b., 
			the word is a subordinating conjunction and in sentence c., the word 
			is an adverb.&nbsp; They may have the same meaning, i.e., are 
			synonyms, but they certainly do not have the same syntactical 
			properties.&nbsp; That is what is meant by syntactical homonymy.<br />
			You can have:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style58">
				<li><em>Since the beginning of the year I have been here</em></li>
				<li><em>Since I was a child I have been here</em><br />
				and</li>
				<li><em>Since I went there three years ago I haven't been back</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>but in a., we are fronting a prepositional phrase for marked 
			effect, in b., the marking is much less obvious with a simple 
			reversal of the clauses in a complex sentence and in c., we are 
			forced to repeat the pronoun, <em>I</em>, to get a well-formed 
			sentence which some may find only marginally acceptable or clumsy.</p>
			<p>The word <em>since</em> can also function as a subordinating 
			conjunction with the different and unrelated meaning of a 
			resultative or causal sense in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I was in London, I went to see my aunt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a drink since it was an hour before my train left</em><br />
			but it would be perilous to suggest to a learner that <em>because</em> 
			and <em>since</em> are synonyms except in this restricted use.</p>
			<p>The word can even function as a postpositioned preposition so 
			instead of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was here an hour ago, but hasn't returned</em><br />
			we can, in some varieties have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was here an hour since, but hasn't 
			returned</em><br />
			but suggesting to a learner that <em>since</em> and <em>ago</em> are 
			synonyms will not be productive of well-formed grammar (or very 
			helpful).</p>

			<p><a name="little"></a>Lexemes may be synonymous in sense (denotation) but not in connotation.<br />
			For example, <em>determined. pig-headed</em> and <em>stubborn</em> mean much the same thing but 
			<span lang="x-none"></span>have positive or negative connotations.&nbsp; Compare, 
			too, <em>terrorist, freedom fighter, partisan</em> and <em>
			resistance fighter</em>.<br />
			A <em>doctor</em> and a <em>quack</em> may do the same job but are 
			viewed rather differently.<br />
			In addition to the word-class difficulties set out below concerning
			<em>small</em> and <em>little</em>, it is worth noting that <em>
			little</em> is used pejoratively or affectionately but <em>small</em> 
			does not carry those connotations so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She had a beautiful little house</em><br />
			implies the house was attractive to the speaker and viewed with 
			affection but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had a beautiful small house</em><br />
			merely comments on the size of the house.<br />
			Equally:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a nasty small man</em><br />
			suggests that he is unpleasant and of a small stature but:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a nasty little man</em><br />

			<p>We can have <em>tough rope</em> and <em>strong rope</em> as well

			collocations are not possible: <em>strong winds</em> not <em>*tough 
			winds</em>, <em>a tough job</em> not <em>*a strong job </em>and so 
			on.</p>
			<p>The words <em>small</em> and <em>little</em> form another popular 
			example with numerous collocational and syntactical difficulties.</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><strong>Youth </strong><em><strong>vs</strong></em><strong>. 
				size</strong><br />
				We can have, e.g.,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a small town<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a little 
			town<br />
				</em>(although <em>little</em> might collocate better with <em>village</em>).<br />On the other hand, we can also have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a little girl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a little puppy<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a 
			small girl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a small puppy<br />
				</em>but the first adjective implies <em>young</em> and the second, 
				diminutive size.<br />
				An expression such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>her little sister<br />
				</em>also implies an age difference rather than a size 
				difference.</li>
				<li><strong>Determiner <em>vs</em>. adjective</strong><br />
				With countable nouns, <em>little</em> usually refers to size and 
				so does <em>small</em> so we allow both:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a small house next to the pub</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a little house next to the pub</em><br />
				However, with mass nouns, <em>little</em> and <em>a little </em>
				are quantifying determiners, not adjectives so, e.g. we allow 
				both:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have little news for you</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a little news for you</em><br />
				and the first implies <strong>an insufficient amount </strong>
				while the second implies <strong>a small but adequate amount</strong>.<br />
				but we do not allow<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have small news for you</em><br />
				<em>or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have a small news for you</em><br />
				because the word <em>small</em> cannot be used as a determiner.&nbsp; We have, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put a little water in the whisky</em><br />
				not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *Put a small water in the whisky</em><br />
				and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little more, please<br />
				</em>but not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A small more, please<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little time later<br />
				</em>and not 
			usually<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?A small time later</em>.<br />The word <em>small</em> 
			is only adjectival and it's sometimes hard to see this.&nbsp; We can 
			have, e.g., <em>a small difficulty</em> and <em>a little difficulty</em> but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did it with little difficulty</em> 
			(determiner)<br /><em>vs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He did it with small difficulty</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Attributive <em>vs</em>. predicative use</strong><br />
				As a rule, <em>little</em> is not used predicatively so, 
				usually:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a little dog</em><br />
				is preferred to<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The dog was little</em><br />
				but <em>small</em> may be used in both ways.</li>
				<li><strong>Comparative and superlative forms</strong><br />
				When these are required, <em>little</em> gives way to <em>small</em> 
				so we usually prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the smaller / smallest cup</em><br />
				to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Take the littler / littlest cup</em><br />
				etc.&nbsp; Using <em>little</em> in the comparative and 
				superlative forms is confined to children's speech.</li>
				<li><strong>Adjective or adverb</strong><br />
				The word <em>little</em> is also an adverb (unlike <em>small</em>) 
				so we allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I little understood what she was talking 
				about</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I small understood what she was talking 
				about</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman was a little unhappy</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The woman was a small unhappy</em></li>
				<li><strong>Noun or adjective</strong><br />
				The word <em>little</em> may also be used as a noun but <em>
				small</em> cannot so we have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lost the little he had<br />
				</em>not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He lost the small he had.</em></li>

&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He shouted as if he were a maniac</em><br />

			<p>Words which are synonymous in meaning but differ in dialect are 
			out of place when used in the inappropriate variety.<br />
			A BrE <em>lift</em> is an <em>elevator</em> in AmE, and there are 
			hundreds of other synonymous terms.&nbsp; Other varieties of English 
			around the world demonstrate similar pairings.<br />
			In BrE the word <em>footpath</em> can denote a <em>pavement</em> or 
			a <em>small country way</em> but in Indian English, it is a <em>
			pavement</em>.&nbsp; In American English, it's a <em>sidewalk</em>.<br />
			The verb <em>revert</em> in BrE means <em>go back</em> but in Indian 
			English is often used to mean <em>reply</em>.<br />
			In BrE, the term <em>bathers</em> refers to <em>people swimming in 
			the sea or a pool</em>.&nbsp; In Australian English it refers to <em>
			a swimming costume</em>.<br />
			In BrE, the word <em>blue</em> is usually a simple adjective but in 
			Australian English is can be used as a synonym of the noun <em>
			mistake</em>.</p>
			<p>Grammatical (colligational) differences also occur.<br />
			For example, in Indian English, the verb <em>appreciate</em> can be 
			used intransitively as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would appreciate if you would help me</em><br />
			and the verb <em>reach</em>, in the sense of <em>arrive</em>, can 
			also be used that way.<br />
			In other varieties of English, the verbs must be transitive.<br />
			AmE also makes verbs transitive which are, in BrE intransitive so we 
			get, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protest the idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; write me</em><br />
			and so on which in BrE require complementation with a prepositional 
			phrase (<em>protest against</em> and <em>write to</em>).</p>

					<h3>Using simile</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>As we saw above, simile in English is often achieved with the <em>
			as ... as</em> or <em>like</em> connections.&nbsp; The <em>as ... as</em> 
			connection, in particular, frequently forms common, fixed binomial 
			expressions (or clichés if you prefer) such as <br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as deaf as a post<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as dead as a doornail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as bald as a coot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as drunk as a judge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as blind as a bat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as 
			cool as a cucumber<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as fit as a fiddle<br />
			</em>etc.&nbsp; Some of these are quite ancient similes and many 
			come from Shakespeare and biblical sources.&nbsp; Some are of fully 
			obscure origin.<br />
			The <em>like</em> formulation also occurs in fixed expressions such 
			as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a breath of fresh air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a man possessed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a 
			tornado<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			There is a cline here from more or less 
			fixed expressions to more flexible semi-fixed ones.&nbsp; (For more, 
			go to the guide to 
			idiomaticity linked in the list of related guides at the end.)</p>
			<p>Simile can also be achieved without the use of any connector except a 
			copula of some kind:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a bit of a dragon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's becoming 
			something of a grumpy old bear<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Rarely, similes can 
			be made with <em>-like</em> or <em>-wise</em> suffixes:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She 
			talked machine-gun-like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They walked crabwise<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<p>The <em>like</em> formulation to compare two things is rather more 
			flexible and it's routine for speakers to make them up as they go 
			along to imply something is synonymous with something else in some 
			sense.&nbsp; For example<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He talks like a machine gun (sounds)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			He sings like a crow (makes a noise)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's like a bad dream (feels)<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Fixed similes and the ability confidently to deploy the <em>like</em> 
			formulation to add meaning are both important for learners of a 
			language and the area is not difficult to teach.&nbsp; In particular, the 
			ability to use <em>sound, look, taste, feel, seem, smell + like</em> 
			is important.<br />
			(When at a a loss to find an appropriate synonym with which to form 
			a simile, some native speakers in casual speech resort to <em>... like
			anything</em> for want of something better.&nbsp; We get, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enjoyed the party like anything</em><br />
			Learners may need to be made aware of this use but it is not 
			something on which to dwell because it betrays a lack of available 
			vocabulary in the speaker.)</p>
			<p>Similes can also be created in English with the use of neither 
			the <em>as ... as</em> nor the <em>like</em> formulation.&nbsp; 
			Here's a short list of what is meant:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;paper thin</em> (=<em>as thin as paper</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>crystal clear </em>(=<em>as clear as crystal</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>feather light</em> (=<em>as light as a feather</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>grass green</em> (=<em>as green as grass</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;sky high</em> (=<em>as high as the sky</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>ice cold</em> (=<em>as cold as ice</em>)<br />
			etc.<br />
			These formulations are rarer and the formation of adjectival 
			compounds like these is unpredictably allowable.</p>
		
			<p>Both fixed phrases and the ability to use simile 
			can be taught.&nbsp; Here are a couple of ideas:<br />
			</p><table cellpadding="2" class="auto-style7">
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2">Match the phrase on the left with the ones

					everything up because he knew his mother would explode if 
					she got home and found it in that state.&nbsp; By the time 
					he'd finished, he was dog tired but happy that the house

			Completing expressions can also be helpful and lead to some 
			interesting cross-language comparisons such as:
			<p class="auto-style26"><em>sleep like ________<br />
			sing like ________<br />
			work like ________<br />
			run like ________<br />
			smoke like ________<br />
			drink like ________<br />
			</em><span class="style_blue">etc.</span></p>
			<p>Once presented, such structures can be reinforced with gap-fill 
			tests to locate acceptable combinations and with freer exercises to 
			compare common objects, actions, people, situations and so on.&nbsp; 
			It's not difficult to do that.</p>
			<p>Some of these fixed similes have alternatives, with alternative meanings.&nbsp; 
			For example, we can have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run like a hare [fast]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run like a 
			rabbit [in fear]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run like clockwork [smoothly]</em></p>
			<p>All languages do this kind of thing and have traditional 
			similes for many common verbs and nouns.&nbsp; It can be amusing, 
			interesting and educational to do some cross-language analysis with 
			learners.<br />
			For example, the expression<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that story is as old as the hills<br />
			</em>will translate into German roughly as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that story has a long 
			beard<br />
			</em>In the same language, however,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as poor as a 
			church mouse<br />
			</em>translates word for word.<br />
			In French, that 
			would be<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as poor as Job</em><br />
			and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to smoke like a chimney<br />
			</em>in that language translates as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to smoke like a fireman</em>.<br />
			The expression:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as flat as a pancake<br />
			</em>translates exactly into Swedish and so 
			does<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as slippery as an eel<br />
			</em>but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stubborn as a mule<br />
			</em>might translate as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as stubborn as an old goat</em>.<br />
			In Hungarian,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drink like a fish<br />
			</em>is rendered as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drink 
			like a brush maker</em>.<br />
			In Spanish, finally<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleep like a log<br />
			</em>translates as<br />
			<em>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			sleep like a dog<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mad as a hatter<br />
			</em>translates into<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crazy as a goat</em>.<br />
			Learners will, naturally, often assume that similes will translate 
			across languages &ndash; they rarely do, but it's fun finding out.</p>

			<p>In the spot-the-simile exercise we have sneakily 
			inserted one metaphor: <em>explode</em>.&nbsp; We do not mean that 
			the mother will actually explode.</p>
			<p>Metaphor is a more difficult, but, many would argue, even more 
			important area to tackle simply because metaphor is so common in 
			English.&nbsp; It is almost impossible to understand much of the 
			language unless you are alert to metaphorical uses.&nbsp; It has 
			been asserted that nearly all thought and language is metaphor of 
			some kind.</p>
			<p>Consider these examples:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he hammered on the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she was boiling with rage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his face darkened<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			that's music to my ears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a mountain of work to do<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			In none of these is the word meant literally; nobody used a hammer, 
			boiled, went dark, heard music or saw a mountain.</p>
			<p>Writers have deployed metaphor for thousands of years to 
			make a point more vivid.<br />
			Even in Harry Potter, not otherwise considered great literature, 
			they occur quite frequently.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style56">and</span><br /><em>they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them</em></p>
			<p>The master was PG Wodehouse who, it is said, invented a new metaphor 
			(or simile) on almost every page:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>Jeeves shimmered in<br />
			the supply of the milk of human kindness was 
			short by several gallons<br />
			the voice of Love seemed to call to me, 
			but it was a wrong number<br />
			unseen in the background, 
			Fate was quietly slipping lead into the boxing-glove<br />
			the butler loomed in the doorway</em></p>
			<p>As with similes, many of the metaphorical expressions commonly 
			used in English have become clichés and are more or less fixed.&nbsp; 
			They can be approached in a way similar to the ideas for simile 
			above.&nbsp; For example,</p><table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style7">

			<p>It has frequently been noted that certain adjectives which are 
			literally applicable to one of our five senses can be transferred 
			metaphorically to another.&nbsp; We get, therefore:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a sharp sound</em> (touch to hearing)<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a smooth taste</em> (touch to taste)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sweet smell </em>(taste to smell)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a flat taste</em> (touch to smell)<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a loud pink blouse</em> (hearing to sight)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acid yellow</em> (taste to sight)<br />
			The adjective <em>cold</em> is often associated with unfriendliness 
			and <em>warm</em> with its opposite so we get:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a cold reception<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an icy smile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cool look<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lukewarm applause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a tepid agreement<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warm welcome</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			There is some evidence that all languages do this, by the way, so it 
			is an area worth a small amount of investigation in the classroom.&nbsp; 
			Raising your learners' awareness that they can do this in English as 
			well as in their own languages is sometimes productive.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

			<p>In English, and many other languages, time is seen as moving from 
			left to right and from behind us to in front of us.&nbsp; We get metaphorical expressions derived from 
			these notions such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back to square one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on to the end<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are behind time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are ahead of the game</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			In other languages, however, time is seen as a vertical dimension, 
			moving from top to bottom, right to left or in front to behind.&nbsp; Speakers of those languages will 
			have some difficulty extracting meaning from metaphors which work 
			differently.</p>
			<p>Less obviously, positive notions are often connected, in English, 
			with ideas of upward movement and negative ones with downward 
			movement so we have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He fell into poverty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They rose to fame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's really up for it</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's feeling a bit down</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sales took off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sales fell away</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p>In common with most languages, too, English recognises a distinction 
			between the centre and the periphery so we get metaphors such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; the core of the problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the heart of the matter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a tangential comment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a circle of friends</em><br />
			etc.</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>In English, metaphor is often used in a way which uses language 
			related to a different field of concern from what one might expect 
			and these structural metaphors are not consistent across languages.&nbsp; 
			So, for example, in English:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><strong>disagreement = war</strong><ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>We shot down her arguments</em></li>
					<li><em>He attacked the weakness in my proposition</em></li>
					<li><em>She defended her suggestions</em></li>
					<li><em>He was bombarded with objections</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>time = a physical resource</strong><ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>We are running out of time</em></li>
					<li><em>Time is getting short</em></li>
					<li><em>We will have to make time</em></li>
					<li><em>It will buy us some time</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>life = a journey</strong><ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>We are on the road to ruin</em></li>
					<li><em>She's on her way to the top job</em></li>
					<li><em>Keep calm and carry on</em></li>
					<li><em>She climbed the ladder to the manager's position</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>language = liquid</strong><ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>She came out with a torrent of invective</em></li>
					<li><em>The conversation trickled out</em></li>
					<li><em>The truth has been leaked to the press</em></li>
					<li><em>He produced a flood of supporting data</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.&nbsp; It is perilous to assume that these kinds of 
			comparisons are not culturally determined.</p>

			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>In English, certain colours are associated with certain emotions 
			and states and metaphor is common in this area.&nbsp; We get, 
			therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a bit green<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are feeling blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's in a black depression<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the green-eyed monster<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a brown study<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; white noise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yellow-bellied</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>see red</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purple prose</em><br />
			etc.</p>

			<p>Getting learners actually to use metaphor is somewhat more 
			difficult but at all levels they need to be aware of the device and 
			be able to unpack what's being said or written.<br />
			That said, designing written tasks which require the use of standard 
			(clichéd?) metaphors is a good beginning.<br />
			Expressing emotion is a place to start.&nbsp; For example:</p><table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style7" style="width: 608px">
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2">Re-write the following to make them more 
					emphatic and interesting.&nbsp; The first is an example.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>He was 
					very angry indeed</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style31" style="width: 303px">He blew his 
					top</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>He was 
					very afraid</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>The boys 
					are really happy</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>When she 
					saw the mess she was very upset</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>He is very 
					in love with Mary</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>The poor 
					man is very unhappy</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>When she 
					left him she made him sad</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>The film 
					made her feel afraid</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>She was 
					very surprised by the sudden noise</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>She was 
					very satisfied with her examination result</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Clearly, you have to present two or three ways of expressing <em>
			anger, happiness, fear</em> and <em>love</em> before your learners 
			can begin to tackle the exercise but many find that the knowledge 
			that they are writing / speaking more naturally very satisfying.</p>
			<p>A follow-up exercise could be to get learners to prepare to tell an 
			anecdote about a time they were very happy / sad / angry / in love 
			etc. and to include a selection of metaphors before telling their 
			story to other people.</p>
			<p>You can do the same thing with other semi-fixed metaphors:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style7" style="width: 608px">
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2">Re-write the following to make them more 
					emphatic and interesting.&nbsp; The first is an example.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>They argued 
					for a pay rise</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style31" style="width: 303px">They battled 
					for a pay rise</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>He put the 
					idea to the meeting</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style32" style="width: 303px">float</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>It will be 
					easy from here</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style32" style="width: 303px">sail</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>We have lots 
					and lots of work to do</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style32" style="width: 303px">mountain</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>The website is 
					a real mess</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style32" style="width: 303px">dog</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>If I were you, 
					I'd avoid him</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style32" style="width: 303px">berth</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 303px"><em>Everyone in 
					the crowd was wearing blue</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style32" style="width: 303px">sea</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>You can include or omit the clues as you see fit, of course.<br />
			And you can follow that up with a more productive exercise in which 
			learners write / talk / write then talk about a situation including 
			three or four metaphors from a list.<br />
			An interesting game is to get learners to speak about a topic for 2 
			minutes, inserting one of the target metaphors.&nbsp; Others have to 
			listen carefully and shout out when they hear the metaphor.&nbsp; It's a 
			bit of fun.</p>
