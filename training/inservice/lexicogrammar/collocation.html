		<p>A common enough definition is from Lewis:</p>
		<p class="indentpara">Collocations are those combinations of words which 
		occur naturally with greater than random frequency<br />
		<span class="auto-style70">Lewis, 2008: 25</span></p>
		<p>This simple definition hides a good deal of complexity.&nbsp; We need 
		to understand what is meant by</p>
		<ol class="auto-style91">
			<li><em>combinations of words</em></li>
			<li><em>naturally</em></li>
			<li><em>greater than random</em></li>
		</ol>

		<p>Some of these are almost entirely predictable because they are strong 
		collocations; some are much weaker collocations and far less 
		predictable.<br />
		It's a fair bet that you inserted <em>rain</em> or <em>waterfall</em> in 
		the first gap, <em>to</em> in the gap that goes with <em>fro</em>, <em>
		birds</em>, <em>sheep</em> or <em>goats</em> in <em>a flock</em>, <em>
		shut</em> for the <em>case</em> and <em>sheep</em> (again) for the <em>
		family</em>.<br />
		The other gaps are <span class="style_underline">almost</span> entirely 
		unpredictable except to say that it is unlikely that you inserted <em>
		dwarf</em> as the noun modified by <em>high</em>, <em>boat</em> after
		<em>air-conditioning</em> and <em>ditch</em> as the noun for the 
		adjective <em>towering.</em>&nbsp; If, however, you assumed that it was 
		a non-finite verb form, it's fairly predictable that you inserted the 
		preposition <em>over</em> after it.&nbsp; It is unlikely, too, that you decided 
		on a <em>sports carriage</em> although <em>horse-drawn</em> is a popular 
		choice.<br />
		In the final row, it's a safe bet that you inserted a noun in the first 
		example (because the word <em>significant</em> only functions as an 
		adjective in English), a noun or verb in the second cell (because <em>
		gas</em> only functions as a noun and often classifies other nouns like
		<em>cooker, fire, lamp, light </em>etc.).&nbsp; What you inserted in the 
		final gap is unguessable because so many nouns, verbs and adjectives can 
		collocate meaningfully with <em>paper</em>.<br />
		In other words, your choices to fill the gaps in the phrases were more 
		or less constrained, with some items clearly excluded and others 
		allowed.&nbsp; Constraints 
		on and exclusions in language use is what collocation is about.</p>

			<p>If you have followed the guide to lexical relationships, you will 
			be aware of the meaning of syntagmatic rather than a paradigmatic 
			relationships in language.&nbsp; Briefly:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Syntagmatic relationships</dt>
			<dd>refer to syntax in a sentence.&nbsp; For example, in this 
			sentence:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man selected a tie</em><br />
			we have a subject noun phrase, a verb and another noun object 
			phrase.<br />
			The relationships between the three phrases are determined, in all 
			languages, by the grammar of a well-formed sentence so, while we can 
			replace a noun phrase with another and a verb phrase with another to 
			get, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman selected a tie</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man selected a jacket</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man threw away a tie</em><br />
			we cannot replace on a non like-for-like basis and have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The woman the man a tie</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The man selected threw away</em><br />
			Syntagmatic relationships work horizontally along clauses.</dd>
			<dt>Paradigmatic relationships</dt>
			<dd>work vertically and refer to the fact that <em>The man, The 
			woman, selected, threw away</em> and <em>a tie</em> all perform a 
			specific grammatical function and can be replaced <em>ad infinitum</em> 
			with any similarly functioning phrase.&nbsp; The resulting sentence 
			may be nonsense but it will be grammatically correct so we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ostrich selected a fencepost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spaceship chose a tie</em><br />
			and any number of other perfectly grammatical sentences.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h4>The summary is:<br />
		<img alt="paradigmatic vs. syntagmatic" height="156" src="../../imagesgraphics/simple_syntagmatic.png" width="470" /></h4>
		<p>Each slot in a clause can be replaced by words and phrases <strong>in 
		the same word class</strong> to 
		make new clauses (some of which might make sense) <em>ad 
		infinitum</em>.&nbsp; The boxes relate to items in a paradigmatic 
		relationship with each other and the black arrows show the syntagmatic relationships.</p>
		<p>Collocation concerns both types of relationships:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Collocation is a syntagmatic phenomenon insofar as it concerns 
			which sorts of items are more or less likely to co-occur 
			horizontally in a clause.&nbsp; For example, it is more likely that 
			the verb <em>select</em> will co-occur with an animate subject so we 
			will not usually encounter:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tree selected</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car selected</em><br />
			but any animate subject is possible so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child selected<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee selected<br />

		<h3>In summary:</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Grammar</strong></dt>
			<dd>works on an <strong>open-choice principle</strong> 
		.&nbsp; The only constraint is word / phrase class, i.e., the 
		paradigmatic relationships between elements performing the same 
		grammatical function (verbs, nouns, adverbs, determiners etc.).&nbsp; Whether a sentence is well-formed or not merely depends on the 
		ordering of the items which make up a clause.<br />
		We can look at any clause in any language and ask:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_underline"><strong>What</strong></span> 
		substitutions can we make?</em><br />
		because the choice is virtually open ended.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Collocation</strong></dt>
			<dd>is a powerful syntagmatic <strong>constraint</strong> on making 
		language because it is concerned not with free choice but with 
		limitations on meaning and what is appropriate and acceptable semantically.&nbsp; 
		I.e., the issue is one of <strong>closed choices</strong> and how wide 
		the choices are is determined by collocational strength.<br />
		We can look at a clause in this respect and ask:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="style_underline"><strong><em>Which</em></strong></span><em> 
		substitutions can we make?</em><br />
		because the choice is now restricted.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h3>Exclusion<br />
		<img alt="exclude" height="133" src="../../images/exclude250.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
		<p>Exclusion is a key concept within collocation.</p>
		<p>Some words collocate so freely that almost no combination is excluded.&nbsp; 
		For example, the determiner <em>some</em> will collocate with any plural 
		count noun and any mass noun at all so there is almost no way to predict 
		with which nouns it is most likely to co-occur.&nbsp; For the purposes 
		of analysis, this lack of exclusivity means that it makes no sense to 
		refer to the collocational characteristics of a word like <em>some</em>.</p>
		<p>Other words are far less flexible and some almost completely 
		inflexible so, for example, although the adjective <em>good</em> is 
		promiscuous in the nouns which it can be used to describe it is not 
		fully so.&nbsp; We are unlikely to encounter, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a good problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a good drawback</em><br />
		etc. because the adjective is semantically constrained to exclude many 
		negative-connotation nouns.&nbsp; Not all, however, because:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a good thunderstorm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a good accident</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		are conceivable if ironic in most circumstances.</p>
		<p>Other words are very exclusive and are severely constrained in terms 
		of co-occurrence.&nbsp; For example, the word <em>pay</em> collocates 
		quite frequently with a range of nouns (<em>bills, invoices, the money, 
		attention, the price, dividends </em>etc.)<br />
		However, the noun <em>attention</em>, which collocates with <em>pay</em> 
		in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Please pay more attention</em><br />
		has a much more constraining effect on the verbs of which it can be the 
		object and they are confined almost to <em>pay</em> and <em>give</em>.&nbsp; 
		What's more, none of the synonyms of <em>pay</em> and <em>give</em> can 
		be used with the noun <em>attention</em> and only <em>heed</em> appears 
		to be a synonym of <em>attention</em> which can also be the object of
		<em>pay,</em> as in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please pay more heed</em><br />
		Furthermore, although the verb <em>pay</em> also has a range of near synonyms, 
		<em>foot, settle, disburse, give, shell out</em> etc., only some of these can 
		refer to the same noun:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay / settle / foot the bill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay / settle the invoice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay / disburse / give / shell out the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; give / shell out his pocket money</em><br />
		are all acceptable but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *give / shell out / disburse the bill / the invoice</em><br />
		are not and we can only have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foot the bill</em><br />
		and not<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *foot the invoice</em><br />
		etc.</p>
		<p>In our example, the verb <em>pay</em> and the noun
		<em>attention</em> collocate strongly in one direction (noun to verb), 
		but the same is not true for collocations in the other direction (verb to 
		noun) which are much less exclusive.&nbsp; There is, in the jargon, 
		asymmetric reciprocity which is explained a little more fully later.</p>

			<p>Most authorities will agree that there are two forms of 
			collocation to consider: grammatical and lexical.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Grammatical collocation</strong></dt>
			<dd>refers to what is analysed elsewhere on this site as 
			colligation, to which there is a guide linked in the list at the 
			end.<br />
			The principle is that some words are, as it were, primed 
			grammatically to appear in certain grammatical structures.<br />
			For example:<br />
			The verb <em>differentiate</em> is grammatically primed to take the 
			preposition <em>between</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the difference between the houses?</em><br />
			The adjective <em>interested</em> is grammatically primed for the 
			preposition <em>in</em> (plus an -<em>ing</em> form in the case of 
			verb complementation)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's not very interested in hockey</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm interested in seeing the film</em><br />
			The noun <em>pleasure</em> is grammatically primed to take a <em>to-</em>infinitive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a pleasure to see you<br />
			The verb <em>promise</em> is grammatically primed to take either a 
			<em>to</em>-infinitive or a <em>that</em> clause<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I promised to help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I promised that I would help</em><br />
			The noun <em>accident</em> is grammatically primed to be preceded by the 
			preposition <em>by</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was done by accident</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Some authors will place all prepositional, phrasal and 
			phrasal-prepositional verbs into 
			this category.<br />
			This form of collocation will not be further analysed here.&nbsp; 
			For more, see the guides to colligation and multi-word verbs linked in the list of related 
			guides at the end.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Lexical collocation</strong></dt>
			<dd>is a far more equal form of partnership in which both words 
			contribute to the meaning of the phrase.<br />
			For example:<br />
			Noun + Verb<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bomb exploded</em><br />
			Verb + Noun<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lost patience</em><br />
			Adjective + noun<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a stinging insect</em><br />
			This is the form of collocation which is considered in this guide.</dd>
		</dl>
			<p>A simple way to remember this difference is to see that 
			combinations which include function words are grammatical and those 
			between lexical words are lexical.<br />
			In English, the lexical words are open-class items (i.e., ones to 
			which new additions are possible if not frequent) and involve nouns, 
			adjectives, adverbs and verbs.<br />
			Functional (or structural words) are closed-class items (i.e. ones 
			to which new additions are very rare if not impossible) and involve 
			prepositions, determiners, conjunctions and pronouns.<br />
			Therefore:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>Any combination of two or more lexical 
			words is lexical collocation<br />
			Any combination which includes functional words is grammatical 
			collocation</strong></p>
			<p>In this site, the latter is referred to as colligation and 
			analysed elsewhere (see the link below).</p>

			<p>Naturally, some collocations are stronger than others.&nbsp; The nature of collocation can be illustrated like this:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="collocation" height="157" src="../../imagesgraphics/collocation.png" width="400" /></p>
			<p>
			There is probably no principled way in which 
			we can always distinguish, e.g., a strong collocation from an idiom 
			or a binomial although it is easy enough to identify examples of one 
			or the other.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Idioms</strong><br />
			These are pretty much fixed and unalterable expressions in a 
			language.&nbsp; For example, someone can be described as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a 
			one-man band<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a jack of all trades<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the life and soul of the party<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Things can be talked about as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the odd one out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a 
			blessing in disguise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chicken feed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a flash in the pan<br />
			</em>and so on.<br />
			There are literally thousands of such expressions in every language 
			which people can deploy almost as if they were single words, saving 
			thinking time and maintaining fluency.<br />
			There is a guide to idiomaticity, linked at the end, where more 
			detail is to be had.<br />
			The important thing about this kind of collocation is its 
			noncompositionality, i.e., the whole phrase has to be understood as 
			a single item and cannot be broken down into its constituent parts 
			to get at the meaning.</li>
			<li><strong>Binomials and invariable collocations</strong><br />
			Binomials are a special sort of idiom made up of two elements 
			which always appear in the same order.&nbsp; If they are nouns, they 
			are often used with a singular verb form because they represent a single concept 
			(we say, e.g., <em>supply and demand <strong>is</strong> the issue</em> 
			not <em><strong>are</strong> the issue</em>).<br />
			Binomials often contain words found in no other contexts.&nbsp; Examples 
			are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to and fro<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thunder and lightning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spic and span<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither 
			here nor there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in and out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cheap and nasty<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			There 
			are also some trinomials in English such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left, right and 
			centre<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bell, book and candle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cool, calm and collected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hook, line 
			and sinker<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			A small subset in this category comprises invariable collocations in which only one combination is 
			usually possible in only one order such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from top to bottom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back to front<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; duck a question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stage a play<br />
			</em>This kind of collocation is sometimes referred to as Siamese 
			twins.&nbsp; The elements are, in other words, both inseparable and 
			unalterable in the way that other, weaker collocations are not.<br />
			For example:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His speech was <span class="style_black">short and sweet</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was something I could not <span class="style_black">aid 
			and abet</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Foreign and domestic</span> 
			policies are being reconsidered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a <span class="style_black">rough and ready </span>rule<br />
			</em>In the legal profession, there are many more of these and they 
			include, for example:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heirs and successors<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assault and battery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expressed or implied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fit and proper<br />
			</em>and many others.</li>
			<li><strong>Strong collocations</strong><br />
			These can almost always be predicted by native speakers of a 
			language (or at least have very few alternatives).&nbsp; Typically 
			they allow a choice of words but at only one point in the phrase or 
			clause.&nbsp; For 
			example, if you are asked to fill the gap in the following, your 
			answer is probably quite predictable.<br />
			<em>Please __________ free to ask any questions</em>.<br />
			Some of these collocations allow a choice at two points in 
			the clause or phrase.&nbsp; For example:<em><br />
			swat / squash a fly / wasp / bug<br />
			cook / prepare / make a meal / dinner / food / some grub<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Other strong collocations are adjective-noun combinations.&nbsp; 
			The number of possible adjectives for <em>rain</em> is large but not 
			infinite (<em>heavy, light, drizzly, hard, thin</em> 
				etc.) and exclude adjectives such as <em>strong, powerful</em> 
			etc.<br />
			Some authors will place all phrasal, prepositional and 
			phrasal-prepositional verbs in the category of grammatical 
			collocation.&nbsp; On this site, they are considered separately.</li>
			<li><strong>Delexicalised verbs</strong><br />
			When verbs are involved in these invariable collocations they are 
			often describable as delexicalised because they take their meaning 
			from the noun with which they collocate rather than having an 
			explicit meaning in themselves.&nbsp; Other examples of delexicalised 
			verbs (or verbs which can be described as such in certain 
			environments) are:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>do | have | get | go | make | put | set | 
			take</em></span><br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do the washing up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have a shower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get a letter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go by car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make a cake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make the beds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put a question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set a trap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take / make a decision</em><br />
			in all of which it is the noun which contributes more to meaning 
			than the verb.&nbsp; These general-purpose verbs combine with 
			certain nouns only to produce memorable lexical chunks which native 
			and skilful non-native speakers deploy almost as single lexemes, 
			although adverbials and adjectives may be inserted and tense and 
			voice changed to suit the speaker / writer's intentions.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>make (mistakes, haste, a fuss, arrangements, certain, discoveries, 
			fun of, a journeys, peace, war, a mess, money, friends)<br />
			do (homework, justice to, an injury, a service, a favour, wrong, the shopping, 
			damage)<br />
			take (advantage, notice, pains, root, an offer, an interest, place, offence)</em><br />
			<em>pay (attention, a compliment, our respects)<br />
			give (explanations, thanks, consideration, one's word, 
			promises)<br />
			</em>The point at which strong collocations like these become so 
			predictable and fixed as to qualify as idioms rather than 
			collocations is not at all easy to discern.</li>
			<li><strong>Prime verbs</strong><br />
			An allied concept is that of what are known as a language's prime 
			verbs.&nbsp; In English, these are<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>be | bring | come | do | get | 
			give | go | keep | make | put | take</em></span><br />
			Besides the delexicalised nature of many of these verbs in certain 
			collocations, they are also the verbs which are basic to most 
			idiomatic language and which often take the place of more formal or 
			synthetic verbs.&nbsp; So, for example:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style121"><strong>We can render ...</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style122"><strong>... as this with a prime 
					verb</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style118"><em>He appeared suddenly</em></td>

					<td class="auto-style119"><em>I got to the hotel late</em></td>

				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style118"><em>I handed in my essay</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style119"><em>I gave my essay in</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style118"><em>He travelled to New York</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style119"><em>He went to New York</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style118"><em>Please retain the receipt</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style119"><em>Please keep the receipt</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style118"><em>I prepared dinner</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style119"><em>I made dinner</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style118"><em>She garaged the car</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style119"><em>She put the car in the garage</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style120"><em>I caught the train</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style116"><em>I took the train</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			There are, in fact, very few verbal concepts in English which cannot 
			be rendered less formally and more simply by using one of the prime 
			verbs in combinations with adverbials.</li>
			<li><strong>Textual collocation</strong><br />
			This refers to the tendency for sets of words to occur together in a 
			text on a particular topic.&nbsp; A text about families will probably 
			include, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; home, children, parents, arguments<br />
			</em>and so on but one about smoking would have<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cigarette, health, 
			addictive, nicotine, secondary<br />
			</em>etc.</li>

		<p>The relationships between collocating lexemes is often unequal.&nbsp; 
		There is, in other words, <strong>asymmetrical reciprocity</strong>.&nbsp; For example, the noun <em>interest</em> 
		collocates with a wide range of adjectives such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; great interest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keen interest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obvious interest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sudden interest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; academic interest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; personal interest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public interest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; special interest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; romantic interest</em><br />
		and hundreds of other adjectives including:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; vested interest</em><br />
		The adjective <em>vested</em>, however, only collocates with the noun 
		<em>interest</em> 
		and has no other combination in general English, although in legal and 
		economic registers we may encounter the technical uses of the terms <em>
		vested property</em> and <em>vested authority</em>.<br />
		(We are leaving aside the term <em>vested</em> to mean <em>wearing a 
		vest</em>, by the way.)<br />
		Once we have used the term <em>vested</em>, we have almost no choice at all but 
		to follow it with the noun <em>interest</em>.&nbsp; However, when we use 
		the noun <em>interest</em>, we are not constrained in anything like the 
		same way in our selection of an appropriate adjective to modify it.<br />
		That is what is meant by asymmetrical reciprocity: collocation does not 
		work equally in both directions.<br />
		The key is to identify what is sometimes referred to as the <strong>
		pivotal element</strong> in the collocation, i.e., the element which is 
		the determining factor limiting the range of possibilities for the other 
		element.<br />
		Here are some more examples:</p>
		<p>The number of nouns which can combine with the adjective <em>heavy</em> 
		is huge and will include:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>weight, car, man, breathing, metal, plate, computer, 
		stone, table, brick, key, ashtray</em><br />
		and almost every other noun which is not in itself associated with 
		something light, such as <em>feather</em> or <em>bubble</em>.&nbsp; The 
		number of possible nouns runs into many thousands.<br />
		However, if we take any of these nouns, it is easy to see that the 
		number of adjectives which can be used to modify them is much smaller 
		than the number of nouns which can be modified by <em>heavy</em>.<br />
		For example, the noun <em>rain</em> can be modified by <em>heavy</em> 
		but it is clear that the number of other adjectives we can use with this 
		noun is limited and it is almost possible to produce a complete list 
		confined to:</p>

		<p>You may be able to think of a few others but the list is clearly not 
		anything like as long as the list of nouns which can be described as <em>
		heavy</em>.&nbsp; The list of possible adjectives would be much shorter 
		in cases such as <em>computer, ashtray, 
		breathing</em> etc.<br />
		As we saw above, the adjective <em>torrential</em> can only be 
		used with a small number of nouns and it is possible to come up with a 
		list such as:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style113"><em>cloudburst<br />
				current<br />
				deluge</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style112"><em>downpour<br />

				<td class="auto-style112"><em>rain<br />
				rainstorm<br />

				<td class="auto-style112"><em>river<br />
				shower<br />
				storm</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style111"><em>stream<br />
				thunderstorm<br />
				waterfall</em></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>and it is quite possible that not all native speakers of English 
		would accept all those as natural combinations.&nbsp; Given that there 
		are probably around 70,000 nouns in English, this means that the 
		adjective <em>torrential</em> collocates with only 0.02% of them.&nbsp; 
		In other words, if you try to use the word randomly to modify any noun 
		you come across, you have a 99.98% chance of being wrong.</p>
		<p>Other sorts of collocation work the same way so, for example, the 
		list of nouns which can be the object of the verb <em>make</em> is very 
		long but the list of verbs which can have <em>bed</em> as the object is 
		very much shorter.</p>
		<p>There is a classroom implication that we need to focus on 
		collocations which are limited, not on those which are so numerous that 
		they can't be taught.<br />
		Hence, the focus on <span class="style_underline">exclusion</span> at 
		the beginning of this guide.</p>

			<p>Collocation may be described as the study of how lexemes 
			conventionally co-occur (are <span class="style_black"><em>
			combinations</em></span> in Lewes's definition) but that does not necessarily mean that they 
			must be juxtaposed.&nbsp; For example, we may have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; the <strong>dense fog</strong></em><br />
			in which the words are juxtaposed, or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; the <strong>fog</strong> was / became / looked <strong>dense</strong></em><br />
			in which the collocating noun and adjective are separated only by 
			the copulas <em>be, become </em>or<em> look</em>, but we could also have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; the <strong>fog</strong> which rolled down the mountain that morning 
			grew increasingly <strong>dense</strong></em><br />
			in which the collocates are separated by nine other words.<br />
			This is clearly a teaching issue because learners may not be able easily to spot the collocating items in the

			<p>The citation from Lewes at the beginning included the expression:
			<span class="style_black"><em>with greater than random frequency</em></span>.</p>
		<p>Language, however, is a non-random phenomenon.&nbsp; It is not the 
		case that one language lexeme may be followed by any other with 
		absolutely equal, i.e., random, probability because language is a 
		rule-based system.</p>
		<p>The Oxford English Dictionaries website states that:</p>
		<p class="indentpara">The Second Edition of the 20-volume Oxford English 
		Dictionary contains full entries for 171,476 words in current use ... 
		Over half of these words are nouns, about a quarter adjectives, and 
		about a seventh verbs; the rest is made up of exclamations, 
		conjunctions, prepositions, suffixes etc. And these figures don't take 
		account of entries with senses for different word classes (such as noun 
		and adjective).<br />
		<span class="auto-style70">https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language/</span></p>
		<p>If we assume, therefore, that we have around 85,000 nouns which could 
		conceivably be the subjects of around 25,000 verbs, the number of 
		possible combinations of noun + verb is well over 2 billion.&nbsp; The 
		number of possible adjective + noun combinations would be over 3.5 
		billion.<br />
		This is clearly not a tenable conclusion and most combinations of words 
		are, in fact, excluded for one of two main reasons.</p>
		<p>For example, if a clause begins:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because she ...</em><br />
		it cannot be completed with just any item in the language because the 
		choices are constrained by the grammar and the meaning systems.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Grammar<br />
			</strong>because the word cannot, for example, be 
			followed by <em>opening, difficult, so, in the garden, familiar with, 
			all, were</em> or <em>house</em> 
			because there are word-class and other structural constraints which 
			follow from the rules of English grammar.&nbsp; In fact, because 
			neither a noun nor an adjective can come next, something like 75% of 
			the words in English are already excluded.<br />
			The linguistic systems of the language will mean, therefore, that 
			only a verb phrase, with or without an adverbial, can follow our example.&nbsp; 
			That still leaves around 25,000 verbs in the language which could 
			conceivably come next.<br />
			This is not, strictly speaking, an example of grammatical 
			collocation (see above for that) but an artefact of the language's 
			grammar.</li>
			<li><strong>Meaning<br />
			</strong>because language is not a random 
			collection of significations but utilised for the purposes of 
			communication, so the phrase, <em>Because she ...</em>, cannot rationally be followed by:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... doesn't understand, I will ask her to 
			understand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... is alone, she is with people</em><br />
			because no communication properly results (despite being 
			grammatically well formed).<br />
			In addition, certain verbs which only take inanimate or animal 
			subjects such as <em>rain, photosynthesize, calve, low, erode, 
			inundate, overflow, pitter-patter, blare, glint, flame, swish, thud</em> 
			and so on are also excluded.&nbsp; We cannot have, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because she flamed ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because she eroded the cliff</em> ...<br />
			etc.<br />
			To take a non-verb example, meaning will require that the adjectives <em>
			influential, tiny, glittering, pollinated</em> etc. are unlikely to 
			occur collocated with the noun <em>elephant </em>simply because the 
			ideas of <em>an influential, tiny, glittering </em>or<em> 
			pollinating elephant</em> are not ones that makes sense to (most) 
			users of a language.<br />
			Equally, the subject noun <em>an elephant</em> is unlikely to occur 
			with verbs such as <em>explain, buzz, explode, drone, meditate, apologise</em> 
			and so on because that is not what elephants do (presumably).<br />
			The number of ways to finish the sentence which begins:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the elephant ...</em><br />
			is severely limited by the nature of elephants.&nbsp; Grammatically, 
			of course, most of the 25,000 English verbs can follow but only a 
			very small percentage of that number will make any sense.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>What is meant by non-random collocation is, therefore, not a matter of 
		random <em>vs.</em> systematic phenomena, it is a matter of comparative
		<span class="style_underline">degrees</span> of probability.&nbsp; It is 
		an analogue, not a digital phenomenon.&nbsp; Degrees of probability are 
		determined grammatically and semantically.<br />
		There are, in other words, regularities in the collocational systems of 
		a language, any language, which <span class="style_underline">reduce</span> 
		randomness but the system is not random to begin with.</p>

			<p>Collocational aspects of many words vary according to the context 
			(i.e., field of discourse) in which they occur.&nbsp; For example, 
			within a business context a verb such as <em>grow</em> might 
			collocate with <em>market</em> or <em>business</em> as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to grow the market</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They grew the business year on year</em><br />
			but in non-context-specific fields, the verb usually means <em>
			cultivate</em> as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grow vegetables</em><br />
			or intransitively to mean <em>get larger</em> as in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children are growing quickly</em><br />
			All specialist fields (registers) have their own internal jargon (or 
			specific terminology to be more polite) so, whereas a teacher of 
			language might refer to:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;intermediate level</em>,<br />
			a legislator might refer to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;creating a level playing field</em>,<br />
			a builder might refer to<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; foundation level</em><br />
			and a sports commentator might refer to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;levelling the score</em><br />
			The example above with the verb <em>map</em> is clearly set in an IT 
			context but a geographer would probably use the verb quite 
			differently and with different noun objects such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; map the transport links.</em></p>
		<p>These considerations do not solely apply to verbs, although verb-noun 
		collocations are good examples of the working of register influences:</p>
		<ul class="greenbullet">
			<li>Adjectives such as <em>strategic</em> will be used differently, 
			and collocate differently in military, chess-playing and economic 
			registers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>strategic weapons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strategic moves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strategic 
			industries<br />
			</em>respectively, for example.<br />
			(See also the way
			<em>vested</em> collocates across registers, noted above.)</li>
			<li>Adverbs such as <em>healthily</em> will be used differently and 
			be differently collocated by nutritionists and economists<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eat 
			healthily<br />
			</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; profit healthily<br />
			</em>for example.</li>
			<li>Nouns such as <em>turbulence</em> will be used differently and 
			be differently collocated by social commentators, scientists and 
			marital counsellors<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; street turbulence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turbulence of an 
			airflow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turbulence in a relationship<br />
			</em>for example.<br />
			In 
			management-speak, one might encounter the term <em>payroll orphans</em> 
			(workers who have been fired) but that combination of nouns is 
			unlikely to appear in any other register.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Context, as usual in language teaching, is crucial.</p>

			<p>A concept closely allied to register is style (so closely, in

			Style is influential in the selection of collocating words because 
			although:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; settle the bill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay the bill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foot the bill</em><br />
			are all example of phrasal synonymy, as we have seen, they are stylistically variable 
			from the formal to the neutral and the informal, respectively.</p>

		<p>Informally, verb plus prepositional phrase collocations are 
		frequently alternatives to more formal verbs.&nbsp; It is also averred 
		that verb + adverb combinations are less formal than single-word 
		parallels (at least when an alternative exists).&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; go to the next stage</em><br />
		is less formal than<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proceed</em><br />
		and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; throw away</em><br />
		is less formal than<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>discard</em></p>

			<p>The citation from Lewes also included the phrase:

			We can define <em>natural</em> in many ways but the essence is that 
			it is not contrived or contrary to some kind of usual, ordinary or

		<p>Naturally(!), among speakers of any language, opinions will vary and 
		what one speaker finds a perfectly natural combination of words may

		<p>More to the point, do you think everyone who speaks English as a 
		first language would agree?</p>
		<p>It is, in fact, especially with weak- or medium-strength 
		collocations, very difficult to decide what is and is not natural.&nbsp; 
		However, to help us these days, we have access <em>via</em> corpus 
		research to very large samples of 
		natural language data from which we can see the patterns that are 
		frequent, those that are unusual and those that do not occur or are 
		vanishingly rare.<br />
		However, frequency is not necessarily a measure of naturalness because 
		some combinations of words can be infrequent but natural because they 
		are confined to certain unusual registers and/or contexts.<br />
		For example, the terms:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compose language<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creep soundlessly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; careful operation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heritage phenomena<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; downsized workforce<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; matrix management</em><br />
		are, according to some corpus research, really quite rare but the fact 
		that they do occur with more much than random frequency implies that 
		they are natural enough and few speakers of the language would wince if 
		they read or heard them in particular contexts.<br />
		Unfortunately, teachers are rarely able to access corpus research 
		findings in real time in the classroom (although they can when planning 
		what to teach) so we are thrown back on our intuitions about language 
		which may or may not be typical of the speech community we represent.</p>
		<p>It is rare, in any case, for false collocation to result in incomprehensibility and all these examples of 
		probably false collocations are clear in terms 
		of the speaker / writer's intentions:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was deeply overjoyed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They opted for their Member of the Senate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was expelled from the army<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has a group of fish in his pond<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind was very heavy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She rode a new vehicle to work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to get a new square of glass put in the window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dived profoundly in the river<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke with happiness</em><br />
		So, we should not become too fixated on the issue of natural 
		collocations, especially at lower levels where communication of an idea 
		will often be more important than natural-sounding language.</p>
		<p>The point is made below, however, that learners expect some certainty 
		in terms of what they are told about language and telling them that, for 
		example:<br />
		<span class="style_black">&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, yes 'strong rain' and 'boiling sunshine' are 
		possible, I guess, but I wouldn't say it</em></span><br />
		is rarely reassuring or helpful.</p>
		<p>The point is made below, too, that many multi-purpose nouns, often 
		hypernyms, do not form very natural-sounding collocations so, for 
		example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a box of cigarettes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a group of furniture<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a container of paint</em><br />
		all sound slightly unnatural but, failing mastery of the terms <em>
		carton, suite</em> and <em>pot</em>, they will communicate effectively.&nbsp; 
		See below for more on noun + noun collocations of this sort.<br />
		Equally, mastery of multi-purpose verb phrases such as <em>begin to do / 
		play</em> will often stand learners in good stead if they do not know 
		how to say, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; go in for golf</em><br />
		or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; take up knitting</em><br />
		etc.</p>

		<p>Some forms of lexical collocation are more frequent and more

		fulfilled.&nbsp; Adjective + noun and verb + noun have already been

		</p>
		<p>We can now look in a little more detail at these six types one by one.</p>

			<p>A range of adjectives are so promiscuous that almost no exclusion 
			is possible and these include:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; good, nice, pleasant, lovely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bad, unpleasant, ugly, difficult</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			These adjectives will not collocate with
			<span class="style_underline">all</span> nouns, of course, because 
			certain combinations are semantically virtually impossible, such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; unpleasant enjoyment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasant illness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; difficult weather</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			However, the range of nouns that they will collocate with is so 
			large as to be impossible to list exhaustively.&nbsp; They form, in 
			other words, such weak collocations that they do not commend 
			themselves as a teaching target.</p>
		<p>Other adjectives (most of them) form medium-strength collocations and 
		can be the target of our teaching and these include:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; heavy, strong, weighty, dense, thick, high, tall, 
		substantial, fat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; light, bright, elegant, easy, simple, gentle, cheerful, happy</em>,
		<em>thin</em><br />
		and so on.&nbsp; The list can be extended very considerably but this is 
		a guide, not a dictionary or thesaurus.<br />
		With these adjectives, it is possible to extract certain patterns which 
		can act as rules of thumb for learners to use.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em>heavy</em> is usually used with materials and physical 
			objects so we have:</dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a heavy car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heavy rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heavy metal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a heavy person</em><br />
			etc. but the near synonym, <em>weighty</em>, is often reserved for 
			abstract concepts so we may have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a weighty problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a weighty issue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a weighty influence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a weighty question</em><br />
			etc. in which the adjective <em>heavy</em> is not allowable.</dd>
			<dt><em>thick</em> and <em>fat</em> are near synonyms in many cases 
			so we can have, e.g.:</dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a fat book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a thick book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a fat pipe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a thick pipe</em><br />
			and so on, but this is not always evident because we do not find:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a thick cow</em><br />
			preferring<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a fat cow</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *a fat cloud</em><br />
			preferring<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a thick cloud</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fat fog</em><br />
			preferring<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thick fog</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			The point here is not that certain combinations are wholly 
			impossible but that certain combinations are preferable, more 
			frequent and more natural.</dd>
			<dt>It may be argued that <em>cheerful</em> and <em>happy</em> are 
			also near synonyms but the first applies almost solely to people and 
			the second is more flexible so we can have:</dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cheerful / happy party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cheerful / happy person<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cheerful / happy face</em><br />
			etc. but we do not usually allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a cheerful accident<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a cheerful meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a cheerful outcome<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a cheerful coincidence</em><br />
			preferring <em>happy</em> in all cases.</dd>
			<dt><em>easy</em> and <em>simple</em> are synonyms in many cases so we can allow:</dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a simple / easy question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a simple / easy problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a simple / easy sum</em><br />
			but the two words do not always mean <em>not difficult</em> because 
			<em>simple</em> 
			often means <em>not complicated</em> so we find:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a simple machine</em><br />
			not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *an easy machine</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a simple sketch</em><br />
			not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *an easy sketch</em><br />
			and so on.</dd>
			<dt><em>strong</em> and <em>powerful</em> are obvious synonyms with 
			different collocations characteristics so we can have, for example:</dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong coffee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong medicine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong arguments<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong suggestions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong foundations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong tape</em><br />
			and thousands more.&nbsp; We can also have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful medicine</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful arguments</em><br />
			However, the adjective <em>powerful</em> 
			is more constrained and normally reserved to mean <em>producing 
			power</em> so we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful engine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful muscles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful wind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful leader</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful wave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful country<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful man</em><br />
			etc.
			but when the sense is of a static object, we do not allow <em>powerful</em> 
			as an adjective so, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *powerful foundations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *powerful rope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *powerful bolt</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *powerful dam</em><br />
			etc. are all unavailable and, conversely:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *strong engine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *strong gun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *strong kick<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *strong program</em><br />
			are also unavailable.</dd>
		</dl>
		
			<p>Some adjectives form very strong collocations as we saw with the 
			example of <em>vested interest</em> above.&nbsp; Other, less extreme, 
			examples include:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; torrential rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; violent crime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glittering career<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spoken language / word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sunken ship / boat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; superhuman strength / efforts / feat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drifting snow</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<h3>attributive and predicative adjective use</h3>
			<p>Most adjectives can be used attributively and predicatively.&nbsp; 
			In the former case, the collocation tends to be stronger and more 
			obvious.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some anxious parents outside the 
			school</em><br />
			<em>vs</em>.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parents outside the school were anxious</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She made a rapid rise to the top of the business</em><br />
			<em>vs.</em>:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her rise to the top of the business was rapid.</em><br />
			This is even more the case when the adjective in question is 
			participial.&nbsp; In the latter case, the word is likely to be 
			interpreted as a verbal use rather than purely adjectival.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked in the freezing rain and wind<br />
			vs</em>.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain and wind I walked in were freezing</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The written word was more memorable<br />
			vs</em>.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The memorable word was written</em></p>
			<h3>classifier <em>vs</em>. epithet</h3>
			<p>Certain adjectives take on enhanced collocational strength when 
			used as classifiers (determining the type of noun) or epithets 
			(describing the noun).&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S<span class="auto-style123">he wrote </span>
			a short book</em><br />
			uses <em>short</em> as an epithet to <strong>describe</strong> the
			<em>book</em>, and is not a particularly strong collocation, but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wrote a short story</em><br />
			is used to classify the <strong>kind</strong> of story, is not, in 
			this sense, gradable and is a much stronger collocation, verging on 
			a compound noun.<br />
			Compare, too:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked in one of the compact offices 
			upstairs</em><br />
			with<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bought a compact disc</em></p>

		<p>Many verbs have no particular collocational characteristics but do 
		exhibit semantic exclusion by their nature.&nbsp; For example, because of 
		the meanings of the verbs we do not allow:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cut the sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; envelop the letter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decide the similarity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identify the weather</em><br />
		and thousands of other combinations which simply do not make sense (in 
		any language).<br />
		One obvious distinction is, non-poetically and non-metaphorically, we 
		restrict a range of verbs such as <em>decide, oppose, prefer</em> etc. 
		to animate, often human, subjects and others, such as <em>flicker, 
		resonate, ring, tick, slam, snap, burn</em> etc. to inanimate subjects.&nbsp; 
		Metaphorically, we can use something like:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She slammed out the door, her patience having finally snapped</em><br />
		but the power of such items rests in ignoring not adhering to the normal 
		collocational characteristics of the verbs.</p>
		<p>Some verbs are only used in English with a certain set of nouns and 
		some nouns require a reciprocally restricted range of verbs of which 
		they can be the object.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>The verbs <em>close, shut, block, switch off, turn off</em> etc. 
			mean more or less the same thing but, in English, collocate 
			differently.&nbsp; We:</dt>
			<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>close</em> or <em>shut doors, lids, 
			roads, taps, programs </em>and <em>shops</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>turn</em> or <em>switch off lights, radios, computers</em> 
			and <em>taps</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>block gaps, views</em> and <em>roads</em><br />
			and there is no obvious reason for this as other languages will 
			translate the phrases differently.&nbsp; The antonyms of these verbs (<em>open, 
			switch on, turn on</em>) work similarly.<br />
			Style plays a role here because <em>shut</em> and <em>block</em> are 
			often less formal than <em>close</em>. as can be seen from signs, 
			which are normally in more formal, frozen style&nbsp; so we would 
			get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please keep this door closed</em><br />
			rather than<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please keep this door shut</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ROAD CLOSED</em> <em>AHEAD</em><br />
			rather than<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ROAD BLOCKED AHEAD</em></dd>
			<dt>Nouns also determine the verbs of which they may be objects so, 
			for example, we:</dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break </em>and<em> keep promises<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; catch fire, colds, sight of </em>and<em> diseases<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earn gratitude </em>and<em> a living<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; give promises, consideration, notice, thanks </em>and<em> words<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hold meetings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep secrets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lend a hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lose confidence </em>and<em> touch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay compliments, respects, attention<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; play tricks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run risks </em>and<em> businesses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set examples </em>and<em> sails<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strike matches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take an interest, pains, offence, root </em>and<em> steps<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throw parties </em>and<em> fits</em><br />
			etc. and in none of these cases is it possible to insert more than a 
			very limited range of other verbs, if it is possible at all because 
			the noun is the dominant item.</dd>
			<dt>Some nouns are only (or almost only) connected with certain 
			behaviours, for example:</dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the door / shutter / window / lid slammed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the goats / sheep bleated<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the jet / lion roared<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the dog barked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the horse reared<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the train / lorry / thunder rumbled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the donkey brayed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bells pealed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the mud squelched</em><br />
			and hundreds more.<br />
			Even in those cases where more than one noun naturally collocates 
			with any verb, the list of possible ones will be severely limited.</dd>
			<dt>Inanimate vs. animate subjects</dt>
			<dd>As well as determining the sorts of object to which a verb can 
			apply collocational factors play a role in determining verbs' 
			subjects.&nbsp; For example, verbs which imply or suggest some kind 
			of thought process or deliberate action are usually confined to 
			collocations with human or higher animal subjects so we will find:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary considered braking</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The cat watched the bird</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The car considered braking</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The keyboard leapt off the desk</em><br />
			and the same is true for hundreds of verbs which imply deliberate 
			behaviour rather than a simple material process.<br />
			However, we sometimes employ what is called pathetic fallacy for 
			effect so we might encounter:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The car decided not to start</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The photocopier took the opportunity to break 
			down.</em><br />
			This is, naturally, logical nonsense but that's often the way things 
			appear.<br />
			An associated issue is that English is rather untidy in assigning 
			subjects to verbs so we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tap dripped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kettle boiled</em><br />
			etc. when other languages will be more logical and refer to the fact 
			that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water dripped</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water boiled<br />
			</em>Ergative uses of some verbs, in which the ostensible 
			grammatical subject is semantically the object of the verb, also seem to break the 
			animate-inanimate rule of thumb so we allow, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book sold well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door opened</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The toast burnt</em><br />
			and so on which are either not allowable or will demand a special verb form 
			in other languages.</dd>
			<dt>Delexicalised verbs</dt>
			<dd>have been covered above and in these cases it is the noun which 
			is dominant in providing meaning and in the selection of the 
			appropriate verb.&nbsp; In other words, inserting verbs before these 
			nouns is generally a language-specific phenomenon determined by the 
			meaning of the noun and in some cases only one or two possibilities 
			exist:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _______ the beds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _______ homework<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _______ a nap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _______ an alarm clock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _______ a train / bus etc. to work</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; _______ lunch</em><br />
			and so on.</dd>

					<td class="auto-style78">
					<em>deeply depressed</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Here, too, the semantic properties of the items will exclude 
			certain combinations in all languages so we can't allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *ecstatically miserable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *miserably happy</em><br />
			and so on because such expressions are internally contradictory or 
			oxymoronic.&nbsp; With adverbs, then, we need to match meaning 
			reciprocally so we do allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ecstatically happy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miserably depressed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; genuinely honest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; openly relieved</em><br />
			etc. because the meanings of the two elements are complementary.<br />
			When the adjective from which an adverb is derived and the following 
			adjective are too close in meaning, however, we cannot combine the 
			terms so we don't allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *sadly unhappy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *cheerfully happy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *solely alone</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			The simple rule is that in order to form an acceptable collocation, 
			the adverb and the adverb must contribute separately to the meaning 
			of the phrase, not just be repetitious.</p>
		<p>However, intensifying adverbs are another matter.&nbsp; They come in 
		three forms and their meaning can usually be summarised as <em>very.&nbsp;
		</em>How they collocate is often a question of gradability.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Amplifiers increase the strength of the adjective and operate 
			differently with gradable and non-gradable adjectives.<ol class="auto-style79">
				<li>With gradable adjectives the adverbs may indicate the 
				extreme of the scale (up or down) so we will get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extremely likely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; highly preferable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; insufferably hot</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slightly warm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; marginally preferable</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very interesting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather ugly</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>With non-gradable, on-off adjectives, or adjectives which 
				already represent the extreme of a scale, adverbs simple enhance the 
				meaning so we may have, e.g.:<br />
				
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hopelessly addicted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deeply mistaken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wholly unique<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perfectly complete<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; totally wrong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wholly ecstatic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perfectly atrocious<br />
				</em>etc.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="auto-style90">The two sorts of amplifiers cannot be used 
		interchangeably.&nbsp; Those reserved for gradable adjectives such as
		<em>extremely, enormously, particularly, insufferably, noticeably</em> 
		etc. do not work with non-gradable or extreme adjectives so we do not find:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *enormously complete<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *particularly dead</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *noticeably perfect</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *slightly atrocious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *very detestable</em><br />
		etc. and we cannot use those amplifiers which work for 
				non-gradable senses with gradable adjectives so, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *wholly cold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *completely hot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		*highly tall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *perfectly old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *indescribably nice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *totally lovely<br /></em>are all disallowed.</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="2">Emphasisers work to express the speaker / writer's feelings and 
			will collocate very widely so we can have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plainly / obviously / clearly / doubtlessly + 
			right / wrong / good / bad / pleasant / unpleasant</em><br />
			and almost any other adjective so combinations such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; definitely good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obviously difficult<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearly enjoyable</em><br />
			and so on are all allowed.<br />
			Because the adverb is acting to express the speaker / writer's view, 
			these items do not take their collocational characteristics from the 
			adjectives.&nbsp; In fact, the lack of any form of reciprocity leads 
			us to believe that they are not collocational phenomena at all.</li>
			<li>Downtoners can do three things but collocate differently 
			depending on what they are doing.<ol class="auto-style79">
				<li>Compromisers reduce the speaker / writer's sense of 
				certainty, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quite interesting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of helpful</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Again, because these express the speaker / writer's position 
				collocation, if it can be called that at all, can occur with almost any adjective.</li>
				<li>Minimisers downplay the strength of an adjective so 
				collocate most naturally with gradable items as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slightly interesting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; probably important</em><br />
				etc. and not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *slightly perfect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *more or less adult</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Approximators serve to suggest that something is almost but 
				not wholly the case so they collocate most naturally with 
				non-gradable adjectives as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; almost unique<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtually perfect</em><br />
				etc. but not with gradable concepts such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *almost hot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *virtually chilly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *nearly old</em></li>

			<p>Noun + noun collocations occur preponderantly in four forms:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Compounds or potential compounds<br />
			Where the line is drawn between strongly collocating nouns and true 
			compound nouns is not clear cut.&nbsp; For example, we can have weak 
			collocations such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loudspeaker switch</em><br />
			and there are numerous other nouns which will collocate with 
			either element:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loudspeaker positions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loudspeaker cable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loudspeaker controls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; light switch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; light dimmer</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; light controls</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			However, other very strong collocations are, or may become, compound 
			nouns rather than being obviously the subject of collocation.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; light + bulb &rarr; light-bulb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lamp + shade &rarr; lampshade<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dish + washer → dishwasher</em><br />
			A simple but slightly unreliable test of whether a combination 
			represents a compound or simply a medium or strong collocation is to 
			pronounce the pairs.&nbsp; Compounds are usually stressed on the 
			first item.<br />
			For more on compounding, see the guide, linked in the list at the 
			end.</li>
			<li>Nouns for groups which many call collective nouns although on 
			this site there is a difference which we will observe here.<ol class="auto-style79">
				<li>Collective nouns<br />
				Collective nouns proper are those which represent a collection 
				of entities and to which it is not necessary to add the <em>of</em>-phrase 
				so we do not, for example, often see:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an army of soldiers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a family of relations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a congregation of worshippers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cavalry of horse riders<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a jury of jurywomen</em><br />
				and so on because the collective noun contains the concept of 
				what makes it up.</li>
				<li>Assemblages<br />
				are nouns to represent the whole made up of its parts and 
				some collocate very strongly with certain things or people.&nbsp;
			There are lots of these and many of them, especially those for the 
				animal world, are made up or vanishingly 
			rare.&nbsp; Common ones are:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flock of sheep / goats / birds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; litter of kittens / puppies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pack of dogs / wolves / cards<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shoal of fish<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; squad of soldiers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swarm of bees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a gang of criminals<br /></em>and so on.&nbsp; The number of nouns which collocate in this way is 
			limited and teachable, unless one wants to get bogged down with <em>a murder of crows, 
			an exultation of larks, a bank of monitors, choir of angels, nest of 
			vipers</em> and a <em>murmuration of starlings</em>, of 
			course.&nbsp; A hunt on the web for collective nouns will provide 
			long, useless lists and many will not actually be true collective 
				nouns.<br />In terms of colligation or grammatical collocation 
				is it worth observing that the both assemblage and collective 
				nouns proper are grammatically singular but often collocate with 
				a plural verb form.&nbsp; We can have, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the squad of players is here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the squad of players are here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the jury have reached a verdict<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the jury has reached a verdict</em><br />
				The use of the plural is either a form of 
			proximity concord (in which the influence of the second plural noun 
				disposes the speaker to use a plural form of the verb) or 
				notional concord (in which the speaker / writer perceives the 
				assembly to be made up of its individuals because they are 
				known).<br />
				In most languages and many varieties of English, including AmE, 
				the singular form is the invariable choice.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Partitives<br />
			There is a dedicated guide to partitives on this site, linked 
			from the list of related guides at the end.&nbsp; It is enough here 
			to exemplify the collocational aspects of these words by this table, 
			taken from that guide.<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder" style="width: 550px">

			</table>
			<br />
			On the left, we have weakly collocating partitives which 
			collocate with a huge range of mass nouns so we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bit of time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a touch of irony<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a piece of meat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an item of information</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			However, the realities of collocation exclusion become evident as we 
			move to typical and restrictive partitives because the noun often 
			determines the only appropriate partitive to use.&nbsp; While <em>
			piece of </em>can be used with many mass nouns, it cannot be used 
			with nouns which demand certain types of partitives so we do not 
			allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a piece of milk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a piece of dust</em><br />
			and so on, preferring<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a dash / splash / pint </em>etc<em>. of milk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a grain / cloud / speck </em>etc<em>. of dust.</em><br />
			The typical partitives collocate according to the nature of the 
			substance so flat things come in sheets, round things in balls, 
			rectangular things in bars and thin things in slices and so on.<br />
			On the far right are some examples of very restricted partitives 
			which are strong 
			collocations and in many cases, although the general partitives may 
			be available, are selected for precision so, for example, we can have<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a bit of bacon</em><br />
			but
			no other noun can follow<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a rasher of _______<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a loaf of _______<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a lock of _______</em><br />
			except,<em> bacon, bread</em> and <em>hair</em> respectively.<br />
			Even when a partitive is used quite widely, its use may be restricted 
		by the noun it modifies (another example of asymmetric reciprocity) so we can allow:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; bunch of people / keys / arguments / houses / cars / 
		books / chairs / words</em><br />
		and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swarm of attackers / customers / clubbers / 
		football fans</em><br />
		and many more, but we are restricted to the use of <em>bunch</em> when it comes to<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; bananas, flowers </em>and<em> grapes<br />
		</em>and to <em> swarm </em>when we are referring to<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bees, ants, mosquitoes </em>and the like.
			</li>
			<li>Classifiers<br />
			Many nouns are used quasi-adjectivally to classify other nouns and 
			many of these combinations also verge on compound nouns.&nbsp; 
			Examples of nouns acting as classifiers (which differ from 
			adjectives in that they do not describe, they classify) are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a village pump<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a brick wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a plastic toothbrush<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an electric fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a customs officer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a paper plate</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			See the note above under adjective-noun combinations where it is 
			observed that adjectives used as classifiers increase the 
			collocation strength of the phrase.</li>

			<p>Adverbs may precede or follow the verb and may be separated from 
			it by other adverbials so we encounter, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove into the garage carefully</em><br />
			in which the adverb is separated from the collocating verb by a 
			prepositional phrase<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He carefully drove into the garage</em><br />
			in which the adverb precedes the verb<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove carefully into the garage</em><br />
			in which the adverb follows the verb<br />
			In all these cases we can legitimately speak of verb + adverb 
			collocates without implying which comes before which.</p>
			<p>Again, many adverb + verb combinations are allowed or excluded 
			for semantic rather than purely collocational reasons so we do not 
			encounter<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *saunter quickly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *stroll excitedly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *gallop slowly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *laugh miserably<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *weep happily</em><br />
			and hundreds of other possible combinations because the verbs 
			themselves imply the kinds of behaviour they express.<br />
			This is common to all languages and unlikely to be a source of 
			difficulty.<br />
			As we saw with verb + noun collocations, however, when both items 
			contribute to the meaning, collocation is frequent so we see:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; saunter casually<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stroll quietly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laugh happily</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Again, both parts must normally contribute, not simple repeat the same 
			meaning so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *heat warmly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *sleep unconsciously<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *fill fully</em><br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *relax leisurely</em><br />
			etc. do not occur.<br />
			There are numerous exceptions in which the speaker / writer wants to 
			emphasise the verb with an adverb so we do encounter, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stroll slowly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hurtle rapidly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; race quickly</em><br />
			etc.&nbsp; These tautologies are often considered stylistically 
			questionable.</p>
			<p>Excluded from consideration here are those verbs whose 
			combinations with adverbs produces a new meaning.&nbsp; These are 
			considered in the guide to multi-word verbs.&nbsp; They include, 
			e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speak up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bring about</em><br />
			and many, many more.</p>
			<p>We need to be slightly careful to distinguish between adverbs as 
			adjuncts, integral to the clause and modifying how the verb is 
			perceived, and adverbs as disjuncts (or sentence adverbials) whose 
			function is discoursal and whose role is to modify the whole of the 
			clause to which it applies.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke clearly at the meeting</em><br />
			contains and adjunct adverb (<em>clearly</em>) which tells us how he 
			spoke.&nbsp; However,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, he spoke at the meeting</em><br />
			contains the same adverb functioning as a disjunct and expressing 
			the speaker's notion of the truth of the proposition.&nbsp; It tells 
			us nothing about how he spoke so is not, therefore, an instance of 
			collocation.&nbsp; Compare, too:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me honestly what he thought</em><br />
			which is an example of how <em>honestly</em> collocates with many 
			verbs to do with communication including <em>speak, explain, talk, 
			communicate</em> and others and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly, he told me what he thought<br />
			</em>in which the adverb is a disjunct and expresses the way the 
			speaker wants the hearer to understand what is said.</p>
		<p>There is a range of more general-purpose adverbs which 
		collocate naturally with a limited range of verbs.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em>strongly</em> collocates with</dt>
			<dd><em>support, suggest, argue, deny, condemn, oppose, influence, 
			recommend </em>etc.</dd>
			<dt><em>badly</em> collocates with a range of negative-outcome verbs 
			such as</dt>
			<dd><em>damage, harm, congest, deform, hurt, injure, need</em> etc.<br />
			but not with <em>break, destroy, pulverize, demolish</em> etc. 
			because these are not gradable concepts.</dd>
			<dt><em>greatly</em> collocates with verbs such as</dt>
			<dd><em>enjoy, appreciate, relish, value, dislike, disapprove</em> 
			etc.<br />
			but not with verbs which already contain the sense of <em>greatly</em> 
			such as <em>adore, worship, love, hate, deplore, detest </em>etc.</dd>
			<dt><em>deeply</em> can collocate with a range of negative verbs 
			such as</dt>
			<dd><em>hurt, upset, anger, offend</em> etc.<br />
			but not with more positive verbs such as<br />
			<em>please, enjoy, compliment, hearten</em> etc.</dd>
			<dt>verbs which represent changes will collocate naturally with 
			adverbs expressing extent and speed, for example:</dt>
			<dd ><em>change quickly<br />
			evolve rapidly<br />
			alter drastically<br />
			modify fundamentally</em><br />
			etc.</dd>

			<p>There is some doubt whether most verb + prepositional phrase 
			combinations count as collocations at all because:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The combinations are usually perfectly predictable from an 
			understanding of the basic meaning(s) the preposition can realise 
			so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waiting for a bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hoping for rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deciding on an answer</em><br />
			and so on simply require the learner to understand the preposition.&nbsp; 
			They may be examples of colligation (insofar as, for example, <em>
			wait, look, wish</em> and<em> hope</em> are all primed to take a 
			prepositional phrase with <em>for</em>) but not, technically, of lexical collocation.</li>
			<li>Many combinations are verb + adverb particle rather than 
			prepositional phrases at all so are better analysed as multi-word 
			verbs.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break out the sandwiches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call in the police</em><br />
			and so on are phrasal verbs + objects, not verbs + prepositional 
			phrases.</li>
			<li>Other combinations are better analysed as prepositional verbs 
			so, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; complain about the service<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rely on his help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; account for his behaviour</em><br />
			are all examples of prepositional multi-word verbs.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>That said, there are some idiomatic uses which are less easily 
		analysed as anything but strong collocations, verging on clichés or 
		fixed idioms.&nbsp; Examples include:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He burst into song<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They burst into tears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She exploded with anger</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It collapsed in a heap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It burnt to the ground</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		which are not prepositional verbs in the true sense.</p>
			<p>The other issue is that these combinations are not lexical at all 
			by the definition we introduced this guide with.&nbsp; They are 
			grammatical collocations because they involve function words.<br />
			If, however, you take the view that the prepositional phrase is a 
			semantic unit rather than a syntactical one, then calling these 
			expressions examples of lexical collocation is legitimate and 
			defensible.</p>

			<p>These terms are used in the literature to describe the same 
			phenomenon.&nbsp; The issue is one of synonymy and semantic fields 
			and whether certain lexemes tend to collocate more frequently or 
			reliably with others which have either negative or positive 
			connotations.<br />
			This is a development of the principle of semantic exclusion that we saw 
			above but is slightly more idiomatic and difficult to acquire.<br />
			Here are some examples of what is meant:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Example 1:</dt>
			<dd>Certain actions will fall into a semantic field, all being 
			hyponyms with the hypernym or superordinate <em>crime</em> such as:<br />
			<em>murder, theft, arson, blackmail, mugging, burglary</em> etc.<br />
			and all these nouns will collocate strongly with only a limited 
			range of verbs, the most obvious one being <em>commit</em>.&nbsp; 
			However, other verbs, near or partial synonyms of <em>commit</em> 
			will not collocate with the members of the same group so we cannot 
			have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *execute theft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *do arson<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *perform burglary</em><br />
			although the stylistically much more formal verb <em>perpetrate</em> 
			can be used with this group of actions.<br />
			By the same token, positive actions do not collocate with a verb 
			such as <em>commit</em> or <em>perpetrate</em> so we do not find:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *commit / perpetrate a kindness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *commit / perpetrate a favour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *commit / perpetrate charity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *commit / perpetrate an entertainment</em><br />
			etc.</dd>
			<dt>Example 2:</dt>
			<dd>Another set of similar words comprises negative states and 
			includes, for example:<br />
			<em>difficulties, trouble, problems, death, damage, illness, 
			sickness, disease, hitches, setbacks, hindrances, snags</em> etc.<br />
			and all these nouns will collocate naturally with the verb <em>
			cause</em> (and some will collocate with <em>produce</em>, and <em>
			lead to</em>).&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He caused trouble<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The substance causes death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her behaviour led to setbacks in the programme<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It produced difficulties</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			However, a near synonymous verb, <em>provide</em>, will not 
			collocate naturally with nouns denoting difficulties but with those 
			that are benefits so we do not usually allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *provide snags<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *provide problems</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			but allow naturally:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide facilities<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide a service<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide support<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide assistance</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			<span class="smallfont">(based on Schmitt, 200,:78)</span></dd>
			<dt>Example 3:</dt>
			<dd>The nouns <em>result, outcome</em> and <em>consequence</em> are 
			all near synonyms of each other but the way they are perceived and, 
			hence, the adjectives with which they collocate are different and 
			affected by semantic / collocational prosody.&nbsp; For example, we 
			can see from:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; important results<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting outcomes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dire consequences<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; excellent result<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; horrible consequences<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; direct result<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obvious outcome<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; positive result</em><br />
			that the noun <em>consequence</em> is more than randomly associated 
			with negative events but <em>outcome</em> and the much more common
			<em>result</em> are either neutral or positive, rarely negative.&nbsp; 
			The other near synonym, <em>aftermath</em>, is wholly reserved for 
			negative outcomes, so we allow, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the terrible aftermath</em><br />
			but not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *the wonderful aftermath</em><br />
			<span class="smallfont">(based on Xiao &amp; McEnery, 2006:110)</span></dd>
			<dt>Example 4:</dt>
			<dd>Adjectives are even more prone to the effects of collocational 
			prosody so while we allow, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weak tea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weak beer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weak muscles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weak support<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weak material<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weak memory</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			near synonyms of <em>weak</em> behave differently so we do not 
			allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *feeble tea / beer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *puny material<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *fragile muscles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *weedy foundations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *puny memory</em><br />
			etc., but do allow some other combinations such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fragile / feeble support</em></dd>
		</dl>
			<p>Words which are generally defined as having no particular 
			connotation, either positive or negative, can acquire connotations 
			depending on the selection of a collocate.&nbsp; A well-known 
			example appears in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cause of the fire</em><br />
			in which the word <em>cause</em> simply means <em>reason for </em>
			and is neutral.<br />
			However, as we saw above, the verb is almost always used for 
			negative events so we have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This caused a problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She caused the fight</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the cause of the accident</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			but we rarely encounter:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That caused his success</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She caused some laughter</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This caused her happiness</em><br />
			If, however, we do select these positive collocating nouns, the verb 
			assumes a more positive sense.&nbsp; (And in the second of these 
			examples, the negative sense of the verb is so strong that it may 
			well refer to unkind laughter rather than happiness.)</p>
			<p>Examples in political speeches and statements are also common so 
			while the word <em>benefit</em> in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A benefit of this machine is its quietness</em><br />
			we are clearly using the word benefit positively.&nbsp; However, in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Benefits and other underserved handouts to people</em><br />
			the word becomes, by association, negative.<br />
			In most reference books, the term <em>Brussels</em> is merely the 
			name of the capital of Belgium.&nbsp; Use the word as a classifier 
			in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brussels bureaucrats</em><br />
			however, and it automatically assumes a negative connotation for 
			many.<br />
			In an expression such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recent immigrant</em><br />
			the word <em>immigrant</em> has no particular connotation.&nbsp; 
			Ally it, however to <em>illegal</em> and it becomes pejorative.<br />
			By the same token, the word <em>countryside</em> is normally 
			considered neutral but describe it as <em>threatened, precious</em> 
			or <em>British</em> and for many it takes on very positive 
			associations.</p>

			<p>Some of the analysis above draws heavily on what are called 
			corpora.&nbsp; Essentially, these are extremely large samples of 
			language data which can be used to investigate frequencies of and concordances between 
			words and that lies at the heart of collocational research.<br />
			Some extremely useful corpora are available free of charge online 
			and can be used by teachers to investigate the ways in which words 
			combine (and with what kinds of other words) to make meaning.<br />
			You may, for example, intuitively know that<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a positive result</em><br />
			is more common or natural than<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a positive consequence</em><br />
			but relying purely on one person's intuition is not always 
			trustworthy and a little research may be called for.<br />
			One very useful place to look is <a href="https://corpus.byu.edu">
			https://corpus.byu.edu</a>.&nbsp;
			You will have to register, probably, but once you have, the use of 
			the various corpora on that site is free.<br />
			There are some provisos, however:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Corpora draw on a variety of data &ndash; written, spoken, colloquial, 
			academic and so on &ndash; so you need to decide on the context for the 
			language you want to investigate.</li>
			<li>Some corpora cover a long period (Google books, for example, 
			considers texts written from the 16th century onwards) so may not 
			reflect modern usage.</li>
			<li>Some corpora are register specific so will reflect how words are 
			used in certain settings only.&nbsp; If you want to know about the 
			everyday, colloquial use of a word, you would be well advised not to 
			use a corpus based, for example, on United States Supreme Court 
			decisions.<br />
			On the other hand, if you are teaching English for Academic Purposes 
			then a list such as the Academic Word List (available as an appendix 
			in Schmitt, 2000:182 <em>et seq.</em>) will be most useful.</li>
			<li>Size matters when it comes to corpora and they vary considerably 
			from the 14 billion words in the new iWeb corpus down to 50 or 100 
			million words in other corpora.</li>
			<li>Frequency matters, too, and, although items like <em>whiteboard</em> 
			or <em>role play </em>may not be particularly frequent, they are almost essential to 
			know for learners of English.&nbsp; Using frequency as the
			<span class="style_underline">sole</span> measure of whether to 
			teach a word is perilous because learners may need a less frequent 
			term such as <em>container</em> rather than be troubled, especially 
			at lower levels, to learn the more frequent but restricted items 
			like <em>box, can, tin, jar, bottle, carton, packet, tube, crate, 
			case</em> and so on.</li>
			<li>Individuals vary considerably in terms of the language they need 
			and the registers in which they want to use English.&nbsp; The term
			<em>transfer fee</em> may not be particular frequent but is 
			important to football fans and a term like <em>baste</em> is rare 
			but important to those interested in cooking.&nbsp; If you happen to 
			be <em>hard of hearing</em>, then you need that collocation or 
			idiom, if you are not, you probably don't.</li>

			<p>One consequence of the development of corpora is to usher in a 
			golden age for lexicographers and modern learners' dictionaries are 
			now much better than they were at identifying and presenting common 
			collocations.&nbsp; They are a very productive resource for those 
			who have the leisure to consult them while writing.<br />
			Additionally, dedicated collocation dictionaries are now available and most draw heavily (or solely) on corpus research.&nbsp; 
			As a resource for reference purposes such books are, naturally, very 
			helpful but a text such as the Oxford Collocations Dictionary which 
			claims to include "<span class="style_black">over 250,000 
			collocations and over 75,000 examples</span>" is daunting at the 
			least, useless at worst.&nbsp; A saving grace of that reference 
			source is that it has included "<span class="style_black">Special 
			pages that each pull together collocations on a particular topic 
			such as business, meetings, and sport</span>" and register is, 
			indeed, an important issue in collocation work as we saw above.<br />
			Naturalness in the use of 
			collocations in English is not likely to be enhanced by constant 
			reference to a resource of this kind.<br />
			A better approach is to use the patterning we have analysed here to 
			present language logically and in a consistent, rule-based manner.&nbsp; 
			That is not easy in the case of collocations, but it is an 
			achievable target.</p>

			<p>if you are a native or near-native speaker of English, there will 
			be a temptation to concede that almost all combinations of words are
			<span class="style_underline">possible</span> collocations and, 
			therefore, acceptable.&nbsp; This is a temptation worth resisting 
			because learners are not generally very interested in the quirky and 
			unlikely but possible and a good deal more concerned with sounding

			a time when it is <span class="style_underline">possible</span> to produce<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She set homework</em><br />

			Not being clear about what is and is not permissible is unhelpful 
			even if that means editing or being economical with the truth.</p>
		<p>The following is taken from the simpler guide to this area in the 
		initial-plus training section.&nbsp; If you have been there, you've done 
		it.</p>
		<p>Collocations are very helpful for learning vocabulary.&nbsp; 
		There are some things to consider:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>helping learners to notice collocation</strong></dt>
	<dd>It is unusual to find any kind of reading text which doesn't contain 
	some obvious collocations so make sure you focus on them at some time in a 
	reading lesson.&nbsp; Eventually, your students should be able to spot them 
	for themselves.&nbsp; Highlighting <strong><span class="auto-style28">likely</span><span class="style_red"> 
	collocations</span></strong> in texts is effective.<br />
	A small trick is to design a short text in which the collocations are wrong 
	and get learners a) to notice them and b) to correct them.&nbsp; At higher 
	levels, this can make an interesting change to a dictation.&nbsp; You 
	dictate the text with the false collocations and the learners correct it as 
	they go along.</dd>
			<dt><strong>teaching vocabulary thoroughly</strong></dt>
			<dd>Whenever you teach a new verb, remember to set it in a context 
			of what sort of nouns it collocates with.&nbsp; For example, if you 
			teach <em>unearth</em> try make sure that your learners know what sorts 
			of things can be <em>unearthed</em> <em>&ndash; the truth, a body, an 
			artefact, evidence </em>etc.&nbsp; If you teach a new adjective, 
			treat it similarly and make sure your learners know what sorts of 
			things it describes, for example, <em>greedy</em> applies to animate things, 
			mostly, but you can have <em>a greedy bank.</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>focusing some lessons on collocation</strong></dt>
			<dd>This is such a useful area that it is worth making it part of 
			your usual teaching programme.&nbsp; It is worth considering, for 
			example, basing a lesson around notions such as size, weight, 
			length, temperature and so on so that you can focus the learners on 
			such things as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tall building<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; narrow street<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heavy 
			load<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scorching sunshine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bitterly cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extensive grounds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crushing 
			weight<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			This may help your learners avoid saying 
			things like<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *thin street<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *flimsy load<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *boiling 
			sunshine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *severely cold<br />
			</em>or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *grave weight</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>being clear</strong></dt>
			<dd>If you are a native speaker of English in particular, you may 
			often feel that a collocation such as <em>shuddering with fear</em> 
			or <em>burying an argument</em> is conceivable (and they both are) 
			but your students want clear answers and access to more natural 
			collocations so, unless they are very advanced, stick to the clichés &ndash; 
			we <em>shiver</em> or <em>tremble with fear, resolve arguments</em> 
			and <em>bury hatchets</em>.</dd>

		<p><strong>Matchers. </strong>&nbsp;Students draw the lines and end up

		<p><strong>Gap fills.</strong>&nbsp; Students work together to see what 
		can naturally go in the gaps:</p>

		The view was quite …………… and we …………… for over an hour just …………… it.</p>
		<p><strong>Selections. </strong>&nbsp;Students choose the right collocations:</p>
