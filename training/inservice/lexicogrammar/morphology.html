			<h1>Morphology: the building blocks of language</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="morphology" height="207" src="../../images/lego_bricks310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>
			This guide is concerned with the general theory of morphology rather 
			than with how any one language forms words by combining morphemes.&nbsp; 
			For more on that, in English, consult the guide to word formation, 
			linked below.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<h2>What is morphology?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We'll start this guide with a definition of its subject matter.<br />
			A morpheme is</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>the smallest </em>
			<strong><em>meaningful</em></strong><em> unit of a language</em></span>.</p>
			<p>and the word <em><strong>meaningful</strong></em> is emphasised 
			for a reason.<br />
			In this phrase, we have these 10 morphemes:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em><strong>the + small + est + mean + ing + ful + unit + of + a + language</strong></em></span>.</p>
			<p>The term <em>meaningful</em> here does not refer to meaning standing 
			alone (although it may) but to meaning in context or in combination 
			with other words.<br />
			For example, a function word such as <em>it</em> carries no meaning 
			without a context and co-text but in a sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read the book and loved it</em><br />
			the words <em>book</em> and <em>it</em> clearly carry meaning.<br />
			And in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>John and Mary came to the show</em><br />
			the word <em>and</em> carries a meaning to the hearer / reader 
			relating to combining subjects although the word standing entirely 
			alone has no discernible meaning.<br />
			Both <em>it</em> and <em>and</em> are morphemes by this definition 
			and so are <em>I, read, the, book, love, -d, John, Mary, came, to</em> 
			and <em>show</em>.</p>
			<p>Morphology, then, is the study of how languages form words.&nbsp; All languages do this and they do it in a 
			bewildering and fascinating number of ways.</p>
			<p>We are concerned here with how English functions in this respect but 
			effective teaching in this area requires at least an outline 
			knowledge of how your learners' language(s) function.&nbsp; For some 
			information about that, see the guide to teaching word formation, 
			linked below.&nbsp; Other languages employ morphemes in a variety of 
			ways using, e.g.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infixes: a rare event in English exemplified by <em>spoon<span class="style_black"><strong>s</strong></span>ful</em> 
			or <em>abso<span class="style_black"><strong>bloody</strong></span>lutely</em>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; circumfixes: unknown in English but used extensively in some 
			languages which add affixes in pairs to the beginning and end of a 
			lexeme to derive a single change in meaning or word class.</p>
			<p>The guide to word formation, linked below, covers similar ground 
			but extends it into other areas.&nbsp; This guide is concerned with 
			understanding the theoretical bases for how words are formed in 
			English.</p>

			<p>Before we can sensibly look at what words are made of, we need to 
			be clear about what a word actually is.&nbsp; This may seem a very 
			simple question but it is actually rather difficult to define what a 
			word is in any language.<br />
			Here's a definition from Google:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em><span class="style_black">a single distinct meaningful element of 
			speech or writing, used with others (or sometimes alone) to form a 
			sentence and typically shown with a space on either side when 
			written or printed</span></em></p>
			<p>As we shall see, that is not an adequate definition for 
			our purposes.&nbsp; The definition is hedged with
			<span class="style_black"><em>typically</em></span> and
			<span class="style_black"><em>sometimes</em></span> and that is a 
			sign that the definition is difficult.</p>

			doesn't work.&nbsp; (Is <em>doesn't</em> one word or two?)<br />
			Some languages do not follow the convention at all and all words are 
			written in a stream.&nbsp; For example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will you have<br />
			</em>in Thai looks like<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; สิ่งที่คุณจะต้อง.<br />
			</em>It is for these reasons that linguists prefer the term <strong>
			lexeme</strong> or <strong>lexical item</strong> to the anguished 
			word <em>word</em>.&nbsp; A lexeme is a basic unit which can be one 
			word or a phrase which carries a single significance.<br />
			By this definition, all of these are lexemes because the individual 
			parts, where they exist, do not convey the whole meaning:</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>Of course, one ordinary way to identify a word is to look it up 
			in a dictionary.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that won't work, either.&nbsp; 
			If you go to an online dictionary for something like <em>
			inderivability</em>, you are very unlikely to find it but most 
			native speakers of English would be happy to accept that it really 
			is a word.<br />
			The other issue with dictionaries is that, in order to save space, 
			they usually list words by the root or lemma.&nbsp; For example, you 
			will find <em>repeat</em> as a headword or lemma in a dictionary but
			<em>repeated</em> and <em>repeating</em> will normally not be listed 
			separately unless the words are used with a different significance.&nbsp; 
			That doesn't mean they aren't words.</p>
			<h3>So what actually is a word?</h3>
			<p>For a morphologist, a word is any item which can be derived from 
			the application of morphological rules.&nbsp; This means that even 
			something like <em>computerhood</em>, which you will certainly not 
			find in a dictionary, is a word because it can be derived from the 
			three morphemes that make it up, following normal conventions in 
			English.&nbsp; These are:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compute</em></span> 
			the verb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + <span class="style_black"><em>r</em></span> to make 
			the noun doer of the verb (or, with words that do not already end in 
			'<em>e</em>', '<em>er</em>')<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + <span class="style_black"><em>hood</em></span> 
			to make the noun signifying state of being a doer of the verb.</p>

					<li><em>elephant</em> (noun) &rarr; <em>elephant<span class="style_black">ine</span></em> (adjective)</li>

			</table>
			<p>A central concern of morphology is to investigate how productive 
			a derivational morpheme actually is.&nbsp; This does not apply to 
			inflexional morphemes because their role is generally fixed 
			grammatically<br />
			How is it, for example, that the morpheme <span class="style_black">
			<em>th</em></span> can be attached to some adjectives to form the 
			noun (<em>warm → warm<span class="style_black">th</span>, wide → wid<span class="style_black">th</span></em> 
			etc.) but is almost completely unproductive in forming new words in 
			English?<br />
			We would not, for example, take the adjective <em>
			windy</em> and form a noun such as <em>windi<span class="style_black">th</span></em>, 
			preferring instead to choose the <span class="style_black"><em>ness</em></span> 
			suffix and making <em>windiness</em>.<br />

					<h3>Transparency</h3>

			</table>
			<p>Some morphemes have an easy-to-see relationship between the form 
			and meaning.&nbsp; Here are some examples:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>-</strong><em><strong>ible</strong></em><strong> and 
				-</strong><em><strong>able</strong></em><br />
				It is easy to unpack a word like <em>recordable</em> by 
				considering the suffix <span class="style_black"><em>able</em></span> 
				and realising that it always produces an adjective from a
				<strong>transitive</strong> base verb and that it exists as a 
				free morpheme meaning <em>can</em>.&nbsp; You can quite easily 
				make new adjectives like this from any number of verbs, 
				providing they take an object.&nbsp; The fact is that it is the 
				only way English can form a new adjective from a verb.&nbsp; We 
				have, of course, the <span class="style_black"><em>ible</em></span> 
				morpheme in words like <em>flexible, audible, comprehensible</em> 
				and so on but if you try to form an adjective from unusual or 
				phrasal verbs you will almost always opt for
				<span class="style_black"><em>able</em></span>.&nbsp; Try it 
				with:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				prune, devolve, explode, derange, disturb, put off, turn down</em>.<br />
				The morpheme <span class="style_black"><em>ible</em></span> is, 
				therefore, unproductive.<br />
				There are still many extant adjectives formed from verb which 
				employ the -<em>ible</em> suffix.&nbsp; However, removing the suffix does 
				not usually leave a recognisable word so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; audible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; risible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incorrigible</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Here, again, we have instances of a bound base or bound root 
				which is no longer able to function alone.&nbsp; The words <em>
				aud</em>, <em>ris</em> and <em>corr</em> simply do not exist 
				although they can be traced to Latin.<br />
				In nearly all cases, the -<em>ible</em> forms are more formal 
				and less common so we have formal-informal pairings such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; credible - believable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; edible - eatable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; potable - drinkable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; risible - laughable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; illegible - unreadable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comprehensible - understandable</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li><strong>nouns from adjectives</strong><br />
				Another example is the ways in English that nouns are formed 
				from adjectives.&nbsp; The two most common are:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ness</em></span>: <em>happy → happiness, sad → sadness, great → greatness</em> 
				etc.<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ity</em></span>: <em>insane → insanity, absurd → absurdity, acid → acidity</em> 
				etc.<br />
				However, if you try to form new nouns from these adjectives:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blue-green, airy, snowy, freezing, wet</em><br />
				You will almost always opt for <span class="style_black"> <em>ness</em></span>, indicating that
				<span class="style_black">
				<em>ness</em></span> is more productive than 
				<span class="style_black"> <em>ity</em></span> in this 
				function.<br />
				This is not to say that <span class="style_black"> <em>ity</em></span> is unproductive in the way 
				that <span class="style_black"> <em>th</em></span> is, but that it is less productive.&nbsp; It 
				can be very productive with adjectives ending in the 
				<span class="style_black"> <em>able</em></span> 
				morpheme.&nbsp; Try, e.g.,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; openable, disturbable, derivable, pickupable</em><br />
				and -<span class="style_black"><em>ability</em></span> seems to be the form of choice although it is 
				certainly possible to form words like <em>openableness</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>doers</strong><br />
				Other derivational morphemes are also less productive than 
				others.&nbsp; We can, e.g., form the doer of a verb by attaching 
				the morpheme <span class="style_black"> <em>ant</em></span> as in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inhabit → inhabitant<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				assail → assailant<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				claim → claimant</em><br />
				but this suffix is far less frequently used for this function 
				than the ubiquitous <span class="style_black"> <em>er</em></span> suffix.&nbsp; Try forming the 
				doer of the action from these verbs and you'll see how much more 
				productive the <span class="style_black"> <em>er</em></span> morpheme is:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disturb, peruse, demand, accommodate</em><br />
				The suffix <span class="style_black"> <em>ist</em></span> is even less productive in this sense 
				although <em>typist</em> and <em>telephonist</em> exist.<br />
				Just as we saw for the <span class="style_black"> <em>able/ible</em></span> distinction, the 
				suffix <span class="style_black"> <em>or</em></span> is now almost completely unproductive and is 
				frozen into words like <em>actor, transgressor</em> and <em>
				doctor</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Nonce words</strong><br />
				Speakers of English frequently make up words by the addition of 
				a derivational suffix or a small range of prefixes.&nbsp; We 
				get, therefore words such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speakable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; screwability<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; framableness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; writingless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; misdecide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; travelful</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unframe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disharmonise</em><br />
				and so on, none of which will appear in a dictionary and all of 
				which are temporary (nonce) introductions.&nbsp; Nonce words are 
				sometimes referred to as occasionalisms.</li>
				<li><strong>Barbarisms</strong><br />
				This term is used by language purists to describe formations 
				which are disparaged because acceptable and derivationally purer 
				forms already exist.&nbsp; Some will not become popular but many 
				so-called barbarisms have already entered the language.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>orientate</em> is a verb formation already covered by the 
				verb <em>orient</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>preventative</em> is an adjective whose meaning is not 
				distinguishable from <em>preventive</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>untactful</em> is an unnecessary addition to a language 
				which already contains <em>tactless</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>educationalist</em> is not clearly distinguishable from 
				the current <em>educationist</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>metrification</em> does not add anything useful not 
				covered by <em>metrication</em>.&nbsp; In fact, it adds 
				unnecessary suffixes because there is no verb <em>metrify or 
				metrificate</em> but <em>metricate</em> certainly exists.<br />
				and so on.<br />
				In some cases, these questionable coinages will become the usual 
				forms, in others, they will die out.<br />
				As has been pointed out:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Ultimately, it is general usage, 
				rather than etymological pedigree, that determines the survival 
				of a word.</em></span> (Todd &amp; Hancock 1986:71).&nbsp; 
				(Although they may, of course, mean <em>use</em> rather than <em>
				usage</em>.)</li>
				<li><strong>Combining forms</strong><br />
				When an additional meaning is grafted on to a term by the 
				addition of a suffix it does not usually change the word class 
				so cannot be derivational in this sense.&nbsp; The guide to word 
				formation contains more on this area and there is a list of such 
				forms linked below.&nbsp; Words such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thermometer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heliotropic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Francophone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; herbicide</em><br />
				are examples of the use of combining form suffixes which do not 
				change the word class (even if they are appended to recognisable 
				words at all, which many are not).<br />
				Combining forms are, especially in academic and scientific 
				writing, very productive indeed so recent formulations, such as
				<em>anthropocene</em> (the current geological age) are coined at 
				will and retain their existence for many years.</li>

			<p>Some suffixes are simply too constrained in the number of bases 
			they can be attached to to make them very productive.<br />
			We can make an adverb from some nouns with the suffixes 
			<span class="style_black"> <em>wise</em></span> 
			and <span class="style_black"> <em>wards</em></span> as in, e.g.,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crabwise, clockwise, northwards, citywards </em>etc.<br />
			but the number of possibilities is very limited because of the 
			infrequency of the resulting adverbs and the small usefulness the 
			concepts have.</p>
			<p>However, the adverb forming <span class="style_black"> <em>ly</em></span> is hugely productive in its 
			ability to produce adverbs from adjectives because the results are 
			both frequent and useful.&nbsp; It can also attach itself to the 
			barely limited number of participle adjectives in English.&nbsp; So 
			we can form, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; stunningly, interestingly, swingingly, boringly, 
			understandingly, reassuringly</em><br />
			and so on.&nbsp; We can even make up new adverbs on the spur of the 
			moment and be understood, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke praisingly.</em></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apology → apologize<br />
				</em>Another verb-making suffix, <span class="style_black"><em>en</em></span>, attaches itself to single 
				syllable adjectives but only if they end in certain phonemes 
				(stops, and fricatives):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deep → deepen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; light → lighten<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; broad → broaden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deaf → deafen<br />
				</em>but not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear → *clearen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high → *highen<br />
				</em>in fact, we insert a 't' to conform with the phonological 
				rule and get
				<em>heighten.<br />
				</em>This applies to prefixes, too, as we see with the choice 
				often of <em> <span class="style_black">im</span> </em>rather 
				than <em> <span class="style_black">in</span> </em>before /m/ 
				and /p/ and <span class="style_black"><em>ir</em></span> before

				<dt> <strong>etymology</strong></dt>
				<dd>The root of a word will often determine what derivational

				<dd>For example, the adjective-forming suffix
				<span class="style_black"><em>ic</em></span> will not attach to 
				Anglo-Saxon bases but <span class="style_black"><em>en</em></span> 
				will so we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vitriolic, metallic, dramatic<br />
				</em>but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				woollen, leaden, ashen</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>meaning</strong></dt>
				<dd>The prefixes <span class="style_black"><em>un, im, in</em></span> 
				etc. do not attach to words with negative connotations so we 
				can't have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *unvile, *impernicious, *undoleful, *unhelpless<br />
				</em>etc.
				but we can have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unlovely, unappreciated, improper, unhelpful<br />

				<dt><strong>transparency</strong></dt>
				<dd>When introducing the concepts of word formation in English, 
				it makes sense to start with those morphemes whose meaning is the 
				most transparent.&nbsp; They also tend to be the most 
				productive, of course, and therefore, the most useful.<br />
				So, start with simple affixes which have a near one-to-one 
				relationship between form and meaning:<br />
				Suffixes like: <span class="style_black"><em>able, ness, ity, 
				ize/ise</em></span> are good candidates.<br />
				Prefixes such as<span class="style_black"><em> un, re, pre</em></span> 
				are also good candidates.</dd>
				<dt><strong>frequency and usefulness</strong></dt>
				<dd>are considerations to bear in mind when deciding 
				on the teaching of any lexis and it is sensible to exclude 
				noun-making suffixes such as <span class="style_black"><em>th</em></span> 
				and adjective-forming suffixes such as <span class="style_black">
				<em>esque</em></span> because they are either wholly or nearly 
				fully unproductive in English.&nbsp; In fact, singling out
				<span class="style_black"><em>th</em></span> as a noun-former at 
				all is probably a waste of time.&nbsp; Learners do not need to 
				know that the noun <em>width</em> is formed from the adjective + 
				the suffix because the suffix itself is no longer productive.<br />
				It makes more sense to focus on:<br />
				Noun-forming suffixes like <span class="style_black"><em>ness, 
				er, ity, eer, ist</em></span> rather than
				<span class="style_black"><em>ant, dom, ery, hood</em></span> 
				etc.<br />
				Adjective-forming suffixes like <span class="style_black"><em>
				able, less, ful, ish, ist</em></span> rather than
				<span class="style_black"><em>ous, ic, ian</em></span>.<br />
				The adverb-forming <span class="style_black"><em>ly</em></span> 
				rather than <span class="style_black"><em>wards</em></span> or
				<span class="style_black"><em>wise</em></span>.<br />
				The verb-forming <span class="style_black"><em>ise/ize</em></span> 
				rather than <span class="style_black"><em>fy, en</em></span>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>constraints</strong></dt>
				<dd>Phonology and meaning are the two to focus on because 
				etymology will only be useful in real time for learners with a 
				narrow range of European first languages.<br />
				It is, for example, predictable from the syllable number and 
				stress pattern (two syllables or more, stress not at the end) 
				that the verbs from<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; computer, brutal, central, economy, 
				familiar, national, personal<br />
				</em>etc. will all end in -<span class="style_black"><em>ize</em></span> 
				or -<span class="style_black"><em>ise</em></span>.<br />
				The 
				constraints on the use of <span class="style_black"><em>en</em></span> 
				in this function are much less easily applied but 
				phonologically, for example, deriving <em>quiet<span class="style_black">en</span></em> 
				from <em>quiet</em> is not too challenging once you spot the /t/ 
				ending and from there, it is a short step to forming <em>
				tighten, flatten </em>etc.<br />
				The fact that already-negative adjectives (like <em>ugly, vile, 
				hateful, odious, helpless, antagonistic</em>) do not take 
				antonym-making prefixes but positive ones (such as <em>kind, 
				comfortable, generous, helpful, likeable</em>) do is easy to 
				grasp and the knowledge will help learners avoid a good deal of 
				potential error.</dd>
				<dt><strong>comprehension vs. production</strong></dt>
				<dd>Armed with a knowledge of the function of common affixes, 
				learners can significantly increase their receptive lexicon.<br />
				Production is harder, of course, but opting for the most 
				productive affixes when speculating on word formation will 
				usually pay dividends.&nbsp; If you want to make the opposites 
				of these adjectives, what would you choose?<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cut, read, quiet, easy, lived-in, organised, classified, 
				worried</em><br />
				Participle adjectives very frequently form their opposites with 
				the simple <span class="style_black"><em>un</em></span>.<br />
				Nouns formed from adjectives are overwhelmingly made with
				<span class="style_black"><em>ness</em></span> (and less 
				frequently <span class="style_black"><em>ity</em></span>) so 
				that's the way to bet if you want to form nouns from adjectives 
				from, e.g.,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delightful, malicious, rocky, thrifty, dark, clever</em><br />
				then the natural selection is <em>ness</em> and you'll be right 
				nearly all the time.<br />
				If the adjective ends in <span class="style_black"><em>able</em></span>, 
				opt for <span class="style_black"><em>ity</em></span>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; readable, drinkable, editable, pronounceable, describable
				</em>etc.</dd>

					<h2>Inflexional morphemes</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In English we can denote a number of grammatical constructions by 
			using inflexional morphemes.&nbsp; We usually do this by changing 
			the ending but, irregularly, we can also change the internal 
			characteristic of the lexeme (a process called mutation or ablaut 
			when it affects the vowel).&nbsp; Inflexional morphemes always, in 
			English, follow derivational morphemes.&nbsp; We get, therefore, 
			e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>nation+al+ise+d</em><br />
			not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>nation+al+d+ise</em><br />
			Inflexional morphemes include:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Tense</strong>:<br />
				We saw above that the <span class="style_black"><em>-ed/-d</em></span> 
				morpheme signals past tense but it also signals a past 
				participle for regular verbs:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talk</em> → <em>talk<span class="style_black">ed</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hope</em> → <em>hop<span class="style_black">ed</span></em><br />
				and for some irregular verbs the past participle is also marked 
				by a morpheme addition<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forgot</em> → <em>forgot<span class="style_black">ten</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; broke</em> → <em>brok<span class="style_black">en</span></em><br />
				Internal changes 
				(mutations) are also morphemic but what usually occurs is that one bound 
				morpheme is altered and becomes a slightly different bound 
				morpheme as in, e.g.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; understand → understood<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behold → beheld</em><br />
				English is unusual among European languages in 
				having only one past-tense form to apply to all persons.&nbsp; 
				Most other languages in this family use different endings for 
				most of the persons and number.<br />
				It is also unusual in often having the same form for the past 
				tense and the past participle.&nbsp; Other languages, such as 
				Greek, distinguish the forms.</li>
				<li><strong>Aspect</strong>:<br />
				English signals progressive and other aspects by changes to the 
				verb:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go, going, gone<br />
				</em>Again, English is very limited in this respect having only 
				one form of the past participle and only one of the -<em>ing</em> 
				form.&nbsp; The -<em>ing</em> form, incidentally, has no irregularities.&nbsp; 
				None.</li>
				<li><strong>Person</strong>:<br />
				Apart from the truly irregular verb <em>be</em>, English only 
				signals person with the third-person <span class="style_black">
				<em>-s</em></span> morpheme (and then only in the singular):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speak</em> → <em>speak<span class="style_black">s</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hang</em> → <em>hang<span class="style_black">s<br />
				</span></em>By European language 
				standards, this is a very limited range.&nbsp; In some other European 
				languages, for example, the translation works like this:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder" style="width: 90%">

				This is not universal and, for example, all three Scandinavian 
				languages (Norwegian, Swedish and Danish) have the same form for 
				all the verbs in all persons (<em>går</em>).<br />
				For this reason, many languages, such as Greek and Italian, 
				routinely drop the pronoun because the person is signalled by 
				the verb ending.&nbsp; The term for these languages is <strong>
				pro-drop</strong> incidentally, and there is more on that in the 
				guide to types of languages, linked below.</li>
				<li><strong>Number</strong>:<br />
				Although there are some irregularities, English uses the <em>
				<span class="style_black">s/es</span> </em>morpheme to signal the 
				plural.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class</em> → <em>class<span class="style_black">es</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; house</em> → <em>house<span class="style_black">s</span></em><br />
				Almost all nouns function this way in English which is a simple 
				system in comparison to many other languages (and more complex 
				than many which do not signal the difference between singular 
				and plural at all).</li>
				<li><strong>Adjectives</strong>:<br />
				English uses morphemic addition to change some adjectives from 
				absolute to 
				comparative or superlative:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long</em> → <em>long<span class="style_black">er</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; small</em> → <em>small<span class="style_black">est</span></em><br />
				The morpheme <span class="style_black"><em>most</em></span> can also act as a suffix 
				carrying a similar meaning of towards the extreme in words like <em>nether<span class="style_black">most</span>, upper<span class="style_black">most</span>, 
				hind<span class="style_black">most</span></em> 
				etc.&nbsp; The morpheme <span class="style_black"><em>more</em></span> 
				can't do that and the suffix <span class="style_black"><em>most</em></span> 
				is now unproductive.<br />
				The added complication in English is that some adjectives cannot 
				take the inflexion at all so we do not allow, e.g., <em>boredest</em> 
				or <em>beautifuller</em>.&nbsp; The rules for when we inflect 
				and when we use the periphrastic form are quite complex, in 
				fact.<br />
				Other languages are often simpler in this respect.&nbsp; Most 
				Romance languages, French, Spanish, Romanian, Portuguese etc. 
				employ the periphrastic form and some, such as German, usually employ 
				only the inflected form (although the periphrastic form is 
				available), others, Scandinavian languages and some Slavic 
				languages, for example, work a little like English.<br />
				Adjectives in English remain unchanged, whatever case, gender 
				and number they are associated with.&nbsp; Other languages will 
				often inflect the adjective to show case, gender and number.</li>
				<li><strong>Case</strong>:<br />
				Many languages, which take advantage of morphemes to signal 
				case (nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, locative, 
				ergative etc.) alter the nouns and other elements to show this.&nbsp; 
				English generally does not do this with content words but has a 
				slightly complex pronoun and determiner system which sometimes radically alters a morpheme to show case and 
				sometimes simply adjusts it slightly:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder" style="width: 50%">
					<tr class="style_black">
						<td class="auto-style72" style="width: 16%">Nominative

						hers<br />
						his<br />
						theirs<br />
						</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				and so on.&nbsp; A full list is available in the guide to 
				personal pronouns.<br />
				English also deploys the <span class="style_black"><em>'s</em></span> 
				morpheme for the genitive:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John<span class="style_black">'s</span>, the dog<span class="style_black">'s</span>, the ship<span class="style_black">'s</span>, the government<span class="style_black">'s<br />
				</span></em>The fact that English has two genitive structures (<em>the 
				government's policy</em> vs. <em>the policy of the government</em>, 
				for example) is an added complication which leads to a good deal 
				of unnatural language in learners and some error.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The technical term for the way in which words can have their 
			grammatical function altered by changes to the morphology is <strong>accidence</strong>, incidentally.</p>
			<p>Old English had many more (and much more complex) inflexions than Modern 
			English has retained.&nbsp; The loss of inflexion is one of the 
			most important changes to have occurred in the language.&nbsp; (As a 
			matter of simple interest, Old English was made even more 
			complicated by having a separate category for two people.&nbsp; So 
			we had <em>ic</em> (<em>I</em>), <em>we</em> (<em>we</em>) and <em>
			wit</em> (<em>we two</em>) for example and these changed in the 
			accusative, dative and genitive, rather like modern German pronouns 
			alter.)<br />
			Many other languages, such as German, Polish, Finnish, and French 
			deploy a much wider range of suffixes to denote number, person, case 
			and gender.&nbsp; Other languages, such as the Chinese languages are 
			even more limited than English in their use of inflexions and suffixation.</p>

					<h3>Suppletion<br />
					(n. /səˈpliːʃᵊn/)</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Occasionally, we come across a form which is clearly not derived 
			from what we would expect.&nbsp; For example, the words <em>larger</em> 
			and <em>largest</em> are clearly connected to and derived from the 
			base form <em>large</em> but that is not the case with the words <em>
			worse</em> and <em>worst</em> acting as the comparative and 
			superlative forms of the word <em>bad</em>.<br />
			What we are dealing with is suppletion and the result is called a 
			suppletive form.&nbsp; It refers to the fact that the forms are 
			phonemically and (sometimes) etymologically distinct.&nbsp; The 
			origin of the word <em>bad</em> is somewhat obscure but the words
			<em>worse</em> and <em>worst</em> are traceable to Old English 
			forms.<br />
			Suppletion may be complete as in the example of <em>bad-worse</em> 
			in which the words share no letters or sounds at all or it may be 
			quite weak as in the case of <em>five-fifth</em> where the words are 
			derived from the same root but the pronunciation has been altered so 
			that the spoken forms may not be recognised as connected at all.<br />
			Other common examples of suppletion in English are:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em>go, went gone</em></dt>
				<dd>The past tense of this verb is clearly unconnected from the 
				base form and the past participle.&nbsp; The latter two come 
				from the Old English <em>gan</em> and there are cognates in most 
				Germanic languages, <em>gehen</em> in German, <em>gaan</em> in 
				Dutch and so on.<br />
				The past tense of the verb, however, is derived from the 
				irregular past tense of the verb <em>wend</em> and that verb has 
				now taken on the regular past tense forms.</dd>
				<dt><em>three, third</em></dt>
				<dd>This is a weaker example because some letters and sounds are 
				shared but hearing the words will not obviously alert people to 
				their connection.</dd>
				<dt><em>one, first; two, second</em></dt>
				<dd>are both examples of much stronger suppletion because the 
				word <em>first</em> derives from a different root from the word
				<em>one</em> (although both are traceable to Old English) and 
				the word <em>second</em> is an import <em>via</em> French from 
				Latin and not connected with the numeral <em>two</em> at all.</dd>
				<dt><em>far, further, farther, furthest, farthest</em></dt>
				<dd>are all examples of quite weak suppletion because they all 
				derive from the same Old English root.</dd>
				<dt><em>be, am, is, are, was, were</em></dt>
				<dd>is an example of really complex suppletion.&nbsp; The roots 
				are traceable but all come from a different set of words in Old 
				English and Proto-Indo European.&nbsp; It is a tangle of 
				semantically connected forms with no discernible spelling and 
				pronunciation commonalities.&nbsp; The word <em>be</em> derives 
				from the Old English <em>beon</em> (<em>exist</em>), the word
				<em>am</em> from <em>eom</em>, the word <em>are</em> from the 
				plural form of <em>beon</em> and so on.&nbsp; The past tenses are 
				traceable to the verb <em>wesan</em> (meaning <em>remain</em>).&nbsp; 
				The verb has eight distinct parts in Modern English derived from 
				at least two Old English dialects: <em>be, am, is, are, was, 
				were, being, been</em>.</dd>
				<dt><em>good, better, best</em></dt>
				<dd>The first of these is traceable to Old English <em>gōd</em> 
				but the two other forms come from a different source (Old 
				English <em>beste</em>).</dd>
				<dt><em>person, people</em></dt>
				<dd>The first of these derives from the Old French <em>persone</em> 
				and the latter from Old French <em>peupel</em> (itself from 
				Latin <em>populus</em>).&nbsp; The plural <em>persons</em> is 
				rare and formal.</dd>
				<dt><em>cow, cattle</em></dt>
				<dd>derive from separate roots but the latter is considered a 
				plural collective version of the former.&nbsp; Other forms such 
				as <em>ox-oxen</em> are referred to as suppletive affixes 
				because they do not follow the normal morphological rules for 
				making plurals.</dd>
				<dt><em>wreak, wrought</em></dt>
				<dd>This is a real oddity because <em>wrought</em> was 
				originally the past tense of <em>work</em> (which is now regular 
				in English).&nbsp; It still exists as a participle adjective in, 
				e.g., <em>wrought iron</em>.&nbsp; The past forms of <em>wreak</em> 
				are in principle regular (<em>wreaked, wreaked</em>) but it has 
				become common to see <em>wrought</em> used as the past of that 
				verb, perhaps by analogy to <em>teach</em> and <em>seek</em>.</dd>

			<p>For a much more detailed look at prefixes and what they do, see 
			the guide to word formation.&nbsp; Here, we will simply list some of 
			the categories into which prefixes fall and the sorts of things the 
			morphemes do.&nbsp; Nearly all prefixes are bound morphemes.<br />
			Free morphemes which may look like prefixes are usually cases of 
			compounding so, for example, the morpheme <em>house</em> in <em>
			housemaster</em> is not considered here as an example of prefixing.<br />
			See the guide to compounding for more on that, linked below.<br />
			Prefixes come in three main sorts of which the second is the most

			<ol>
				<li><strong>derivational prefixes</strong><br />
				are quite rare in English and almost wholly unproductive.&nbsp; 
				In earlier forms of English they were very productive and many 
				modern words such as <em>become, aforesaid, embolden </em>etc. 
				can be traced to earlier prefixation.<br />
				They include, e.g.,<ol class="auto-style61">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; asleep</em></li>
					<li><em>be</em>- forming verbs such as<br />
