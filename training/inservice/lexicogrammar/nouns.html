			<h1>Nouns</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="label" height="207" src="../../images/label310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>
			This is a major word class but, oddly, sometimes neglected on the 
			basis that all languages have nouns so there can't be much to talk 
			about.&nbsp; The first part is true, the second much more debatable.<br />
			You may have seen nouns referred to in some analyses as <strong>
			substantives</strong> but that is a rather old-fashioned term we 
			will avoid.</p>
			<p>
			If this is your first visit feel free to take things as they come.&nbsp; 
			Alternatively, here's a guide to the contents.<br />
		Clicking on <span class="style_red">-top-</span> at the end of each section will

			<p>That's easy.&nbsp; Nouns are labels for things, aren't they?&nbsp;

				<li>All of the above bar the word <em>cultural</em> can be 
				nouns.</li>
				<li>Some can also function as verbs so, from the table above we 
				can also have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is painting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smile!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				I wanted to capture it alive<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It punctured the tyre<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's 
				tabling a new motion</em></li>
				<li>Some nouns (most, in fact) can also function grammatically 
				as a type of adjective called a classifier.&nbsp; The difference 
				between a classifier and an adjective proper is that a 
				classifier refers to the type of noun we are modifying and an 
				adjective describes it.<br />
				From the list in the table, we can have the following as 
				classifiers, i.e., adjectival in some way:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went to painting classes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an organisation issue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the departure point?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the estimated arrival time?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's famous for his table talk</em><br />
				at what point a noun acting to modify another noun as a 
				classifier shades into a noun compounding with another is often

			<p>Because nouns are so central to any language, it will be 
			unsurprising to find that there are many ways in which they are 
			formed.&nbsp; Some nouns, of course, most, in fact, are simple 
			nouns, not formed from other words and having no obvious features 
			identifying them as nouns.&nbsp; There is nothing, for example, 
			about the form of words like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; house, car, problem, screen, key, joy, sky, 
			place</em><br />
			etc. which allows us to identify them as nouns.&nbsp; Only seeing 
			what they do in the syntax of the language allows us to classify 
			them accurately.<br />
			Other nouns are, however, clearly derived from words in other 
			classes.&nbsp; Here's a short list of the most frequent and obvious 
			ways nouns are formed by suffixation in English:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>-age</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This suffix refers to a generalised noun derived from a 
				particular case of another.&nbsp; Examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drainage, leafage, percentage, package, 
				parentage </em>etc.<br />
				The suffix is also used to form nouns from verbs, again 
				referring to a generalised concept from the verb, as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carriage, assemblage, marriage, towage, 
				passage</em> etc.<br />
				In fact, most words ending in -<em>age</em> are nouns and that 
				is a helpful guide to learners.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>-al</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This suffix is usually one which forms adjectives but these 
				can be converted into nouns such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; musical, national, original, neutral, 
				criminal</em> etc.<br />
				Quite rarely, the suffix is used to form nouns from verbs as in, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dismissal, portrayal, deferral, refusal</em> 
				etc.<br />
				Most words ending in <em>-al </em>are not nouns, however.&nbsp; The way 
				to bet is that they are adjectives.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>-an, -ant, -crat, -ee,-eer, -er, -ist, -ite, 
				-or, -ster</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>All these noun-forming suffixes refer to people in favour of 
				something, the doer of a verb or a person concerned with a field 
				of enquiry.&nbsp; The most common is -<em>er</em> which forms 
				new nouns readily from verbs.&nbsp; Others, such as -<em>al</em> 
				and -<em>or</em> are no longer productive.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disciplinarian, vegetarian, republican, 
				historian, inhabitant, participant, democrat, technocrat, 
				escapee, employee, engineer, mountaineer, gardener, speaker, 
				Marxist, fascist, socialite, actor, doctor, mobster, gangster</em> 
				etc.<br />
				The -<em>ite</em> ending is widely used in geology to describe 
				types of minerals and rocks as in <em>dolerite, anthracite, 
				malachite</em> and many more.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>-ate</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This is a rare noun-forming suffix and usually forms causal 
				verbs such as <em>truncate, desiccate</em> and so on but it can be used 
				to form a noun from another as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doctorate, subordinate, graduate, 
				sophisticate </em>etc.<br />
				It is also frequently used to denote chemical derivatives such 
				as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phosphate, carbonate, silicate </em>etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>-ation, -cation, -sion, -tion</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>These are variations on a theme, all ending in -<em>ion</em>.&nbsp; 
				They readily form nouns from verbs such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;replication, organisation, deification, electrification, 
				decision, conversion, devotion, notation </em>etc.<br />
				Almost all words ending in -<em>ion</em> are nouns of some 
				description.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>-ery </strong></em> <span class="auto-style161">(and </span>
				<em><strong>-ory</strong></em>),<em><strong> 
				-ry</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>These suffixes are now almost fully unproductive but are 
				used to signal an activity or the place where an activity takes 
				place.&nbsp; Examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brewery, bakery, conservatory, 
				observatory, surgery, upholstery, hostelry, colliery </em>etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>-ese</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This suffix is mostly confined to people or types 
				of language and is sometimes used to invent new terms such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Japanese, Maltese, c<span class="auto-style108">omputer</span>ese, 
				managementese, bureaucratese, teacherese</em> etc.<br />
				This suffix is sometimes replaced by <em>-speak </em>as in <em>
				BBC-speak, IT-speak, Cambridge-speak </em>etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>-ess</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This suffix was frequently used to form female versions of 
				male nouns so we used to have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stewardess, hostess, manageress, actress</em> 
				etc.<br />
				However, times change and the ending is now often disparaged as 
				sexist language so all of the above, shorn of the ending can be 
				used to describe people of either (or all) sex(es).<br />
				For non-human nouns, the suffix is still in frequent use, 
				however, and we still encounter, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tigress, lioness, goddess </em>etc.<br />
				Even for humans, some -<em>ess</em> suffixes are still in common 
				use for want of a better expression so we still encounter, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>duchess, marchioness, princess, seamstress </em>etc.<br />
				A range of nouns have alternative male / female forms and they 
				include, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goose / gander, duck / drake, king / 
				queen, sister / brother, uncle / aunt </em>and a host more.<br />
				See the guide to gender, linked below, and the section in this 
				guide on markedness, for more about sex 
				marking on nouns.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>-ful</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This suffix often forms adjectives but has a noun-forming 
				function to denote quantities such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>handful, bottleful, carful, houseful</em> etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>-hood, -ship</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>These suffixes refer to a stage in life or a condition such 
				as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>boyhood, adulthood, falsehood, childhood, neighbourhood, 
				township, friendship, comradeship, guardianship</em> etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>-ism, -ocracy, -ology, -aphy, -apy</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>These are all to do with political or moral positions or 
				fields of academia such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marxism, Trumpism, democracy, autocracy, 
				sociology, biology, geography, therapy</em> etc.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>-ity</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>This suffix is used to derive nouns from adjectives ending 
				in -<em>ible</em> and -<em>able</em> and words are often coined 
				for the nonce with this suffix.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>availability, divisibility, permissibility, doability, 
				pickupability, burnability </em>etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>-let, -ette</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>These are confined to marking another noun for size such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaflet, eyelet, kitchenette, launderette</em> 
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>-man / -woman</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>Both these suffixes denote the doer of an action and are 
				formed from verbs.&nbsp; Just like the -<em>ess</em> suffix, 
				however, the forms are now often disparaged as sexist language 
				so are less productive than they once were.&nbsp; We still 
				encounter, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laundryman / laundrywoman, fisherman / 
				fisherwoman, spokesman / spokeswoman, countryman / countrywoman, 
				businessman / businesswoman</em> and more.<br />
				See the guide to gender, linked below, and the section in this 
				guide on markedness, for more about sex 
				marking on nouns.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>-ment, -ness</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>Both these are productive suffixes denoting the state of 
				being in a position or having a quality.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discernment, management, disappointment, 
				happiness, gratefulness, forgiveness </em>etc.</dd>
				<dt>-<em><strong>ware</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>This is a suffix derived from the old word <em>ware</em> 
				meaning an item for sale, now only seen in the plural.&nbsp; It 
				is still productive and the term in computing of <em>software</em> 
				is only attested from 1960.&nbsp; Other terms such as <em>
				spyware, bloatware</em> and so on are even more recent.</dd>

			<p>Missing from the list above is the ubiquitous <em>-ing</em> 
			suffix used to form nouns.&nbsp; Adding that suffix to a verb can 
			often form words which appear to be nouns (and sometimes are) but 
			which also retain some verbal qualities.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Driving when you are tired is dangerous</em><br />
			we have the gerund form <em>driving</em> which is operating as a 
			noun and is the subject of the copular verb, <em>be</em>.<br />
			It does, however, retain some features normally associated with 
			verbs because:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>It may be followed by a direct object:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Driving cars when you are tired is 
				dangerous</em></li>
				<li>It may be modified by an adverb phrase rather than an 
				adjective:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Driving too quickly is dangerous</em></li>
				<li>It cannot be pluralised so we do not allow <em>*drivings</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other formations are better described a verbal nouns or deverbal 
			nouns because they 
			have lost some or all verbal qualities and function grammatically just as 
			other nouns do.<br />
			Verbal nouns retain some verb-like qualities but deverbal nouns are 
			just nouns.<br />
			For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old buildings are dangerous</em><br />
			we have a noun, <em>building</em>, derived from the verb <em>build</em> 
			which does not show any verbal qualities (in this case) so:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>It cannot be used with a direct object so we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The building the houses took a long time</em><br />
				and need to insert an <em>of</em> phrase to make the connection 
				as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The building of the houses took a long 
				time</em></li>
				<li>It is modified by two adjectives, one attributive and one 
				predicative (<em>old</em> and <em>dangerous</em>) and it cannot 
				be modified by an adverb so we can't have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*The building slowly took too long</em></li>
				<li>It can be pluralised just like nearly all nouns by adding
				<em>-s</em> to the stem allowing <em>buildings</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the list above, there are other ways of making verbal nouns 
			using a variety of suffixes.<br />
			The distinction, briefly, is that <strong>gerunds retain 
			considerable verb-like features</strong> but <strong>verbal nouns 
			operate as all other nouns</strong> and have lost any verbal 
			characteristics.</p>
			<p>The situation is not clear cut, however, and there is a cline 
			from the gerund forms which retain verb-like characteristics and the 
			pure nominal forms which are noun-like in their behaviour.&nbsp; The 
			situation is:</p>
			<img alt="cline" height="304" src="../../imagesgraphics/gerund.png" width="620" /><p>For more on the distinction between participle verb forms,

			<h3>The traditional classification</h3>
			<p>You may have learned at some time that there are three sorts of 
			nouns.&nbsp; That's a traditional way to divide them, like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Common nouns<ol class="auto-style2">
					<li>abstract (such as <em>love, happiness, envy</em> etc.)</li>
					<li>concrete (such as <em>table, computer, paper</em> etc.)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Proper nouns (such as <em>Birmingham, Peter, The Labour 
				Party</em> etc.)</li>
				<li>Collective nouns (such as <em>army, flock, family, committee</em> 
				etc.)<br />
				See the note below on the difference between collective and 
				assemblage nouns.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In summary, the old classification looks like this:<br />
			<img alt="old classification" height="470" src="../../imagesgraphics/nouns_classify_old.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p><a name="1"></a>The classification was based on what we understand the notion of 
			the noun is, not its grammatical function in a sentence.<br />
			This is a classification now considered somewhat out of date and 
			unreliable.&nbsp; Can you think why?&nbsp; 
			<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'nouns2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have 
			an answer</a>.</p>
			<ol id="nouns2" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">
				<li>The distinction between abstract and concrete nouns is not 
				sustainable.&nbsp; It's clear that <em>happiness</em> does imply 
				an intangible abstract quality but what about a word like <em>
				smile</em>?&nbsp; Is that an abstract or concrete thing?&nbsp; 
				Something you can touch is clearly a concrete noun but things 
				that you perceive in other ways are not so easily classified.</li>
				<li>Nouns can slip between categories such as these.<ol class="auto-style2">
					<li>The noun <em>love</em> may be an abstract in some cases<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All we need is love<br />
					</em>but in other cases, the word 
					is clearly a concrete<br /><em>He is one of the loves of her 
					life</em>.</li>
					<li>The noun <em>Jones</em> is clearly a proper noun in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Ask Jones to do it<br />
					</em>but can be a concrete common noun in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask the Jones who works in accounts to do it</em>.</li>
					<li>The noun <em>Russia</em> is a proper noun but the noun
					<em>Russian</em> behaves just like a common noun.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Common nouns do not all behave in the same way.&nbsp; Some 
				are mass nouns which take no plural forms and occur with 
				singular-form verbs, such as <em>information, furniture, water</em> 
				etc.&nbsp; Some behave very differently and have plural forms 
				such as <em>house, keyboard, window</em> etc.<br />
				This fundamental and critical distinction between count and mass 
				nouns is not one shared by many languages.&nbsp; Those languages 
				which do not make the distinction (or in which the distinction 
				is not grammatically significant) often have simple determiner 
				systems.&nbsp; Speakers of such languages encounter serious 
				problems in this regard when learning English and, in fact, may 
				never internalise the distinction consistently.<br />
				The determiners which work with these two distinct sorts of 
				nouns therefore vary, so we can have, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; some milk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some dogs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a few houses</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				but we can't have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *a milk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a little dogs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *much houses</em><br />
				etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>A more modern classification</h3>
			<p>Most grammars these days classify nouns into four main 
			categories based not on notions of meaning but on grammatical 
			function.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="new classification" height="380" src="../../imagesgraphics/nouns_classify_new.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p><a name="3"></a>There are two examples of each of the four main

			Answers:<br />
			1 and 7 are collective nouns.<br />
			2 and 8 are mass nouns.<br />
			3 and 6 are proper nouns.<br />

			<p>For a little more on how concord works with collective nouns, see 
			the guide to the area, linked below.</p>
			<p>In some analyses, we might add a fifth 
			category, classifiers and partitives, because they exhibit phenomena 
			unique to themselves.&nbsp; Examples are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				Classifiers:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drives a <span class="style_black">sports</span> car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He works in a <span class="style_black">steel</span> plant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a <span class="style_black">reception</span> manager<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are a <span class="style_black">language</span> teacher</em></li>
				<li>
				Partitives:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass me a <span class="style_black">bit</span> of bread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use a <span class="style_black">length</span> of rope<br />

			<p>For teaching purposes, both classifications have some utility:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>The notional, old-style, classification is useful when 
				meaning is the paramount consideration because the distinctions 
				between common, proper and collective nouns are intuitively easy 
				to grasp and the nouns which fall into these categories (with 
				the exception of the dubious concrete-abstract distinction) 
				exist in all languages and are handled similarly.<br />
				This kind of classification also sits well with communicative 
				approaches because the focus is on notion not structure.<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>Common nouns are the most frequently encountered types 
					and, if one distinguishes between mass and count noun uses, 
					follow predictable patterns.&nbsp; Collocational aspects of 
					common nouns are particularly obvious and any number of 
					adjective + noun, verb + noun or noun + verb collocations can be the 
					focus of teaching.</li>
					<li>Proper nouns are usually subjects or objects of verbs 
					and the only ones with which we use the vocative (addressee) 
					case.&nbsp; Some languages reserve a particular inflexion on 
					the noun to signal this.<br />
					Few adjective + noun collocational patterns, bar a few 
					predicative adjectives, are observable with proper nouns at 
					all.<br />
					Because these nouns are nearly always applied to human 
					agents, the range of noun + verb collocations is predictable 
					and teachable.<br />
					Most proper nouns do not take article determiners although 
					the system is, as we shall see, frustratingly irregular.</li>
					<li>Collective nouns need to be distinguished from 
					assemblage nouns (which are analysed in the guide to 
					partitives and classifiers (linked below)).<br />
					Collective nouns proper are those in which it is clear what 
					the individual members are so we do not often need the <em>
					of-</em>construction.&nbsp; We can refer, therefore, to<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an army<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a congregation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a committee</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; my family</em><br />
					and so on.<br />
					Assemblage nouns, on the other hand, follow a predictable pattern: 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>assembly noun + of + plural common noun + singular verb</strong></span> as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bunch of bananas was on the table<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a crowd of schoolchildren was waiting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a queue of customers is outside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pod of whales was seen</em><br />
					etc. although, in informal, casual speech, plural verb forms 
					are often applied.&nbsp; More on that later.<br />
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The more modern classification is more useful when structure 
				(i.e., colligation) is the focus.<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>The same considerations apply to proper and collective 
					nouns (because the categories are retained from the old 
					classification).</li>
					<li>The more modern categorisation allows the focus to be 
					put on mass vs. count properties which is fundamental to 
					understanding how nouns work in English.&nbsp; Other 
					languages often do not handle the concepts in the same way 
					even when the distinction between mass and count nouns is 
					maintained.</li>
					<li>The modern classification can also be helpful when 
					handling meaning because the distinctions between nouns used 
					to encode mass or count ideas can be handled more 
					effectively once the main distinctions have been mastered.</li>

			<p>Mass nouns are distinguishable because they can act as 
				arguments (e.g., as subjects and objects) in their bare form so 
				we allow, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave advice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Money was helpful</em><br />but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They made suggestion<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Coin was heavy</em><br />and, of course, because they do not occur in the plural.<br />In fact, with two exceptions, count nouns cannot stand without a 
				determiner so, for example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q: <em>What shall I clean it with?</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: 
			<em>Water</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: <em>*Brush</em><br />The exceptions are:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<em>They walked arm in arm</em> (an example of parallelism in which 
			apparently countable nouns are used to refer not to the items 
			themselves but to a concept or relationship in which case they are 
			considered as mass nouns)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<em>Come here, child</em> (a rare vocative use).</p>
			<p>Mass nouns cannot occur with an indefinite article so we do not 
			allow, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a milk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *an alcohol<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a water<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *an oxygen</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p>See below for some more examples of what is sometimes called 
				idiomatic uses of count nouns without determiners.<br />Mass nouns form the next largest category and include:</p>
			<ol class="greenbullet">
				<li>abstract qualities:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				anger, happiness, significance<br /></em>This is not, however, a reliable rule because, for 
					example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>belief, joy, pleasure, prejudice, suggestion, theory 
				</em>and <em>virtue</em><br />can be or are conventionally used as count nouns.</li>
				<li>substances:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silver, iron, 
					water, alcohol</em></li>
				<li>many nouns formed from 
				verbs (often called gerunds):<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; training, teaching, running<br />
				</em>(There are many nouns derived from verbs which are 
					countable such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; killing, furnishing, greeting, 
					shooting, reading, sweeping, painting<br /></em>etc., and not all nouns which end in -<em>ing</em> are 
					derived directly from verbs such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outing, thing, stocking, fining, 
					piling, ceiling </em>etc.)</li>
				<li>most infectious diseases<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; malaria, flu, pox<br />
				</em>but, oddly, <em>cold </em>is a count noun when it 
					refers to illness but a mass noun when it refers to 
					temperature.</li>
				<li>many mass nouns which, in most other languages, where 
					such differences exist, are count nouns.&nbsp; These include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accommodation, advice, furniture, 
				information, 
				machinery, money<br /></em>and many more.</li>
				<li>generally mass nouns which can sometimes be pluralised in special (often poetic) senses:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				the waters of the Thames<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				the wines of France<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the peoples of 
				the Americas</em></li>
				<li>It is sometimes stated that the use of the indefinite 
					article, <em>a/an</em>, with mass nouns is always prohibited 
					in English so you cannot have, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a water<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a furniture<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a knowledge<br />
				</em>etc.<br /><em></em>As far as it goes, this is a reasonable rule of thumb 
					for teaching purposes but disguises the truth because it is 
					certainly possible to have, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a good education is important<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a knowledge of French is helpful<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a 
				ridiculous behaviour which is unhelpful<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a conduct which I can't condone<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a 
				blanket permission has been granted<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a produce which is unique to the area<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a weather which I dislike<br />
				</em>but these are still not instances of the nouns 
					magically becoming count nouns because the instances are 
					quite rare and the plurals of these words are unavailable.&nbsp; 
					Often, as the examples show, the use of the indefinite 
					article is only possible when the noun has been identified 
					as a unique example in some way.</li>

			<p>This is quite a small group including nouns like <em>army, navy, crew, family, staff, committee</em> etc.<br />Collective nouns may be quite specific or operate much more 
				generally so, for example, <em>group</em> may be applied to <em>people, books, cars</em> and a huge range of other entities and 
				words such as <em>crowd, batch, set </em>and so on are equally 
				promiscuous although even with these terms there are 
				restrictions, usually to do with classifying the animate or 
				inanimate.<br />The more specific group nouns are better referred to as
				<strong>assemblage</strong> nouns and they include items like:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pod</em> (<em>whales, dolphins, porpoises</em>)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flock</em> 
				(<em>birds, sheep, goats</em>)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shoal</em> (<em>fish</em>)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; squad</em> (<em>soldiers, sports players</em>)<br />and so on.<br />It is tempting to teach somewhat arcane uses of assemblage 
				nouns, especially, for animals such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pace of asses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a murder of crows<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a skulk of foxes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a labour of moles</em><br />and so on.&nbsp; However, it is a temptation worth avoiding 
				because a) they are not known to many expert and native users of 
				English and b) they are of dubious historical validity, many 
				having been invented by Dame Juliana Berners in the 15th 
				century.<br />However, the guide to classifiers and partitives, linked below, 
				contains a list of the most useful ones which are in general use 
				under its section on <strong>assemblages</strong>.&nbsp; That 
				includes some specific terms such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a company of actors<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bunch of grapes</em><br />and so on.<br />There is 
				a complication with this group:</p>
			<ol class="greenbullet">
				<li>In British English these grammatically singular nouns are often

					<li>If we

				verb form.</li>
					<li>When we are thinking of a single entity, we

					<li>If there is an internal conflict in the collective, 
						the plural verb form is selected.</li>

			<p>Some confusion can be caused when nouns look like adjectives so, 
				for example, in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a paperback book</em><br />it appears that the word 
			<em>paperback</em> is functioning as an 
				adjective to describe the book just as <em>splendid</em> or <em>good</em> operate to describe the book in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a splendid book</em><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a good book</em><br />The distinction is that a word which simply describes, such as
				<em>splendid</em> or <em>good</em>, is an epithet but a word 
				which categorises is a classifier and, although they seem to be 
				doing similar jobs in the syntax, they are not.<br />Epithets can be modified but classifiers rarely can:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an absolutely splendid book</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a very good book</em><br />vs.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *This is an absolutely paperback book<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *This is a very 
			history book</em><br />Additionally, although epithets can usually be used 
				predicatively as in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book is splendid<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book is good</em><br />it is unnatural 
			or plain wrong to use classifiers this way, usually:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?This book is paperback</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*The book is history</em><br />Finally, noun classifiers cannot be made comparative or 
				superlative so we allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an even more splendid book<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the best book</em><br />but we cannot have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *This is a more paperback book<br /></em>For more, see the guides to classifiers and adjectives

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There is a cline from combinations in which it is clear that the 
				first noun is acting as a classifier and true compound nouns 
				which represent a single concept.&nbsp; For example, in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; university teacher<br /></em>the first noun serves to classify the second and the stress 
				falls naturally on the second item as it would if the first were 
				an epithet (/ˌjuː.nɪ.ˈvɜː.sɪ.ti.ˈtiː.tʃə/).&nbsp; Compare, for 
				example, <em>happy teacher</em> (/ˈhæp.i.ˈtiː.tʃə/) in which 
				both the adjective and the noun carry stress.<br />The same is true for the difference between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; senior teacher<br /></em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senior Teacher<br />
			</em>in which the first simply implies age or length of service 
				(so the stress falls on the second item) but the second, 
				capitalised version is a job title and the stress falls on the 
				first item (/ˌsiː.nɪə.ˈtiː.tʃə/ vs. /ˈsiː.nɪə.ˈtiː.tʃə/).<br />And in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; picture frame<br /></em>the stress falls on the first element (/ˈpɪk.tʃə.freɪm/) 
				and that is an indication of a compound rather than a classifier 
				+ noun combination.<br />At the proper compound end of the cline we find items such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; babysitter<br /></em>which is clearly now an accepted compound noun because<br />a) the stress falls on the first element (/ˈbeɪ.bi.ˌsɪ.tə/)<br />b) the item is written as one word (or, by some, hyphenated)<br />Each edition of an English-language dictionary is updated 
				regularly to include combinations of classifier + noun (or, 
				indeed epithet + noun) which have become accepted compounds.&nbsp; 
				For example, terms such as <em>superglue, gaslight, mouseclick, 
				compact disc, hard drive, toner cartridge</em> and many more 
				were originally stressed on the second element with the first 
				acting as an epithet or classifier.&nbsp; As the terms became 
				more familiar, the stress moved to the first element and the 
				orthography often changed from two words <em>via</em> 
				hyphenation to a one-word spelling.<br />Hyphenation is still variable across users of the language and 
				between dictionaries.</p>
			<h4><strong>Plurality is sometimes an issue with compound nouns.</strong></h4>
			<p>One obvious characteristic of compounds is that when they 
			are plural, the plural marker usually falls on the second element so we get, 
			e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>beach huts</em> not <em>*beaches hut</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>child minders </em>not <em>*children minder</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>desk drawers </em>not <em>*desks drawer<br />
			</em>In a lot of cases, of course, the first element is a mass noun 
			which can take no plural so this makes good sense and we find:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>water works<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sugar lumps<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; water board<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<p>Some noun classifiers are, however, irregularly marked for 
			number.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="style_black" style="color: black;">saloon</span><span>&nbsp;</span>car<br />
			</em>but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="style_black" style="color: black;">sport<span class="style_underline" style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>car<br />

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="style_black" style="color: black;">camera</span><span>&nbsp;</span>bag<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="style_black" style="color: black;">complaint</span><span>&nbsp;</span>form<br />

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="style_black" style="color: black;">complaint<span class="style_underline" style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>department<br />
			</em>and so on.<br />
			The way to bet is that they are singular so we have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model car collection</em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>portrait gallery<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; landscape photography</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Learners who do not have parallel structures in their first

			<p>Particularly in the field of English for Academic and English for 
			Business areas, there has quite recently been some interest in the 
			concepts of shell nouns.&nbsp; Briefly, what shell nouns do is to 
			encapsulate ideas in a way that makes the noun itself the shell for 
			a set of propositions.&nbsp; For example in:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>The problem is that too many vehicles use 
			the new bypass causing congestion at peak times so the aim is to 
			limit the traffic by improving and extending alternative routes 
			through the suburbs.</em></p>
			<p>we have two shell nouns, <span class="style_black"><em>problem</em></span> 
			and <span class="style_black"><em>aim</em></span> which respectively 
			encapsulate the propositions of identifying an issue and seeking a 
			solution.<br />
			The shell noun is usually followed by the proposition that it 
			encapsulates linked either with a <em>that-</em>clause (<em>problem</em>) 
			or just a simple copula such as <em>be</em> (<em>aim</em>).<br />
			Shell nouns are usually abstract concepts and come in different 
			flavours (from Schmid, 2018, whose list is more detailed and 
			longer):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Factual<br />
				Factual shell nouns include, e.g., <em>fact, phenomenon, reason, 
				result, proof, sign, difference, similarity, aspect, part, 
				problem, advantage, drawback </em>and so on into which clauses 
				or very much longer stretches of text are conceptualised.</li>
				<li>Mental<br />
				Mental shell nouns include, e.g., <em>idea, theory, mystery, 
				belief, knowledge, view, illusion, doubt, question, disbelief, 
				aim, plan, solution, regret, delight, fear, worry</em> etc.</li>
				<li>Modal<br />
				Modal shell nouns express most kinds of modality:<br />
				Epistemic (related to truth): <em>possibility, danger, truth, 
				reality</em><br />
				Deontic (related to duty): <em>permission, mission, need</em><br />
				Dynamic (related to ability and willingness): <em>ability, 
				capacity, opportunity</em><br />
				If the terms for modality do not seem familiar and you want to 
				know more, try the guide to types of modality, linked in the 
				list of related guides at the end.</li>
				<li>Eventive<br />
				These shell nouns include: <em>event, act, situation, attempt, 
				effort, struggle, priority, trouble, problem, success, mistake, 
				situation, context, position, place, time, way, procedure, 
				provision</em> etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The argument is not that the examples above are <strong>always</strong> 
			shell nouns but that they can act as shell nouns serving to 
			conceptualise things in a way that ordinary content nouns such as
			<em>beach, happiness, hedge, fruit, money, person, teacher, train</em> 
			and so on cannot.<br />
			The use of shell nouns is particularly common is some kinds of 
			academic texts in which the author is concerned to set up a series 
			of propositions under an overall heading of, e.g., <em>reason, 
			problem, theory, outcome, necessity</em> and so on.<br />
			There is a guide to teaching shell nouns in the EAP section of this 
			site, linked below.<br />

			<p>The distinction made above between mass and count nouns is not an 
			absolute, on-off phenomenon.&nbsp; Moreover, it is not a distinction 
			which has any utility in many other languages.&nbsp; Few languages 
			require their speakers to consider mass <em>vs</em>. count 
			properties of a noun before attaching the grammar to it.<br />
			It has been persuasively suggested that the distinction is not a 
			valid one in English because a large number of nouns can be used in 
			both ways.<br />
			There are a number of related ways in which nouns may cross the borders 
			between mass and count characteristics.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>The general and the particularised</strong><br />
				Words such as <em>hair, business, cheese, wine, beer, life, 
				noise, (re)semblance, time</em> etc. are often used as mass nouns but there are 
				occasions when we can singularise the concepts and, indeed, 
				pluralise them.&nbsp; Like this:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder" style="width: 70%">

				Many hundreds of nouns can be used in both general (mass) and 
				particular (count) senses.&nbsp; For example, we can ask about 
				the evolution of <em><strong>a</strong> language</em> (and that 
				is reference to its development) or we can ask about the 
				evolution of <em>language</em> (which is reference to language 
				as a mass concept, not a particular language).<br />
				We can also speak of <em>the atmosphere</em> in an mass way when 
				making reference to the skin of gases around the earth but we 
				can also use the word countably to refer to multiples of 
				atmospheric pressure.</li>
				<li><strong>Distinct meanings</strong><br />
				Some words are polysemous and exhibit different (but connected) 
				meanings in mass- and count-noun use.<br />

				See also the section below on plural and singular differences

				<li><strong>Partitive use</strong><br />

				partitive, to which there is a separate guide linked in the list

				In these cases, it is the partitive which can be made plural or 
				is singular, not the noun itself.<br />
				Partitives may, of course, also be used with count nouns as in, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pile of chairs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three heaps of books</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li><strong>The understood partitive</strong><br />
				In colloquial uses, the partitive is often omitted and the mass 
				noun is used as a count noun which can be singular or plural.&nbsp; 
				This most frequently occurs with typical partitives which refer 
				to the measures of the substance, such as s<em>poonful, pint, 
				glass, bowl, scoop, portion, cup </em>etc., and can be 
				retrieved by the hearer / listener without too much difficulty.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one sugar please<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two or three coffees?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two soups, please<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three teas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A beer, please<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two ice-creams please<br />
				</em>This is not reliable, however, because most mass nouns 
				resist the omission of the partitive and, <strong>when the meaning is as 
				a mass noun</strong>, we cannot have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Three sauces<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A salt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Three strings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Three papers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A bread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Five bacons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Two cakes</em><br />
				etc. even when the partitive is often quite predictable.<br />
				We can, naturally, use many of these as count nouns but here the 
				focus is on their use as mass nouns.</li>
				<li><strong>The understood mass use</strong><br />
				We know from our knowledge of the article system that a singular 
				mass noun cannot stand without a determiner so while we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His house was expensive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was sold<br />
				</em>etc., we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *House was sold<br />
				</em>We also know that this restriction does not apply to mass 
				nouns so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Housing was expensive<br />
				</em>as well as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The housing was expensive.<br />
				</em>It follows, therefore, that if someone uses a usually count 
				noun in the singular without an article or other determiner, the 
				understanding is that a mass use is meant<br />
				So for example, if we say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An apple would be a good addition to this<br />
				</em>we are using the noun <em>apple</em> in its usual 
				count-noun guise, but if we say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apple would be a good addition to this<br />
				</em>we clearly intend that <em>apple</em> is understood as a 
				mass noun.</li>
				<li><strong>Classifiers</strong><br />
				An alternative way in which mass nouns may be made count nouns 
				is, instead of the use of a pluralised partitive, to use the 
				noun as a classifier.<br />
				For example, although the words <em>coffee, gold </em>and <em>
				water</em> are generally considered and most frequently used as 
				mass nouns, they can occur in the following mass-noun uses:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two coffee cups<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three gold bars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A single water jug</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				When count nouns act as classifiers like this they are, 
				naturally, functioning quasi-adjectivally rather than as nominal 
				items in their own right.</li>
				<li><strong>Hyponymy</strong><br />
				Often, superordinates or hypernyms are mass nouns while the hyponyms which 
				they subsume are count nouns so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>housing</strong>: house, flat, 
				room, bedsit, mansion, palace, villa </em>etc.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>equipment</strong>: tool, oil, 
				pipe, saw, screwdriver</em> etc.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>gear</strong>: rucksack, tent, 
				water carrier, groundsheet </em>etc.<br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li><strong>Alternative count nouns</strong><br />
				It is often possible in English to select a synonymous count 
				noun in place of a mass noun so we encounter pairs such as:<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder" cellspacing="1">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style68" style="width: 50%">Mass nouns</td>

				</table>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Changes over time</strong><br />
				Language is not static so over time and some nouns have managed to 
				shift from mass to count or<em> vice versa</em>.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>wages</em> was once a mass noun but the singular form is now 
				encountered frequently and the noun is treated as a count noun 
				(the King James Bible [circa 1611] has, Romans 6, 23,
				<span class="style_black"><em>the wages of sin is death</em></span>).<br />
				<em>accommodation</em> was once a count noun with a plural in 
				common use but now usually occurs as a mass noun.&nbsp; The 
				plural form is also in use in other meanings.<br />
				<em>mathematics</em> and <em>physics</em> were both count nouns 
				originally but are now treated as mass nouns and <em>history</em> 
				is now a mass noun when applied to an academic subject but still 
				a count noun when referring to particular types or versions of history 
				as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his bookshelf were four histories of 
				the Crusades.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here is a list of most of the most common and troublesome mass 
			nouns in English.&nbsp; It's not complete and many, such as <em>
			wood, kindness, fire, work, weight, damage, travel</em> and so on, 
			can be used with or without different meanings as count nouns.<br />

			<p>The terms <strong>countable</strong> and <strong>uncountable
			</strong>nouns are sometimes used for the categories above.&nbsp; While this may be helpful for some purposes, 
			the terms are misleading.<br />
			For example, <em>money</em> is a 
			mass noun we can count and almost all mass nouns can be made count 
			nouns by the use of a partitive:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a slice of cake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bit of 
			cheese<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a piece of information<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three quarters of the loaf of bread<br />
			</em>or measures<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pound of sugar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pint of ale, a kilo of oil</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			As we shall see below, the determiner and article systems for mass 
			and count nouns are also different so it is a distortion to describe 
			mass nouns as singular.<br />
			By the same token, it is arguably advisable to tell our learners 
			about count and mass <strong>uses</strong> rather than count and 
			mass <strong>nouns</strong> because, as we saw above, that's nearer 
			the truth of the matter.&nbsp; We should be careful not to mislead.</p>

			<p>
			Certain forms of nouns (and other word classes such as adjectives) 
			may be described as marked insofar as they are differentiated from 
			the form which is usual and taken for granted.&nbsp; For example,</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>kitchen</em> and <em>book</em> are unmarked but <em>
				kitchenette</em> and <em>booklet</em> are marked for size</li>
				<li><em>table</em> and <em>mouse</em> are unmarked but <em>
				tables</em> and <em>mice</em> are marked for number (see below)</li>
				<li><em>goose</em> and <em>chicken</em> are unmarked but <em>
				gander</em>, <em>cockerel</em> and <em>hen</em> are marked for 
				gender</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is unfashionable to use gender markings on many nouns so 
			the use of, e.g., the <em>-ess</em> ending to denote females 
			(<em>manageress, stewardess</em> etc.) and the use of specific nouns for female 
			and male people is deprecated, so we now prefer <em>police 
			officer</em> for <em>policewoman / man</em> etc.&nbsp; Sometimes, 
			however, the gender distinction is unavoidable.<br />There are two types:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>unmarked forms</strong></dt>
				<dd>In these nouns, it is not possible by inspecting the 
				morphology to see which sex is meant:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bachelor &ndash; spinster </em>(although <em>bachelor girl</em> (rather than 
				<em>*spinster boy</em>) is heard with a preference now for the 
				adjective as in <em>single person / man / woman</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sister &ndash; brother<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				mother &ndash; father<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				aunt &ndash; uncle<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				lady &ndash; gentleman<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				queen &ndash; king<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				woman &ndash; man<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nun – monk</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>marked forms</strong></dt>
				<dd>In these words, the marking is made morphologically, usually 
				with the suffix <em>-ess</em> but not invariably, so the sex difference 
				can be seen:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bridegroom &ndash; bride</em> (unusual in that the male form is 
				marked)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				duke &ndash; duchess<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				emperor &ndash; empress<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				god &ndash; goddess<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				hero &ndash; heroine<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				host &ndash; hostess<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				widower &ndash; widow </em>(unusual in that the male form is marked)</dd>
				
			</dl>
			<p>
			A large group of nouns referring to people remains unmarked for 
			gender (and the list grows as words like <em>actress</em> and <em>
			hostess</em> fall out of favour).&nbsp; There is, for example, no 
			distinction in:<br />
			<em>artist, person, chair(man), guest, professor, criminal, speaker, 
			child, vet, consultant, freelancer, doctor, novelist, parent, teacher</em> and many more.</p>
			<p>
			Occasionally, it is necessary to insert a marker for gender if the 
			sense requires a distinction to be made so we get:<br />
			<em>male nurse, man servant, woman friend, girl Friday</em> and so on.<br />
			As people become more sensitive to connotation, these terms, too, 
			are falling out of fashion.</p>
			<p>
			Gender marking or its absence is irrational in English (why is there 
			not, e.g., a <em>guestess</em> or a <em>criminaless</em>?) and the suffixes are 
			unproductive so no new forms appear.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>domesticated or 'higher' animals</strong></dt>
				<dd>There are no political or social pressures acting on nouns 
				for animals (providing they are of the higher sort) so we have, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buck &ndash; doe<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				bull &ndash; cow<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				cock &ndash; hen<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				gander &ndash; goose<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				stallion &ndash; mare<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				tiger &ndash; tigress<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				lion &ndash; lioness</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>non-domesticated or 'lower' animals</strong></dt>
				<dd>Lower animals, i.e., those with which we feel no particular affinity 
			or are not normally domesticated, do not usually take any kind of 
			sex marking although terms such as <em>dog-otter</em> are available 
			for people to whom it might matter.</dd>

				and in all these cases the final /f/ is replaced by /vz/<br />
			etc.<br />
				However, the plural of <em>roof</em> is seen 
			both as <em>roofs</em> and <em>?rooves</em> (and differently 
			pronounced).&nbsp; The word <em>wharf</em> also has two acceptable 
				plural forms, <em>wharves</em> and <em>wharfs</em>, as does <em>
				dwarf</em>.&nbsp; The status of <em>oaf</em> changing to <em>
				oaves</em> is unclear.<br />
				Other nouns ending in /f/ do not alter the morphology so we get, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>cliff – cliffs<br />
				muff – muffs<br />
				proof – proofs<br />
				gulf – gulfs</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>Older English plurals<br />
				A small number of nouns have retained older English plural forms involving 
			a change to the vowel (ablaut) or an ending other than a simple <em>-s</em> or <em>-es</em> 
			suffix.&nbsp; They include words like<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style109">
					<tr>
						<td><em>child – children<br />
						die – dice<br />
			foot – feet<br />
						goose – geese<br />
						louse – lice<br />mouse – mice</em></td>
						<td><em>man – men<br />
						ox – oxen<br />
						penny – pence </em>(or <em>pennies</em>)<br /><em>person – people<br />
						tooth – teeth<br />
						woman – women</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				which simply have to be learned and taught 
			individually.&nbsp; That is, by the way, almost a complete list.<br />
				Sometimes a phenomenon known as suppletion is at work here: the 
				derivations of the singular and plural nouns are different so 
				the words look unconnected.&nbsp; The word <em>person</em> is 
				derived from Old French but the word <em>people</em> is a later 
				derivation from a different French word.<br />
				This also accounts for the plural of <em>cow</em> being <em>
				cattle</em>.</li>
				<li>Zero-marked plurals<br />
				Some nouns have no marking in the plural (a &Oslash; plural) but the plural still exists.  These often 
				(not always) refer to animals:<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style109">
					<tr>
						<td><em>(air)craft<br />
						bison<br />
						deer<br />
						elk<br />
						fish<br />
						grouse</em></td>
						<td><em>lobster<br />
						moose<br />
						salmon<br />
						sheep<br />
						shrimp<br />
						trout</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				Some of these words do take regular plurals when we are 
				considering small numbers of identifiable entities:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; six fishes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two shrimps</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				but some resist any kind of plural marking.<br />
				Note: These are all count nouns and should not be confused with 
				mass nouns which take no plural.&nbsp; No plural form is not the 
				same thing as a zero plural form.</li>
				<li>Invariable unmarked plurals<br />
				A few words in English are always plural but take no inflexion to show 
				it.&nbsp; Examples are:<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style109">
					<tr>
						<td><em>cattle<br />
						clergy<br />
						folk<br />
						gentry</em></td>
						<td><em>people<br />
						police<br />
						poultry<br />
						vermin</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				Again, these are unmarked plural forms of countable nouns, not 
				mass nouns.</li>

			<p>
			A much larger group of 'irregular' plurals are loan words from 
			Latin, French, Italian and Greek (and a few from Hebrew).&nbsp; In many of 
			these cases, the plural form of the original language is often 
			preferred but there is a clear tendency to Anglicise the forms.&nbsp; 
			These are often described as irregular plurals but they are not.&nbsp; 
			They are simply following the regular plural-forming conventions of 
			the languages from which they have been borrowed.<br />
			The way to bet is to impose the English plural system on imports but 
			that is not always the safest procedure.&nbsp; When both the 
			original language form and the English plural is available, the 
			former is usually preferred in technical and formal writing.<br />

				<em>graffiti</em> (singular <em>graffito</em>)<br /><em>paparazzi</em> (singular <em>paparazzo</em>)<br />
				<em>spaghetti</em> (singular <em>spaghetto</em>)<br />

			<em><span class="style_black">... use[s] the singular verb with

			But we prefer the plural use for couple, family, music groups, and

			<p>While there are certainly some irregularities and idiomatic uses 
			of nouns with their articles and determiners much can be explained 
			more usefully and rationally as count nouns being used as mass nouns.&nbsp; 
			The easy fall-back position taken in too many grammars written for 
			learners and some coursebooks is that these uses are 'exceptions' 
			which must be learned individually.&nbsp; They are not.<br />
			What they actually are is count nouns being conceptualised for the 
			nature of the <strong>underlying meaning</strong> rather than their <strong>
			number</strong> and used, therefore, in the same way as mass nouns.&nbsp; We may have <em>two feet</em> and <em>two 
			hands</em> but we come to work <em>on foot</em> and make things <em>
			by hand</em>.&nbsp; Other examples include:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Institutions:</dt>
				<dd><em>go to / be:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in: bed / church / university / school / hospital / 
			court / prison / business</em> etc.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at: work</em></dd>
				<dt>Transport:</dt>
				<dd><em>travel / arrive / come by:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bus / plane / car / air / bicycle / sea / 
			ship</em> etc.</dd>
				<dt>Times:</dt>
				<dd class="auto-style3"><em>happen:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by: day / night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at: dawn / sunset / dusk / twilight / Christmas / Easter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in: summer / autumn / winter / spring</em></dd>
				<dt>Prepositional phrases:</dt>
				<dd><em>happen / be:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at: risk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by: arrangement / accident / chance / contrast / mistake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in: addition / advance / case / effect / fact / favour / 
				opposition<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on: account / call / demand / oath</em></dd>
				<dt>Binomial idioms:</dt>
				<dd><em>day to day, door to door, heart to heart,&nbsp;face to 
				face, shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, hand in glove, hand in 
				hand, head over heels, man and boy</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt>Verb + noun collocations:</dt>
				<dd><em>lose heart, make conversation, take part, pay attention, 
				give way, talk shop, spend time, save trouble, take offence, 
				take root, take place, catch fire, do wrong</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>All of these are simply <strong>unmarked</strong> uses of count 
			nouns used in idiomatic expressions rather than exceptions to be 
			learned individually.<br />
