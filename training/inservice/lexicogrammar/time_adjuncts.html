			<h1>Time adjuncts</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="time" height="207" src="../../images/clock_waiting310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Time adjuncts get their own guide because this is a complex area 
			of English grammar which is the source of much error and unnatural 
			language produced by learners of English.<br />
			Partly, this is because the area is simply complex and difficult to 
			learn and partly because languages differ in how they conceptualise 
			and cut up time.</p>
			<p>This guide only considers adjuncts and will include prepositional 
			phrases, adverbs and nouns acting adverbially.&nbsp; Here 
			are some examples of what's considered below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>adverbs<br />
				<em>She arrived </em> <span class="style_black"><em>recently</em></span><br /><em>They spoke </em> <span class="style_black"><em>briefly</em></span>
				<span class="style_black"><em>afterwards</em></span></li>
				<li>prepositional phrases<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Since the mid-60s</em></span><em>, people have 
				been visiting the island<br />
				He has lived here </em> <span class="style_black"><em>for ages</em></span></li>
				<li>noun phrases:<br />
				<em>We had a meeting<span class="style_black"> that </span> </em> <span class="style_black"><em>Monday</em></span><br /><em>We stayed <span class="style_black">all </span> </em> <span class="style_black"><em>week</em></span><br />
				(For our purposes below, noun phrases will mostly be referred to 
				simply as adverbials or as the complements in prepositional phrases as appropriate.)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Not included here are subordinate time clauses, except in 
			passing, and they include, for example, structures such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_black">When I had finished lunch</span>, 
			I took the dog for a walk<br />
			</em>At the end, there is link to a guide to tenses in subordinate 
			clauses.</p>
		<p>We are only considering 
		adverbial adjuncts in what follows, i.e., adjuncts which modify verb 
		phrases.&nbsp; Adjuncts can also modify, for 
		example, noun phrases as in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument after dinner was soon settled</em><br />
		in which the adjunct, <em>after dinner, </em>modifies the noun phrase
		<em>the argument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was very happy</em><br />
		in which the adjunct <em>very</em> modifies the adjective <em>happy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove too quickly</em><br />
		in which the adjunct <em>too</em> modifies the adverb <em>quickly</em>.<br />
		The technical terms for these sorts of adjuncts are, respectively, 
		adnomial, adadjectival and adadverbial but those are not terms which 
		should delay you or your learners.</p>

			</table>
			<p>There is no profession-wide agreement on how time adverbials can be 
			divided.&nbsp; This analysis draws on three attempts (all different) 
			and there are lots more to choose from.<br />
			The most primitive (and arguably least useful) distinction is to 
			divide the area into two categories:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Adverbials which say <strong>when</strong> something happens, happened, exists 
				or existed<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrived yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She cleans daily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have paid the bill already</em></li>
				<li>Adverbials which say <strong>how often</strong> something happens, happened, 
				exists or existed<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never went to school by bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The post arrives daily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He frequently shops at the supermarket<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They scarcely ever have much time for holidays</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is some logic to a crude division like this because of the 
			position in a sentence that the adverbials can occupy.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Group 1 adverbials normally prefer the end position or can be fronted 
			so we can have:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, she visited her aunt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She visited her aunt yesterday</em><br />but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She yesterday visited her aunt</em><br />or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She visited yesterday her aunt</em></li>
				<li>Group 2 adverbials are different.&nbsp; There are two sorts 
				of these:<ol class="auto-style18">
					<li>Adverbials of definite (i.e., measurable) frequency<br />
					occur most commonly in the final position in a clause so we 
					see, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car is serviced yearly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train leaves hourly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bus arrives at 8 every day</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>Adverbials of indefinite (i.e., not measurable or 
					approximate) frequency<br />
					can occupy the 
			end position but most frequently occur with the verbs (before main 
			verbs, after auxiliaries).&nbsp; They can be fronted for emphasis 
			but that is not their normal position at all.&nbsp; When the 
					adverbial is a phrase, it usually occupies end position so, 
					we can have, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She frequently works too hard<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often, I think of retiring<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have almost never taken the offer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She argues with her sister 
				from time to time</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They can usually be relied on</em><br />but not:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They went frequently out in the evening</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For learners of the language, especially at elementary levels, 
			that is a clear and accessible distinction which covers many 
			eventualities.<br />
			For teachers, however, for whom this part of the site is written, it 
			won't do, because it would exclude some quite usual forms, such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have already arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went again to the manager to complain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I immediately phoned the police</em><br />
			and so on.&nbsp; These forms are allowable because the adverbial 
			time adjunct is a proper adverb rather than a prepositional phrase.&nbsp; 
			We cannot put prepositional or noun phrases in the same position in the 
			clause because that produces the unacceptable (or marginally 
			acceptable):<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *They have at this moment arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?They went at 6 o'clock to the manager<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I that evening telephoned the police</em></p>
			<p>A related issue is that virtually all time adverbials can, for 
			special emphasis, be placed in the initial position in a sentence so 
			we allow a huge range including:<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Briefly, they spoke about the issue</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I want to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarcely ever do we watch TV<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my holiday, I went to museum<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, I spent all the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the war, she has lived alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly always, I take the bus</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			For the sake of the analysis below (and your sanity) we will not 
			analyse these forms separately but simply note here that <strong>the initial 
			position is almost always possible </strong>but it serves to place emphasis 
			on the adverbial.&nbsp; It marks it, in other words.<br />
			So, when you encounter a rule below, add mentally:<span class="style_black"><em> 
			except where the speaker / writer chooses to front the adverbial for 
			effect</em></span>.</p>
			<p>Here's a more complicated arrangement which we will 
			use here:<br />
			<img alt="time" height="227" src="../../imagesgraphics/time_adjuncts.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>Don't worry, more explanation of the terms in that diagram 
			follows.<br />
			This is not a classification that everyone would support and 
			certainly not suggested here as a way forward for all considerations 
			of analysing the area.<br />
			However, it is based on principle and, moreover, is a practical way 
			of approaching the topic in the classroom rather than from the 
			perspective of a grammarian.<br />
			The shortcomings of this (and any other attempt to classify a 
			slippery area) will become apparent.</p>

			</table>
			<p><strong>Website warning:</strong><br />
			Out here on the web, you will encounter lists of time adjuncts which 
			promiscuously mix up adverbs proper (such as <em>now, then </em>
			etc.) and prepositional phrases (such as <em>in the morning, after 
			work</em> etc.) and sometimes noun phrases acting adverbially (such 
			as <em>the following week, today, Tuesday</em> etc..&nbsp; Usually, they are simply all classified as 
			adverbs rather than the correct term, adverbials.<br />
			That way madness lies because prepositional phrases, noun phrases and adverbs 
			often have different syntactical properties and occur in different 
			parts of clauses.<br />
			If you don't distinguish in the classroom (although it is not 
			usually necessary to bother learners with the metalanguage), then 
			you will encourage errors such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He from time to time comes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They monthly meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She had the previous week left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They at six left</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Errors like those can be teacher induced simply by failing to 
			analyse what is quite a simple distinction.<br />
			Word and phrase class is important.</p>
			<p>Prepositional phrases, because they contain a complement (usually 
			a noun phrase) are an open class because there is in theory no limit to 
			the number of nouns in any language.&nbsp; We can make up new nouns 
			to represent new ideas.&nbsp; For example, until recently, the 
			expression <em>during the telethon</em>, was an unknown and 
			incomprehensible time adjunct prepositional phrase.&nbsp; No longer.</p>
			<p>Adverbs are also an open class of words but <strong>time</strong> 
			adverbs are a different matter and it is theoretically possible 
			to come up with an exhaustive list of all the time adverbs in 
			English.&nbsp; The list wouldn't be very long and would include at 
			least:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">afterwards, again, ago, already, always, 
			annually, before, before, beforehand, biannually etc., briefly, 
			constantly, constantly, continually, continuously, daily, earlier, 
			early, enduringly, eternally, eventually, ever, finally, first, 
			first etc., firstly etc., forever, formerly, fortnightly, 
			frequently, generally, hourly, incessantly, infrequently, just, 
			last, lastingly, late, lately, later, momentarily, monthly, never, 
			next, nightly, non-stop, normally, now, occasionally, off and on, 
			often, once, once in a while, originally, permanently, persistently, previously, 
			provisionally, quarterly, rarely, recently, regularly, 
			repeatedly, seldom, since, sometimes, soon, still, subsequently, temporarily, 
			then, today, tomorrow, tonight, twice, usually, weekly, yearly, 
			yesterday, yet</p>

			<p>Adverbs (and other adverbials including prepositional and noun phrases) 
			which signal when in time something occurred are a relatively small 
			closed group of words and structures.&nbsp; They include the words 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>in black</strong></span> in this set of 
			examples:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrived <span class="style_black"><strong>this morning</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left <span class="style_black"><strong>at 6</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrived <span class="style_black"><strong>in the afternoon</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They left <span class="style_black"><strong>before the end</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to stop <span class="style_black"><strong>now</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He left <span class="style_black"><strong>then</strong></span></em></p>
			<p>The adverbs proper in this group, from the opening list above 
			include:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>ago, late, now, 
			then, today, tomorrow, tonight, yesterday</em></span></p>
			<p>Of these, <em>ago</em> is unusual in that it acts prepositionally, 
			demanding a noun-phrase complement but the complement <strong>
			precedes</strong> it so we have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; three weeks ago</em><br />
			not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *ago three weeks</em><br />
			It is often classified as an adverb in many grammars but is 
			unusual in that it cannot stand alone.<br />
			On this site, we consider it a postposition.&nbsp; That is to say, 
			it functions like an ordinary preposition but it follows rather than 
			precedes its complement.</p>
			<p>The adverb <em>then</em> in this list functions to mean <em>at that 
			time</em> but can also be a sequencer to express the ordering of 
			events (see below).<br />
			The words <em>today, tomorrow, tonight, yesterday</em> are often 
			classified as nouns (and so they are in some circumstances such as
			<em>Yesterday was lovely</em>) and the list could be extended 
			(because nouns are an open class) to include <em>yesterday evening, 
			the coming week, the night before last</em> and so on.</p>
			
			<p>The worthwhile teaching point here is that adverbials which 
			refer to an explicit and definite time are most comfortable and most 
			frequently found at the end of the clause.&nbsp; It is, naturally, 
			possible in some cases to place them in the middle of the clauses so 
			we might allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want now to stop</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He then left</em><br />
			but this is rare and rarity implies that the item is marked for some 
			special emphasis.</p>
			<p>Moreover, we do not allow prepositional phrases to do 
			this:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He this morning arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She at 6 left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They in the afternoon arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They before the end left<br />
			</em>because prepositional phrase time adverbials, as opposed to time 
			adverbs, cannot occupy the middle position in a clause and are 
			normally confined to the end or initial position.</p>
			<p>The simple rule of thumb is:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Time adverbials referring to specific moments 
			in time or to defined periods are placed at the end of the clause 
			unless a special meaning is intended.<br />
			All time adverbial prepositional phrases are terminal (or initial 
			for emphasis).</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style16">
					<h3>Duration</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are two basic duration categories:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Adverbials denoting the length of time<br />
				These are related semantically to the set above of explicit time 
				expressions, so we can have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked from 6 till 11<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spoke briefly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They briefly consulted the timetable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They lived there permanently<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stayed awhile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stayed for a year<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She worked all the following week<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was temporarily unemployed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was momentarily stunned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lived here during the 60s<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lived here during her university course<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left here months ago<br />
				</em>All these examples refer to a finished action in the past so the 
				verb tense reflects that.<br />Prepositional-phrase adverbials 
				and noun phrases like 
				<em>for a year, all month, last year</em> etc. must 
				take the end position but adverbs ending in -<em>ly</em>, such 
				as <em>momentarily, temporarily</em> and <em>briefly</em> can come before the main 
				verb in a medial position.&nbsp; The safest bet for learners is to 
				place them at the end.<br />
				The rogue here is <em>ago</em> because it is a postposition and 
				follows rather than precedes the noun-phrase complement.<br />There is a group of adverbs which fulfil the function of 
				expressing the duration of an event or state and the list 
				includes:<p class="auto-style72"><span class="style_black"><em>awhile, briefly, constantly, continually, 
				continuously, enduringly, eternally, forever, incessantly, 
				lastingly, momentarily, non-stop, permanently, persistently, 
				provisionally, repeatedly, temporarily</em></span></p>
				but some of these adverbs also carry other meanings (of 
				irritation, determination etc.).&nbsp; When they do, they follow 
				the same rules as for other adverbs of manner (see the general 
				guide to adverbs linked in the list of related guides at the end, for more).</li>
				<li value="2">Adverbials expressing the sense of <em>up to this moment<br />
				</em>Again, there is a limited range:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lived here since 1998<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lately been working on a new project<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have recently got married<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has worked hard this month<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been doing that a lot recently<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been here for a month</em><br />
				The adverbs <em>lately</em> and <em>recently</em> refer to a recent undefined period 
				but strongly imply that the action or state is ongoing.<br />
				Noun phrases acting adverbially always take the end position.<br />
				In prepositional phrases, only <em>since</em> pins the beginning 
				to a specific time and only <em>for</em> is used to express the 
				length of time.<br />
				The preposition <em>during</em> is covered above under the first 
				set and it makes little sense to include it in the teaching of 
				words such as <em>for</em> and <em>since</em> because it 
				operates so differently.<br />
				Note that <em>since</em> is also included in the list of adverbs 
				because it can act as one in expressions such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw him last Thursday but not <span class="style_black">
				since</span></em><br />
				When it fulfils this up-to-now function, it always occurs at the 
				end of a phrase and is probably better analysed as a preposition 
				with an ellipted complement such as <em>then</em> or <em>that time</em>.<br />
				A prepositional phrase adverbial must take the end 
				position but adverbs proper can appear medially or in end position.&nbsp; 
				The safest bet for learners is to place them at the end.<br />
				Some of these adjuncts are discussed again below under the category of 
				Relational adjuncts because they serve to relate two times and 
				two states or events to each other.</li>

					<h3>Definite frequency</h3>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are two related and syntactically similar types of 
			adverbial which indicate definite frequency:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To express the period of the frequency, adverbs with -<em>ly</em> 
				suffixes are the usual forms:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trains leave hourly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pay my road tax monthly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We meet annually<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill is sent out quarterly</em><br />
				These <span class="style_underline">always</span> take end 
				position in the clause.</li>
				<li>To express the frequency of an event, prepositional and noun 
				phrases are common:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We meet three times a year<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We did it four times<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was late on five occasions</em><br />
				but adverbs can also be used<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They did it twice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They argued again and again</em><br />
				These also <span class="style_underline">always</span> occupy 
				the end position in the clause.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>From the list above, adverbs which fall into the category of 
			definite frequency include:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>annually, biannually etc., daily, 
			fortnightly, hourly, monthly, nightly, quarterly, weekly, yearly</em></span></p>
			<p>and many are derived from nouns although none derives from <em>decade</em> or <em>century</em>.</p>

			<h3>Indefinite frequency</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Indefinite frequency is indicated by what in other analyses and 
			some books for learners are called adverbs of frequency.<br />
			Semantically this group can be divided into 4 sections:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The usual:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has generally eaten there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I normally hate travelling by tube<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She habitually argues with me</em></li>
				<li>The continuous or iterative (repeated):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has constantly interfered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They continually complain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is perpetually late for work</em></li>
				<li>The frequent:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I regularly take a bus to work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She frequently talks to her dogs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They often eat out</em></li>
				<li>The infrequent (or absent):<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I rarely go to the cinema<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has never complained<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seldom meet him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will periodically take time off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They meet from time to time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He works off and on</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>When the adverb adjuncts co-occur with other time adjuncts, the 
			medial position is required or more natural:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go to the cinema frequently on Saturdays</em><br />
			is allowable but less natural than<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I frequently go to the cinema on Saturdays</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?They come occasionally late</em><br />
			is very unnatural compared with<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They occasionally come late</em></p>
			<p>Adverbs from the list above which fall into the category of 
			indefinite frequency include:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black">
			<span class="auto-style17">Single words:</span><br /><em>always, 
			constantly, ever, frequently, generally, infrequently, never, 
			normally, occasionally, often, 
			regularly, seldom, sometimes, regularly, usually<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style17">Phrases:</span><br /><em>at times, every so often, from time to time, now and again, off and 
			on, on and off, on occasion, once in a while</em></span></p>
			<p>The adverb <em>ever</em> is the odd one out because it is a 
			non-assertive form only appearing in negative and interrogative clauses.&nbsp; 
			We allow, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you ever see her?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't ever seen her</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have ever seen her</em><br />
			The multi-word adverbs, like <em>off and on</em>, take the end position in clauses and cannot 
			appear before the verb.&nbsp; In that sense they are akin to 
			prepositional phrases such as <em>from time to time </em>which can 
			only appear terminally.<br />
			Noun phrases cannot refer to indefinite frequency but appear often 
			as the complements of prepositions in, e.g., <em>with constant 
			repetition, with annoying frequency, at all times</em> etc.</p>
			<p>All four of the indefinite groups share a syntactic pattern:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Single word adverbs in this category are 
			usually placed before the main verb but after any auxiliary verb and the 
			verbs <span class="auto-style17">be</span> and 
			<span class="auto-style17">have</span>.<br />
			These adverbs can also be used in the end position but that is 
			slightly rarer.<br />
			Co-occurrence with other time adverbials usually forces medial 
			position.<br />
			Prepositional phrases, noun phrases or multi-word adverbs
			<span class="style_underline">always</span> take end position.</p>

			<h4>A note on tenses:</h4>
			<p>English has two fundamental tense forms which are reflected in 
			the structures with which the tenses combine and that applies 
			especially to time adjuncts.&nbsp; These two tense types are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Absolute tenses</strong><br />
				These refer to specific times in the past, present or future.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went to London last Monday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were eating when the postman arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will take the 4-o'clock train tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They applauded loudly at the end of the performance and went 
				on clapping for over 5 minutes</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Adjuncts of both time and duration, <em>yesterday, at 6 
				o'clock, for an hour, tomorrow</em> etc., 
				are naturally used with absolute tenses, <em>went, will go, were 
				playing</em> etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Relational tenses</strong><br />
				These relate two times together and are, traditionally, referred 
				to as perfect aspect forms.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He had already finished the work by the time I arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Mary hasn't shown up yet, we'll put the meeting off for an 
				hour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time you arrive I'll already have left</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				With relational meanings we need to deploy somewhat different 
				time adjuncts.&nbsp; This is not because the time adjuncts 
				require these particular tense forms, as is often averred in 
				coursebooks and grammars for learners, but because the function 
				of the tense forms is to relate times to each other and that 
				leads to the adjuncts which are appropriate to the function.<br />
				To suggest, for example, that the adverb <em>already</em> 
				demands a perfect tense form is to get the direction of 
				causation the wrong way around.&nbsp; It is in the nature of 
				relational tense forms that they require adverbials which are 
				semantically appropriate.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are two sorts of relational time adverbials.</p>

					<td class="auto-style16">
					<h3>Linking events and states</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Some of these have been covered above because categories overlap.&nbsp; 
			The adverbials that link times together and, therefore relate tenses 
			to each other are exemplified here (<span class="style_black"><strong><em>in
			</em></strong>
			<em><strong>black</strong></em></span>).&nbsp; The normal linkage occurs between:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A past event 
			or moment in time and the present</li>
				<li>The future and beyond the future</li>
				<li>The past and before the past</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have <span class="style_black">
				<strong>already</strong></span> 
			finished the project</em><br />which embeds the past (the work is done) 
				in the present (no more 
			work needs to be done).</li>
				<li>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He hadn't arrived </em>
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>yet</strong></em></span><em> 
			so we couldn't start</em><br />which embeds the time before the past (his non-arrival) 
				in the past 
			(the inability to start).</li>
				<li>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She </em><span class="style_black">
				<em><strong>still</strong></em></span><em> 
			hasn't told her father, so he's is in the dark</em><br />which 
				embeds the past (not telling her father) in the present (he 
			is now in the dark).</li>
				<li>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They will have opened the new road 
				</em><span class="style_black"><em><strong>by the time</strong></em></span><em> you move 
			here</em><br />which embeds the future (opening the road) in the time after the 
			future (moving house).</li>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been trying to contact you 
				</em><span class="style_black"><em><strong>since</strong></em></span><em> Friday but you 
			are always out</em><br />which embeds the past (attempted contact) 
				in the present 
			(habitually absent).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Prepositional phrases with <em>since</em> are marginal in this 
			respect and probably better analysed under duration (above) because 
			that is their key sense.</p>
			<p>Adverbs which fall into this category from the list above 
			include:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">already, before, early, earlier, eventually, 
			just, lately, recently, since, soon, still, later, next, previously, 
			yet</p>
			<p>There are issues with <strong>assertion and non-assertion</strong> 
			with <em>still, already</em> and <em>yet</em>, insofar as <em>already</em> is an assertive form 
			and <em>yet</em> and <em>still</em> are non-assertive, appearing in questions and 
			negative statements:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She still hasn't done it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has he done it yet?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you still here?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They've already arrived</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p>The position of relational adjuncts is quirky and needs careful 
			handling in the classroom:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style18">
				<li><em>already </em>and<em> yet<br />
				</em>these are adverbs and, as is common for the word class, 
				often occupy a medial position before the main verb but after 
				auxiliaries rather like indefinite frequency adjuncts (above).<br />
				They can also appear at the end of the clause so both<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She has already made dinner</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She has made dinner already</em><br />
				are possible although the end position gives the adjunct greater 
				weight and the medial position is more frequent.<br />
				Equally, however,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They haven't yet done it</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They haven't done it yet</em><br />
				are both acceptable but the end position is the more natural in 
				informal language.</li>
				<li><em>still</em><br />
				is an adverb and confined to a medial position immediately after 
				the subject when used non-assertively.&nbsp; So,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She still can't see the point</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can she still be here?</em><br />
				is acceptable but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She can't still see the point<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She can't see the point still</em><br />
				are not.<br />
				Assertively, however, there are variations so:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may be old but I can still hold a glass 
				straight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will still be there when you arrive</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's working still</em><br />
				are acceptable and follow the same syntactical pattern as <em>
				already</em>, <em>recently</em> and <em>lately</em>.</li>
				<li><em>by</em> and <em>by the time</em><br />
				are prepositional and
				frequently appear as pseudo-conjunctions.&nbsp; They are confined to 
				the end position of the first clause.&nbsp; Otherwise, they 
				simply take the end position because they are prepositional 
				phrases.&nbsp; So,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'll have repaired it by the time you 
				need it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She'll have got there by now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll have been working on this for six hours by 10 o'clock</em><br />
				are all acceptable but other positions for the adjuncts are 
				not normally possible:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They'll have by the time you need it 
				repaired it </em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She'll have by now got there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We'll have by ten o'clock been working on this for six hours<br />
				</em>are all unacceptable.</li>
				<li><em>since</em><br />
				is also prepositional and assumes it place in the phrase at the end of the 
				clause so,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been waiting for a taxi since half 
				past three</em><br />
				is fine but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have been since half past three 
				waiting</em><br />
				is not.<br />
				See above for the times when <em>since</em> acts like an adverb 
				without a complement.</li>

			</table>
			<p>The other form of relational adjuncts serves to link events in 
			time (by, usually, making it clear what happened first).&nbsp; Unlike 
			the relational forms, they do not necessarily connect times 
			together; they link events and states so are frequently found with 
			absolute rather than relational tense forms.<br />
			They are often conjuncts rather than adjuncts proper because they 
			function to link events or actions between sentences or clauses.<br />
			In this group come the adverbs and prepositional phrases, <em>
			firstly, then, at first, in second place </em>etc., which are often referred to as 
			sequencers (imaginatively).<br />
			Noun phrases are rarer in this function but nominalised clauses such
			<em>the second part of the procedure is , the last thing to do is
			</em>etc. do occur.</p>
			<p>Here are some examples of common 
			uses of sequencing adverbials:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had dinner before me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spoke afterwards<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing that needs to be done is get the facts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spoke after the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before 6, he had finished<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, he fed the cat, then he fed himself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, we ran out of time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came from America originally</em><br />
			A sub-set of sequencing adjuncts includes those that refer to 
			repetition of an action:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did it three times<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's lost it again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As before, he wasn't believed</em></p>
			<p>Adverbs which fall into the category of sequencers from the list 
			above include:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">afterwards, again, before, beforehand, 
			finally, first, second etc., firstly, secondly etc., formerly, last, 
			lastly, later, once, originally, subsequently, then</p>
			<p><strong>Position</strong>:<br />
			These adjuncts can be adverbs, nominalised clauses or prepositional phrases and they 
			almost always occupy initial or end positions.&nbsp; They are 
			slightly unusual because, as was noted at the outset, the initial 
			position, while being a possible position for all adjuncts, usually 
			emphasises the adjunct in some way.&nbsp; In the case of sequencers, 
			which are often conjuncts, 
			this is less marked because initial position is the canonical or 
			normal one.</p>

			<p>We can coordinate time adjuncts but only when they serve the same 
			function.&nbsp; We cannot produce coordinated phrases 
			when there is a mismatch between the functions of the items and 
			retain naturalness.</p>
			<p>So, for example, the following are all possible because the adjuncts 
			being linked are in the same category:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He lived in London in 1971 and in the late 80s</em><br />in which both adjuncts refer to specific times</li>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He comes frequently or at least regularly</em><br />in which both adjuncts refer to indefinite frequency</li>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stays in Greece during the spring and into 
			the winter</em><br />in which both adjuncts are durational</li>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will already have arrived by the time 
			you get here</em><br />in which both adjuncts are relational</li>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First they dug the ground over and then they 
			planted the seeds.&nbsp; Subsequently it all flourished.</em><br />in which we have three sequential adverb adjuncts 
				(although the last is really a conjunct).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following examples are not acceptable in English because 
			there is a mismatch of function between the adjuncts:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They will have already arrived and at six 
			o'clock</em><br />mixing relational with absolute time</li>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She came in the afternoon or frequently</em><br />mixing definite and indefinite (frequency) adjuncts<br />etc.</li>

			<p>It is, naturally possible to move adverbs of frequency to before 
			the main verb (following any auxiliary verbs) but that cannot be 
			done with phrases of frequency.<br />
			</p>
			<p>So, for example, we prefer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flights arrive hourly in the summer</em><br />
			over<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The flights arrive in the summer hourly</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He runs for 10 minutes every morning</em><br />
			over<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He runs every morning for ten minutes</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We met for an hour or so from time to time in 
			the summer months</em><br />
			over<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We met from time to time in the summer 
			months for an hour or so</em></p>
			<p>This is not a hard rule and speakers will often disturb the 
			ordering to mark an adjunct for special emphasis but it is a rule 
			worth following for learners of the language.<br />
			If your learners are producing unnatural time phrase ordering it 
			may reflect that fact that languages differ in this respect so it 
			may be worth spending a little time on this issue.</p>
			<p>The other minor consideration here is when we have two adjuncts 
			of the same type and then we usually prefer the more exact before 
			the less exact (just as smaller places come before larger in place 
			adjunct ordering).&nbsp; So, we get<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He came at six on Monday</em><br />
			rather than<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He came on Monday at six</em></p>

			<p>Frequently, time adjuncts and place adjuncts co-occur in the same 
			clause.<br />
			In English, there are no absolute rules for ordering time and place 
			(as there are in many languages).&nbsp; There are, however, rules of 
			thumb:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We place longer adjuncts after shorter ones so we prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was working here for many years</em><br />
				rather than<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was working for many years here<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was working in 1990 at a prestigious and expensive Chinese 
				restaurant in New York<br />
				</em>rather than<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was working at a prestigious and expensive Chinese 
				restaurant in New York in 1990</em></li>
				<li>When all the adjuncts come at the end of the clause, as is 
				frequently the case, the usual order is place then time because 
				place is considered more intimately associated with the verb 
				phrase, so we 
				prefer:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked at a restaurant in London for three years in 
				the mid-70s</em><br />
				rather than<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked for three years in London, in 
				the mid-70s at a restaurant</em><br />
				or any other possible combination of the four adjuncts.</li>
				<li>When the first two rules conflict and to avoid stylistic 
				problems, the time adjunct is often placed in initial position 
				so the last example might be better as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mid-70s, he worked at a restaurant in London for 
				three years</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For three years in the mid-70s, he worked 
				at a restaurant in London</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>For special emphasis or to give one adjunct or another extra 
			weight, speakers will flout these rules so we might get:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; At </em><strong><em>that</em></strong><em> time, of course, in 
			London it was difficult to get a decent cup of coffee anywhere.</em></p>

			<p>Most time adjuncts can be modified with other adverbials but how 
			it is done depends on the function of the adjunct.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>When adjuncts</strong></dt>
				<dd>Defined points of time can be modified with adverbials which 
				make them even more defined, so, for example, we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrived at exactly 6<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They left just then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came on the dot of 9</em><br />
				Duration can similarly be modified but it makes a crucial 
				difference whether we are modifying an adverb or a prepositional 
				phrase.&nbsp; We can have, therefore:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was very momentarily embarrassed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spoke very briefly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has moved here extremely recently</em><br />
				because, in the usual way of things, intensifying adverbs can 
				modify other adverbs.&nbsp; However, prepositional phrases allow 
				a much more restricted form of modification and it is the noun 
				complement of the phrase which takes the modification:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stayed for exactly two hours</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He stayed exactly for two hours</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has lived here for a whole year</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He has lived here whole for a year<br />
				</em>etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Frequency adjuncts</strong></dt>
				<dd>Definite frequency (by its nature) allows the same kind of 
				modification as defined points of time so we can have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sends out the bill exactly monthly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been exactly four times<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen her just twice</em><br />
				Indefinite frequency is often signalled by adverbs and these 
				can, in the usual way, be modified, but the modification 
				routinely requires end rather than medial positioning of the 
				adjunct especially if it consists of a phrase:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They come very frequently<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?They far too frequently come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do that slightly too often<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I slightly too often do that<br />
				</em>The modifiers <em>too</em> and <em>enough</em> (the latter 
				following the adjunct) are available to modify indefinite 
				frequency as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrives late too frequently<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She visits too seldom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They come often enough</em><br />
				etc. but these are not usually acceptable with <em>never</em> 
				and <em>always</em> for semantic reasons (in that one cannot go
				<em>*frequently always </em>or<em> *seldom never</em>).<br />
				Prepositional phrases, again, take different modification 
				usually with <em>only</em> or <em>just</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They work here only from time to time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walks to school just in the summer months</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Relational adjuncts</strong></dt>
				<dd>Relational adverbs resist modification.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He has absolutely already finished<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is not here very yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have waited exactly since half past three</em><br />
				although<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have waited since exactly half past three</em><br />
				is allowable because we are modifying a defined point in time as 
				we did above, not the adjunct itself.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Sequencers</strong></dt>
				<dd>Sequencers are sometimes modified but the range of modifiers is 
				severely limited:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had lunch just before two<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spoke immediately afterwards</em><br />
				are fine but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He had lunch exactly before two<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He came from London very originally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Immediately next, we went out</em><br />
				are not acceptable.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Modification of time adjuncts, as we would expect, works 
			differently across languages and these kinds of restrictions will 
			cause errors such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *They immediately then opened the box<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They very seldom but often enough work late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She came precisely recently</em></p>

			<p>A sure way to encourage error in this area is to teach 
			unprepared.&nbsp; Unless you are very talented, it is unlikely that 
			you will remember all the considerations which have been covered in 
			this guide concerning adjunct form, position and function.<br />
			This is a complex area in which languages differ markedly in what 
			adjuncts are possible, how they are used and what their functions 
			are.<br />
			Relational <em>vs</em>. absolute time distinctions are particularly 
			troublesome for learners from many language backgrounds because 
			their languages may not make the distinction at all.<br />
			Equally troublesome for some learners is the fact that English deals 
			with absolute time and duration rather differently.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Distinguish between adverb time references and 
				prepositional-phrase adjuncts.<br />
				If you don't, learners will be encouraged to insert 
				prepositional phrases in the medial position in clauses (which is 
				rarely possible) or to place adverbs unnaturally at the ends of 
				clauses so we will hear or read:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He came at 6 o'clock to the house</em><br />
					which emphasises the time adjunct unnecessarily</li>
					<li>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He played tennis with his brother 
					generally</em><br />
					which focuses on his opponent not on the verb, and so on.</li>
					<li>and plain errors such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They'll have by six got here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I monthly visit my sister<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They three times did it</em><br />
					will also occur.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Get the categories straight and present them or deal with 
				them as discrete areas before mixing them.<br />
				If you don't, bewildered learners may produce:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They went already<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have started at six o'clock</em><br />
					failing to distinguish between absolute and relative time.</li>
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They again and again did it</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They annually meet</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They arrive often late</em><br />
					failing to distinguish between definite and indefinite 
					frequency, the former taking end position and the latter 
					often taking medial position.</li>
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow I will come to your 
					party</em><br />
					unnaturally stressing the adjunct and, perhaps, failing to 
					distinguish between absolute time and sequencing.</li>
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Permanently, he was complaining</em><br />
					failing to distinguish between duration and absolute time.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Handle time and place adjuncts separately.<br />
				If you have followed the guide to place adjuncts, linked in the list of related guides at the end, 
				you will know that they operate quite differently from time 
				adjuncts in English.&nbsp; If you mix them up, you may get 
				errors such as:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They went dead at six<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He finished clear before 7</em><br />
					where the modifiers are not appropriate for time adjuncts.</li>
					<li>or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *At six o'clock came Mary</em><br />
					where there is confusion because an initial place adjunct 
					often requires the subject–verb inversion as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Here comes Mary</em><br />
					but a time adjunct 
					does not so it should be:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; At six o'clock, Mary came</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Simply listening to your learners or reading carefully what they 
			write may alert you to the areas which are causing trouble and then, 
			using this guide, you should be able to plan and conduct a lesson or series 
			of lessons which focuses on the trouble without introducing more 
			confusion.</p>
