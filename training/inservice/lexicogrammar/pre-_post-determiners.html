			<h1>Pre- and post-determiners</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="dominoes" height="207" src="../../images/dominoes310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>If you have followed <a href="determiners.html" target="_blank">the guide to determiners
			</a>on this site, you 
			will probably have noticed that determiners rarely co-occur.&nbsp; 
			We cannot, for example, have:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>*the a car</em></li>
				<li><em>*that the man</em></li>
				<li><em>*my the house</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>etc.&nbsp; This restriction, incidentally, does not exist in a 
			range of other languages.</p>
			<p>However, there is a distinct class of determiners which function 
			to modify other determiners.&nbsp; What is included in this 
			class is a matter of some disagreement.&nbsp; The approach taken 
			here is to consider first which determiners most authorities will 
			agree can function as pre-determiners and then to consider some more 
			marginal cases which, at least for teaching purposes, can be analysed 
			in the same way.<br />
			Later in the guide, we will get to a brief consideration of 
			post-determiners.</p>
			<p>In what follows, we will class the zero article as a determiner.&nbsp;In an expression such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All luggage must be weighed</em><br />
			it appears that the word <em>all</em> is the only determiner 
			present.&nbsp; However, because <em>luggage</em> is a mass noun it 
			can be analysed as being preceded by the zero article.&nbsp; Then 
			the structure is<br />
			<span class="auto-style56">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all + zero article [&Oslash;] + mass noun</span><br />
			and <em>all</em> may be classed as a pre-determiner.</p>
			<p>Missing from the following is any mention (apart from here) of 
			what are called restrictive or exclusive adverbs.&nbsp; They 
			include, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That <span class="style_black">just</span> 
			the thing I need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's <span class="style_black">only</span> a small spider<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is <span class="style_black">solely</span> the person in 
			charge</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's <span class="style_black">merely</span> 
			the assistant</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears to be </em>
			<span class="style_black"><em>simply</em></span><em> a question of 
			money</em><br />
			and are excluded here because they are considered in the guide to 
			adverbs.&nbsp; These adverbials refer to the whole verb or noun phrase and 
			are not, strictly speaking, pre-determiners.&nbsp; They are 
			sometimes called limiters.</p>
			<p>In many analyses, the list of pre-determiners is very limited and 
			includes only:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>all, both, half</em></li>
				<li>multipliers: <em>double, twice, eight times</em> etc.</li>
				<li>fractions: <em>a third, one quarter, a thousandth</em> etc. 
				(but, note, not <em>half</em>)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We will be slightly more adventurous than that but will note when 
			what we include in this guide is not an analysis shared by everyone.</p>
			<p>It is also worth making it clear now that only one pre-determiner per phrase is 
			permissible.&nbsp; In other words, these items are all mutually 
			exclusive and cannot co-occur.</p>

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2><em><a name="half"></a>all, both, half</em></h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>These pre-determiners function in slightly different ways.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>With <strong>singular count nouns</strong> we can use <em>
				half</em> and <em>all</em> but not <em>both</em></dt>
				<dd>For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; half a loaf is better than none<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				half this job will be done soon<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				all my house has been decorated<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				he waited all that day</em></span><br />
				but not:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *both my job was done</em></span></dd>
				<dt>With <strong>plural count nouns</strong> we can use all 
				three pre-determiners but <em>half</em> cannot be used with the zero 
				article</dt>
				<dd>For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; half those oranges are rotten<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				both the children came<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				all the men went home and stayed there<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				all lions are unpredictable<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				both (the) dogs are friendly</em></span><br />
				but not with the zero article:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *half people arrived</em></span><em><span class="style_black"><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*half trains are always late in my country</span></em><br />
				The predeterminer (or determiner) <em>both</em> refers to
				<strong>dual entities only</strong>.</dd>
				<dt>With <strong>mass nouns</strong> we can use <em>half</em> or
				<em>all</em> but not <em>both</em>.&nbsp; Additionally, only <em>
				all</em> can be used before the zero article</dt>
				<dd>For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; half my money is already gone<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				all the information is not needed<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				all luggage will be returned at baggage reclaim</em></span> 
				[zero article]<br />
				but not:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *half chocolate is gone<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *both the sugar is gone</em></span></dd>
			</dl>

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>notice</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<ol>
				<li>We cannot use <em>all, both</em> or <em>half</em> before 
				other quantifier determiners:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li><span class="style_black"><em>*half every, *both 
					neither, *all each, *half some, *both no, *all</em></span> 
					<span class="style_black"><em>enough</em></span> are all disallowed for obvious reasons of the meaning 
					they carry.</li>
					<li>There is an informal use of <em>half</em> in which this 
					rule can be broken:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have half enough time 
					to do this</em></span><br />
					but this only works with <em>enough</em>.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>These three pre-determiners have alternative <em>of</em>-constructions 
				such as:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of the time<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				both of the boys<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				half of the house</em></span><br />
				etc.<br />
				Although this is an optional structure when the noun is being 
				determined, it <span class="style_underline">must</span> be used when we are pre-modifying a pronoun 
				so we have:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of it was wasted<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				both of them came<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				half of it was used<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				half of them were drunk</em></span><br />
				but not<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *both them arrived<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*half it was rotten</em></span><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *all them were 
				sold</em></span><br />
				etc.<br />
				Moral: if in doubt, use the <em>of</em> structure.</li>
				<li>All three can act as pronouns (pro-forms) rather than 
				determiners in their own right, slightly formally in some views:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All arrived in time<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Both broke immediately<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Half was rotten</em></span></li>
				<li>Only <em>all</em> and <em>both</em> can follow the noun or 
				pronoun they determine:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ladies all arrived late<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				the children both cried</em></span><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They all 
				complained</em></span><br />
				but not:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the cake half was eaten</em></span></li>
				<li>The pre-determiner <em>both</em> is not so much plural as 
				dual (a concept taken much further in some languages).&nbsp; It 
				shares this characteristic with the determiners <em>neither</em> 
				and <em>either</em>.</li>
				<li><em>Both</em> also functions adverbially as an additive and 
				equaliser and 
				is considered in the guide to adverbs, linked from the list 
				below.&nbsp; One example will do:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John is <span class="style_black">both</span> 
				a good manager and an approachable boss</em></li>
			</ol>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*three times of his height</em></span></li>
				<li>None of these pre-determiners can follow the noun or pronoun

				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the amount three times<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*the price quadruple of the other</em></span></li>
				<li>There are some arguably old fashioned or rare terms which it

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>These, too, are fairly straightforward but it is worth noting 
			some things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>All these expressions have alternative, parallel <em>of-</em>constructions 
				and these are usually preferred.&nbsp; Some of the examples 
				without <em>of</em> in the following sound strange to most 
				native speakers:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one-third the money &gt; one-third of 
				the money<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				sixth-sevenths the time &gt; sixth-sevenths of the time</em></span><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three-quarters the effort &gt; 
				three-quarters of the effort<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				five-eighths the distance &gt; five-eighths of the distance</em></span><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>The pre-determiner <em>half</em> is not included in this 
				section because it has some characteristics which are not shared 
				by fraction pre-determiners, especially when it comes to the use 
				of the <em>of-</em>construction with count nouns:<br />
				We can have:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; half of those 
				vegetables are rotten<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; half those vegetables are rotten<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one third of those vegetables are rotten</em></span><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; half my work 
				has been wasted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one quarter of my work has been wasted</em></span><br />but not<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *one third those vegetables are 
				rotten</em></span><br />
				or<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *one quarter my 
				work has been wasted</em></span><br />etc. because only <em>half</em> 
				can be used <strong>without</strong> the <em>of-</em>construction 
				before demonstrative and possessive determiners.</li>
				<li>Some fractions in English are a real challenge to pronounce 
				and spell.&nbsp; Consider particularly <em>sixths</em>, <em>
				eighths</em>, <em>sixtieths</em> (respectively, /sɪksθs/, /eɪtθs/, 
				/ˈsɪk.stɪəθs/) etc.<br />
				Many languages simply do not allow consonant clusters such as /ksθs/ 
				and speakers of those languages (Japanese and Arabic, for 
				example, as well as some south-east Asian languages) will find 
				it very hard to get them right.<br />
				Speakers of Slavic languages will have less difficulty because 
				those languages routinely contain quite forbidding consonant 
				clusters.&nbsp; The Slovak word štvrť, for example, (pronounced 
				/ʃtvr̩tʲ/ and meaning <em>quarter</em>) contains no vowels at 
				all.&nbsp; Germanic languages, too, contain frequent consonant 
				clusters.<br />
				Do not be surprised, therefore, if fractions are pronounced with 
				intervening vowels inserted between the consonants (e.g., /sɪəksəθəs/ 
				instead of /sɪksθs/).<br />
				In fact, native speakers will often reduce the clusters for ease 
				when speaking rapidly and pronounce sixths as /sɪks/ (eliding 
				the /θs/) so it slightly perverse to insist that learners 
				shouldn't do this.</li>

			<p>There is a separate guide

				<dt>typical partitives</dt>

			<p>It is not the case that all grammarians would include these four 
			words in the category of pre-determiner but, because they share 
			structural characteristics with the other forms discussed above, it 
			is legitimate for teaching purposes to include them.&nbsp; Some 
			analyses will call these intensifying pre-determiners because they 
			serve to amplify or tone down the strength of the noun phrase which 
			follows.&nbsp; What they all do is communicate the speaker / writer's attitude.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>such</em> and <em>rather</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>These words have other functions, of course, operating as 
				adverbials in, e.g., <em>such beautiful work should be 
				exhibited, rather nasty weather</em> etc.<br />
				Here we are concerned with their function as a pre-determiner 
				when they serve to emphasise the speaker's attitude as in, e.g.:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't be such a baby</em></span> 
				(= you are being very like a baby)<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she is such a nice woman</em></span> 
				(= she is a very nice woman)<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is such good food</em></span> 
				(= this is very good food [zero article])<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he is rather a stupid player</em></span> 
				(= more than usually stupid)<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they have rather a nice house</em></span> 
				(= more than usually nice)<br />
				The reason many analyses do not include these as a proper 
				pre-determiners is that they can only pre-determine the 
				indefinite or zero article and not the range of possessives and 
				demonstratives etc. which have been exemplified for the real 
				pre-determiners above.&nbsp; We cannot have, therefore:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *such my house<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*such those eggs<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*such the cat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *rather her car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*rather those apples<br />
				</em></span>etc.<br />
				In American English <em>rather</em> is confined to its adverb 
				function but in British English, it is used as a pre-determiner 
				with much the same, although slightly less emphatic, meaning as
				<em>such</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>what</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This word, too, clearly has a number of other uses in the 
				language but as a pre-determiner it functions to express 
				surprise, joy or disappointment in exclamations such as:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What an exceptional result!</em></span><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What gorgeous weather!</em></span> 
				[zero article]<span class="style_black"><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a very stupid thing to 
				say!</em></span><br />
				Again, this word can only pre-determine the indefinite or zero 
				articles.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>quite</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This is an anomalous word because it can carry two distinct 
				attitudinal messages:<br />
				1) Positive attitude when used with a non-gradable adjective in 
				the noun phrase:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				It was a quite fantastic show<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				It was a quite disgusting performance</em></span><br />
				2) Negative attitude when used in other environments:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				It was a quite interesting development </em></span>(i.e., not very 
				interesting)<br />
				Sentence stress plays a role here and the stress or lack of it 
				on the pre-determiner can imply a down-toning or intensifying 
				meaning.&nbsp; De-stress the predeterminer and the adjective is 
				emphasised; stress it and the downtoning effect is expressed.<br />
				It is also anomalous in that is can occur with the definite 
				article as in, e.g.:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's quite 
				the best tool for the job</em></span></dd>

			<p>The determiners <em>rather</em> and <em>quite</em> can act as post-determiners, 
			following the determiner proper so we can have:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a rather / quite interesting 
			development</em></span><br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was rather / quite an interesting 
			development<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			That's rather / quite interesting information</em></span> (zero 
			article)<br />
			(Arguably, in fact, putting the item after the indefinite or zero 
			article simply results in its acting as an adverb pre-modifying the 
			adjective and not a determiner at all.)<br />
			We cannot do this with <em>what</em> and <em>such</em> so we cannot have:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A what beautiful picture<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*A such beautiful picture</em></span></p>

			So far, the discussion has focused on pre-determiners which modify 
			determiners proper.<br />
			There is, however, an alternative way to analyse somewhat rare 
			phrases which contain three determiners.&nbsp; In this case, we can 
			refer to them separately as pre-, central and post-determiners, like 
			this:</p>

			<p>
			The issue to notice, explained in more detail in the guide to 
			determiners is that pre-determining expressions with the preposition
			<em>of</em> function as partitives rather than determiners proper so 
			we can have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many of her friends<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both of the children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a quarter of my salary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of those six letters</em><br />
			and general partitives conventionally take the first position in the 
			sequence.<br />
			Restricted partitives, because they are determined by the nature of 
			the noun, often take the place of post-determiners so we may 
			encounter, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both my rashers of bacon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; half these loaves of bread</em><br />
			etc. and in these cases, the noun phrase rather than a single noun 
			is determined.</p>
			<p>
			The distinction between the quantifiers plus <em>of</em> and 
			generalised partitives proper lies in the fact that the former 
			cannot be pluralised so while we allow, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bit of information<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some pieces of information<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pile of books<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; four piles of books</em><br />
			and so on, no parallel constructions can be used with the 
			quantifiers except the fractional ones.&nbsp; We allow, therefore:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; three quarters of these apples<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; five sixths of the first group</em><br />
			but no pluralisation of words like <em>many</em> or <em>several</em> 
			is permissible.&nbsp; That is not the case in some languages.</p>

			<h3>Other languages</h3>
			<p>Your learners' language(s) will 
			almost certainly handle these sorts of concepts differently.&nbsp; For 
			example, it is perfectly OK in Greek to have <em>the my friend</em> 
			or <em>that the dog</em>.&nbsp; Romance languages, such as Italian 
			and Spanish, but not French, allow the possessive determiner to 
			co-occur with the article, too.<br />
			In some languages, Romanian, Bulgarian, and Swedish, for example, 
			affixes (often suffixes) act as determiners.<br />
			Other languages, such as Finnish, also have possessive affixes doing 
			a similar job.<br />
			Many of the expressions with the pronoun <em>of</em> acting as partitives of 
			one kind or another will be realized through the use of genitive 
			case structures in languages which depend on case marking to express 
			relationships.</p>
			<p>The way to bet is to presume from the outset that pre- and post-determiners 
			will</p>
			<ol>
				<li>be used differently in your learners' language(s) and have 
				different co-occurrence rules</li>
				<li>be virtually untranslatable</li>
				<li>be ordered differently in your learners' first language(s)</li>
				<li>cause problems if they are presented in a piecemeal fashion 
				with no consideration of parallel forms</li>
				<li>cause problems if they are presented all together in an 
				overwhelming mass of data</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Contexts</h3>
			<p>It is very important (not just here) to present these forms in a 
			clear context for which graphics and realia are the obvious source 
			because concepts do not coincide across languages.</p>
			<p>For example, it is easy enough to come up with visuals such as:</p>
			<table cellpadding="2" class="auto-style4">
				<tr>
					<td valign="middle">
					<img alt="each half" height="210" src="../../imagesgraphics/predeterminers1.png" width="310" /></td>

					<img alt="both" height="140" src="../../imagesgraphics/predeterminer2.png" width="310" /></td>

				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" colspan="2" valign="middle">
					<img alt="painting" height="184" src="../../images/painting250.jpg" width="250" /></td>

				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" colspan="2" valign="middle">
					<span class="auto-style6">How do you feel?</span><br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>It's quite an interesting 
					painting<br />
					What a beautiful painting<br />
					What an awful painting<br />
					It's such a beautiful painting<br />
					It's rather a boring painting<br />
					Anything else?<br />
					Discuss with two other students<br />
					Find two people who agree with you</em></span><br />
					etc.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>At lower levels, especially, a little Total Physical Response 
			teaching may be appropriate.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John, give all the men a piece of blue 
			paper.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Mary, give all the students a piece of white paper.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Arthur, give both a green and a white piece of paper to a student<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			June, give both your pieces of paper to Fred</em></span><br />
			etc.</p>
			<h3>Timing</h3>
			<p>There is almost no point at all in tackling this area at all if the 
			distinction between count and mass noun uses is unclear to your students.</p>
