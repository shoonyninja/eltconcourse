		<p>There are two principles at work here which combine to determine the

				</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>There is a clear tendency in English to place longer and more complex 
		phrases towards the end of sentences rather than at the beginning.<br />
		The key concept here is heaviness.&nbsp; The longer and more complex a 
		constituent of a clause is, the heavier it is said to be.<br />
		For example, modifying a noun with a single adjective as in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The red car</em><br />
		is a very light way to do so and the tendency in English is to place 
		light elements such as adjectives, numerals and other determiners before 
		the noun.&nbsp; That's why, in English, we get:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; three cars</em><br />
		not<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cars three</em><br />
		(as we do in a range of other languages, including Yoruba and many 
		African languages as well as Thai and many other South-East Asian 
		languages).<br />
		On the other hand, heavier elements tend to follow what they modify so 
		we have, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car which I drove for many years when I was a 
		student</em></p>
		<p>Here is an example of how heaviness affects how natural-sounding a 
		sentence is.&nbsp; Read the following aloud and decide which to you 
		seems the most natural, normal way to order the items in the sentence.&nbsp; 
		Then
		<a href="#3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'weight',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
		click here</a>:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>The problem was John's complete and absolute denial that 
			there was something seriously wrong with the car.</em></li>
			<li><em>John's complete and absolute denial that there was something 
			seriously wrong with the car was the problem.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p id="weight" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">Which of them sounded more natural to you?<br />
		If you chose 
		sentence 1., you are in the majority.<br />
		Sentence 2. flouts the 
		end-weight rule by placing the heavy (i.e., more complex) expression at 
		the beginning.&nbsp; The end-weight principle accounts for a great deal 
		of word ordering in English which is otherwise not easily explained.</p>

			<tr>

				<img alt="tail" height="133" src="../../images/tail_comet200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style6"><h3>The end-focus or old-before-new 
				principle</h3></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>The other principle at work in English is the fact that new information 
		is placed towards the end of sentences.&nbsp; Here's a very clear 
		example (from Bruno, no date):</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="3"><em>Every Tuesday, Samantha takes her dog to the dog 
			park near her house.&nbsp; The city of San José maintains the dog 
			park in an effort to promote healthy lifestyles.&nbsp; The city of 
			San José sustains several dog parks throughout the city.</em></li>
			<li><em>Every Tuesday, Samantha takes her dog to the dog park nearby 
			her house.&nbsp; The dog park is maintained in an effort to promote 
			healthy lifestyles by the city of San José.&nbsp; The city of San 
			José sustains several dog parks throughout the city.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>It is easy to see that 4. flows more easily than 3. because the 
		reader is led through the three sentences by reference to old 
		information before the introduction of new information.&nbsp; This is an 
		example of theme-rheme structuring.&nbsp; (For more, go to 		
		the guide the theme-rheme structure, linked in the list at the end of 
		related guides.)</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" >

				<img alt="sceptical" height="166" src="../../images/woman_sceptical250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style6">
		<h2>So what?</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>Taken together, the end-weight and end-focus principles have a 
		powerful effect on word order in English, even though the language is 
		often said to have a very firmly fixed word order.&nbsp; The effect is 
		twofold:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Extrapositioning:<br />
			The notional subject of the verb is moved towards the end of the 
			clause, a phenomenon known as postponement, so instead of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire did the damage</em><br />
			we might have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the fire that did the damage</em><br />
			and instead of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some children were damaging the garden</em><br />
			we might have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some children damaging the garden</em></li>
			<li>Fronting:<br />
			An anticipatory or dummy subject fronts the sentence but, unlike 
			most cases of fronting, this is in fact the unmarked rather than 
			marked form in English (and that is not so in many languages).&nbsp; 
			For example, fronting an adverb usually marks it in some way for 
			special emphasis, so the difference between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, I went shopping</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went shopping yesterday</em><br />
			is that in the first case the time is marked as especially important 
			and in the second, it is not.<br />
			However, this is not the case for anticipatory <em>there</em> and
			<em>it</em> clauses so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a snake in the garden</em><br />
			is the <span class="style_underline">normal</span>, unmarked, way of 
			stating a fact in English<br />
			but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A snake is in the garden</em><br />
			is less common and therefore more strongly marked.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The resulting sentence contains two subjects: the clause which is 
		what we would normally expect to be the subject of the verb and the 
		anticipatory subject, <em>there </em>or<em> it</em>.</p>
		<p>A second reason for focusing on this area in our teaching is that it 
		is by no means straightforward, as we shall see and avoiding errors such 
		as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Anything can't be wrong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *To learn a new language is fun</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		is mostly a matter of knowing how anticipatory, dummy subjects are used 
		in English and being aware of the fact that this is the
		<span class="style_underline">normal</span> way of stating facts.&nbsp; 
		That may be in contradistinction to the way in which the learners' first 
		language(s) operate(s).</p>

		<p>Compare these two sentences:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="5"><em>There is something rather strange and frightening 
			about him.</em></li>
			<li><em>Something strange and frightening is about him.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Sentence 6. sounds strange even though it is grammatically 
		correct.&nbsp; What English does here, to comply with the end-weight 
		principle, is to insert a dummy subject and allow the noun phrase to be 
		shifted to the end of the sentence.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, this is called 
		'shifting' in the literature.<br />
		(Note here that we are talking about <em>there</em> as a dummy subject, 
		not <em>there</em> as an adverb.&nbsp; When the word is an adverb it is 
		usually stressed<em><strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There</strong>'s John!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please sit <strong>
		there<br />
		</strong></em>but when used as a dummy, it is unstressed<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a <strong>bank</strong> on the corner.</em></p>
		<p><a name="1"></a>Here are some more examples of the ways English can 
		use the dummy or existential <em>
		there</em>:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="7"><em>There can't be anything very wrong.</em></li>
			<li><em>There was someone playing the piano in the house.</em></li>
			<li><em>There are good reasons for the problem.</em></li>
			<li><em>There have been some nasty incidents recently.</em></li>
			<li><em>There's a man with a dog in the garden.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Now try to alter the sentences to avoid the existential <em>there
		</em>and see what you get.&nbsp; 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'avoid',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have done that</a>.</p>
		<p id="avoid" style="visibility:hidden" ><span class="style_brown">If you try to alter those sentences to 
		avoid the dummy <em>there</em>, you get rather odd and 
		unacceptably foreign-sounding results like:<em><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		*Anything can't be wrong<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Someone playing the piano was in the house<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		*The problem has good 
		reasons<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		*Nasty incidents have been recently<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?A man with a dog is in the 
		garden</em>.<br />
		Frequently, it is difficult to identify exactly what is wrong with a 
		learner's production because it 'just sounds wrong'.&nbsp; Avoidance of 
		the existential <em>there </em>clause is often the reason.<br />
		<br />
		The other source of error with existential <em>there</em> sentences is 
		to neglect to note (or be told) that the subject must be indefinite.&nbsp; 
		For example:<br />
		We can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a girl in the classroom</em><br />
		but not:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *There's the girl in the classroom</em><br />
		unless the word there is an adverb of place<br />
		and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's something I want to ask</em><br />
		but not<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *There's that question I want to ask<br />
		</em>(Note, however, that informally a definite noun phrase as the 
		subject is allowed:<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>There's my feelings to consider<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		There's Mrs. Smith who needs inviting.</em>)</span></p>
		<h3>Concord with the existential <em>there</em></h3>
		<p>Usually, in informal English, we assume that the dummy <em>there</em> 
		is singular.&nbsp; This is not permitted in very formal English or 
		anywhere near 
		a grammar pedant.&nbsp; We can, therefore, have both:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="12"><em>There's two men coming up the path.</em></li>
			<li><em>There are two men coming up the path.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>The reason for this slight ambiguity is that,
		<span class="style_underline">grammatically</span>, <em>there</em> is 
		the subject of the sentence but the subject of the 'normal' clause is
		<span class="style_underline">notionally</span> still the subject of the 
		verb so both verb forms are allowable.</p>
		<h3>Relative pronoun clauses with existential <em>there</em></h3>
		<p>This is a frequent pattern in English.&nbsp; For example</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="14"><em>There's nothing more (that) I want to see.</em></li>
			<li><em>There's nothing (which) interests me here.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>(Note that in 15. it is possible to omit the relative <em>which</em>.&nbsp; 
		That is not possible in other relative clauses because it is the subject 
		of the verb.)</p>
		<h3>Other verbs with the existential <em>there</em></h3>
		<p>The existential <em>there</em> is almost exclusively used with a form 
		of the verb <em>be</em>.<br />
		Up to now we have only been using <em>there</em> with the verb <em>be</em> 
		but there are other verbs which can be used.&nbsp; The copular verbs 
		seem and appear are obvious candidates but others are possible.</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="16"><em>There stood a suspicious-looking man on the corner.</em></li>
			<li><em>There appears to be a mistake in the figures</em></li>
			<li><em>There comes a time when I have simply to give up.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Uses like these are mostly literary and in 18., the clause has become 
		a semi-fixed expression.</p>

		</table>
		
		
		<p>Quirk <em>et al</em> (1972) identify six sorts of existential <em>there</em> sentence 
		forms.&nbsp; Others, e.g., Chalker (1984), refer to <em>there</em> used 
		this way as <em>the introductory there</em> without setting out the 
		possibilities in any detail and others, e.g., Parrott (2000) refer 
		to it as <em>a dummy subject</em>, again without setting out the 
		details.&nbsp; We'll follow the first of these in this list but reduce 
		the list to two main sorts, putting together related formulations 
		(because that's the way to teach them).&nbsp; The essential differences 
		are down to transitivity in English verbs.<br />
		This is not a teaching syllabus, of course, but teachers need to be 
		aware of the types of sentences in which the anticipatory, dummy or existential <em>there</em> occurs in 
		English because these are not paralleled across all languages and 
		present learners with some difficulties.</p>

			<li><em>There are three people asking questions

			<li><em>There isn't anything in the cupboard to give the children 
			<span class="style_black">to 
			eat</span></em></li>
		</ul>
		<p>There are, somewhat more rarely, passive possibilities with the 
		existential <em>there</em>.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<ul class="greenbullet">
			<li><em>There will be no stone left unturned</em></li>
			<li><em>There have been four windows broken</em></li>

		<p>The principles of end focus (old before new) and end weight are at 
		work here, too.</p>
		<p>The pronoun <em>it</em> can stand for complete clauses and is often 
		used in this way to allow us to shift the clause itself to the end.<br />
		This is why it is called the anticipatory <em>it.</em>&nbsp; The pronoun 
		anticipates what it stands for (often a nominalised clause).<br />
		We can convert a sentence with a nominalised clause to one with an 
		anticipatory <em>it-</em>subject like this:<br />

		<p>The anticipatory <em>it</em> can also stand for a range of 
		nominalised phrases and clauses as in, e.g.:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>adjective plus non-finite <em>to-</em>infinitive</dt>
			<dd class="auto-style56"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is wonderful to 
			see her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a delight to watch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's fun to try<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a shame to miss the concert<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a pity to lose the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is odd to forget them</em></dd>
			<dt>adjective plus non-finite -<em>ing</em> clause</dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is lovely being here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is horrible going shopping with her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was nasty walking in the rain</em></dd>
			<dt>nominalised finite <em>that-</em>clauses</dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is odd that she isn't here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a pity that she can't come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a 
		shame that he's away</em></dd>
		</dl>
		<p><em>It</em> as a dummy subject with no discernible meaning is used as the subject 
		or object of many statements about weather, time, place and condition as 
		well as some semi-fixed expressions.&nbsp;
		For example:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="27"><em>It is raining</em></li>
			<li><em>It is Wednesday</em></li>
			<li><em>It would be nice if you helped</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>For a little more in this area, see the 
		guide to nominal clauses, linked from the list at the end, in which the clause as the object or 
		subject of a verb is discussed.</p>

		<p>Very few languages handle this area in the same way that English 
		does.&nbsp; Few languages are as obsessed as English is with inserting a 
		dummy subject and in those languages, the subject is often simply 
		omitted, so you'll get errors such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't like when you call me 
		stupid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I think is probable they will win</em> etc.</p>
		<p>Even if they do use a dummy <em>it</em> (as some do) they will probably 
		not use an existential form such as <em>there</em>.<br />
		For example,<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a mouse in the house<br />
		</em>might in other 
		languages be<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has a mouse in the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It gives a mouse in the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		house has a mouse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It exists a mouse in the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It finds a mouse in 
		the house<br />
		</em>and so on.<br />
		Language such as Greek and Romanian which do not have a dummy subject of 
		any kind will often use a verb meaning <em>exist</em> so, directly 
		translating, speakers of those languages might produce<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exists a 
		mouse in the house</em>.</p>
		<p>Careful attention and alertness to your learners' production in this 
		area pays dividends in terms of their being able to produce more natural 
		sounding and less foreign utterances.</p>

		<p>It is probably worth a bit of classroom time to raise your learners' 
		awareness of these two fundamental principles because they underlie so 
		much which is otherwise hard to explain.</p>
		<p>A straightforward way to start the process is to present the learners 
		with sentences which conform to the principles, contrasted with some 
		that don't but express the same meaning.&nbsp; For example, which of the 
		following are the most natural formulations?&nbsp; Click on the table 
		when you have an answer.<br />
		<img id="img1" alt="existential task 1" height="251" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'../../imagesgraphics/existentialtaskans.png')" src="../../imagesgraphics/existentialtask.png" width="450" /></p>
		<p>From there, it's a short step to getting learners to be able to 
		reformulate sentences more naturally as in this example.&nbsp; Click on 
		the table when you have the answer in your head.<br />
		<img id="img2" alt="task 2" height="283" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img2',/*url*/'../../imagesgraphics/existentialtask2ans.png')" src="../../imagesgraphics/existentialtask2.png" width="450" /></p>
