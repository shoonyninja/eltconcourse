			Usually people's definitions include something like 'a 
			word which modifies a verb'.&nbsp; That, as we shall see, 
			is only half right.<br />
			You may have come up with some (or all) of the following 
			types which in each case are verb modifiers:</p>
			<ol class="style_brown">
				<li><strong>Adverbs of manner, answering the question 'How?'<br />
				</strong>so we get, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is cycling 
				<span class="style_brown"><strong>quickly</strong><br />
				</span> 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is thinking 
				<span class="style_brown"><strong>hard</strong><br />
				</span> 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are waiting 
				<span class="style_brown"><strong>patiently</strong><br />
				</span></em>etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Adverbs of place, answering the question 'Where?'<br />
				</strong>so we get, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are waiting 
				<span class="style_brown"><strong>outside</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People were walking 
				<span class="style_brown"><strong>everywhere</strong><br />
				</span> 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please sit  
				<span class="style_brown"><strong>here</strong><br />
				</span></em>etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Adverbs of time, answering the question 'When?' or 
				'How often?'<br />
				</strong>so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are enjoying it 
				<span class="style_brown"><strong>now</strong><br />
				</span> 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going <strong>soon</strong><span class="style_brown"><br />
				</span> 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She
				<strong>sometimes</strong> arrives 
				<span class="style_brown">late<br />
				</span></em>etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Adverbs of degree, answering the question 'How 
				much?'<br /> </strong>so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enjoyed it 
				<span class="style_brown"><strong>enormously</strong><br />
				</span> 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They voted
				<strong>overwhelmingly</strong> for a change<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hated it 
				<span class="style_brown"><strong>intensely</strong><br />
				</span></em>etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="style_brown">You may have a slightly different list.&nbsp; 
			Some would put adverbs of frequency (<em class="style_brown">sometimes, often, 
			frequently </em>etc.) in their own category, some wouldn't.&nbsp; The 
			division between adverbs of manner and degree is also slightly 
			fuzzy.&nbsp; In fact, there are those who would argue that this sort 
			of categorisation lacks utility in terms of analysis but is useful 
			as a pedagogic tool only.<br />
			It ignores, for example, adverbs which perform different functions 
			like linking cause and effect (such as <em>hereby</em>) or 
			expressing the speaker's angle or attitude (such as <em>economically</em> 
			and <em>theoretically</em>).</p>
			<p class="style_brown">Out here in the virtual world there are some 
			other weird (and a few wonderful) classifications of adverbs which 
			include invented and unsustainable categories such as causative 
			adverbs, opinion adverbs and so on.&nbsp; We will not be inventing such things.</p>
			<p class="style_brown">All 
			the examples above are single words but adverbs also come as 
			adverb phrases such as <em><span class="style_brown">far more, from time to time, so very</span> </em>
			etc.&nbsp; They act as single-word adverbs in many cases but 
			sometimes they have their own characteristics (see below).&nbsp; 
			Some of these are better analysed as prepositional phrase adverbials 
			but they perform parallel communicative functions.</p></div><p>(It 
			is worth a short aside here to distinguish between an adverb of 
			manner and an adverb intensifier.&nbsp; Adverbs of manner modify 
			verbs directly as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She worked intensely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thought deeply<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke bitterly</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			However, a number of adverbs (including the ones exemplified here) 
			also act as adverb intensifiers in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an intensely painful wound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea was deeply misguided<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is bitterly opposed to the thought</em><br />
			Semantically and functionally, we should keep these concepts 
			separate or we risk confusing our learners unecessarily.<br />
			There is a guide to adverbial intensifiers, which are mostly 
			adverbs, linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>

					<h2>Forming adverbs</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		<p>It is often the case that a word can be identified by its form as an 
		adverb because English has only a few ways to form adverbs:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The most common by far is the addition of -<em>ly</em> to the 
			adjective form (sometimes with a spelling change):<br />
			<em>happy – happily, nasty – nastily, wooden – woodenly, rare – rarely</em> etc.<br />
			This is the usual suffix for the formation of an adverb from an 
				adjective in Modern English.&nbsp; Hence <em>carefully</em> from
				<em>careful</em> and hundreds of others.&nbsp; At one time, it 
				was also the way to make an adjective from a noun (hence <em>
				motherly</em> from <em>mother</em>).&nbsp; The latter use has 
				been replaced by a simple <em>-y</em> suffix.<br />
				It derives, however, from the Anglo-Saxon word <em>lic </em>or
				<em>lich</em> meaning <em>bod</em>y.&nbsp; The suffix has been 
				shortened and grammaticalised to the suffix only.</li>
			<li>For adjectives ending in -<em>ic</em>, the form is usually -<em>ally</em> 
			rather than just -<em>ly</em>:<br />
			c<em>omic – comically, specific – specifically</em> etc.</li>
			<li>Rarely, we can add -<em>wards</em> to other adverbs or nouns denote direction of 
			movement:<br />
			<em>north – northwards, down – downwards, earth – earthwards, 
			home – homewards, on – onwards, back – backwards</em> etc.</li>
			<li>Even more rarely, we can add -<em>wise</em> or -<em>ways</em> to 
			denote the manner of something:<br />
			<em>crab – crabwise, edge – edgeways, edge – edgewise, coast – coastwise</em> etc.</li>
			<li>There is one example of an adverb formed with -<em>long</em>:
			<em>headlong</em> (and even that is usually an adjective).&nbsp; The 
			adverb <em>sidelong</em> exists but the word is almost always 
			adjectival.</li>
			<li>The suffix -<em>wide</em> also forms a rare set of words which 
			are occasionally used as adverbs: <em>nationwide, countrywide</em> 
			etc.&nbsp; When the suffix is attached to a nation or other state 
			entity, it is usually hyphenated as in <em>Germany-wide, 
			Europe-wide, Japan-wide</em> etc.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Unfortunately, an adverb is sometimes not identifiable from its form 
		at all and these words simply have to be learned individually because no 
		reliable form test is available to identify them.&nbsp; Examples include 
		many short place adverbials such as <em>out, in, inside, over</em> etc. as well 
		as ones such as <em>seldom, often, outside, soon, home</em> 
		and <em>hard</em>.<br />
		To complicate matters, some words can function in more than one way.&nbsp; 
		This is a phenomenon known as syntactical homonymy.<br />
		For example, in:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked out</em><br />the word 
				<em>out</em> is functioning as an adverb (of place or 
		direction) but in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked out the door</em><br />the word is functioning as a preposition with a noun-phrase complement (<em>the 
		door</em>) but it is still part of an adverbial phrase.<br />Prepositions have complements, adverbs do not.</li>
				<li>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to go home</em><br />the word 
				<em>home</em> is functioning adverbially, modifying <em>go</em> 
		(or the whole verb phrase, <em>want to go</em>) but in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have a lovely home</em><br />the word is functioning as a noun and is not adverbial in any way 
				(and, incidentally, <em>lovely</em> is an adjective, although it 
				looks like an adverb).</li>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived early<br />
				</em>the word <em>early</em> is functioning as an adverb telling 
				us about the verb <em>arrive</em> but in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had an early breakfast<br />
				</em>the word is functioning as an adjective.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As we see above, most adverbs are formed from or have equivalent 
			adjective forms.&nbsp; A few adverbs, however, notably:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>just </em>(meaning <em>recently</em>)<em>, quite, so, 
			soon, too </em>and <em>very</em><br />
			do not have any recognisable adjective forms at all.</p>

				</table>
			<p>We have see above that form is not a reliable basis on which to 
			base the identification of word class.&nbsp; Adverbs may 
			overwhelmingly be formed by the addition of<em> -ly</em> or <em>
			-ally</em> to an adjective but there are numerous exceptions and 
			many adjectives look like adverbs because they end in -<em>ly</em>.</p>
			<p>Meaning, too, is an unreliable guide because, although it is 
			fairly straightforward to focus on concepts encoded in words 
			relating to how a verb is performed, adverbs have numerous other 
			functions which are more difficult to pin down.&nbsp; We could, for 
			example, test for an adverb by asking whether the word refers to 
			manner, place, time or degree and that will often help us to 
			identify whether something is adverbial or not.&nbsp; It will not, 
			however, reliably 
			help us to identify an adverb because, as we saw above the class of 
			adverbials is much more varied than the class of adverbs.<br />
			For example, a word like <em>more</em> is certainly often an adverb 
			but it does not refer to manner, place, time or degree in the same 
			way that, for example, words like <em>slowly, there, then</em> and
			<em>greatly</em> do.<br />
			Equally, <em>in French, over the road, at six </em>and <em>with no 
			effort </em>refer respectively to manner, place, time and degree yet 
			none is an adverb.</p>
			<p>We are left, as is often the case, with a slot test which relies 
			on syntax as the defining characteristic.&nbsp; In other words, we 
			have to look at what the words do in the syntax of the language to 
			identify their word class.<br />
			This means identifying which words can fill certain slots in 
			clauses.&nbsp; For example, if you attempt to fill the slots in 
			these clauses with <strong>single</strong> words, you quickly discover that only one class 
			of words will do the trick:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove the car very __________ out of the garage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It __________ rains in England<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She kicked the ball __________ over the wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She did the work __________ well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a(n) __________ beautiful story</em></p>
			<p>Adverbs.</p>

		<p>When adverbs function as adverbials, modifying a verb or verb phrase, they are of three sorts:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Adjuncts</strong></dt>
	<dd>These are the most familiar ones to us because the adverb is integrated 
	into the sentence.&nbsp; We don't need any more information than the clause 
	contains to understand them.&nbsp; Some examples:<br />
	<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She waited <span class="style_brown">inside</span><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	They told me <span class="style_brown">quickly</span><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	She <span class="style_brown">rarely</span> gets here on time<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I want to leave <span class="style_brown">now<br />
	</span></em>There are four adjunct adverbs in particular whose function is 
	somewhat different from others.&nbsp; They serve to link cause and effect 
	but do so in a way which makes the utterance perform the act.&nbsp; In other 
	words, they are performative.&nbsp; They are also quite formal, even 
	archaic.<br />
	Here are examples of the four most common ones:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
		<li><em>You are </em> <span class="style_brown"><em>hereby </em> </span>
		<em>elected as captain</em></li>
		<li><em>The undersigned undertake </em> <span class="style_brown"><em>herewith 
		</em> </span>
		<em>to transfer the money</em></li>
		<li><em>She had studied the area and was </em> <span class="style_brown">
		<em>thereby
		</em>
		</span><em>able to explain it to me</em></li>
		<li><em>She sold the painting and </em> <span class="style_brown"><em>therewith 
		</em> </span>
		<em>became quite wealthy</em></li>
	</ul>
	<p class="auto-style58">See the guide to cause and effect for a little more 
	on this.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt><strong>Disjuncts</strong></dt>
			<dd>These are not integrated into the clause (and are often 
			separated by commas) and they express the speaker / writer's view of 
			what is being said / written or they express how the speaker wants 
			the utterance to be viewed or the speaker's view of the truth or 
			generalisability of what is said.&nbsp; Some examples:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are <span class="style_brown">certainly</span> 
			not in<br />
			<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously</span>, he's not coming<br />
			<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happily</span>, I found 
			my keys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Honestly</span>, I have no idea<br />
			</em>Because disjuncts are external to the clause structure and 
			modify everything in the clause rather than a single element of it, 
			they are sometimes called sentence adverbs and there is a guide to 
			them on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
			Many adverbs which appear as disjuncts are, in other contexts, 
			adverbs of manner (see below).<br />
			Compare, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She waited <span class="style_brown">happily</span>, sitting in the sunshine 
			and reading her novel</em><br />
			where <em>happily</em> is an adverb of manner describing <strong>how</strong> 
			she waited and applicable to the verb <em>wait</em> only<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Happily</span>, she waited for us and brought us 
			home even though we were so late</em><br />
			where <em>happily</em> is a disjunct applicable to the whole of the 
			rest of the utterance and which expresses the speaker's feeling.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Conjuncts</strong></dt>
			<dd>These connect two separate and potentially independent clauses (they are, in fact, 
			cohesive devices and not, as some will call them, discourse markers).&nbsp; Some examples:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the beer runs out, <span class="style_brown">then</span> I'm 
			going home<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He looked everywhere, <span class="style_brown">yet</span> he 
			couldn't find her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed my bus.&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Consequently</span>, 
			I was late to work</em><br />
			Happily, this is not the place to discuss the technical difference 
		between a conjunct and a conjunction but conjunct adverbs get their own 
			section below.<br />

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Adverbs of manner</strong> (or process adverbs)<br />
			Usually, these follow the verb (if there's no object) or follow the 
			object.&nbsp; So we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove <span class="style_brown">carefully</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He drove the car <span class="style_brown">carefully</span></em><br />
			It is also possible, but rarer, to place these before the verb:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_brown">carefully</span> drove the car into 
			the garage<br />
			</em>But this won't work if the verb is used intransitively or with 
			no prepositional or adverbial complement:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*He carefully drove<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</em>*<em>She slowly walked<br />
			</em>but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He carefully drove the bus out<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She slowly walked away<br />
			</em>They <span class="style_underline"><strong>never</strong></span> 
			come between the verb and the object:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>He drove
			<span class="style_brown">carefully</span> the car.<br />
			</em>The traditional way to analyse these sorts of adverbs is, as 
			we have here, to call them adverbs of manner.&nbsp; They are also 
			called <strong>process adverbs </strong>because they can only apply 
			to verbs which can be made progressive.<br />
			When adverbs such as <em>carefully, slowly, quietly, stealthily, 
			idiotically </em>and so on are used with verbs in a stative meaning, 
			the result is impossible.&nbsp; For example, we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I played quietly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrived slowly</em><br />
			and so on, but we cannot have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I knew the answer carefully<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She saw the man slowly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Peter believed she was silly quietly</em><br />
			because those are all stative uses on the verbs.&nbsp; Verbs which 
			are normally stative can be used dynamically, of course and when 
			that happens process adverbs may be used so we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was thinking carefully<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was considering the idea quietly</em><br />
			etc.</li>
			<li><strong>Adverbs of place</strong><br />
			These, too, usually follow the object of the verb or the verb itself 
			if there's no object.&nbsp; So we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw it <span class="style_brown">everywhere</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			They went <span class="style_brown">there</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She came <span class="style_brown">here</span></em><br />It is rare 
			to front these, but possible for emphasis as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Here </span>she 
			comes!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">There </span>they are!</em><br />
			They <span class="style_underline"><strong>never</strong></span> 
			come between the verb and the object:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He saw
			<span class="style_brown">everywhere</span> friends<br />
			</em>The ordering of adverbs of place in clauses generally mirrors 
			the ordering of prepositional phrase adverbials which, for teaching 
			purposes, is convenient because they are performing the same 
			functions.</li>
			<li><strong>Adverbs of degree</strong><br />
			These also follow the object (if there is one) or come directly 
			after the verb.&nbsp; So we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enjoyed the book <span class="style_brown">slightly</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He concentrated <span class="style_brown">intensely</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			They pursued him <span class="style_brown">relentlessly</span></em><br />
			These adverbs can be placed before the verb and this has the effect 
			of making them slightly more emphatic.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_brown">greatly </span>
			enjoyed the party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_brown">completely </span>finished the 
			work</em><br />
			They <span class="style_underline"><strong>never</strong></span> 
			come between the verb and the object:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>They pursued
			<span class="style_brown">relentlessly</span> him<br />
			</em>Into this category, we can also put adverb intensifiers (to 
			which there is a separate guide on this site) such as <em>
			completely, definitely, certainly, slightly, hugely</em> and so on.&nbsp; 
			These are of two sorts:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>amplifying and downtoning adverbs which raise or lower the 
				scale of the verb they modify as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_brown">totally
				</span>dismissed the idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm afraid I have <span class="style_brown">slightly </span>
				scratched the car</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Because these adverbs move the strength of the verb up or down a 
				notch, they cannot be used with ungradable verbs (which are 
				considered on or off events, by their nature having an end 
				point) so we do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She <span class="style_brown">completely
				</span>did her homework<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She <span class="style_brown">slightly </span>made dinner</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *Peter <span class="style_brown">somewhat </span>
				travelled to London</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He <span class="style_brown">wholly
				</span>arrived</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *John <span class="style_brown">thoroughly </span>found 
				his wallet in the kitchen</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				but we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_brown">completely
				</span>destroyed the garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John <span class="style_brown">thoroughly </span>searched his 
				pockets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary <span class="style_brown">partially </span>enjoyed the 
				film<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_brown">wholly </span>rejected the 
				idea</em></li>
				<li>emphasising adverbs, by contrast with amplifiers and 
				downtoners, may be used with almost any verb and serve to stress 
				it rather than increase or decrease the scale, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_brown">definitely
				</span>arrived late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has <span class="style_brown">certainly </span>lost her 
				keys</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_brown">positively
				</span>shouted with joy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_brown">absolutely </span>cried my eyes 
				out</em><br />
				etc.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong><a name="freq"></a>Adverbs of time<br />
			</strong>There are four sorts of these:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li><strong>Definite time </strong>adverbs usually come at the end of the clause.&nbsp; So we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am leaving <span class="style_brown">tomorrow</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I want to leave <span class="style_brown">soon</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She arrived <span class="style_brown">eventually</span></em><br />These are often fronted for emphasis.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Tomorrow</span>, I 
			have to go shopping<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="style_brown">Sooner or later</span>, she'll get 
			the message<br />
				</em>In English, the fronted position marks the adverb for 
				emphasis but in some languages, German and Spanish, for example, 
				this is a common or compulsory position for the time adverb and 
				carries no special marking.<br />
				Some analyses put words like <em>home</em> and <em>tomorrow</em> 
				into the class of nouns acting adverbially.</li>
				<li><strong>Indefinite frequency</strong> adverbs<ol class="auto-style89">
					<li>These usually come before a main verb but after 
			any auxiliary verb (or the first auxiliary if there are more than 
			one) and after the verb <em>be</em>.&nbsp; So we get:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She 
					<span class="style_brown">often</span> plays the piano<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She has <span class="style_brown">sometimes</span> played the piano<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He is <span class="style_brown">frequently</span> stupid<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			They would <span class="style_brown">seldom</span> have to ask for 
			help<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She <span class="style_brown">rarely</span> tells the truth</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will <span class="style_brown">often
					</span>have been there</em></li>
					<li>These adverbs, however, occur
					<span class="style_underline">before</span> semi-modal 
					auxiliary verbs<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_brown">often
					</span>has to come in early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is <span class="style_brown">often </span>able to help me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_brown">seldom </span>used to entertain guests<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_brown">seldom </span>dare to go</em></li>
					<li>The adverbs <em>often, usually, sometimes </em>and<em> occasionally</em> 
					frequently occur at the end of clauses:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They work late in the office sometimes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She comes to the house occasionally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He complains about having no money often</em><br />
						Others in this category can occur at the end of clauses 
						but only with some special emphasis.</li>
					<li>Multi-word adverb phrases of indefinite frequency do
					<span class="style_underline">not</span> follow this rule.&nbsp; 
			With these the usual word order is to place them after the clause as 
			we do for other time adverbs.&nbsp; So, 
			we get:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He comes to my parties 
					<span class="style_brown">from time to 
			time</span><br /></em>not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He comes 
					<span class="style_brown">from time to time</span> to my parties<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She only helps me <span class="style_brown">now and then / again<br />
					</span></em>not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She only 
					<span class="style_brown">now and then / again</span> 
			helps me<br />
					</em>There are two exceptions.&nbsp; The compound adverbs
					<em><span class="style_brown">scarcely ever</span> </em>and 
					<em class="style_brown">hardly ever</em> operate as 
					single words and follow the same rules as <em>often, seldom, 
					frequently </em>etc. so we get, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_brown">
					scarcely ever </span>helps<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The are <span class="style_brown">hardly ever</span> here<br />
					</em>and neither can be placed terminally.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Definite frequency</strong> adverbs usually 
				come in end position.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pay the paper bill <span class="style_brown">monthly</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They send electricity bills <span class="style_brown">
				quarterly</span></em><br />
				These refer to measurable amounts of time and include, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I get the newspaper daily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She travels to London weekly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We meet annually</em><br />
				The normal position for these adverbs is at the end of a clause, 
				after the verb, its object or any prepositional phrase.<br />
				Placing the adverbs anywhere else usually results in non-English 
				or special emphasis.<br />
				Apart from <em>annually</em> and <em>seasonally</em>, which are 
				themselves derived from adjectives, these 
				adverbs also functions as adjectives:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a monthly meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a yearly trip<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a daily news broadcast</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				An adverbial phrase, such as <em>once a month / day / year / summer</em> 
				etc. can be used instead of definite frequency adverbs but it is 
				slightly more colloquial and in formal writing the adverb forms 
				are preferred.</li>
				<li><strong>Relational time</strong> adverbs which connect two 
				times together.&nbsp; They often come in medial position, before 
				the main verb but also occur at the beginning and end of 
				clauses.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had <span class="style_brown">already </span>left when I 
				arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She won't be at home <span class="style_brown">yet</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have <span class="style_brown">recently </span>completed my

			Two adverbs of indefinite frequency have special characteristics:<ol class="smallredbullet">
						<li><span class="style_brown"><em>generally</em></span><br />
						is an adverb of indefinite frequency but it is difficult 
						to equate with others in the group because in positive 
						and interrogative sentences, the word means <em>usually</em> 
						but in negatives, it means <em>seldom</em> or <em>rarely</em>.&nbsp; 
						For example:<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He <span class="style_brown">generally </span>
						doesn't come to see me = He <span class="style_brown">
						rarely </span>comes to see me</em><br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She <span class="style_brown">generally </span>
						complains about the food = She <span class="style_brown">
						usually </span>complains about the food.</em><br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Do you <span class="style_brown">generally
						</span>eat early? = Do you <span class="style_brown">
						usually </span>eat early</em></li>
						<li><span class="style_brown"><em>ever</em></span><br />
						This is the non-assertive form of <em>never</em> and occurs 
						regularly in questions to elicit a statement of 
						frequency:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you ever go to the cinema?&nbsp; Rarely, these 
						days</em><br />
						It can also occur in negative sentences with the sense 
						of <em>never</em>:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't ever wait for an answer</em><br />
						and is generally in the sense of a complaint.</li>

			<p>Six adverbs are semantically already 
			negative and are sometimes referred to as negator adverbs.&nbsp; They are: <em>rarely, seldom, barely, 
			hardly, scarcely</em> 
			and, of course, <em>never</em>.<br />
			Because these words are already negative in sense, they cannot be 
			negated again in the normal way.<br />
			Much more information about these, including some research findings 
			is available in the guide to negation, linked below.<br />
			Here, we will just set out a few examples of the general rules.</p>
			<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>These adverbs do not occur in questions or negative 
				sentences because their sense is already negative:<br />
				We accept:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_brown">hardly ever</span> go to London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_brown">scarcely ever</span> asks for help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We <span class="style_brown">seldom </span>eat before seven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_brown">rarely </span>complains about her work load<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_brown">never </span>arrive on time</em><br />
				but not, usually:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Do you <span class="style_brown">hardly ever
				</span>go to London?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't <span class="style_brown">scarcely ever </span>see her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She didn't <span class="style_brown">seldom </span>eat out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We don't <span class="style_brown">never </span>arrive on time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Does she <span class="style_brown">rarely </span>eat out?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				(There are some doubtful areas of usage with these negative 
				adverbs which are discussed more fully in the guide to negation, 
				linked below.)</li>
				<li>They are used with non-assertive forms (such as <em>any, 
				ever, yet</em> etc.):<ol class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>They rarely ever come to anyone's party</em></li>
					<li><em>I seldom went anywhere</em></li>
					<li><em>She barely saw anything</em></li>
					<li><em>They have hardly had any time to think yet</em></li>
					<li><em>She scarcely ever comes late</em></li>
					<li><em>She never has any time</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>In the initial position, somewhat formally, they require 
				inversion of the subject and verb (with the <em>do</em> operator in past 
				simple and present simple forms):<ol class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>Rarely does he believe me</em></li>
					<li><em>Seldom have I heard such nonsense</em></li>
					<li><em>Barely audibly did she speak</em></li>
					<li><em>Hardly had I arrived when the phone rang</em></li>
					<li><em>Scarcely had she arrived than the fire alarm sounded</em></li>
					<li><em>Never have I seen someone make such a mess</em></li>
				</ol></li>
				<li>Like the negator <em>never</em> these adverbs can 
				take a positive question tag:<ol class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>They never like anything, do they?</em></li>
					<li><em>They scarcely said anything, 
					did they?</em></li>
					<li><em>You seldom agree, do you?</em></li>
					<li><em>I hardly had time, did I?</em></li>
				</ol>But, unlike the true negator, <em>never</em>, they can take 
				balanced tags so we can also allow:<ol class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>You rarely agree, don't you?</em></li>
					<li><em>I hardly had time, didn't I?</em></li>
					<li><em>It was barely 
					audible, wasn't it?</em></li></ol>
					The true negator <em>never</em> can only take a positive tag as in:<ol class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>I never had much time, did I?<br />
					</em>and we do not allow:</li>
					<li><em>*I never had much time, 
					didn't I?</em></li>
				</ol></li>

		<p id="answer" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden"><span class="style_brown">You 
		probably have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He has a <strong>very</strong> good brain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove <strong>very</strong> carefully<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has an <strong>unusually</strong> good brain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove <strong>unusually</strong> carefully<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has a good <strong>enough</strong> brain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove carefully <strong>enough</strong></em><br />
		When adverbs modify an adjective or 
		an adverb (as many do) the odd-man-out is <em>enough</em> because it 
		follows rather than precedes the adjective or adverb.&nbsp; We get, 
		therefore, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer is close 
		<span class="style_brown">enough</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't do it carefully <span class="style_brown">
		enough<br />
		<br />
		</span> </em>Otherwise, adverbs modify adjectives and other adverbs in 
		exactly the same way as they modify verbs.&nbsp; We can have, therefore:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>That's </em> </span><span class="style_brown"><em>very 
		</em> </span><span class="style_brown"><em>interesting</em> (modifying an adjective)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He opened the parcel </em></span><span class="style_brown">
		<em>extremely </em> </span><span class="style_brown"><em>carefully</em> (modifying another adverb)</span><br /><em><br />
		</em><span class="style_brown">It is an important characteristic of the 
		adverb <em>very</em> that it can only modify another adverb or an 
		adjective.&nbsp; It cannot function as an adjunct and modify a verb 
		directly.&nbsp; It is not alone in this because other adverbs such as
		<em>extremely, utterly, slightly, exceptionally</em> and so on also 
		function only to modify another adverb or an adjective.</span></p>
			<p id="answer2" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden"><span class="style_brown">Note, too, the post-modifying position of <em>ever</em> in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We hardly 
		</em> 
		</span><span class="style_brown"><em>ever </em> </span><span class="style_brown">
		<em>eat out.<br />
		</em>
		The modifier <em>ever</em> is only used with indefinite frequency time adverbs so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We scarcely <strong>ever</strong> see him</em><br />
		refers to frequency but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I can scarcely see it</em><br />
		refers to manner and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I can scarcely <strong>ever</strong> see it</em><br />
		would be an unusual reference to frequency 
			because:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can scarcely see it<br />
			</em>is the only choice if we are focused on manner.<br />
		See also the guide to adverb 
		modifiers, linked below, which considers intensifiers: amplifiers, 
		emphasisers and downtoners.</span></p>
			<p>A small class of adverbs is known as <strong>viewpoint adverbs</strong> 
			because they serve to express the angle or viewpoint from which 
			something is stated.&nbsp; They include the ones exemplified in:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>It was <span class="style_brown">politically </span>unwise to say that at the meeting</em></li>
				<li><em>It is <span class="style_brown">ethically </span>indefensible to suggest that</em></li>
				<li><em>It is <span class="style_brown">technically </span>feasible for the program to crash</em></li>
				<li><em>I am <span class="style_brown">financially </span>embarrassed</em></li>
				<li><em>His position is <span class="style_brown">theoretically
				</span>strong</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In these examples, the adverbs are adjuncts because they function 
			only to modify the adjective in each case but they can also function as disjuncts, 
			modifying the entire clause as in, for example:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em><span class="style_brown">Politically</span>, it was unwise to say that at the meeting</em></li>
				<li><em><span class="style_brown">Ethically</span>, it is indefensible to suggest that</em></li>
				<li><em><span class="style_brown">Technically</span> it is feasible for the program to crash<br />
				</em>etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and for 
			more on that, you should consult the guide to adverbials and the 
			guide to disjuncts, linked at the end.</p>

			<p>Usually, adverbs which modify adjectives and other adverbs 
			perform one of three functions which can all be described as 
			intensifiers of some kind.&nbsp; Here are examples of the three 
			types but there is a guide to adverb intensifiers on this site, 
			linked below, which provides more detail.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Intensifier: emphasising</strong></dt>
				<dd>These adverbs simply make the modified element stronger.&nbsp; 
				They do not scale the item.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came <span class="style_brown">really
				</span>quickly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was <span class="style_brown">definitely </span>better</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Intensifier: amplifying</strong></dt>
				<dd>These adverbs move the sense of the modified item up a 
				scale.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was <span class="style_brown">very
				</span>well done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parcel was <span class="style_brown">terribly </span>
				heavy</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Intensifier: downtoning</strong></dt>
				<dd>These adverbs work in the opposite fashion, weakening the 
				intensity of the modified item.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was <span class="style_brown">
				somewhat </span>carelessly made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought he was <span class="style_brown">quite </span>nice</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>There is, however, an essential difference between those which 
			can modify adjectives and those which modify other adverbs and it is 
			this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black">A range of adverbs can modify 
			adjectives and retain their usual meaning but adverbs modifying 
			other adverbs can <strong><span class="style_underline">only</span></strong> 
			be intensifiers of some kind.</span></p>
			<p>So, for example:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>We can have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was <span class="style_brown">extremely
				</span>tall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figures were 
				<span class="style_brown">very </span>carefully calculated<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a 
				<span class="style_brown">pretty </span>good party<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was 
				<span class="style_brown">quite </span>surprisingly 
			good<br /></em>all of which are intensifiers of some kind, modifying either 
			adjectives or other adverbs.</li>
				<li>We also allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was 
				<span class="style_brown">quietly
			</span>confident<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The novel was 
				<span class="style_brown">internationally
			</span>admired<br /></em>which are not intensifiers but retain their usual meaning when 
			modifying <strong>adjectives</strong>.</li>
				<li>But we do not allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She spoke 
				<span class="style_brown">quietly
			</span>angrily<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They worked 
				<span class="style_brown">internationally </span>effectively<br />
				</em>because adverbs which modify other <strong>adverbs</strong> are limited to one 
			of the three intensifying functions.&nbsp; In other words, they
				<strong>must</strong> be intensifiers of some kind.<br /></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not a restriction, incidentally, which is parallelled in 
			many other languages so it needs to be taught.</p>
			<p>Three other adverbial expressions can pre-modify adverbs and 
			adjectives:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em><strong>how</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>shows the degree of the item.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How heavily it had rained could be judged 
				from the water in the pots<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How heavy the rain had been could be judged from the water in 
				the pots</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>however</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>introduces a dependent adverbial clause.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However angry she is, she shouldn't raise 
				her voice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However hard he works, he gets no credit for it</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>so ... that</strong></em></dt>
				<dd><em>so </em>is a modifier followed by a <em>that-</em>clause 
				and means <em>to the extent or degree.&nbsp; </em>When it is fronted, it is followed by the 
				inversion of the subject and the <em>do / does / did</em> operator or 
				auxiliary verb.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So carelessly did he drive that everyone 
				was terrified<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So fast did the bird fly that it was quickly out of sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So much has she spent that she is completely broke<br />
				</em>But the normal word-order rules apply when it occurs 
				elsewhere in the clause as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove so carelessly that everyone was 
				terrified<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bird flew so fast that it was quickly out of sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has spent so much that she is completely broke<br />
				</em>(There is a somewhat rare, literary construction using <em>
				so </em>+ an adverb which does not require the use of the <em>do 
				/ does / did </em>operator so we can encounter, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So fast flew the bird that it was quickly 
				out of sight</em><br />
				This formulation cannot, however, usually be used with a pronoun 
				so we cannot allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?*So fast flew it that it was quickly out 
				of sight.</em>)</dd>

		<ol>
			<li>Some adverbs can modify prepositions or prepositional phrases.&nbsp; 
		E.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's <span class="style_brown">dead</span> against the idea<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The bullet went <span class="style_brown">completely</span> through the 
		metal<br />

			my thin jacket<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are <span class="style_brown">(very) nearly</span> over the worst<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is <span class="style_brown">just</span> next to the post office, 
			<span class="style_brown">directly </span>opposite the 
			station<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They live <span class="style_brown">right</span> by the river<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was <span class="style_brown">nearly</span> after dark when they arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was <span class="style_brown">way</span> over my head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting started <span class="style_brown">shortly</span> after 6 o'clock.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man spoke <span class="style_brown">purely</span> in his own interests.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They acted <span class="style_brown">solely </span>to their own advantage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a comment <span class="style_brown">very much </span>out of order here.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We looked <span class="style_brown">all</span> over the town for a replacement.<br />
			</em>That is, by the way, virtually a complete list of adverbs that 
			act this way.</li>
			<li>A more limited range of adverbs can modify the adverb particles 
			of phrasal verbs so we allow, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hit <span class="style_brown">right
			</span>on the solution<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anaesthetic has worn <span class="style_brown">well
			</span>off</em><br />
			but this is quite rare and most modification of adverb particles 
			produces malformed language so we cannot allow, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The arrangement feel immediately through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She gave completely in</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*She turned the job straight away down</em><br />
			so the modifier needs to be placed outside the phrasal verb as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The arrangement <span class="style_brown">immediately
			</span>fell through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave in <span class="style_brown">completely</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned the job down <span class="style_brown">straight away</span></em></li>
			<li>Adverbs may modify determiners, indefinite pronouns and numerals.&nbsp; E.g.:<br />
		<em><span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost</span> everyone came back safely<br />
		<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than </span>20 people came late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Nearly </span>600 guests were 
			invited</em></li>
			<li>A few adverbs (<em>such, rather, quite</em>) can <strong>pre-modify</strong> nouns and 
		noun phrases.&nbsp; E.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's <span class="style_brown">quite</span> a job.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		It was <span class="style_brown">such</span> idiocy<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The kitchen's <span class="style_brown">rather</span> a slum<br />
			</em>Some adverbs can also modify a noun directly, acting 
			adjectivally:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An away match<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above paragraph<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The then teacher of French<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upstairs bedrooms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The home journey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The backstage party<br />
			</em>Syntactical homonymy may be considered here and the alternative 
			analysis is to consider that these words can be adverbs or 
			adjectives depending on their grammatical function.</li>
			<li>Many adverbs can <strong>post-modify</strong> noun phrases and 
			they are of two sorts:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>Time adverbs:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party 
				<span class="style_brown">yesterday</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting 
				<span class="style_brown">afterwards</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument 
				<span class="style_brown">beforehand</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His sleeplessness 
				<span class="style_brown">overnight</span><br />
				</em>The adverbs <em>daytime, nighttime</em> and <em>overnight</em> 
			can all be used as pre-modifiers but they may better be considered 
			as adjectives when they do that as in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His daytime thought<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Her nighttime worries<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My overnight trip</em></li>
				<li>Place adverbs<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My journey 
				<span class="style_brown">overseas</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His way 
				<span class="style_brown">home</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That child 
				<span class="style_brown">there</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This customer 
				<span class="style_brown">here</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The road <span class="style_brown">ahead</span></em><br />Only a few of these can act either as pre-modifiers 
				or as 
			post-modifiers.&nbsp; They are: <em>upstairs, downstairs, home</em> 
			and <em>above</em>.&nbsp; Non-intuitively, <em>below</em> can only 
			be used as a post-modifier so, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the below paragraph</em><br />
				is not allowed but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the paragraph below<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the above paragraph</em><br />and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the paragraph above</em><br />are acceptable.<br />
				Again, especially when they pre-modify, some can be considered 
				adjectives so in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an upstairs room<br />
				</em>the word <em>upstairs</em> is adjectival rather 
				than adverbial.</li>

		<p>There is another way to classify adverbs on a less structural and 
		more functional basis.&nbsp; There is a guide to circumstances linked in the list of related guides at the end and the analysis is akin to what you will find 
		there.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Circumstantial adverbs</strong>:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Where?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How?</em></dt>
			<dd>An adverb which answers any of these questions is a 
			circumstantial adverb.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I stayed there</em> (a place adverb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He came early </em>(a time adverbial)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He walked fast</em> (a manner adverb)<br />
			As you can see, this classification applies to type-a adverbs 
			analysed above.<br />
			<strong>Circumstantial adverbs generally modify verb phrases.</strong></dd>
			<dt><strong>Additives, Exclusives, and Particularisers</strong>:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Including what?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excluding what?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focused on what?</em></dt>
			<dd>These adverbs perform one of three functions:<ol>
				<li>As <strong>additives</strong>, they act to join items 
				together and signal that they are equally important.<br />
				In 
				this way, they often function as conjuncts.&nbsp; For example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li><em>John's ideas are very important.&nbsp; Mary 
					<span class="style_brown">also </span>has 
					a good point, I believe.</em><br />
					Here, the adverb <em>also</em> functions to alert the hearer 
					/ reader to the fact that both ideas are to be considered on 
					a par and of equal standing</li>
					<li><em>I went to London.&nbsp; I met Mary, 
					<span class="style_brown">too</span>.</em><br />
					Here, the adverb <em>too</em> signals that both events are 
					of equal importance.&nbsp; There is no sense of 
					subordination.</li>
					<li><em>Mary is <span class="style_brown">both </span>a brilliant cook and a wonderful 
					dancer.</em><br />
					Here the adverb <em>both</em> plays the same equalising and 
					additive role.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>As <strong>exclusives</strong>, they serve to signal that 
				some events or states are not to be considered.<br />
				These are 
				also called <strong>restrictive</strong> adverbs because they 
				function to limit what it is we are saying to a particular 
				context.&nbsp; For 
				example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li><em>This meeting is called <span class="style_brown">solely
					</span>to consider the future 
					of the library</em>.<br />
					Here, the adverb <em>solely</em> signals that no other 
					discussion is appropriate.</li>
					<li><em>This is <span class="style_brown">just </span>a question of knowing how to work the 
					machine.</em><br />
					Here, the adverb <em>just</em> signals that no other 
					information is necessary, thus excluding, e.g., guesswork 
					and trial and error.</li>
					<li><em>I am <span class="style_brown">merely </span>at this meeting to take notes and report 
					back</em>.<br />
					Here, the adverb <em>merely</em> excludes any other possible 
					role for attending the meeting.&nbsp; The adverbs <em>simply</em> 
					or <em>only</em> 
					could be substituted with little change to the meaning.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>As <strong>particularisers</strong>, adverbs can signal the 
				speaker / writer's focus.<br />
				They are often to be found in 
				the initial position for emphasis and are frequently viewpoint 
				adjuncts signalling the angle from which the speaker is working.&nbsp; 
				They can also be disjuncts signalling the speaker's view 
				concerning how a whole statement should be understood.&nbsp; In 
				some analyses, these are called sentence adverbials because 
				their function is to modify the whole clause, not only the verb 
				or verb phrase.<br />
				For example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li><em>These birds are <span class="style_brown">mostly
					</span>found near fresh water.</em><br />
					Here, the adverb <em>mostly</em>, in contrast to an 
					exclusive such as <em>only</em>, serves to focus on water in 
					particular but also signals that other habitats are 
					possible.</li>
					<li><em>She is <span class="style_brown">generally </span>good at liaising with customers.</em><br />
					Here, the adverb <em>generally</em> signals the fact that 
					there are other possibilities but the focus is on the fact 
					that she is good at liaison.<br />
					As a disjunct, the word can signal the limitations the 
					speaker is placing on how one should understand what is 
					said.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em><span class="style_brown">Generally</span>, this is a good piece of work with much to 
					recommend it</em><br />
					where the disjunct signals the speaker's wish to be 
					understood as commenting with the restriction that what is 
					said does not apply to the whole piece of work.</li>
					<li><em><span class="style_brown">Predominately</span>, the course will focus on English for 
					Academic Purposes.</em><br />
					Here, the adverb <em>predominately</em> serves a similar 
					focusing function without excluding other elements of the 
					course.</li>

			<p>We saw above that many adverbs can act as linking items, 
			connecting ideas and making texts cohesive.&nbsp; The discoursal 
			function of some adverbs is often overlooked if people focus only on 
			those which modify verb phrases.<br />
			Conjuncts usually function anaphorically, linking a clause or 
			sentence to a preceding clause or sentence.<br />
			When adverbs function as conjuncts, they are often preceded by 
			conjunctions, often but not exclusively, coordinators.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She missed her train and, 
			<span class="style_brown">consequently</span>, 
			couldn't attend the wedding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They lost their keys so, <span class="style_brown">therefore</span>, had to break in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can drive you to the station but, 
			<span class="style_brown">alternatively</span>, there's a 
			bus from the corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was a wealthy person although, 
			<span class="style_brown">additionally</span>, somewhat 
			mean-spirited</em></p>
			<p>Here are some examples of what they do.&nbsp; For more, see the 
			guide to conjuncts listed in the list of related guides at the end.&nbsp; 
			In that guide 11 functions are identified but we'll simplify things 
			slightly here because, for teaching purposes, some functions can be 
			handled together and adverbs themselves do not function in all the 
			categories, some being the domain of prepositional phrases or 
			clauses.<br />
			In the following examples, we have omitted the first clause or 
			sentence but it can be easily imagined.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Listing and enumerating:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Secondly</span>, we come to the matter of 
				finance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Next</span>, we need to consider possible problems</em></li>
				<li>Adding<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Additionally</span>, there is the question of who should be 
				invited<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Furthermore</span>, he didn't write to thank us.</em></li>
				<li>Summing up<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Briefly</span>, this means we will have to start again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Concisely</span>, the problem is twofold</em></li>
				<li>Showing result<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Consequently</span>, he became very ill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Accordingly</span>, she attended the meeting in person</em></li>
				<li>Contrasting<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Alternatively</span>, you can stay here and I'll 
				go shopping<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Otherwise</span>, we'll be too late to get the tickets</em></li>
				<li>Equating<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Similarly</span>, she is very determined to go.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Equally</span>, the problem is solvable</em></li>
				<li>Topic switching (or signalling return to a previous topic)<br />
				These are sometimes referred to as transitional conjuncts.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Anyway</span>, what have you been doing 
				recently?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Anyhow</span>, how did he do?</em></li>
				<li>Expressing time<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Eventually</span>, she agreed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">Later</span>, we all went along with the idea</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As the examples show, conjunct adverbs are almost always fronted 
			in the second clause or sentence (as a consequence of their 
			anaphoric discourse role) but, often quite formally, they can be 
			inserted in the clause or take the end position, as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We arrive, <span class="style_brown">finally</span>, at the main item on the agenda<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She, <span class="style_brown">consequently</span>, arrived late at the meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They saved their money, <span class="style_brown">accordingly</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This problem is, <span class="style_brown">equally</span>, quite serious</em></p>

			<p>If the adverb is not separated by commas or by pausing between 
			separate tone units from the rest of the clause, then some ambiguity 
			arises.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband was displeased and she ended up similarly unhappy</em><br />
			means that we are comparing her unhappiness with 
			her husband's displeasure so the adverb is only modifying the adjective, 
			acting as an adjunct, which is commonly what adverbs do.&nbsp; However,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband became displeased and she ended up, similarly, unhappy</em><br />
			betokens that we are comparing her ending up unhappy with her 
			husband's becoming displeased and 
			the adverb is functioning as a conjunct linking the whole second 
			clause to the first.<br />
			Another example may help.<br />
			In:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; That's what the boss said is vital but this is equally 
			important</em><br />
			the adverb is modifying only the adjective <em>important</em> and 
			equating it to <em>vital</em>.&nbsp; However, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's what the boss said is vital but this 
			is, equally, important</em><br />
			the adverb is linking the whole sentence to a previous one and 
			implies that the boss saw <strong>both</strong> things as vital.<br />
			Fronting the adverbs removes the danger of ambiguity so the adverbs 
			in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband became displeased.&nbsp; Similarly, she ended up unhappy</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss said that is vital.&nbsp; Equally, 
			this is important<br />
			</em>are only interpretable as conjuncts.</p>

			<p>On this site, we avoid, generally, the use of the term 
			prepositional object, preferring to talk of prepositional 
			complements so, by our definition, the noun phrase <em>the mainline 
			railway station</em> is, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We arrived at the mainline railway station</em><br />
			the complement of the preposition <em>at</em>.<br />
			Some analyses prefer to use the term prepositional object for it 
			because that is how the noun phrase is acting.&nbsp; So be it.<br />
			Adverbs of time and place (only) often act as prepositional 
			complements, however, and, in that case, cannot sensibly be 
			described as objects because they are not noun phrases and the

				this site, do not find that convincing so assume that, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He has been here since lately<br />
				</em>is, in fact, malformed or at least very rare.)</li>
				<li>The preposition <em>till/until </em>will take many more

				We allow, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lived here after then<br />

					<h2>Negating adverbs</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		<p>In English, negation usually begins with the negator and continues to the end 
		of the clause so what comes before the negator is left in peace.&nbsp; 
		For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't go frequently = He went sometimes</em><br />
		but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He frequently didn't go = He often failed to go</em><br />
		Where the adverb is positioned in a negative sentence is, therefore, 
		critical to how it is understood.</p>
			<p>As we see from this example, there is a word-ordering issue with 
			some time adverbs when they are negated.&nbsp; The usual position 
			for adverbs of indefinite frequency such as <em>always, often, 
			sometimes, occasionally</em> etc. is to place them between any 
			auxiliary verbs and the main verb so we accept, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has frequently arrived late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sometimes go to his parties</em><br />
			but reject:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She has arrived frequently late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I go sometimes to his parties</em><br />
			However, when the sentence is negated, a different ordering is often 
			apparent so we accept:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hasn't frequently arrived late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't frequently arrive late</em><br />
			and we can also accept:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't go to his parties sometimes</em><br />
			and probably reject:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't sometimes go to his parties</em></p>
			<p>Above and elsewhere on this site, it is suggested 
			that neither <em>sometimes </em>nor<em> occasionally </em>occur in 
			negative clauses.&nbsp; That is usually true but as we see above, 
			not universally so.</p>
			<p>The same consideration applies when the adverb is modifying other 
		elements.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only Mary will be late = Other people will also be late</em><br />
		but<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary will not only be late = She will also do something else</em> 
		(such as complain about something)</p>

					<h2>Comparatives and superlatives of adverbs</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		<p>There are exceptions but for most adverbs the rule generally is that we use the 
		periphrastic constructions with <em>more</em> and <em>most </em>or<em> 
		less </em>and<em> least </em>to make 
		the comparative and superlative forms with adverbs, especially those ending in <em>-ly</em>, so we have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go <span class="style_brown">more often </span>than I used to</em> not (usually) ?<em><span class="style_brown">oftener</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go <span class="style_brown">less often</span> than I used to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was <span class="style_brown">more deeply</span> affected</em> 
		not *<em><span class="style_brown">deeplier</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sister was <span class="style_brown">the least deeply</span> affected<br />
		</em>and so on.<br />
		For a longer discussion of inflexion <em>vs</em>. periphrastic forms, see 		the 
		guide to adjectives.</p>
		<p>In very informal (wrong?) uses, we also find adjectives taking the place 
		of two-syllable (disyllabic) adverbs in clauses such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?<em>He drove <span class="style_brown">quicker</span><br />
		</em>This 
		really <strong>should</strong> be <em class="style_brown">more quickly</em>, of course.&nbsp; 
		Would you accept any of these?<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke <span class="style_brown">slower</span><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		He dressed <span class="style_brown">scruffier</span><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		She answered <span class="style_brown">happier</span></em></p>
		<p>Not all adverbs can be modified to form comparatives and 
		superlatives.<br />
		There are, for example, no comparative forms of adverbs of place<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *I waited <span class="style_brown">inside </span>but he 
		stayed <span class="style_brown">more inside</span></em><br />
			Adverbs of direction can be modified but not with the <em>more/most</em> 
			construction.&nbsp; Instead the preferred modifier is <em>further</em> 
			as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We drove further <span class="style_brown">northwards</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They went further <span class="style_brown">inside</span></em><br />
			but not:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The went more downwards<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She travelled more westwards</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They went more outside</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She travelled more away</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			This is non-intuitive for speakers of many languages which do allow 
			such modifications and a source of quite persistent, if rare, error.</p>
			<p>Not all adverbs of time can be modified so while we can have, for 
		example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; She <span class="style_brown">frequently </span>works late but 
		her boss <span class="style_brown">more frequently</span> does so</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She came <span class="style_brown">late </span>but I came
		<span class="style_brown">even later</span></em><br />
			because these refer to indefinite frequency and are by definition 
			gradable.<br />
			We cannot, however, make comparatives or superlatives with adverbs of absolute 
		time as in<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She's working <span class="style_brown">tomorrow</span></em><br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; John arrived <span class="style_brown">eventually</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have started <span class="style_brown">already</span></em><br />because
		<em>*more tomorrow, *more eventually</em> and <em>*more already </em>are 
		not available.<br />
			We can also not make comparatives and superlatives with adverbs of 
			definite frequency because <em>*more seasonally, *more yearly, *less 
			daily </em>etc. are not available, either.</p>
			<p>Some uncommon adverbs are formed with <em>wise, ward(s)</em> and
			<em>ways</em> and these are usually, for semantic reasons, 
			ungradable.&nbsp; However, the -<em>wards</em> series can be graded 
			as we saw with <em>further</em> to give, e.g.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled it <span class="style_brown">
			further upwards</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They continued <span class="style_brown">further homewards</span></em></p>

			<li>Some adverbs retain the same form as the adjective and for these 
			we use the same rules as the adjectives follow so we have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

			<span class="style_brown">faster</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke too <span class="style_brown">long

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He came <span class="style_brown">late</span> – She came 
			<span class="style_brown">later</span></em><br />
			To that list, in informal English, we can add a few very common 
			adjectives which, in the comparative forms can act as adverbs so we 
			hear:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They bought it <span class="style_brown">
			cheaper </span>than they thought possible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He played the music <span class="style_brown">louder </span>
			and <span class="style_brown">louder</span></em><br />
			and, perhaps:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?He just drove <span class="style_brown">
			quicker</span></em></li>
			<li>Some adverbs are irregular so we have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove <span class="style_brown">well</span>
			&ndash; She drove <span class="style_brown">better/the 
			best</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He drove <span class="style_brown">far</span> &ndash; She drove 
			<span class="style_brown">further/farther</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He drove <span class="style_brown">badly</span> &ndash; She drove 
			<span class="style_brown">worse</span></em><br />
			(<em>More badly </em>is heard in some varieties of English 
			especially if it is pre-modified with <em>even</em> so we can have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I played even <span class="style_brown">more badly </span>
			than I usually do</em>.)</li>
			<li>The adverb <em class="style_brown">soon </em>has no adjective form and we get: 
			<em class="style_brown">
			soon-sooner-soonest</em>.</li>

			<p>As is the case with adjectives, comparative and superlative forms 
			of adverbs may themselves be pre-modified, either to amplify the 
			sense or tone it down so we find, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came much sooner than I expected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did it a lot less carefully than he should<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She worked far more carefully after that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He needs to work a damn sight harder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked rather carefully on the ice<br />

		<p>There are two adverbs, <em>hardly</em> and <em>scarcely</em>, 
		which differ in meaning from the adjectives from which it appears they 
		are derived.&nbsp; Both these are commonly post-modified with another 
		adverb, <em>ever</em><strong>, only if the sense is habitual</strong>.&nbsp; 
		For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We <span class="style_brown">hardly (ever) </span>go to the cinema<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can <span class="style_brown">scarcely (ever)</span> trust him<br />
		</em>When the sense is non-habitual but refers to current ability, the 
		modifier is not permitted:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *My eyesight is poor and I can scarcely ever read this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We can hardly ever accept this price</em></p>
		<p>These two adverbs have no corresponding comparative and superlative 
		forms at all so expressions such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *We <span class="style_brown">more hardly</span> go there these days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I can <span class="style_brown">more scarcely</span> understand that</em><br />
		are not available.</p>
		<p>Both adverbs are negative in sense and therefore associated with 
		non-assertive forms of pronouns, determiners and other adverbs so we get, for 
		example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We <span class="style_brown">hardly </span>have 
		<span class="style_underline">any</span> whisky</em><br />
		not<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We <span class="style_brown">hardly </span>have

		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've <span class="style_brown">scarcely </span>started

					<h2>Adverbs in multi-word verbs</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		<p>Multi-word verbs come in a variety of flavours and shades but one 
		essential way to classify them is to consider whether the particle is an 
		adverb or a preposition.&nbsp; In the first case, they are classifiable as 
		phrasal verbs and the second as prepositional verbs.&nbsp; This matters 
		because the structures of the clauses in which they occur vary 
		considerably depending on the grammatical function of the particle.</p>
			<p>There is a good deal more about this in the guide to multi-word verbs, 
		linked in the list at the end.&nbsp; Here is will suffice to consider 
		how the adverbs work when paired with a verb.&nbsp; Adverbs, as we know, 
		modify verbs but prepositions act to link the verb with its object.&nbsp; 
		So, for example, in<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is looking at the sky</em><br />
		the particle <em>at</em> is a preposition as it usually is and it acts 
		to link the verb <em>look</em> with the object, <em>the sky</em>.<br />
		The preposition does not affect the meaning of the verb <em>look</em> in any way 
		and we can also have, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is looking through the window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is looking towards the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is looking under the newspaper</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She is looking in the fridge</em><br />
		and so on.&nbsp; Equally, we can change the verb to a close synonym 
		while keeping the preposition and the meaning remains unchanged so 
		we can have, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She is staring at the sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is gazing at the sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is peering at the sky</em><br />
		and so on.</p>
		<p>However, other particles are more frequently found both as 
		prepositions and as adverbs with no change in form.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		The word <em>up</em> can be a preposition as in, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked up the stairs</em><br />
		and it can be an adverb, as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She woke up the cat</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		Other words which can function as both prepositions and adverbs include:
		<em>around, down, in, off, on, out, over, round</em>.&nbsp; Another name for 
		the phenomenon of words sliding between classes is categorical 
		indeterminacy, by the way.</p>
			<p>Briefly, we can apply two tests to work out what role the lexemes 
			are playing and that will help us to define our terms and teach the 
			area consistently and accessibly:</p>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" >
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="test 1" height="62" src="../../../gfx/test1.gif" width="100" /></td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		<p>The distinguishing point is that adverbial particles combine with the 
		verb to make a new meaning but prepositional particles simply link the 
		verb with its object although the meaning of the verb may be a 
		metaphorical use such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He stuck at his work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They talked around the main issue<br />
		</em>etc.<br />
		Because the combination of verb + adverb results in a new and often 
		unpredictable meaning, the item is best learned and produced as a single 
		lexeme which can often be separated with the object interposed as in, 
		e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked the word up on the internet.<br />
		</em>The test is to see what happens when we change the particle word so, we allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked down the stairs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked through the park<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked over the bridge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked in the village<br />
		</em>etc. but, if we change <em>up</em> to anything else in the second example, we get 
		nonsense:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She woke down the cat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She woke through the cat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She woke over the cat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She woke in the cat</em></p>

				</tr>
				</table>
		<p>A second test for whether a word is acting as a preposition or an 
		adverb is to give it a complement (or object, if you prefer).&nbsp; 
		Prepositions take complements (or objects), adverbs do not.&nbsp; So, 
		for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed by the church on her way</em><br />
		is a case of a preposition, <em>by</em>, taking the complement (or 
		object) <em>the church</em> to form a prepositional phrase and the 
		preposition <em>on</em> taking as its complement the noun phrase <em>her 
		way</em>.&nbsp; We could also have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed in front of my house during her journey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed along the riverside on her tour</em><br />
		Here the structure is:<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>verb + prepositional phrase(s)</strong></span>.<br />
		However, when we consider:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed up the chance</em><br />
		we have <em>up</em> functioning as an adverb, changing the meaning of 
		the verb <em>pass</em> from <em>go by</em> to <em>deny oneself</em>, because the 
		structure is:<br />
		<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phrasal verb + direct object</strong></span><br />
		and in this case, the verb is not <em>pass</em>, it is <em>pass up</em> 
		as can immediately be seen if one replaces the adverb with another:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed over her ID card<br />
		</em>where the adverb is combining with the verb to make new meanings (<em>surrender
		</em>or <em>transfer</em>).</p>

				</table>
		<p>The temptation is, however, to categorise all verbs which are 
		followed by adverbs as phrasal verbs and encourage learners to commit 
		them to memory as single concepts.&nbsp; This is mistaken because in 
		many cases the adverb is simply functioning to modify the verb rather 
		than combining with it to make a new meaning.<br />
		In some sources, then, one finds such expressions as: <em>call back, get 
		on, get off, go ahead, run after, walk around</em> and a host of others 
		described as phrasal verbs.&nbsp; They are in fact no such thing; they 
		are just verbs followed by modifying adverbs and that becomes clear when 
		we replace the verb with a near synonym or replace the adverb with 
		another.&nbsp; So we can have, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called him back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I phoned him back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I texted him back</em><br />
		just as we can have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I called him later<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I phoned him again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I texted him frequently</em><br />
		and so on.&nbsp; The sense of the verb in all cases is unchanged by the 
		choice of adverb.<br />
		A notorious case concerns the expressions <em>get on</em> and <em>get 
		off</em> (e.g. <em>a bus</em>) which are often described as phrasal 
		verbs.&nbsp; They aren't really because we can apply the same test and 
		replace the adverb or the verb so we can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stepped off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She jumped off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hopped off<br />
		</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got out</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She got away</em><br />
		So, asking learners to consider learning these as fixed expressions is 
		not a good use of their time.&nbsp; A better use is to take the time to 
		learn the meaning of the adverbs and that is often parallel to the 
		meaning the word has when it is used as a preposition.&nbsp; It is a 
		short step from understanding<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She took the paper off the table</em><br />
		where <em>off</em> is a preposition, to understanding<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got off near her house</em><br />
		where <em>off</em> is an adverb,
		because both refer to movement away from.<br />
		It is even asserted (out here on the web but rarely in serious reference 
		resources) that <em>sit down </em>is a phrasal verb.&nbsp; It isn't of 
		course, because we can also have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sit up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sit back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sit forward<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sit still<br />
		</em>and so on and in all cases the verb retains its simple meaning but 
		the manner of it is modified by the following adverb.</p>
		<p>There is more about this fallacy in the guide to multi-word verbs.</p>

			<p>In many varieties of English, including some British 
			dialects, it is informally acceptable to use an adjective where a 
			purist would demand an adverb.&nbsp; We hear and read, therefore, 
			e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He ran quick<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She explained clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It burnt bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was hurt bad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They looked close<br />
			</em>and so on.<br />
			Such uses are quite common in AmE (and much bemoaned by some 
			American writers).&nbsp; In British English, especially in some 
			dialect forms, uses such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We don't speak proper round here</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak nice to your grandma</em><br />
			are also common.<br />
			Even in more formal English, some uses of adjectives where an adverb 
			would be technically required are seen and heard as in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come quick!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived as quick as she could<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were hurt quite bad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked closer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She copied it near perfect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was sore afraid</em></p>
			<p>(Historically, the separation of adverbs from adjectives was not 
			rigidly made until well after Shakespeare's time and word classes of 
			all sorts were much more fluid.&nbsp; When people began to attempt 
			to codify the language some recommended a distinction, for example, 
			between the preposition <em>toward</em> and the adverb <em>towards</em> 
			(only the latter survives commonly as a preposition).&nbsp; The 
			recommendation, too, was to make a distinction between the adverb
			<em>forwards</em> and the adjective <em>forward</em> (and both are 
			now routinely used as adverbs while <em>forward</em> as an adjective 
			is somewhat rare and akin in meaning to <em>impertinent</em> or <em>
			unashamed</em>)).</p>

			<p>Purists should not take their insistence on the 
			adjective-adverb distinction too far.&nbsp; Consider, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hammer the iron repeatedly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hammer the iron flat</em><br />
			In the first, we have the normal adverb modifying the verb <em>
			hammer</em>, of course, and none would complain about the rightness 
			of the use.&nbsp; However, in the second, few would suggest that the 
			word should be <em>flatly</em> as in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He flatly refused to help</em><br />
			What we have here is an example of a proleptic use of an adjective, 
			not an adjective masquerading as an adverb at all.&nbsp; Proleptic 
			means, roughly speaking, <em>anticipatory</em> and proleptic use implies that we are considering the end 
		effect, not the current action.&nbsp; In other words, the adjective is 
			modifying the noun <em>iron</em> (as is the proper role of adjectives), not the 
			verb.&nbsp; Other examples of such uses are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Play the music loud<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll the pastry smooth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pull the rope tight</em><br />
			in which the adjective is being used to modify <em>the music, pastry
			</em>and 
			<em>rope</em>, respectively and not modifying the verb.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Play the music loudly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll the pastry smoothly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pull the rope tightly</em><br />
			in which the adverb is preferred because it is the verb (manner) 
			which we wish to modify.</p>

		<p>Some adjectives, it was noted above, look like adverbs and 
		this betrays their origin.&nbsp; For example, the adjective <em>friendly</em> 
		looks very much like an adverb with its -<em>ly</em> ending&nbsp;and gives 
		rise to the awkward expression <em>friendlily</em> as its parallel 
		adverb.<br />
		Originally, the word derives from Old English <em>freondliche</em>, and 
		the -<em>che</em> inflexion was lost later so the word now functions 
		only as an adjective having passed through a phase in which it performed 
		both roles.<br />
		The word <em>seemly</em>, for example, has a similar route into modern English and now 
		the -<em>ly</em> inflexion is routinely used to make adverbs and 
		the suffix -<em>y</em> to make adjectives.</p>
			<p>Here's a short list of adjectives which look like 
		adverbs and cause some awkwardness when we try to form the corresponding 
		adverb.&nbsp; Many will not accept the unattractive forms such as <em>
		livelily, measlily</em> and so on.</p>

			<p>Many of these words are the result of conventional -<em>y</em> 
			suffixation to form an adjective from a verb or noun with the word 
			from which they are formed happening to end in <em>-l </em>or -<em>le</em>.&nbsp; 
			Nonce words, such as <em>jungly</em> or <em>tangly</em>, may often 
			be formed this way because the -<em>y</em> suffix is still very 
			productive in the formation of adjectives from nouns.</p>
			<p>All adjectives referring to definite frequency in this list are also adverbial 
			so we allow both, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had an hourly meeting</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We met hourly<br />
			</em>The words <em>seasonally</em> and <em>annually</em> do not work 
			in this way, being confined to adverb status, derived from the 
			adjectives <em>seasonal</em> and <em>annual</em>.</p>
			<p>The adverb <em>early</em> also functions as an adjective so we 
			can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had an early breakfast</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ate breakfast early</em></p>
			<p>The words <em>kindly</em> and <em>unkindly</em> are both adverbs 
			formed from the adjective <em>kind</em> but also, confusingly, 
			operate as adjectives so we allow, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke kindly / unkindly</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a kindly / unkindly man</em></p>
			<p>Adverbs formed from such adjectives are so unappealing to many 
			that the preferred adverbial expression will be something like:<br />
			<span class="style_black">
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a(n)</em> [adjective] 
			 <em>manner / way</em></span>.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke to me in a friendly way<br />
			</em>not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke to me friendlily</em></p>
			<p>If you would like that list as a PDF document,
			<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_adjectives_masquerading_as_adverbs.pdf" target="_blank">
			click here</a>.</p>
			<p>A few adjective-adverb forms are identical and the list includes
			<em>hard</em> and <em>fast</em> so we find:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a fast car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a hard job<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove too fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They worked very hard</em><br />
			And also:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need an outside light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went outside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's in the upstairs / downstairs study<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked upstairs / downstairs<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<p>Finally, there are some adjectives which take on adverb-like 
			characteristics because, semantically, they imply the description of 
			a verb not a noun.&nbsp; In this list we find:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She's a hard worker</em> (i.e., <em>She works hard</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It's a fast road</em> (i.e., <em>You can drive fast on it</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They are frequent visitors</em> (i.e., <em>They visit 
			frequently</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I was a heavy smoker</em> (i.e., <em>I smoked heavily</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She's a light sleeper</em> (i.e., <em>She sleeps lightly</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They are occasional customers</em> (i.e., <em>They come 
			occasionally</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It was heavy rain</em> (i.e., <em>It rained heavily</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She's an attractive writer</em> (i.e., <em>She writes 
			attractively</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He's a beautiful singer</em> (i.e., <em>He sings 
			beautifully</em>)<br />
			In all these cases, the usual meaning of the adjective does not 
			apply to the noun phrase, it applies to the way something is done so 
			the adjectives are really adverbials.</p>

		<p>All languages have ways to modify verbs and adjectives but how they 
		do it and how recognisably different an adverb is from an adjective is 
		very variable.&nbsp; No list of this kind is likely to get close to 
		being exhaustive but here are some of the most obvious variations.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>suffixation</strong></dt>
			<dd>English frequently forms adverbs by suffixation, usually with -<em>ly,
			</em>as we saw, but there are other possibilities such as -<em>wards</em>.<br />
			Many, especially European, languages do the same kind of thing:<br />
			Romance languages, such as Spanish, Romanian, French and Italian, 
			often add a suffix like -<em>ment</em> or -<em>mente</em> to the 
			adjective form, from the Latin <em>mentis</em> [<em>mind</em>].&nbsp; For example, the 
			English adverb <em>comfortably</em> translates as:<br />
			<em>cómodamente</em> (Spanish), <em>comodamente</em> (Italian), <em>
			confortablement</em> (French), <em>confortavelmente</em> 
			(Portuguese) and so on.<br />
			Scandinavian languages also use a suffix, -<em>t</em>, to make the 
			adverb from the adjectives but, unfortunately, this sometimes makes 
			it identical to a form of the adjective.&nbsp; For example, <em>
			comfortable</em> translates as:<br />
			<em>bekvämt</em> (Swedish), <em>komfortabelt</em> (Danish and 
			Norwegian).<br />
			Japanese, too, has a range of suffixes to denote the change in word 
			class, for example, the addition of /ku/ to the stem so we get:<br />
			<em>haya</em> (<em>quick</em>) and <em>hayaku</em> (<em>quickly</em>).<br />
			Hungarian works similarly with four possible suffixes.<br />
			Standard Arabic also has a suffix to denote an adverb (-<em>an</em>).&nbsp; 
			Other varieties may differ.<br />
			Once learners with these backgrounds are alert to the parallel 
			suffixation phenomenon, it is usually reasonably easy for them to 
			form English adverbs naturally.</dd>
			<dt><strong>replacing the suffix</strong></dt>
			<dd>In some languages, an adjective may be recognisable from its 
			suffix and in some of these, the suffix denoting an adjective is 
			removed and replaced by one denoting an adverb.<br />
			Greek, for example, replaces an inflexional suffix on an adjective 
			to make it an adverb (usually by inserting -<em>os</em> or -<em>a</em>) so
			<em>comfortable</em> translates as:<br />
			<em>άνετος (ahnetos)</em><br />
			but <em>comfortably</em> translates as<br />
			<em>άνετα (ahneta).</em><br />
			In Russian also, and some other Slavic languages, including Latvian, 
			adverbs can be formed by removing the adjectival suffixes from the 
			adjective and replacing it with the adverb suffix (often -<em>o</em> 
			in Russian).<br />
			In Korean, adverbs are often formed in a similar way, replacing endings 
			rather than simply adding them.<br />
			In these languages, the normal inflexions that the adjectives take 
			to agree with the nouns they modify are dropped when the adverb is 
			formed.</dd>
			<dt><strong>using the adjective forms</strong></dt>
			<dd>Dutch and German can use the same form as the adjective but make 
			it operate, invariably, as an adverb.&nbsp; Both the adjective <em>
			comfortable</em> and the adverb <em>comfortably</em> then translate 
			simply as:<br />
			<em>bequem</em> (German) and <em>comfortabel</em> (Dutch and 
			Afrikaans).<br />
			Turkish, Persian languages (except on words derived from Arabic), Bosnian, 
			Croatian and Slovenian, too, make adjective forms stand equally well 
			as adverbs.<br />
			Learners from these language backgrounds may not see the necessity 
			to change the form of an adjective when it is converted into an 
			adverb and that leads to error such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He drove quick<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I sat comfortable</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>non-inflecting or isolating languages</strong></dt>
			<dd>The classic example here is the Chinese languages in which a new 
			word is inserted to denote the adverbial use of an attribute and 
			distinguish it from the adjective.</dd>
