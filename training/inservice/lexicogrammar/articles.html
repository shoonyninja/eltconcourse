			</table>
			<p>English does not use the full range of articles (and it is 
			unlikely that any language does) but there are possibilities in all 
			languages and some will use more or fewer of the possible articles 
			to determine nouns.</p>
			<p>Here they are, with a few comments:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The indefinite article:<br />
				In English this is either <em>a</em> or <em>an</em> but some 
				will include <em>some</em> as a plural indefinite article.<br />
				Example are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an interesting book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came to a halt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me some coins<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have wasted an hour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a(n) historic moment<br />
				</em>The issue for some learners is that the article <em>an </em>
				occurs slightly irregularly.<br />
				The general rule is that we use<em> an </em>before a vowel 
				sound, but we use <em>a </em>before a consonant sound and in 
				both cases disregard how the word is spelled because this is a 
				pronunciation issue.&nbsp; So we get, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an artist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sculptor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a European issue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an honourable man<br />
				</em>When the /h/ sound is unstressed, many BrE speakers will 
				also use <em>an </em>instead of <em>a </em>so we have:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an historic moment<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				and some will choose to use <em>an</em> before <em>hotel</em> 
				because the word is quite recently imported from French and the 
				'h' is not sounded in that language.<br />
				In quite a lot of languages which have an indefinite article, it 
				is indistinguishable from the numeral <em>one</em> (and if not 
				the same, then closely related to it).&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, the 
				article <em>a/an</em> is derived from the word for <em>one</em> 
				in English and is a reduced form of it.</li>
				<li>The definite article<br />
				In English this is solely the word <em>the</em> because English 
				does not have alternatives dependent on gender or number so we 
				have e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people all arrived late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car went off the road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The choice is limited</em><br />
				Again, there is a pronunciation issue.<br />
				The article is pronounced /ði/ before a vowel sound and /ðə/ 
				before a consonant sound, again, regardless of how a word is 
				spelled.&nbsp; We have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the apple</em> (/ði.ˈæp.l̩/)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man</em> (/ðə.mæn/)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Euro</em> (/ðə.ˈjʊə.rəʊ/)<br />
				etc.<br />
				And again, the unstressed /h/ sound is slightly problematic 
				because some will choose to pronounce<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the historical facts</em><br />
				as /ðə.hɪ.ˈstɒ.rɪk.l̩.fækts/<br />
				and some will prefer /ði.hɪ.ˈstɒ.rɪk.l̩.fækts/.<br />
				In a range of languages which do not have a definite article (or 
				any article system at all) the equivalent of the definite 
				article is often a demonstrative determiner roughly translatable 
				as <em>this</em> or <em>that, these </em>or <em>those</em>.<br />
				In fact, the definite article in English shares an etymology 
				with the demonstrative determiners and can be seen as a reduced 
				form or them in Modern English.&nbsp; In other words, <em>this, 
				that, these</em> and <em>those</em> can be conceptualised as 
				forms of the definite article marked for spatial relationships 
				(near or far) and number (singular or plural).</li>
				<li>The proper article:<br />
				This is somewhat rare in English but occurs frequently in other 
				languages leading some into error.<br />
				For example, in Greek, Portuguese and Catalan, it is 
				conventional to use an article before people's name (<em>the 
				Peter, the Maria </em>etc.).&nbsp; This also happens in informal 
				use in German, French, Italian and Spanish.<br />
				The proper article occurs less often in English but examples 
				are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mr Jones I spoke to was very helpful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Strand is a road in London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kremlin is in Moscow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gambia is in Africa</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Usage varies and countries once conventional referred to with 
				the proper article are no longer referred to that way so we 
				have, e.g., <em>Ukraine</em>, not <em>The Ukraine</em>.<br />
				Modified country names conventional use the proper article:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Soviet Union<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Arab Emirates</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>The partitive article:<br />
				This only occurs in English with the determiner <em>some</em> as 
				in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please give me some paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass me some pens</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				However, other languages use the partitive article frequently 
				and these include French, Greek, Italian and a range of others and in 
				many of those languages 
				they consist of a combination of the definite article with a 
				preposition.&nbsp; For example, in French, <em>à + le </em>= <em>
				au</em> and <em>de + le </em>= <em>du</em>.&nbsp; In Italian, 
				the preposition <em>di</em> combines with the definite article 
				to produce <em>dello</em>, <em>della</em> and other forms 
				equivalent to <em>some</em> or <em>any</em> in English and 
				called a partitive article.&nbsp; In Greek, the proposition <em>
				se</em> combines with articles to form <em>ston</em>, <em>sti</em> 
				and so on.</li>
				<li>The negative article:<br />In English, this role is taken by the word 
				<em>no</em> which 
				acts as a simple determiner.&nbsp; However, other languages may 
				reserve an article-like item for this function.&nbsp; German, 
				for example has the word <em>kein</em> which is inflected in the 
				same way as the indefinite article to show gender and number.<br />Fundamentally, English does not use a negative article but for 
				those whose languages do, comparing <em>no</em> to the 
				indefinite article has some validity.</li>
				<li>Zero article:<br />
				As the name implies, this is an absence of an article and is 
				usually represented as ∅.&nbsp; Because English has a definite 
				article denoting specificity as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me the money</em><br />
				it also employs the zero article to denote an unspecified object 
				before a count or mass noun as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take books with you</em><br />
				The word <em>some</em> can be used as an indefinite plural 
				article or to determine a mass noun as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me some money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take some books with you</em><br />
				It is unhelpful to describe the lack of an article in languages 
				which do not have an article system or those which have a 
				reduced system as the zero article.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Languages differ dramatically in the use of articles (and some 
			don't use them at all).&nbsp; Here's a short list but you should 
			rely on your own research into the language(s) of your learners.&nbsp; 
			Asking them is often useful as it alerts them to differences.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Languages with no article system</dt>
				<dd>These include most Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, 
				Bosnian, Czech etc.) as well as Chinese languages, Indonesian, 
				Japanese, Hindi and Urdu.<br />
				For speakers of these languages, using the correct article in 
				English is very challenging because they do not easily 
				conceptualise the need to mark specificity and non-specificity 
				or count vs. mass nouns.</dd>
				<dt>Language with no indefinite article</dt>
				<dd>These include most Celtic languages (Breton, Welsh, Gaelic, 
				Irish etc.) and Turkish, Farsi and Arabic (which often encodes 
				the definite article as a prefix).</dd>
				<dt>Languages using affixation for articles</dt>
				<dd>Some languages do not have a separate word class of articles 
				but may use a similar system by adding suffixes to nouns.&nbsp; 
				These include Albanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Bengali, Romanian 
				and Scandinavian languages.<br />
				Other languages such as Hebrew and Maltese use prefixes to 
				denote an article system akin to English.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Many languages alter articles to show gender (most European 
			languages) and it is impossible to use any noun, even an invented 
			one, without first considering its gender.&nbsp; European languages 
			have two or three genders normally although more are possible.<br />
			Some languages, such as Basque, Georgian and most Native American 
			languages distinguish between animate and inanimate nouns through 
			the use of gender.</p>
			<p>Languages which are traditionally described as being article-less 
			such as Japanese and Cantonese often use classifiers (sometimes 
			called counters) to denote a 
			wide range of properties in the nouns such as animacy, flatness, 
			stick-like appearance and so on.&nbsp; For more, see
			<a href="classifiers_partitives.html">the guide to classifiers, 
			partitives and group nouns</a>.</p>
			<p>English, on the 
			other hand, has no gender marking on articles but a deeply important 
			distinction between definite and indefinite and specific and 
			non-specific (or generic) concepts which is 
			entirely lacking in many other languages.&nbsp; English also makes 
			use, as we shall see, of the notions of mass and count nouns lacking in many other languages.</p>
			<p>In what follows, we shall not be considering the negative article
			<em>no</em> or the partitive article <em>some</em> but we will look 
			at the indefinite, definite and zero articles in English and 
			consider proper articles in English as a subset of the definite 
			article.</p>

		<p>Decide what you are talking about.&nbsp; There are <strong>only</strong> 
		three choices:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>One or some of many &ndash; indefinite specific reference.&nbsp; 
			This means that the speaker / writer is referring to a specific 
			class of nouns but not to the specific instance of the noun.&nbsp; 
			In other words, the noun is not identifiable by the reader / hearer 
			other than knowing the class of nouns to which reference is being 
			made.&nbsp; The speaker / writer may or may not know more about the 
			noun but this information is not being communicated to the hearer / 
			reader.&nbsp; Compare this to the third point, below.<br />
			For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A man arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information got lost<br />
			</em>In these examples, the hearer / reader only knows what sort of 
			noun is in question (i.e., specific reference) but does not 
			know any more about the noun (i.e., the reference is indefinite).<br />
			The reference is <strong>specific but indefinite</strong>.</li>
			<li>All of them, everywhere &ndash; generic reference.&nbsp; This 
			means the speaker / writer is referring to a whole class of nouns, 
			not a single instance of the class.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wheel was an important invention<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A solicitor deals with legal matters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctors charge a lot in my country<br />
			</em>In these examples, the speaker / writer is referring not to 
			single instances of the nouns but to the whole class of nouns in 
			general.<br />
			The reference is, then, <strong>generic but indefinite</strong>.</li>
			<li>This one exactly &ndash; definite specific reference.&nbsp; This 
			means the speaker / writer is referring to a single, known instance 
			of the noun.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man spoke to me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; London is the capital of Britain<br />
			</em>Here, the reference is both definite (we know which noun is 
			being referred to) and specific (we know what sort of noun is in 
			question).&nbsp; Normally, both the writer / speaker and the reader 
			/ hearer are aware of some or all of the noun's characteristics and 
			can use that information to distinguish between instances of the 
			noun in question.<br />
			The reference is <strong>definite and specific</strong>.</li>
		</ol>

			</table>
		<p>In each of these categories, there's a choice of which article to 
		use.<br />
		If we are talking about indefinite specific reference (<strong>one of 
		many or some of many</strong>), we can have, e.g.,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A man came in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men 
		came in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good furniture is expensive<br />
		</em>If we are talking about generic reference (<strong>all of them, 
		everywhere</strong>), we can have<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A car is useful in the country<br />
		</em>or<br />
		<em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cars pollute<br />
		</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Petrol is expensive<br />
		</em>or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cat is an independent animal<br />
		</em>If we are talking about definite specific reference (<strong>this 
		one exactly</strong>), we can have:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car is outside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sugar is 
		in the cupboard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cars are here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great Britain is an island</em></p>

			It matters if the noun is countable or uncountable (i.e., a mass 
			noun), singular or 
		plural.<br />
			English is not unique but it does has a fundamental and very 
			important distinction between mass and count nouns.&nbsp; Languages 
			which do not have this distinction (or in which the distinction is 
			not grammatically significant) generally have much simpler article 
			systems, or none at all.&nbsp; It is almost impossible to use a noun 
			correctly in English unless one has first considered whether it is 
			being used as a mass noun or a count noun.<br />		<h4><a name="isr"></a>Indefinite specific reference (one of many)<br />

			singular</strong> as representative of all such as <em>unicorn</em> 
			or<em> wheel</em>, you use the definite article <em>the
			</em>or the indefinite article <em>a(n).<br />
			</em>So you have, e.g.<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train is usually cheaper than driving alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smart phone has changed people's lives<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dog is a faithful animal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unicorn is a 
			mythical beast<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			The indefinite article may be used to speak of generic and specific 
			reference such as in<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; A train is a comfortable way to travel</em><br />
			The issue is often stylistic and we could equally say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trains are a comfortable way to travel</em><br />
			which many might consider less formal and stilted.</li>

					<h2>Articles in discourse</h2>

			</table>
			<p>
			Articles have a discourse function and, as with much in connected 
			discourse, a good deal depends on shared information.</p>
			<p>
			Course books for learners will often have simplified (and often 
			inaccurate) 'rules' for article use and we have set out the three 
			main ones above.&nbsp; When these rules are apparently broken, the 
			explanation often lies in the nature of the use of articles in 
			discourse.<br />
			Consider these examples:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A car arrived outside my door and the 
				driver got out and walked up the path.</em><br />
				If we follow the rule that the noun <em>car</em> here is 
				specific but indefinite reference (i.e., it refers to one of 
				many countable objects), then that happily explains the use of 
				the indefinite article, <em>a</em>.<br />
				However, the noun <em>driver</em> is also specific indefinite 
				reference, isn't it?&nbsp; So, why the definite article which in 
				the chart above is not an option because that applies to 
				definite specific reference?<br />
				The answer lies in the shared information.&nbsp; We know that 
				only one driver is permitted <em>per</em> car and we also know 
				which car is in question (it is the one which arrived) so we 
				are, in fact, talking about definite specific reference and the 
				rule above is not broken.<br />
				This will also explain the use of <em>the path</em> because, 
				again, the use of the definite article tells the hearer that the 
				speaker has only one path from the car to the house (or, at 
				least, that this path is only one that is relevant to what 
				happened next).&nbsp; If the sentence had been<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A car arrived and a driver got out and 
				walked up a path</em><br />
				then different messages will be sent:<br />
				In this case it means that this driver was not actually driving 
				the car at all but is a member of a class of drivers so it then 
				becomes indefinite specific reference (just as the article in
				<em>a car </em>is being used).&nbsp; It also means that there 
				were more than one paths and the person chose one of them, not a 
				definite one from those available so that, too, is indefinite 
				specific reference.</li>
				<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We chose a present for my brother but it was 
				not a present he wanted</em><br />
				Here, we have <em>a present</em> chosen from innumerable 
				possibilities so the first article follows the rule: we are 
				talking about a single specific but indefinite case so the 
				indefinite article is valid.<br />
				However, we then have <em>a present</em> again and this time it 
				seems that the reference is definite <strong>and</strong> 
				specific because we know what the present was (the one we 
				chose).&nbsp; Should it not, then, be <em>the present</em>?<br />
				It could be, of course, but that would imply that he had other 
				presents in mind that he did want (a definite and specific 
				present) and the use of the article <em>the</em> would imply 
				that.<br />
				However here, two things are happening:<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>We have the dummy or existential <em>it</em>-clause in
					<em>it was not a present he wanted</em> so that serves to 
					denote the definite nature of the present</li>
					<li>We then have an indefinite article implying that from a 
					large number of possible presents, this one was not wanted 
					and that is indefinite specific reference so the rules are 
					not broken, it is the discourse intentions of the statement 
					that leads to the article choice.&nbsp; If we compare:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he didn't want a gift like 
					this</em><br />
					with<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he didn't want the gift</em><br />
					the difference becomes plain.&nbsp; The first is indefinite 
					specific reference and the second is definite specific 
					reference.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; A cat can be good company for lonely people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cat is an independent animal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cats are independent animals<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The domestic cat is descended from wild animal in the Middle 
				East</em><br />
				If these are all examples of generic reference to countable 
				nouns, why the difference?<br />
				Partly, as was said above, this is a stylistic issue.<br />
				The use of the indefinite article to refer to a generic case of 
				a countable noun requires the use of the singular form.&nbsp; It 
				is generally considered to be stylistically rarer and more 
				formal.<br />
				The form of choice is usually the plural as in the third example 
				but the second example is common enough.<br />
				In the first example, we have a grey area because it may be 
				assumed that the speaker is referring to indefinite specific 
				reference (on the left of the diagram above) and suggesting that 
				lonely people should acquire a cat (<em>any</em> cat) for 
				company rather than suggesting that all cats are suitable as 
				company for all lonely people.<br />
				The final example, too, verges on definite reference (on the 
				right of the diagram) because of the use of the classifier <em>
				domestic</em>.&nbsp; Classifiers often have the function of 
				moving the generic to the definite in terms of reference so the 
				use of the definite article is appropriate.</li>

		<h4>Exceptions with <em>the</em></h4>
		<p>The English article system is often wrongly presented as an 
		impossibly difficult area.&nbsp; As we saw, however, the rules are quite 
		simple.&nbsp; There are, however, a few quirks and exceptions concerned 
		with the use of the definite article.&nbsp; Many of these, however, can 
		be traced back to the rules above.<br />
		These aren't lesson topics &ndash; they should be taught as and when 
		they arise.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>One teachable case of definite specific reference (this one 
			exactly) is when the noun has been mentioned or it can be assumed 
			that a unique reference is intended <strong>and understood</strong>.<br />
			So we get, e.g.<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A car drove by and the driver waved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
			toilet's probably upstairs<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			This is often referred to as the unknown-known rule and can easily 
			be explained that way.&nbsp; An alternative explanation of a 
			sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bought <span class="style_underline">
			<strong>a</strong></span> new car.&nbsp;
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>The</strong></span> car broke 
			down on her first journey</em>.<br />
			is:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>in the first instance, we are referring to an indefinite 
				specific reference for a countable noun and that, as we saw, 
				requires the indefinite article.</li>
				<li>in the second instance, we are now referring to a definite 
				specific reference for a countable noun (because we now know 
				that the car was hers) and that requires the 
				use of the definite article.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>When a noun is modified, it's also a sign of definite specific 
			reference.<br />
			So we get, e.g.<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who is married to the Minister<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
			author of this article<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl in the corner<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Modification takes many forms.<br />
			A subset of this category 
			contains country names which are modified by an adjective such as 
			United, Islamic, Peoples' or Federal: <em>the United States, 
			the Federal Republic</em> etc.&nbsp; Otherwise, nations and 
			languages take ∅ (the zero article).&nbsp; Another subset contains 
			things like <em>the Doppler Effect, The Theory of Relativity</em> 
			etc. but when the possessive <em>'s</em> is used there is 
			no article:<em> Einstein's Theory, Murphy's Law.</em></li>
			<li>Unique objects (or objects unique in a certain shared setting):
			<em>the sun, the moon, the Milky Way, the queen, the president </em>
			etc.&nbsp; A subset of this category contains things like 
			nationalities, geographical areas and superlatives: <em>the Greeks, 
			the French, the biggest building, The Atlantic </em>etc.<br />
			The latter 
			can be explained by noting that the modifier has been omitted: <em>
			The Atlantic (Ocean),
			The (River) Amazon, The Tate (Gallery) The Alps (Range), The Hilton 
			(Hotel).&nbsp; </em>Note the convention to capitalise the article in 
			some cases.&nbsp; Plural countries always take the article: <em>The 
			Netherlands, The Bahamas, The Seychelles.</em></li>
			<li>Families count as plural definite specific reference: <em>Take 
			tea with the Windsors</em></li>
			<li>Rivers always take the definite article<em> the</em>, even if 
			they aren't unique: <em>The Stour, The Thames, The Nile.&nbsp;
			</em>Lakes don't usually but modification (<em>The Great Lakes</em>)<em>
			</em>occurs.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Exceptions with &empty; (the zero article)</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Some common prepositional phrases often with verbs like <em>go, 
			have, get, eat, </em>and <em>be </em>involve indefinite specific reference: <em>go by 
			bus, be in school / church / prison / hospital, go to university</em> 
			etc.&nbsp; The nouns are nearly always means of transport, meals, 
			illnesses or institutions:<em> have appendicitis, get flu, eat 
			lunch, travel by air, go to college </em>etc.</li>
			<li>Times<em> </em>with the prepositions<em> at, by, after, before</em> 
			take the zero article but those following <em>during </em>and<em> in</em> 
			take <em>the</em>: <em>at dawn / sunset / night, by dusk / sunrise / 
			evening, after dark, before nightfall, during the day, in the 
			morning</em> etc.</li>
			<li>Parallel structures take &empty;: <em>hand in hand, man to man, 
			right to left, pen in hand</em> etc.</li>
