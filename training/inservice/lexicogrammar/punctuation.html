		<p>As usual, languages differ and punctuation conventions are very 
		variable.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>European languages</strong></dt>
			<dd>Most of these use the same marks as English but conventions vary 
			considerably.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The usual double quotation marks in 
			English ("text") appear in French as &laquo; text &raquo; and in German as &bdquo;text&rdquo; 
			or &laquo;text&raquo;.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Greek uses ';' as English uses '?' and uses a raised point [Â·] as a colon or semi-colon.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Spanish demands an inverted 
			sign before exclamations and questions as in &iexcl;&nbsp;Text !, &iquest; 
			text ?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Spacing varies with some languages 
			inserting a space before or after marks (notably French and Spanish).</dd>
			<dt><strong>Chinese languages</strong></dt>
			<dd>Modern written Chinese uses a range of marks imported from 
			Europe including the comma, semi-colon, colon, exclamation and 
			question mark.&nbsp; It also has some non-European marks derived 
			from older forms including a different form of quotation marks, a 
			different form of the comma when used in lists as well as wavy 
			underlines and separate symbols for titles.&nbsp; The form of the 
			full stop is a small hollow circle.&nbsp; It's complicated.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Japanese</strong></dt>
			<dd>is somewhat similar to Chinese in using a range of punctuation 
			derived from Europe but also some of its own (especially the use of 
			brackets).&nbsp; The form of the full stop is a small hollow circle 
			and the language also employs a middle dot to separate words.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Korean</strong></dt>
			<dd>also has a range of home-grown marks as well as using European 
			conventions.&nbsp; These include the middle dot to separate items in 
			a list and some different forms of quotation marks and brackets.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Thai</strong></dt>
			<dd>uses a range of marks: a separation indicator, an abbreviation 
			indicator, marks which show the beginning of a paragraph or the end 
			of a story and so on.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Arabic</strong></dt>
			<dd>Modern Arabic now uses a reversed comma and reversed question 
			mark.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Turkish</strong></dt>
			<dd>uses a range of punctuation similar to European uses.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Mathematics</strong></dt>
			<dd>Languages vary in their use of the 
			comma for numerals.&nbsp; In English, the comma is used to separate 
			thousands etc. as in 10,987,005 and the point to separate decimals 
			as in 10.987005.&nbsp; In most languages, that would be 10.987.005 
			and 10,987005 respectively.<br />
			The ~ mark is commonly used in languages other than English to show 
			a range 8 ~ 15, for example, where English uses 8 - 15 or 8&ndash;15.</dd>

					<h2>English punctuation</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>In English, punctuation has sometimes been compared to intonation 
		written down but that's not very accurate as we shall see.&nbsp; 
		Originally, however, punctuation was developed by printers to guide the 
		reading aloud of texts, especially bibles.&nbsp; Conventions which arose 
		from that source are still evident but modern English punctuation use 
		owes more to grammatical than phonological influences.</p>
		<p>Punctuation has two functions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Separation</strong><br />
			Some marks are used to separate units of language.&nbsp; The full 
			stop, the comma and the colon are examples.&nbsp; The separation can 
			occur:<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li>Between units: for example, we use a full stop or a 
				semi-colon to separate discrete sentences or clauses.&nbsp; So we 
				get, e.g.<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun was shining.&nbsp; The overnight rain 
				had stopped<br />
				</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather was lovely; the rain had 
				stopped</em>.</li>
				<li>Within units: for example, we use the comma to separate out 
				a smaller unit inside a larger one.&nbsp; So we get, e.g.<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
				rain, or what was left of it, finally stopped</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Specification</strong><br />
			Some marks specify the function of language.&nbsp; The most obvious 
			examples are question and exclamation marks but also included would 
			be the apostrophe because that is used to show the function of the 
			noun (possessive or descriptive when used, plural when absent).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>We'll consider the most common and troublesome marks one by one.</p>
			
			<hr />

					<h2><a name="1"></a>the comma</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>The comma is a separation mark but it differs fundamentally from the 
		full stop, the colon and the semi-colon.<br />
		What is that difference?&nbsp; 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'punc1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have an 
		answer</a>.</p>
		<div id="punc1" style="visibility:hidden">
		
		<p><span class="style_brown">The comma is used to separate parts of a 
		sentence.&nbsp; Usually, the colon, the semi-colon and a full stop are used to 
		separate units which can stand alone and be separated by a full stop.<br />
		For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wanted to tell me the truth: Mary wasn't coming.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		She wanted to tell me the truth; it wasn't going to be nice.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		She wanted to tell me the truth.&nbsp; I knew it wasn't going to be 
		nice.</em><br />
		None of those sentences would be correct with the insertion of a comma.&nbsp; 
		Putting one in results in a comma splice.&nbsp; For more on that, see
		the 
		answer about what comma splices are linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
		A comma, on the other hand, separates off sense units
		<span class="style_underline">within</span> sentences or clauses.</span></p>
			</div>
			<p>By some measures, there are nearly 20 different rules for how we 
			use a comma in English, and we'll deal with some in a minute.&nbsp; 
			We can summarise more easily when a comma 
			<span class="style_underline">is</span> allowed.</p>
		<ul class="auto-style4">
			<li>The sentence parts must be joined together.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The station itself was dark and deserted, but the station bar 
			was warm and inviting<br />
			</em>is correct punctuation use (although the 
			comma is not obligatory).<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The station itself was dark and deserted, the station bar 
			was warm and inviting<br />
			</em>is incorrect because there's a comma splice between two 
			stand-alone clauses.</li>
			<li>The sentence parts must be grammatically similar.&nbsp; It is 
			possible, for example, to have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The station was deserted, and there was no one around to ask<br />
			</em>but not possible to use a comma like this:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The station was deserted, and the workers 
			have been sitting in the bar<br />
			</em>because the change of number and tense makes two sentences 
			conventional.</li>
			<li>We can't leave out verbs in the second part of the sentence 
			and still use a comma so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The station appeared deserted, and filthy<br />
			</em>is not possible 
			although<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The station appeared deserted, and it looked uncared 
			for and dirty<br />
			</em>is OK with or without the comma.<br />
			In the first sentence, leaving out the subject and the verb <em>
			appear</em> makes a comma impossible.</li>
			<li>The parts of the sentence must be connected semantically (in terms of meaning).&nbsp; 
			A sentence such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Victoria station appeared deserted, although 
			it was raining in Tokyo<br />
			</em>is nonsense.</li>
		</ul>
		
				<h3>Rules of comma use<br />
				<img alt="rule" height="132" src="../../images/police_officer200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
		<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: the rules and conventions are different in different 
		languages.&nbsp; Many will demand a comma between all potentially 
		independent clauses.&nbsp; So we get errors such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I think, he's 
		crazy</em>.<br />
		<strong>Note 2</strong>: the comma and the full stop are by far the most 
		frequent punctuation marks in English.&nbsp; The comma, however, is the 
		one which allows the most choice to the writer.&nbsp; Many 
		(non-)insertions of commas are matters of personal preference.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>adverbials</strong></dt>
			<dd>A comma is never wrong, although not always necessary, when an 
			adverbial is placed at the front of a sentence<em>.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Later, they went to the party<br />
			</em>but not<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They went to 
			the party, later</em><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll see her if you come<br />
			</em>but (usually)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you come, 
			you'll see her</em><br />It is almost always essential to put a comma into the sentence if the fronted 
			adverbial contains a non-finite verb form or no verb at all:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to be sure to meet her, he went to the party<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoping to see her, he went to the party<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In hope of an encounter, he went to the party<br />
			</em>Disjuncts and conjuncts, wherever they occur within the clause, are 
			separated by commas conventionally<em>:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It is, in my opinion, less than perfect<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She has, however, come round to the idea<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He will not change his mind, whatever you say</em></dd>
			<dd>See the 
			guide to adverbials linked in the list of related guides at the end, for more.<br />
			There are times when it is necessary to separate off the adverbial, 
			wherever it comes in the sentence, to avoid confusion, too.&nbsp; 
			For example, remove the commas from this to see what is meant.<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He came to the party, hoping to see her, dressed in a gorilla suit</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>relative clauses</strong></dt>
			<dd>If the part of the sentence you are considering can be separated 
			off from the rest by putting brackets around it, it is non-integral 
			to the sense and/or is a non-defining relative clause so commas should 
			be used.&nbsp; See
			the guide to 
			relative clauses linked in the list of related guides at the end, for more.<br />
			So we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met the doctor, who lives near me, in the pub<br />
			</em>vs.<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			met the doctor who lives near me in the pub<br />
			</em>In the first, the fact that the doctor lives near me is 
			additional information; in the second, it defines which doctor we 
			mean.</dd>
			<dt><strong>in lists</strong></dt>
			<dd>Lists of anything and of any length are separated by commas.&nbsp; 
			Two items may also be connected with <em>and</em> with no comma 
			involved.&nbsp; If there are more than two items, the final comma is 
			optional (and called either the Oxford comma, incidentally, because 
			that is how the style was used by Oxford University Press, or a 
			serial comma).<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She slowly, carefully opened the parcel<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He took a long, deep drink<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			They went in, around(,) and through the garden without meeting<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			They can, may and probably will(,) come to the party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She brought beer, cokes(,) and crisps.<br />
			She let herself in, unpacked the shopping, fed the cat(,) 
			and went to bed.</em></dd>
			<dd>Note: a classifier and an adjective proper (an epithet) are not separated by 
			commas.<br />
			You can have <em>a tall, lanky boy</em> but not <em>*a 
			fast, racing car.&nbsp; </em>See
			the guide to 
			adjectives linked in the list of related guides at the end, for more.</dd>
			<dt><strong>in apposition</strong></dt>
			<dd>If two items in a sentence denote the same thing (i.e. are 
			co-referential), they are in 
			apposition and are separated off by commas:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms. Smith, my landlady, has raised the rent<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			There are three animals, bears, snakes and tortoises, which 
			hibernate in this country</em></dd>
		</dl>
		<p>Most of the 20 or so rules for comma use that appear on various websites 
		and in books may be accounted for by the four rules above.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>

					<img alt="colon" height="55" src="../../imagesgraphics/colon.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style5">
					<h2>the colon</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Colons are quite rare in English and perform two related 
		functions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>They indicate that what follows is caused or fulfilled by what 
			came before:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was raining heavily: that's why I didn't go out.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			You are obviously very tired: I should go now.</em></li>
			<li>They indicate that a list is to follow<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this 
			sentence you will find two each of: verbs, nouns, adjectives and 
			prepositions.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>The colon can be replaced by a conjunct, conjunction or other 
		expression:<em><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		It was raining heavily(,) so I didn't go out.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		It was raining heavily.&nbsp; Therefore, I didn't go out.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		It was raining heavily, which meant I didn't go out.<br />
		</em>There is a guide to conjuncts linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>

					<img alt="semi-colon" height="88" src="../../imagesgraphics/semicolon.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style5">
					<h2>the semi-colon</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Semi-colons connect two independent clauses but in other respects, 
		they function to separate ideas just as the comma does.&nbsp; They should 
		be used with care and only when the two clauses are sufficiently closely 
		related to be part of the same sentence.<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was getting soaked through; it was still raining hard.<br />
		</em>but not<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was getting soaked through; the rain was easing<br />
		</em>Replacing a semi-colon with a comma results, usually, in a run-on 
		or comma-spliced sentence and is poor style at best, illiterate at 
		worst.</p>

					<img alt="dashes and brackets" height="58" src="../../imagesgraphics/dashandbrackets.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style5">
					<h2>dashes and brackets</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Dashes and brackets can be used instead of commas if there's a good 
		reason for doing so.&nbsp; Dashes, in particular, should be handled with 
		care and not used to separate fronted adverbials (and nor should 
		brackets be used that way).&nbsp; So these are unconventional at least:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately &ndash; the rain was easing<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The rain was &ndash; fortunately &ndash; easing<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		(Fortunately) the rain was easin</em>g<br />
		There is sometimes a subtle difference between separately ideas with 
		commas and putting the in brackets.&nbsp; Brackets are usually taken by 
		the reader to refer to comment on the last phrase but commas are taken 
		to refer to the whole preceding clause.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He first had the idea when he was a child (he 
		claims)</em><br />
		with<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He first had the idea when he was a child, he 
		claims</em><br />
		The brackets denote the fact that it the fact that he was a child when 
		he had the idea that is being questioned but the commas call the whole 
		clause, i.e., <em>that he had the idea as a child</em>, into question.</p>

			</table>
		<p>For a direct quotation within a sentence, single inverted commas are 
		usual:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That sign says 'No smoking'</em><br />
		Publishing houses vary in their conventions concerning the use of double or 
		singular inverted commas for dialogue.&nbsp; The usual convention is:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm glad we could meet," she said</em> (comma inside the inverted 
		commas) or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, "I'm glad we could meet."</em> (comma after reporting verb 
		but with the full stop inside the inverted commas).<br />

		<p>The ? is, rather obviously, used to show an interrogative but may

		intonation, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're leaving early?<br />
		</em>vs.<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're leaving 
		early.</em><br />
		Some sentences with subordinate clauses may lose the questions mark

		<p><strong>For the genitive</strong> (or possessive to be a lot less precise):</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Singular nouns which do not end in <em>-s</em> take <em>'s</em> to show 
			possession: <em>the man's bicycle, Peter's friend</em> etc.</li>
			<li>Singular nouns which end in <em>-s</em> can be amended both with a simple 
			<em>'</em> or with <em>'s</em> (conventions in publishing houses vary): 
			<em>James' car </em>or 
			<em>James's car, the class' teacher</em> or <em>the class's teacher</em>.<br />
			Pronunciation varies too, with some preferring /dÊeÉªmzÉªz kÉË/ and 
			others preferring /dÊeÉªmz kÉË/ with a middle road of /dÊeÉªmzÉz kÉË/.</li>
			<li>Plural nouns ending in <em>-s</em> (i.e., most of them) take a simple 
			<em>'</em> 
			after the <em>s</em>: <em>the neighbours' garden, the soldiers' position</em> 
			etc.</li>
			<li>Plural nouns not ending in <em>-s</em> take <em>'s</em>: <em>the men's jobs, the 
			formulae's solutions, the syllabi's main faults, the children's toys</em> 
			etc.</li>
			<li>If two separate entities are imagined, both take the apostrophe:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John's and Peter's houses are in London<br />
			</em>so there are two separate 
			houses<br />
			but in<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John and Peter's house is in London<br />
			</em>there is a single 
			house belonging to two people.<br />
			and in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John and Peter's houses are 
			in London<br />
			</em>there is more than one house belonging to the same two 
			people.</li>
			<li>Compound nouns add the apostrophe to the end element:<em><br />
			my 
			father in law's house<br />
			my sisters in laws' houses<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>For contractions</strong>:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>All contracted forms require an apostrophe:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you're [you 
			are], he's [he is], they'll [they will], the horse'll [the horse 
			will]<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>Contracted (i.e. clipped) forms of some words and numbers 
			sometimes take an apostrophe but some clipped forms&nbsp;are so 
			embedded in the language that they have lost it:<em><br />
			the '90s </em>(also without the apostrophe)<em><br />
			on 
			the 'phone </em>(also without the apostrophe)<em><br />
			'flu' </em>(usually without the apostrophes)<em><br />
			ad, maths, photos, sitcom, pub</em> (all usually without the 
			apostrophe)<br />
			etc.</li>
			<li>Representations of dialect forms also take apostrophes where 
			needed:<em><br />
			huntin', shootin' an' fishin'<br />
			'old yer 'orses<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Common apostrophe errors</strong>:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The word <em>its</em> is the possessive adjective formed from
			<em>it</em> and it takes no apostrophe:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cat licked its paws<br />
			</em>vs.<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it's lying in the garden</em>.</li>
			<li>
				<em>one's</em> is the possessive adjective form of <em>one</em>:<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			one must try to do one's best<br />
				ones</em> is the plural pronoun form of <em>one</em> meaning 
				referring to nouns:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want the blue one not any of the red 
				ones</em></li>
			<li><em>your</em> is the possessive adjective (<em>your car</em> 
			etc.).&nbsp; <em>you're</em> is the contraction of <em>you are</em></li>
			<li><em>whose </em>is the possessive relative pronoun and <em>wh-</em> 
			question word:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose car is this?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he's the man whose car I hit<br />
			who's 
			</em>is the contracted form of <em>who 
			is / who has</em>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who's done the damage?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who's coming?</em></li>
			<li>Abbreviations in the plural do not take apostrophes:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DVDs, 
			TVs, PCs, HDDs<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			In the possessive or with 
			contractions, they function as above:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the DVD's broken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the PC's 
			problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the HDDs' capacities<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Disputed areas</strong> (you choose):</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Numbers: we can have <em>the 90's</em> or <em>the 90s</em> or 
			even <em>the '90's</em> or <em>the '90s</em>.</li>
			<li>Letters: is spelt with two<em> t's</em> or with two<em> 't's</em> 
			or with two <em>"t"s</em> or, rarely, with two <em>ts</em>.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>A note on teaching punctuation</h2>
		<p>It is unlikely, and probably unnecessary, that you would devote whole 
		lessons to this area (although a focus on paragraphing conventionally in 
		texts is another matter).<br />
		However, the temptation is either to ignore or simply correct errors in 
		learners' written work and that's not enough.<br />
		You do need to explain to learners where their L1 conventions may differ 
		and make clear what the rules are in English concerning the punctuation 
		which is troubling them.</p>
