		<p>If you have followed <a href="word_formation.html" target="_blank">the guide 
		to word formation</a>, you will be aware 
		that English makes new words in a variety of imaginative ways.&nbsp; 
		Compounding is one of them.<br />
		Here are some examples:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder" style="width: 365px">
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 181px" class="auto-style61"><em>candlestick</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style67" style="width: 182px">noun + noun</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 181px" class="auto-style63"><em>mouse-click</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style64" style="width: 182px">noun + verb</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 181px" class="auto-style63"><em>blackboard</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style64" style="width: 182px">adjective + noun</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 181px" class="auto-style63"><em>heartbeat</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style64" style="width: 182px">noun + verb</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 181px" class="auto-style63"><em>farfetched</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style64" style="width: 182px">adverb + participle (<em>-ed</em>)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 181px" class="auto-style63"><em>oceangoing</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style64" style="width: 182px">noun + participle (<em>-ing</em>)</td>
			</tr>

				<td style="width: 181px" class="auto-style65"><em>windmill</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style66" style="width: 182px">noun + noun</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>All of these example are written as one word but that is not 
		necessarily true of all compounds.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder" style="width: 365px">
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 181px" class="auto-style61"><em>whisky distillery</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style67" style="width: 182px">noun + noun</td>

					<h2>The problem of definition</h2>

				</tr>
				</table>
			<p class="indentpara">There is no one formal criterion that can be 
			used for a general definition of compounds in English<br />
			<span class="auto-style59">(Quirk <em>et al</em>, 1972:1019)</span></p>
			<p>And that is our problem.<br />
			Many nouns, as we shall see, can be pre-modified by other nouns 
			without necessarily forming what many would regard as a compound 
			noun.&nbsp; However, constant use of such formulations sees the 
			stress moving to the first element and forming the only stressed 
			syllable in the expression (a signal characteristic, if not a 
			defining one, of compound words).<br />
			For example, it is clear that the following result in compound 
			nouns:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a chair with arms = an armchair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a hanger for a coat = a coat hanger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a story about love = a love story</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a meeting of a committee = a committee 
			meeting</em><br />
			and in all these cases, there is one stressed syllable only and it 
			falls in the first element of the compound (not necessarily the 
			first syllable, of course, as we see in the last example, but that is usually the way).<br />
			In other cases, the situation is much less clear and it is a matter 
			of choice whether certain combinations may be considered compounds 
			proper or just nouns pre-modified by other items.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a board to select a candidate = a selection 
			board<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a person who is both an actor and a director = an 
			actor-director</em><br />
			and in the first case, the stress falls on the second syllable of 
			the first item and in the second case on the second syllable of the 
			second item but it is not clear whether both or neither should be 
			considered as compounds.</p>

		<p>Compounds, whether written as 
		one word, hyphenated or as two words, represent a single <strong>sense</strong>.</p>
		<p>They form discrete single-sense units and 
		are treated as single lexemes grammatically.&nbsp; In this guide, some 
		compounds are written as two words, some as one word and some are 
		hyphenated.&nbsp; In many cases, it is the personal preference of the 
		writer how such words are written and dictionaries often differ.&nbsp; 
		You may be in the majority choosing to write <em>teacup</em> as one word 
		but <em>coffee cup</em> as two.&nbsp; The senses and the way the 
		compounds are used are parallel <strong>regardless</strong> of how you 
		write them.</p>

		<h3>Hyphenation and single words</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		<p>A further little wrinkle is that one person's compound 
		is another person's double adjective and all double adjectives need a 
		hyphen (we write <em>the wine-dark se</em>a, not <em>the wine dark sea</em> 
		and <em>the brick-built house</em>, not <em>the brick built house</em>).</p>
			<p>There is also some indication of a cline in the language as a concept 
		becomes increasingly common and conceptualised as a single idea, for 
		example:</p>
		
			<p>
			<img alt="cline" height="177" src="../../imagesgraphics/compounding_cline.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>When gas for domestic lighting was first introduced, it was a noun-noun collocation 
		with <em>gas</em> acting adjectivally (as a classifier or noun adjunct), but gradually, as the system became more 
		common, the term changed until it is now considered a single compound 
		lexeme.<br />
		So, initially, the stress fell on the word <em>light</em> (as the small 
			white square shows), then it moved 
		to the word <em>gas</em>, then the hyphenated form became common and 
		finally the one-word form of the compound became conventional as it now 
		is in <em>gaslight </em>(/ˈɡæs.laɪt/).<br />
		The same stress movement can be observed with terms such as <em>compact 
		disc </em>which, when first introduced, had the stress on <em>disc </em>
		(because <em>compact</em> was an adjective, stressed on its second 
		syllable) but which is now a compound, stressed on the first syllable of<em> 
		compact</em>, like this: <span class="style_black">/ˈkɒm.pækt dɪsk/</span> not 
			<span class="style_black">/kəm.ˈpækt dɪsk/</span>.</p>
			<p>It is possible, of course, that a reverse process may occur and, 
			because gas lighting is now uncommon, that over time the stress will 
			move again to the second element and the word <em>gas</em> will 
			function again as a classifier rather than part of a compound.</p>
		<p>A recent example you are familiar with is the term <em>
		mouseclick</em> (a noun-verb compound making a noun) which appears to have entered the language quite 
		rapidly.&nbsp; Each revision of standard dictionaries includes new 
		compounds.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="pronunciation" height="133" src="../../images/pronunciation_mouth200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Pronunciation: stress</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		<p>Nearly all true compounds are given a 
		main stress on the first element and a secondary stress (if any is 
		present) on the second 
		element so we have, from the list above, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c</em><strong><em>a</em></strong><em>ndlestick:</em><span class="style_black"> 
		/ˈkændl.stɪk/</span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bl</em><strong><em>ac</em></strong><em>kboard: </em>
		<span class="style_black">/ˈblæk.bɔːd/</span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f</em><strong><em>i</em></strong><em>ring 
		squad: </em><span class="style_black">/ˈfaɪər.ɪŋ skwɒd/</span><br />
		etc.<br />
		What this means is that the word which determines meaning and word class 
		is, in fact, usually unstressed in a compound and that runs slightly 
		counter to people's general intuition because we usually expect 
		significant meaning-carrying items to carry heavier stress than others.<br />
		When we say:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My office has a green door</em><br />
		for example, we would expect the stress to fall on the nouns because 
		they are the most significant items and so it does.&nbsp; We get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">&nbsp;/maɪ.ˈɒf.ɪs.həz.ə.ɡriːn.ˈdɔː/</span><br />
		with the two main stresses falling on the first syllable of <em>office</em> 
		and on <em>door</em>.<br />
		However, there is also a word <em>greenroom</em> which refers to the 
		place where actors go when they are not on stage in the theatre and that 
		is a true compound so the pronunciation of:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My office is next to the greenroom</em><br />
		is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">/maɪ.ˈɒf.ɪs.ɪz.nekst.tə.ðə.ˈɡriːn.ruːm/</span><br />
		in which we still have a main stress on the first syllable of <em>office</em> 
		but the second stress in the clause now falls on the first syllable of
		<em>greenroom</em> as the transcription shows.<br />
		(It is also noticeable that the origin of the word is reference to the 
		colour it was usually decorated in and in the 18th century, it was 
		written as two words, in the 19th with a hyphen and today it is a single 
		word.&nbsp; It is a fair bet that it was also pronounced as
		<span class="style_black">/ɡriːn.ˈruːm/</span> when the expression was 
		first used.&nbsp; Today's greenrooms are, incidentally, all sorts of 
		colours.)</p>
			<p>For more on how compounds and other words are stressed, see the 
			guide to word stress, linked in the list of related guides at the 
			end.</p>

					<td class="auto-style2">
			<h3>Plurals</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>The other obvious characteristic of compounds is that when they 
			are plural, the plural marker usually falls on the second element so we get, 
			e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>beach huts</em> not <em>*beaches hut</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>child minders </em>not <em>*children minder</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>desk drawers </em>not <em>*desks drawer<br />
			</em>In a lot of cases, of course, the first element is a mass noun 
			which can take no plural so this makes good sense and we find:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>water works<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sugar lumps<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; water board<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<p>Some noun classifiers are, however, irregularly marked for 
			number.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="style_black" style="color: black;">saloon</span><span>&nbsp;</span>car<br />
			</em>but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="style_black" style="color: black;">sport<span class="style_underline" style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>car<br />

					<h2>Three writing choices</h2>

				</table>
			<p>There are three ways to write compounds and much will depend on 
			the variety of English you use, the commonness of the compound and 
			personal choice.&nbsp; The three choices are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Solid, as one word<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bedroom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paperweight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loudspeaker<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bookkeeper</em></li>
				<li>Hyphenated (as all double adjectives must be)<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tree-felling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; window-ledge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lawn-mower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paper-clip</em></li>
				<li>Open, as two words<br />
				For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; police officer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printing paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; living room<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cellar bar</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is likely that anyone reading this will not agree with the 
			list above in its entirety.&nbsp; Dictionaries and spell-checkers 
			will disagree.&nbsp; There is no hard-and-fast rule.</p>

					<h2>Headedness</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>In English, the second part of the compound usually determines two things:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The word class<br />
			<em>walking stick</em> is a noun not a 
			verb<br />
			<em> 
			software</em> is a noun not an adjective<br /><em>tailor-made</em> is a participle adjective not a noun</li>
			<li>The meaning<br />
			<em>windmill</em> is a type of <em>mill</em> 
			not a type of <em>wind<br />
			bus driver</em> is a type 
			of <em>driver</em> not a type of <em>bus<br />
			police woman</em> is a type of <em>woman</em> not a type of <em>police</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>The nature of English also requires the right-hand element to take 
		any inflexion so a plural of a compound noun such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>bank book<br />
		</em>will fall on <em>book</em>, not on <em>bank</em>.<br />
		By the same token, any verbal inflexion for tense, aspect or derivation 
		will only occur if the right-hand element is a verb so we get, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleep walker<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; homemade<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; baby sitting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chain smokes</em><br />
		etc.</p>
			<p>For this reason, English compounding is described as <strong>
		right-headed</strong>.&nbsp; The headword in the compound lies to the 
		right.&nbsp; Many related, especially Germanic, languages follow the 
		same pattern of right-headedness as does, e.g., Turkish.</p>
		<p>Other languages do things differently.<br />
		In left-headed languages someone who drives a taxi is not a <em>taxi 
		chauffeur</em> but a <em>chauffeur de taxi </em>(French).&nbsp; In 
		French, a <em>postage stamp</em> is a <em>timbre-poste, </em>in Polish a
		<em>znaczek pocztowy</em> and in Romanian a <em>timbru poștal</em> (<em>stamp 
		postage</em> in all cases).&nbsp; Other left-headed languages include 
		Vietnamese, Thai and Welsh.<br />
		As we would expect, inflexions for plurality affect the left-hand 
		element in such languages so the plural of <em>taxi driver</em> in 
		French is <em>chauffeur<span class="styleredbold">s</span> de taxi.</em><br />
		(This applies even to languages which usually have an adjective-noun 
		ordering so, for example, in Polish, the adjective precedes the noun but 
		the classifier follows it and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an expensive postage stamp</em><br />
		translates as<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drogi znaczek pocztowy</em>)</p>
		<p>Many languages avoid compounding and will use a kind of genitive 
		structure (<em>a driver of buses, a stamp of postage</em> etc.) or 
		simply supply a different ending for someone who does something (as 
		English can with <em>gardener, teacher </em>etc.) but, instead of 
		deriving the person from the verb, they will derive the person from the 
		noun and have <em>taxista </em>(Spanish) or <em>tassista</em> (Italian).</p>
			Headedness is an issue which can be handled with 
					comparative language work but to be able to do that well, 
					you need to be aware of the characteristic(s) of your 
					learners' language(s).&nbsp; Headedness applies to more than 
					compounds of course but the forms are 
					parallel.<br />

			<p>Knowing that English is right-headed allows one to infer the 
			meanings of many compound word because, e.g., it is clear that a <em>
			doorman</em> is a type of <em>man</em>, not a type of <em>door</em> 
			and an <em>ashcan</em> is a type of <em>can</em> not a type of <em>
			ash</em>.&nbsp; This is true for thousands of compounds so simply 
			alerting learners to the headedness of English is a worthwhile 5 
			minutes of classroom time.</p>
			<p>There are times, however, when the meaning of a morpheme in a 
			compound is not readily evident.&nbsp; There are, in other words, 
			levels of transparency which we can assign to the morphemes making 
			up the compound.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>notebook</em><br />
				is wholly transparent: it is clearly a type of <em>book</em> 
				(headedness tells us that) and in it one will find or make a <em>
				note</em>.&nbsp; That's a case of both parts being transparent.</li>
				<li><em>passbook</em><br />
				is not completely transparent.&nbsp; It is, of course, a type of
				<em>book</em>, but the relationship and meaning of the morpheme
				<em>pass</em> is, in this case, not transparent and cannot 
				easily be inferred.<br />
				A word such as <em>sketchbook</em> falls into category 1. 
				because it is clear that it is a <em>book</em> containing <em>
				sketches</em> but the word <em>cookbook</em> is not analysable 
				in the same way because it does not contain <em>cooks</em>.<br />
				A compound such as <em>snowman</em>, exhibits a similar problem 
				when compared, for example, to <em>dustman</em>.&nbsp; The 
				latter is a man who collects dust or rubbish and is, again, only 
				partially transparent because one needs to equate <em>dust</em> 
				and <em>rubbish</em>.&nbsp; The former is, however, not someone 
				who collects, or brings, <em>snow</em>, it is a man <em>made of 
				snow</em>.&nbsp; A <em>doorman</em>, on the other hand, is not a
				<em>man</em> made from a <em>door</em>.</li>
				<li><em>drug-pushing</em><br />
				exhibits a reverse phenomenon.&nbsp; This is clearly connected 
				to the meaning of <em>drug</em> (in illicit narcotic) but it is 
				not clear what the <em>pushing</em> refers to.&nbsp; 
				Understanding right-headedness will not help much here although 
				we can infer that it refers to a type of pushing, not a type of 
				drug.</li>
				<li><em>ladybird</em><br />
				This is an example of doubly opaque compound because it is 
				neither a <em>bird</em> nor connected particularly to <em>ladies</em>.&nbsp; 
				The word exhibits, in the jargon, full non-compositionality and 
				its meaning cannot be arrived at by understanding the meanings 
				of the constituent parts.<br />
				The term <em>gatecrasher</em> exhibits a similar phenomenon 
				because it has little to do with <em>gates</em> or <em>crashing</em> 
				but describes an uninvited guest.</li>

		<em><span class="style_blue">the earth quakes, the machine washes </span>
		</em><span class="style_blue">and <em>the ear aches</em></span><span class="style_brown">.<br />
		There are three distinct types of Subject + Verb compounds:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				<span class="style_black"><strong>subject
				noun + base form of the verb</strong></span><br />
				For 
				example:<br />
				<em>landslide, earache, toothache, sunrise, frostbite, rainfall </em>etc.<br />
				This is a very productive group and native speakers are apt to 
				make them up as the need arises.&nbsp; The last two of these 
				exhibit some non-compositionality insofar as the terms <em>bite</em> 
				and <em>fall</em> are opaque.</li>
				<li>
				<span class="style_black"><strong>base form of the
				verb + 
				subject noun</strong></span><br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>driftwood, watchdog, watchmen, flashlight, tugboat, searchlight, 
				hangman</em> etc.<br />
				This is a far less productive group but all these examples are 
				fully transparent.</li>
				<li>
				<span class="style_black"><strong>verb in </strong> <em>-<strong>ing</strong></em><strong> + subject noun</strong></span><br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>firing squad, working group, cleaning fluid, sticking 
				plaster </em>etc.<br />
				This is a moderately productive group and generally transparent 
				in meaning although a term such as <em>rolling tobacco </em>is 
				less so and would fall into transparency group 2. above.<br />
				There is a temptation, succumbed to by some website writers out 
				here, to group all <em>-ing</em> form participles and nouns as 
				compound nouns.&nbsp; This is not the case because:<ol class="auto-style75">
					<li>We should be careful to distinguish between -<em>ing</em> 
				participles acting as simple adjectives and those forming real 
				compound nouns.&nbsp; For example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dancing shoes</em><br />is a compound noun referring to shoes used for dancing and does 
				not imply that the shoes are doing the dancing whereas,<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boiling water</em><br />is water which is boiling, not water used for boiling.<br />The distinction is usually recognisable in the stress with 
				compound nouns being stressed on the first element and 
				combinations of -<em>ing</em> adjectives and nouns being 
				stressed on the second element.</li>
					<li>The other tell-tale characteristic of true compounds <em>
					vs</em>. classified or modified nouns is the sense of a
					<strong>permanent</strong> condition.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a barking dog</em><br />
					is a dog which happens to be currently making a noise 
					whereas:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a hunting dog</em><br />
					is a breed of dog used for hunting and the dog in question 
					may be currently asleep in the sun.<br />
					Equally:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an opening door</em><br />
					is a door which is currently opening but<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sliding door</em><br />
					is a compound referring to a type of door which can slide 
					(but is probably static at the time of talking about it).</li>
				</ol>
				
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="style_brown"><span class="style_brown"><strong>Type 2</strong> compounds are <strong>object + verb</strong> &ndash; </span>
			<span class="style_blue">
		<em>the dress is made, the DVD is played </em>and <em>the window is cleaned</em></span><span class="style_brown">.</span><br />
			Whether the noun precedes or follows the verb is somewhat unpredictable.&nbsp; 
		The <strong>most</strong> common way is noun first because of the nature 
			of right-headedness.<br />
			There are distinct groups of these, too:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong>object noun + base form of the verb</strong></span><br />
				For example:<br />
				<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; haircut, handshake, tax cut, 
				self-control</em> etc.<br />
				This is a moderately productive category.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong>object noun + verb in 
				</strong></span> <em><span class="style_black">-<strong>ing</strong></span><br />
				</em>For example:<br />
				<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; town planning, storytelling, 
				brainwashing, air-conditioning</em> etc.<br />
				This is a productive group.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong>object + verb + </strong> <em>-<strong>er</strong></em></span> (i.e., the 
				doer)<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fashion designer, songwriter, 
				gatecrasher, window cleaner </em>etc.<br />
				Some consider these to be noun + noun compounds and that's a 
				point of view.<br />
				This is a productive group and native speakers are apt to make 
				them up as the need arises.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong>base form of the verb + object noun</strong></span><br />
				For example:<br />
				<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pushbutton, mincemeat, scarecrow, 
				cutpurse</em> etc.<br />
				This is a rarer group.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong>verb in </strong> <em>-<strong>ing</strong></em><strong> + object noun</strong></span><br />
				For example:<br />
				<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cooking apple, reading 
				exercises, parking meter</em> etc.<br />
				Native speakers are, again, apt to make these up as they go 
				along.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong>verb in </strong> <em>-<strong>ed / -en</strong></em><strong> + object noun</strong></span><br />
				This is a 
				rarer group in which the compound represents the finished state 
				of something rather than the action performed on it.&nbsp; 
				Usually, these can be alternatively analysed as classifiers + 
				nouns and not true compounds because the stress frequently falls 
				on the second element.&nbsp; However, we can find, for example:<br />
				<em class="style_brown">left luggage, cut glass, spoken / 
				written word, stolen property</em><br />
				which are single concepts and may be stressed on the first 
				element.<br />
				As we saw above, to be considered compounds at all such items 
				need to represent a permanent rather than temporary state so, 
				for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fallen tree, stolen car, lost child<br />
				</em>and so on are not compounds but phrases containing 
				participle adjectives describing the current, not permanent, 
				condition of a noun.&nbsp; Temporary state expressions like 
				these are generally stressed on the noun.</li>

			<p>These are often lumped together with the verb + noun compounds we 
			have just looked at but there is a distinction:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbullet">In verb + noun compounds proper, the 
				noun is either the subject or the object of the verb as we have 
				just seen so:<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>When the noun is the subject, for example:<br />
					In <em class="style_brown">rainfall</em>, the compound can be expanded to have 
					<em>rain falls</em> 
					(subject noun + verb)<br />
					In <span class="style_brown"><em>turntable</em></span>, the compound can be expanded to 
					<em>the table 
					turns</em> (verb + subject noun)</li>
					<li >When the noun is the object, for 
					example:<br />
					In <em class="style_brown">film review</em>, the compound can be expanded to 
					<em>review a 
					film</em> (verb + object noun)<br />
					In <span class="style_brown"><em>handshake</em></span>, the compound can be expanded to 
					<em>shake a hand</em> 
					(object noun + verb)</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="redbullet">In verb + adverbial compounds, the 
				noun is not the subject or the object of the verb but the 
				compounds tell us where, when or what with the verb is intended.&nbsp; 
				In other words, the compound is adverbial in nature.&nbsp; So:<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li >Where:<br />
					In <em class="style_brown">waiting room</em>, the room 
					is not the object or subject of the verb <em>wait</em>, the compound 
					tells us <strong>where</strong> the waiting takes place and can be expanded 
					with a prepositional phrase to get <em>wait in a room</em>.&nbsp; 
					Other examples include <em class="style_brown">hiding place</em> (<em>hide in a place</em>),
					<span class="style_brown"><em>writing desk</em></span> (<em>write at a desk</em>) and so on.</li>
					<li >When:<br />
					In <span class="style_brown"><em>daydream</em></span>, the noun 
					<em>day</em> is 
					not the subject or object of the verb <em>dream</em> and the compound can 
					be expanded to get <em>dream in the day</em>.</li>
					<li >What with:<br />
					In <em class="style_brown">handwriting</em>, the 
					noun <em>hand</em> is not the subject or object of the verb <em>write</em> and 
					the compound can be expanded to <em>write by hand</em>.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Many of these verb + adverbial compounds use a verb participle with
			<em>-ing</em> + a noun.&nbsp; There 
			are hundreds:<em><span class="style_brown"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printing paper, walking stick, babysitting, 
			sunbathing</span></em> etc.<br />
			The verb may follow or 
			precede the noun but headedness applies so we know that <em>walking 
			stick</em> is a type of <em>stick</em> and that <em>sunbathing</em> 
			is a type of <em>bathing</em>.<br />
			Other forms use the base of the verb plus a noun (again, following 
			or preceding):<span class="style_brown"><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flashlight, daydream, homework, plaything</em></span> 
			etc.<br />
			Most of these are countable but <span class="style_brown"><em>homework</em></span> is not.</p>

			<p>Almost all of these are noun + noun: <span class="style_brown"> <em>oil well, sawdust, painkiller, 
			ashtray, fire engine, shirtsleeve, motorbike, headlamp</em></span> etc.<br />
			For teaching purposes, it's useful to note the large group of 
			compounds using containers:<em><span class="style_brown"><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			matchbox, milk bottle, teacup, 
			coffee cup, cigarette packet</span> </em>etc.<br />
			and to help learners notice 
			that the formation with <em>of</em> changes the meaning: 
			<span class="style_brown"> <em>a 
			teacup</em></span> vs. <span class="style_brown"> <em>a cup of tea</em></span> 
			etc.</p>
			<p>Some are adjective + noun: <em class="style_brown">handyman, 
			whiteboard, softball, hardboard, smart-board, wet room, cold room, 
			shortstop, close fielder </em>etc.</p>
		<p>In most cases, the right-hand word determines meaning <strong>and</strong> word class:<br />
		<em>printing paper</em> is a kind of paper not a kind of printing, a <em>
		tax cut</em> is a type of cut, not a type of tax and so on.<br />
		and <em>babysitting</em> is a verb (or a noun derived from the verb) and
		<em>plaything</em> is a noun not a verb.</p>
			<p>One oddity to note for teaching purposes concerns nouns which are 
			always plural or which have a significantly different meaning when 
			used in the singular or plural forms (also called paired nouns and <em>pluralia 
			tantum </em>respectively).&nbsp; Examples are:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; scissors<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trousers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arms (weaponry)</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			When these words form part of verbless, noun + noun, compounds, they 
			are often (not always) made singular so we get, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; trouser press<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scissor sharpener</em><br />
			but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; arms race</em></p>

		<p>As with noun compounds, these are often formed with an <strong>object 
		+ verb</strong>.&nbsp; For example, in<br />
		<em>
		<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a breathtaking view</span></em><span class="style_blue"><br />the breath is taken and in:<br /></span><span class="style_brown"> <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a firefighting 
		crew<br />
		</em> 
		</span><span class="style_blue">the fire is fought<br /></span>etc.</p>
		<p>Other adjectives can be formed as follows:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Adverbial + Verb</strong><br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; backsliding, 
			homecoming, easy 
			listening</em></span> etc.</li>
			<li><strong>Noun + Adjective</strong><br />
			<em><span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; homesick, travel weary, tax-free, 
			battleship grey </span></em>etc.</li>
			<li><strong>Adjective + Adjective</strong><br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bittersweet, Franco-British, 
			grey-green</em></span> etc.<br />
			The first part of such compounds can contain a derived adjective 
			which cannot usually stand alone.</li>
		</ol>
			
			<p>See the guide to adjectives for a lot more on compounding to form 
			adjectives.&nbsp; There are over ten ways in which this is done and 
			they are set out in that guide.</p>
			
			<p>Again, headedness means that the right-hand word determines 
			meaning and word class of the first two categories.<br />
			Compounded adjectives, on the other hand sometimes imply a <strong>
			combination</strong> of characteristics rather than depending solely 
			on the right-hand element for their meaning.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sky-blue, lemon-yellow</em><br />
			are respectively a type of blue and a type of yellow and both are right headed 
			(or head final) in the normal way but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Russo-Japanese</em><br />
			refers to a combination of elements that are Russian and Japanese, 
			not just Japanese.</p>
			<p>Compound adverbs are much rarer than compound adjectives because 
			an adverb form is uncommonly derivable from such adjectives.&nbsp; 
			They do exist, however, so we may encounter:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A breathtakingly beautiful sunset<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A heart-stoppingly exciting film<br />
			</em>and so on.<br />
			There is a range of adverbs now written as one word which qualify as 
			compound adverbs however and the list includes words such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thereafter, hitherto, therefore, thereby, overnight, sometimes<br />
			</em>and a few others.<br />
			They began their careers in the language as two words usually but, 
			over time have been compounded and are now written as single words.</p>

		<p>Verb compounds like <span class="style_brown"><em>sightsee</em>
		</span>are often back formations from the noun 
		compound (in this case <em class="style_brown">sightseeing</em>).<br />
		There are two patterns:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><span class="style_black"><strong>object noun + verb</strong></span><br />
			For example:<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			lip-read, flat-hunt, pen push, clock watch</em></span><br />
			In these compounds the first element is a noun which is the object, 
			not the subject, of the verb.</li>
			<li><span class="style_black"><strong>noun + verb</strong></span><br />
			For example<br /><span class="style_brown"><em>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			sleepwalk, chain smoke, window-shop, spring clean</em></span><br />
			These compounds are adverbial in nature because they refer not to 
			the object of the verb but to how, when or where it occurs so we can 
			expand them with prepositional phrases to:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walk in your sleep, smoke in a chain, shop by looking in the 
			window, clean in the spring</em>.</li>
		</ol>
			
			<p>Headedness is again apparent and the second element determines 
			that the compound is a verb and it is the verb which carries the 
			central meaning.<br />
			This also means that any other word derived from such compounds is 
			formed by changes to the second element so we get, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sleepwalking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; window shopper<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			And grammatical inflexions will also affect the right-hand element 
			so we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleepwalked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spring cleans</em><br />
			etc.</p>

			<p>This expression is derived from the Sanskrit word meaning <em>
			much rice</em> and in that language, it means <em>a rich person</em>.<br />
			The defining characteristic is that the compound so formed names an 
			entire entity by specifying a feature of it.&nbsp; A rich person 
			owns a lot of rice.<br />
			English makes use of this form of compounding usually by referring 
			to a particular characteristic of the entity and the result can be a 
			noun (usually) or an adjective / classifier (more rarely).&nbsp; 
			Here are some examples:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>bluebell</em> (with a flower like a blue bell)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>loudmouth</em> (with a mouth which is loud)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>blockhead</em> (with a head like a block)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>paperback</em> (with a paper back)<br />
			etc.</p>

		<p>As we noted at the outset, there is a very fuzzy border between compound nouns and classified 
		nouns.&nbsp; There is a guide to classifiers, partitives and group nouns on this site, linked in the list below to which you should refer for more 
		information.<br />
		Briefly, a classifier, or noun adjunct in some analyses, is distinguished from an adjective by being 
		incapable of modification so, for example, while we can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an excellent student<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the most excellent student<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a really excellent 
		student<br />
		</em>etc.<br />
		we cannot have<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a most university student<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a really university student<br />
		</em>and so 
		on.<br />
		The word <em>excellent</em> is an adjective <strong>describing</strong> 
		a characteristic of the student but the word <em>university</em> is a 
		classifier which <strong>categorises</strong> the student.<br />
		It is easy to see that it is a short step from classifier + noun to true 
		compound nouns.&nbsp; Many of the examples cited above could equally 
		well be analysed as a classifier plus a noun so we would have, e.g.<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; town planning<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		lesson planning<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		route planning<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		garden planning</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		all analysable either as compounding or as classifier + noun structures.<br />
		Individual speakers will reveal how they are using some of these 
		expressions by where they choose to let the main stress fall.&nbsp; If 
		the speaker is considering the term as a single-sense compound, the 
		first item will get the stress and when the speaker assumes that the 
		first item simply classifies the second, there are two senses and the 
		stress will usually be placed on the second element.<br />
		So, for example, we may find:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What beautiful stained glass</em><br />
		with the stress falling on <em>glass</em> as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈwɒt.ˈbjuː.təf.l̩.steɪnd.ˈɡlɑːs/<br />
		and then also find:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a stained-glass window</em><br />
		with the stress falling on the first element as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ɪts.ə.ˈsteɪnd.ɡlɑːs.ˈwɪn.dəʊ/<br />
		revealing that the speaker considers the expression as classifier plus 
		noun in the first example and as a compound classifier in the second.</p>

			<p>Compounding is a common way in which new words are coined and 
			come in a variety of flavours:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Blends<br />
				in which part of either or both words is removed and the 
				resulting morphemes compounded as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Oxbridge</em> [a blend of <em>Oxford</em> and <em>
				Cambridge</em>]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>permafrost</em> [a blend of <em>permanent</em> and <em>
				frost</em>]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>simulcast</em> [a blend of <em>simultaneous</em> and <em>
				broadcast</em>]</li>
				<li>True compounds<br />
				in which both words are retained and simply combined to make a 
				third as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bloatware</em> [a verb-noun compound]<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; software</em> [an adjective-noun 
				compound]<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; helpdesk</em> [a noun-noun compound or a 
				verb-noun compound]<br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Retronyms<br />
				in which an additional classifier is seen as necessary because 
				technology has overtaken the original meaning of a word as in, 
				for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rotary telephone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; valve radio<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand mower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand drill</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; horse drawn carriage</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
			</ol>
