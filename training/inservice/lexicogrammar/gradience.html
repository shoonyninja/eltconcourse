			<h1>Gradience and categorical indeterminacy: determiner, pronoun, adjective, adverb or what?</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="blurred boundaries" height="207" src="../../images/blurred_lights310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>What we are discussing here goes under different names.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Gradience </strong>or<strong> Categorical 
				Indeterminacy</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to the fact that it is sometimes difficult to say 
				definitely to which class of words an item belongs.&nbsp; It is 
				usually a straightforward matter to assign words to word classes 
				by looking at the functions they perform grammatically.&nbsp; 
				Nouns and noun phrases operate as subjects and objects, they are 
				linked to other nouns and noun phrases by conjunctions, 
				prepositions act to connect verb phrases to nouns and so on.<br />
				However, if we take, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've just made tea.&nbsp; Would you like 
				some?</em><br />
				we have a problem with the word <em>some</em>.<br />
				Is it acting as a determiner to <strong>modify</strong> the 
				absent (or ellipted) noun <em>tea</em> or is it acting as a 
				pronoun to <strong>stand for</strong> the noun <em>tea</em>?<br />
				Gradience is often called <strong>categorical indeterminacy</strong>.&nbsp; 
				In other words, we cannot determine <strong>in principle</strong> 
				to which category to assign to a word or phrase.<br />
				There are examples of this below.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Syntactical homonymy</strong></dt>
				<dd>is an allied but slightly different concept 
				insofar as it refers not to indeterminacy of word class but to 
				the fact that certain words and phrases may be performing 
				slightly different functions depending on the speaker's 
				intention.<br />
				Lexical homonymy describes the phenomenon of a word looking and 
				sounding the same but carrying two unrelated and different 
				meanings.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They chased their quarry across the 
				valley</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They got the stone from the quarry across 
				the valley</em><br />
				the word <em>quarry</em> looks and sounds the same but its two 
				occurrences are unconnected derivationally and semantically.&nbsp; 
				They are homonyms.<br />
				Syntactical homonymy refers to a parallel phenomenon in which an 
				item carries a different meaning depending on how it is used in 
				syntax.<br />
				For example, in this:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke, by the way, about his brother</em><br />
				it is in principle impossible to determine whether the phrase
				<em>by the way</em> modifies how he spoke (as an aside) or 
				whether it is intended to modify the whole sentence and means 
				that the speaker wishes the utterance to be taken as departing 
				from the main topic of the conversation to which he or she will 
				return.<br />
				In the first case, the phrase is an adjunct modifying the verb 
				and in the second it is a subject-switching conjunct.<br />
				In both cases, the phrase is an adverbial so there is no 
				difficulty in assigning it to that category.&nbsp; The issue 
				lies in deciding what sort of adverbial it is.&nbsp; Only an 
				understanding of the entire discourse in which it occurs can 
				lead us to a conclusion about that.<br />
				If we front the phrase, as we usually do with conjuncts, the 
				situation become slightly clearer.&nbsp; In:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, he spoke about his brother</em><br />
				the phrase would usually be identified as a conjunct signalling 
				a departure from the topic of a previous clause or sentence.<br />
				Adverbs, in particular, can function as adjuncts, modifying the 
				verb phrase and integral to clause or as disjuncts or sentence 
				adverbials indicating the style or attitude of the speaker.&nbsp; 
				For example, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He smiled wickedly at her<br />
				</em>we have an adjunct, <em>wickedly</em>, telling us how he smiled, but 
				in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wickedly, he smiled at her<br />
				</em>we have the same word functioning as a an disjunct and 
				expressing the speaker's emotional reaction to what was done.<br />
				For more on this, see the guide to adverbials, linked 
			below, and the issue is also discussed in the guides to disjuncts and 
			conjuncts, linked from there.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>This guide concerns the problems one encounters when attempting 
			to assign words and phrases to specific classes: <strong>categorical 
			indeterminacy</strong> or <strong>gradience</strong>.&nbsp; The problem 
			is especially 
			obvious with the catch-all adverb category.&nbsp; <strong>Gradience</strong> in language is a polite way to say we 
			don't really know what sort of a word this is,&nbsp;<strong>categorical indeterminacy</strong> 
			is even more polite.<br />
			We have eventually to accept that boundaries between word classes are sometimes fuzzy.</p>
			<p>An allied issue is that different people will use different ways 
			of categorising words at all.&nbsp; Some, Huddleston <em>et al</em>, 
			for example, distinguish coordinators and subordinators as separate 
			word classes usually subsumed by others in the class of 
			conjunctions.&nbsp; Others will assign pronouns to their own class 
			and others may see pronouns as a sub-set of nouns.<br />
			Many grammars still recognise demonstratives as a class of their own 
			while just as many will assign them to the general class of 
			determiners along with possessives, elsewhere assigned to the class 
			of possessive adjectives, and so on.<br />
			There is no definitive right answer to all this, of course, because 
			much depends on the focus of an analysis.<br />
			In this guide and generally on this site, nine main word classes are 
			recognised and it is to these that we shall refer in what follows:</p>

			<p>Of these, the first four are considered open-class content word 
			classes to which additions are readily made and which, standing 
			alone, carry a signification which members of the speech community 
			can readily explain.&nbsp; These four categories also, it seems, are 
			common to most if not all human languages.<br />
			The second four are considered functional, closed classes 
			to which additions are very rarely made and which, standing alone, 
			defy clear definition and whose significance is only clear when they 
			function in the syntax of the language.<br />
			The final class falls into a grey area because, although the words carry some 
			kind of meaning in context, standing alone they do not and they also 
			do not perform a distinct grammatical function.&nbsp; We can, 
			however, and frequently do, create new interjections to express our 
			emotions.</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>One of the roots of gradience is the general tendency in many 
			languages, not just English, to convert content words (those which 
			carry independent meanings such as nouns, adjectives, most adverbs 
			and verbs) into functional or structural words which operate 
			grammatically rather than semantically (such as determiners, 
			pronouns, prepositions and conjunctions).<br />
			There are more examples and a little more explanation of the 
			phenomenon in the guide to the roots of English, linked below.</p>
			<p>The process, sometimes called bleaching, is apparent in many 
			items which start life as content words are converted into 
			functional words with the meaning, so to speak, bleached out.&nbsp; 
			Vestiges of the original meaning often remain in place in other 
			environments.</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>The word <em>like</em> was originally either an adjective 
				(derived from the Old English <em>gelic</em>, meaning <em>
				similar in form</em>) or a verb (differently derived from the 
				Old English <em>lician</em>, <em>to please</em>).<br />
				It now performs numerous other functions in the language:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>as a pro-form for nouns with similar characteristics:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took all the old tools and the 
					like out of the garage</em></li>
					<li>as a conjunction:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He played like his life depended on 
					it</em></li>
					<li>as a preposition:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ran like the wind</em></li>
					<li>(informally) as an adverb:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was like delighted, I reckon</em></li>
					<li>as a meaningless filler:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was like, at the bus-stop when I, 
					like, saw her first and she was, like, walking towards me 
					and ....</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The word <em>instead</em> was originally (up until the 
				middle of the 17th century) written as two words and formed a 
				prepositional phrase, <em>in stead</em>, meaning <em>in position</em>.&nbsp; 
				The word <em>stead</em> (Middle English <em>stede</em>) was a 
				noun meaning <em>place</em> or <em>stability</em> and in other 
				Germanic languages came to mean a <em>town</em> or <em>dwelling 
				place</em>.&nbsp; The words (as it now is, rather than a phrase) 
				is used as:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>a prepositional phrase with <em>of </em>in, e.g.:<br />

			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><em>that</em> is a demonstrative determiner which has a plural 
				form (<em>those</em>) making it a bit like a noun because in

				do in many languages)</li>
				<li><em>little</em> is a determiner (and sometimes a pronoun) which 
				has comparative and superlative forms (<em>less</em> and <em>least</em>) 
				making it work like an adjective.&nbsp; (The guide to synonymy 
				and related concepts, linked in the list of related guides at 
				the end, has more on the

				nouns.)</li>
				<li>In<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is running</em><br />the word

			<p>Of course, as we noted above, a much wider range of words can 
			slide between classes in most languages so we can have, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a clean car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please clean the car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are rich<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rich live over that side of town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's running in tomorrow's marathon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enjoys running</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			With lexical items such as these, it is not usually too hard to work 
			out the meanings and assigning the items to word-class categories.<br />

			<h3>Gerund or Verb?</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>An exception here is the traditional distinction between a gerund 
			(a verb acting as a noun) and the -<em>ing</em> form of a verb 
			denoting its aspect.&nbsp; The distinction is probably not 
			sustainable although it may act as a rough-and-ready rule of thumb 
			in the classroom.</p>
			<p>A third distinction, in some analyses concerns the distinction 
			between a verbal noun and a gerund proper.&nbsp; The difference is 
			betrayed by the fact that a gerund retains some aspects of a verb 
			and can be modified in the normal way of verbs with an adverb so we 
			allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Driving so quickly was dangerous</em><br />
			but a verbal noun may not be so modified and we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Happily fishing is his main hobby</em><br />
			However, both verbal nouns and gerunds may be modified by adjectives 
			so we allow both:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drunken driving is dangerous</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh-water fishing is his hobby</em></p>
			<p>It is clear that in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is cutting the article out of the 
			newspaper</em><br />
			we have a verb, <em>cutting</em>, which is in the progressive 
			aspect, preceded by the primary auxiliary verb, describing her 
			current action.<br />
			It is also clear in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She pasted the cuttings into the book</em><br />
			we have a noun derived from the verb <em>cut</em> which is acting as 
			the object of the verb <em>paste</em>.&nbsp; It is clearly a noun 
			because we can make it plural in the usual way and it is 
			pre-modified by the determiner <em>the</em>.&nbsp; It can also be 
			modified by an adjective such as <em>new, relevant</em> or <em>
			various</em> as nouns are.<br />
			So far, so clear.<br />
			However, there is a fuzzy middle ground where the situation is not 
			clear at all and gradience is apparent.<br />
			For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I objected to her cutting the article out of 
			my newspaper paper</em><br />
			we have the item <em>cutting</em> acting as a noun insofar as it is 
			the object of the prepositional verb <em>object to</em> and it is 
			preceded by a possessive determiner, <em>her, </em>but it is 
			also clearly verbal in meaning because it was the <strong>action</strong> 
			of cutting that disturbed me, not the cutting that resulted.<br />
			and in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I noticed her cutting the article out of the 
			newspaper</em><br />
			we have true categorical indeterminacy because this can mean either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I noticed her as she cut the article out</em><br />
			in which case the item is verbal, or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I noticed her action of cutting the article 
			out</em><br />
			in which case the item is a noun acting as the object of the verb
			<em>notice</em>.<br />
			(For more, see <span class="auto-style4">Quirk &amp; Greenbaum 
			(1973:391) where the authors list 15 possible uses of an -<em>ing</em> 
			form of a verb varying from the purely nominal to the purely verbal 
			with much fuzziness in between.)</span></p>
			<p>What concerns us more here are what happens when <strong>
			functional</strong> words slip across boundaries.<br />
			We'll look at a number of these, some of which were exemplified 
			above and consider what it is that the words are actually doing.<br />
			Until we know that, of course, it's hard to teach them.</p>

					<li><em>*He is very driving</em></li>
					<li><em>*They are too smoking</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				
				<li>The word <em>too</em> can also act as a conjunct adding to 
				what is being said:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is cheap.&nbsp; It will be easy to 
				repair, too.</em><br />
				but, unlike most conjuncts, <em>too</em> cannot appear anywhere 
				but at the end.<br />
				<em>Very</em> cannot perform this function at all.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As an <strong>adjective</strong>:<br />
			The word <em>very</em> can function adjectivally to mean an extreme 
			end of something or an exact identity<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the very bed she slept in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lives at the very bottom of the valley</em><br />
			<em>Too</em> cannot perform this function.</p>
			<p>With pre-modification:<br />
			The word <em>very</em> cannot itself be pre-modified so we don't 
			allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Rather very good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Somewhat very quickly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Far very urgently</em><br />
			but the word <em>too</em> can be modified so we allow:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather too expensive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhat too fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far too cheap</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p>With post-modification:<br />
			The word <em>too</em> cannot be post-modified so we don't allow:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *It was too expensive indeed</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			but the word <em>very</em> can be post-modified with another adverb,
			<em>indeed</em>:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; It was very expensive indeed</em></p>
			<p>It is worth knowing that some languages do not distinguish at all 
			between the concepts of <em>too</em> and <em>very</em>, using one

				</li>
				<li><em>much</em> and <em>very much</em> can also act as determiners to modify the

				<em>no</em>-series of pronouns:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			What did you say?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Nothing very much</em><br />
			so not quite nothing<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Who did he speak to?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Nobody much</em><br />
			so not quite nobody<br />
				Similarly, because they are also non-assertive forms, the 
				any-series can be modified this way:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't see anybody much<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't see anything very much</em><br />
			The items cannot, however, modify the <em>some</em>-series because 
				these are assertive forms so we do 
			not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*Something much</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Was somebody much there?</em><br />
			etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For more on the distinction between assertive and non-assertive 
			forms, see the guide, linked below.</p>
			<p>As <strong>pronouns</strong>:</p>
			<p>Both <em>much</em> and <em>very muc</em>h can be pronouns, as in 
			e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't say very much<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't give him much</em><br />
			but there's a problem of gradience here, too, because it is 
			sometimes difficult to determine whether we have ellipted or omitted 
			the noun phrase.<br />
			If the noun phrase has been omitted or ellipted, the word is acting as 
			a determiner.<br />
			If the word is standing in for a noun phrase, it is a pronoun.<br />
			Compare, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: <em>How much milk have we got?</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: <em>Not much (milk)</em><br />
			where the noun <em>milk</em> is uniquely recoverable &ndash; nothing else 
			can fill this slot in the sentence &ndash; so we have a true case of 
			ellipsis of 
			the noun and <em>much / very </em>much is still a determiner.<br />
			with<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			A: <em>What did he buy?</em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			B: <em>Not (very) much</em><br />
			where it is clear that we are ellipting the subject and the verb phrase (<em>He bought 
			...</em>) but almost any verb phrase, noun phrase or nominalised clause 
			is imaginable as the object of the verb:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;
			He bought a few vegetables<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He bought nothing<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He bought me a small gift<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bought what he had always wanted to have hanging on his 
			wall</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			so here we do not have a case of pure ellipsis (because the omitted 
			item is not unique) and the use of <em>much / very much</em> is arguably pronomial.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>additional accurate clocks</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>clocks which are more accurate</em><br />
			and there is no way without clear context that we could decide what 
			is meant.<br />
			Additionally, we can interpret:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She has less expensive clothing than her sister</em><br />
			as either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her clothing is less expensive than her 
			sister's<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has fewer expensive clothes than her

			</em>and, again, with no context, we cannot decide what is meant and

			Specifically, in this case, <em>more</em> and <em>less</em> can 
			operate as adverbs modifying adjectives or as determiners relating 
			to noun phrases.<br />
			Like this:<br />
			Take these example sentences:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They avoided buying more expensive cheese<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They bought less expensive cheese</em><br />
			We can analyse the sentences in two ways:</p>

					<td class="auto-style63" colspan="2">modified noun phrase</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>As you see, the key lies with what the words <em>more</em> and
			<em>less</em> are doing.<br />
			In Analysis 1. the words are <strong>determiners</strong>.<br />
			The first sentence implies that<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had already bought some dear cheese and 
			avoided buying more of it</em><br />
			and the second sentence implies that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had already bought some dear cheese but 
			bought less of it thereafter</em><br />
			In Analysis 2. the words are <strong>adverbs</strong> modifying the 
			adjective <em>expensive</em>.<br />
			The first sentence implies:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They bought no cheese which was dearer</em><br />
			The second sentence implies<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They only bought cheaper cheese.<br />
			</em>It is impossible to tell by looking at the sentences what the 
			words <em>more</em> and <em>less</em> are doing grammatically.</p>
			<p>These two words can also function as pronouns but in that case no 
			ambiguity arises because the adverb form cannot stand alone.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They avoided buying more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They bought less</em><br />
			can only refer to quantity and the words <em>more</em> and <em>less</em> 
			are pronouns allied to the determiners, not the adverbs.</p>
			<p>The issue of ambiguity in deciding what is the noun phrase and 
			what is the determiner is investigated more fully in the guide to 
			constituent analysis, linked below.</p>

			<p>The word <em>far</em> is unusual in being both an adjective and an adverb.</p>
			<p>As an adjective it is quite simple and the antonym of <em>near</em>:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Put on the far wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's on the far side of the moon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The furthest corner of the room</em><br />
			It is quite rare to use the comparative when the word is adjectival:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The further corner of the room<br />
			</em>In adjectival uses,
			<em>by far </em>is not allowed.</p>
			<p>As an adverb, the word has two distinct uses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>An adverb of distance but only in non-assertive contexts:<br />
				We allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It isn't far<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it very much further?</em><br />
				but we do not usually allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is far<br />
				</em>In this sense,
				<em>far</em> cannot be pre-modified with
				<em>by.</em></li>
				<li>An intensifying, amplifying adverb which can be emphasised 
				by the addition of <em>by</em>, especially with superlative 
				forms.&nbsp; In this form it can:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>intensify a verb or phrase signifying preference:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would far prefer the red one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would far sooner have a rest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would far rather stop now<br />
					</em>In this sense,
					<em>far</em> cannot be pre-modified with
					<em>by.</em></li>
					<li>intensify a comparative or superlative form of an 
					adjective:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is far nicer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is far more interesting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is (by) far the best way to do this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are (by) far the most serious students in the group<br />
					</em>where the word can be emphasised with the addition of
					<em>by.<br />
					</em>When
					<em>far </em>modifies the comparative it cannot usually be 
					pre-modified with
					<em>by</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That is by far nicer</em></li>
					<li>intensify comparative, but <span class="style_underline">
					<strong>not usually superlative forms</strong></span> unless 
					modified with <em>by</em>, of an 
					adverb:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was far more persuasively 
					expressed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove far more quickly than I could have driven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was (by) far the most impressively presented paper</em><br />
					the usual preference is for <em>much</em> in this form:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was much the most impressively 
					presented paper</em></li>
					<li>intensify comparative and superlative forms of 
					quantifiers:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have far less money than we have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are far fewer people here than I expected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have (by) far the most time of all of us</em><br />
					but not:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They have far the least money</em><br />
					for which, again, <em>much</em> is preferred and is rare<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have much the least money<br />
					</em>or the
					<em>by far</em> term is compulsory:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have by far the least money</em></li>

				<h2>Some other examples of words that live on the borderlines</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It is not just determiners, adverbs and pronouns that cause 
			problems by existing on the borderlines between word classes.&nbsp; 
			Even within established word classes, some items switch between 
			groups.&nbsp; Here are some common examples of syntactical homonymy.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>conjunct or conjunction?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Take these two examples:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is tired and getting old.&nbsp; Yet he 
				works a six-day week.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was tired yet happy with my efforts</em><br />
				In the first case, <em>yet</em> is an adverbial acting as a 
				conjunct referring anaphorically to the first sentence.&nbsp; It 
				could be replaced with a more familiar conjunct performing the 
				same function, such as <em>however</em>.<br />
				In the second case, it is a conjunction meaning something like
				<em>but</em>.<br />
				The word <em>so</em> also inhabits this murky area: sometimes a 
				coordinating conjunction, sometimes a conjunct.&nbsp; For 
				example, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not going to work so I don't need 
				the car</em><br />
				the word is acting as a coordinator of two main clauses (and the 
				clause ordering cannot be reversed sensibly).<br />
				However, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not going to work and don't need the 
				car.&nbsp; So, you can use it if you like.</em><br />
				the word is acting as a conjunct linking the second idea 
				anaphorically to the first.<br />
				Moreover, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came early so I can help</em><br />
				the word links the <strong>reason</strong> with the action and 
				is a conjunction<br />
				but in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came early.&nbsp; So, I can help</em><br />
				the word links the <strong>consequence</strong>, not the reason, 
				and is a conjunct.<br />
				In spoken language, the second of these would be distinguished 
				from the first by pausing after <em>So</em>, by intonation and 
				phrasing.</dd>
				<dt><strong>adverbial, noun phrase or post-modifier?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Three more examples:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrived with his sister<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That old man with the black dog<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only way to shift this seems to be with a hammer</em><br />
				In the first we have an adverbial prepositional phrase, <em>with 
				his sister</em>, telling 
				us some about his manner of arrival (accompanied by his sister).<br />
				In the second case we have a prepositional phrase, <em>with the 
				black dog</em>, post-modifying 
				a noun phrase (<em>that old man</em>).<br />
				In the final case we have a copular verb connecting a noun with 
				a non-finite verb phrase which in this case can be classified as 
				nominal (because that's the normal non-adjectival subject 
				complement in such sentences).&nbsp; The phrase <em>with a 
				hammer</em> is an instrumental prepositional phrase.</dd>
				<dt><strong>adjunct or disjunct?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Take these two:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Politically, that's a suicidal idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Politically, the question is one of legitimacy</em><br />
				Usually, an adverb like <em>politically</em>, is classified as a 
				viewpoint or angle adjunct (i.e., one which expresses the field 
				of interest in which the comment is set).&nbsp; In the second 
				example, that is what it is doing.<br />
				In the first of these examples, however, it is clear that the 
				speaker is signalling how the statement is to be understood and 
				that is the job of attitude disjuncts, not adjuncts.</dd>
				<dt><strong>adjective or noun?</strong></dt>
				<dd>An example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upright chairs will go well with the new table<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				OK, I'll get the upright</em><br />
				The upright what?&nbsp; If we call this ellipsis of the noun then 
				the noun itself must be 'uniquely recoverable', i.e., there must 
				be only one possible completion of the sentence.&nbsp; Here, 
				however, we could complete the sentence with <em>chairs, ones, 
				furniture, sort, sorts, type, types</em> and a number of other 
				nouns and pronouns.&nbsp; It is not, therefore, simply a case of 
				ellipsis.<br />
				It might be a case of just omitting a noun phrase, of course, 
				but that phrase has to be something describable as <em>upright</em> 
				and it's hard to see how we can have <em>upright sorts</em> as a 
				meaningful phrase.<br />
				Perhaps it's best just to call the word a nominal adjective akin 
				to something like <em>the French, the old, the unhealthy</em> 
				etc.&nbsp; In that case, it has ceased being an adjective at all 
				and is now a noun.&nbsp; That's how it appears here because it 
				is modified with a determiner, <em>the</em>, and nouns get that 
				treatment.&nbsp; We could even make it plural.</dd>
				<dt><strong>adjective or preposition?</strong></dt>
				<dd>There is no problem assigning words such as <em>at, in</em> 
				and <em>on</em> to the closed class of prepositions.&nbsp; 
				However, some prepositions are not so centrally prepositional 
				and behave in two respects like or as adjectives.<br />
				They can have comparative and superlative forms so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was near the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was nearer the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was nearest the house</em><br />
				and the complex preposition <em>close to</em> works similarly.&nbsp; 
				The marginal preposition <em>like</em> works in the same way but 
				is always made comparative periphrastically (with <em>more</em> 
				and <em>most</em>):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is like her mother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is more like her mother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is most like her mother<br />
				</em>Secondly, <em>near</em> and <em>close</em> can be used 
				predicatively and attributively as real adjectives as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His house is close<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her house is nearer</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nearest farm is over there</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>noun, adjective or classifier?</strong></dt>
				<dd>One example will do:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's an English teacher</em><br />
				This is, of course ambiguous.&nbsp; If we stress the first word,
				<em>English</em>, we are referring to the subject taught and if 
				we stress <em>teacher</em>, we are referring to his nationality.<br />
				In the second case, <em>English</em> is clearly an adjective 
				although it doesn't behave like adjectives should in all cases, 
				having no comparative and superlative forms for one thing.&nbsp; 
				We can call it a denominal adjective (i.e., one formed from a 
				noun) and be done with it.<br />
				If we leave the stress on the first element, we still have a 
				problem.&nbsp; English is the subject he teaches and as such, 
				it's a noun just like <em>literature, physics</em> or <em>
				quantum mechanics</em>.&nbsp; It cannot, therefore be an 
				adjective because we can treat it just like a noun by 
				pre-modifying it with an adjective (<em>advanced English</em>, 
				for example) or a determiner (<em>some English</em>) or a 
				post-modifier (<em>English spoken in Canada</em>) and so on.<br />
				If we do that here we get the truly ambiguous <em>an advanced 
				English teacher </em>or <em>some English teacher</em> etc.<br />
				So it's not a noun either, really.<br />
				We can fudge it and call it a classifier (which is just a 
				special form of adjective also known as a noun adjunct) or we can ditch the adjective idea 
				altogether and call it part of a compound noun.&nbsp; If we do that, we 
				can treat it as a single entity and have, e.g., <em>an old 
				English teacher, a small, hairy English teacher</em> and so on.<br />
				What we can't do is shift the adjective and have <em>a 
				conversational English teacher</em> so we are back to having <em>
				teacher</em> as a noun pre-modified by <em>English</em>, the 
				adjective.<br />
				Take your pick.</dd>
				<dt><strong>adverb or preposition?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Take these:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They went inside the house for dinner<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				John came outside the house for a cigarette<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Mary came out of the dining room and joined him and they chatted 
				outside for a while</em><br />
				In the first example, we have <em>inside</em> functioning as a 
				preposition because it has a noun complement, <em>the house</em>.&nbsp; 
				It can't be an adverb because adverbs don't have complements.&nbsp; 
				We are OK so far.<br />
				The second sentence is also fine.&nbsp; We have <em>outside the 
				house</em> with the preposition <em>outside</em> having the noun 
				complement <em>the house</em>.&nbsp; We are still OK.<br />
				In the third sentence we have <em>out of the dining room</em> 
				and we can analyse this two ways:<br />
				As a prepositional phrase expressing direction as in <em>out of 
				the blue, out of the car </em>etc.<br />
				As an adverb, <em>out</em>, (as in <em>she let the cat out</em>) 
				followed by a prepositional phrase saying where from rather than 
				where to, <em>of the house</em>.<br />
				We could say <em>Mary came out </em>and leave it there, in which
				<em>out</em> is acting as an adverb, and we still have the 
				modifying prepositional phrase <em>of the house</em> to tell us 
				more about the verb <em>come out</em>.<br />
				It is trickier now because we do not know whether in the second 
				use of <em>outside</em> we have simply ellipted the complement of
				<em>outside</em> (<em>the house</em>) so it stays a preposition 
				or are using the word as an adverb (opposed to <em>inside</em>).<br />
				The final problem here is that <em>out of</em> functions as a 
				preposition of place and a preposition of direction depending on 
				where it appears<br />
				Place:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is never out of the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's out of the question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He left it out of the suitcase</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Direction:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They got out of the car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It emerged out of the swamp<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went out of her mind</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				<strong>Multi-word verbs </strong>are a trap for the unwary because so many 
				of the particles can function as prepositions and as adverbs 
				depending on how they are combining with other items in the 
				clause.&nbsp; These are better seen as examples of syntactical 
				homonymy rather than gradience because it is in principle simple 
				to determine the item's word class.<br />
				For example, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked up the road</em><br />
				the word <em>up</em> is a preposition but in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He woke up at six</em><br />
				the word <em>up</em> is an adverb and so it is in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned up late</em><br />
				For more, see the guide to multi-word verbs, linked in the list 
				below.</dd>
				<dt><strong><a name="forsince"></a>adverb, preposition or 
				conjunction and what sort?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Another incidence of the adverb-preposition confusion is 
				exemplified by the words <em>for, since </em>and <em>during</em>. 
				and one reason the words cause trouble for learners is the 
				distinction in their grammatical functions.<br />
				With time expressions, we are accustomed to teaching the words 
				as prepositions with noun-phrase complements or objects:<ol class="auto-style57">
					<li><em>during</em> relates to an event or time span which 
					occupies a stretch of time (which may, in fact, be quite 
					short but not instantaneous).&nbsp; Because the word refers 
					to a completed time span, it is rarely used with a 
					relational tense, such as the present perfect.<br />
					It has two closely related functions:<ol class="auto-style70">
						<li>referring to the whole of a period (in its meaning 
						of <em>throughout</em>), so we get, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He lived here during the sixties<br />
						</em>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She taught here during the 
						school year 2001-2002</em></li>
						<li>referring to some point in time in the period in 
						question, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I left during the advertisement<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He felt unwell during the party</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><em><a name="for"></a>for</em> is also used for a time span but not for an 
					event so it is conventionally followed by a straightforward 
					time expression.&nbsp; The length of time is immaterial.&nbsp; 
					We get, therefore, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stayed for 5 minutes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought for a nanosecond<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lived here for 60 years.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has worked there for a long time</em><br />
					Because the reference can be to completed or uncompleted 
					events and actions, both relative / relational tenses and absolute tense 
					forms are applicable.<br />
					(In terms of syntactical homonymy, the word is also a 
					coordinating conjunction, with the meaning of the 
					subordinating conjunction <em>because</em>, albeit used ever 
					more rarely in modern English:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I refrained from answering for I knew 
					she would be angry</em>)<br />
					As a preposition <em>for</em> also has a number of other 
					functions (at least 14) but these are not to do with 
					syntactical homonymy because the word remains firmly a 
					preposition:<ol class="auto-style70">
						<li>&nbsp;list of 14 is available here (new tab):<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a letter for you</em></li>
						<li>Having the purpose:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is not for sale</em></li>
						<li>Because of:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He feels better for his long 
						weekend break</em></li>
						<li>Amount of time or distance:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke for hours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We drove for miles</em></li>
						<li>On the occasion of:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought it him for his birthday</em></li>
						<li>Compared with something:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's not a bad cook for a man</em></li>
						<li>In support of:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't vote for the President 
						again</em></li>
						<li>In relation to someone or something:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's very nice but too old for 
						me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a liking for hot curries</em></li>
						<li>In exchange<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I traded in my old car for 
						something a bit more reliable</em></li>
						<li>Representing<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I played football for my school</em></li>
						<li>In the direction of:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We headed for Madrid</em></li>
						<li>Meaning<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the German for dormouse</em>?</li>
						<li>To get or achieve:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They waited for a bus in the rain</em></li>
						<li>Duty / responsibility<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's for the manager to decide 
						what happens next</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li><em>since</em> is also a problematic word because it 
					functions as a temporal preposition, too.&nbsp; It refers, 
					however, to the following time span up until another event 
					intervenes or until the present.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has worked here since October<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had been in their jobs since the beginning of the year 
					but left in October<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have waited since the first meeting for an answer</em><br />
					Unfortunately, the word is also a good example of 
					syntactical homonymy because it can also function as:<ol class="auto-style70">
						<li>an adverb:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw her when she came to visit 
						her mother, but not since<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He started on a low salary but has since been promoted and 
						now earns well</em><br />
						and here, as the first example shows, the tense forms 
						are variable (not, as is sometimes averred, always 
						relative or perfect forms).</li>
						<li>a temporal subordinating conjunction:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had lived there since he came 
						to London but moved when he retired<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been at university since I was 18</em></li>
						<li>a causal or resultative subordinating conjunction<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a drink in the bar, since I 
						had an hour to kill before my train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it was Sunday, I stayed in bed till noon</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>reduced relative clause, progressive tense or 
				prepositional phrase?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Take this example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The price including materials is £400</em><br />
				In this sentence we can analyse the words <em>including 
				materials</em> three ways.<br />
				It is a reduced relative clause and in full would be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The price that includes materials is £400</em><br />
				It is an example of ellipting <em>is </em>in a progressive tense 
				form and in full would be:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The price is including materials and is £400<br />
				</em>It is a prepositional phrase and is the equivalent of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The price with the materials is £400</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>adjective or adverb?</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<ol class="auto-style57">
					<li>Consider:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;He rolled it flat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She cut them small</em><br />
				In both these examples, we have an adjective (<em>flat</em> and 
				<em>small</em>, 
				respectively) but no copular verb to link the adjective to the 
				pronoun.<br />
				At first glance, they appear to be malformed sentences because 
				verbs need adverbials to complement them so it should be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rolled it until it was flat</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She cut them into small pieces</em><br />
				In fact, this is a perfectly acceptable use of adjectives 
				playing at being adverbs.<br />
				What we have is called a proleptic use and that means we 
				are looking ahead to the <strong>result</strong> of the action rather than 
				<strong>how</strong> 
				the action was performed.<br />
				That's the technical explanation but we still have adjectives 
				acting as adverbs and sliding across word classes.</li>
					<li>Adverbs of definite frequency, such as <em>daily, monthly, hourly
					</em>etc. function is the normal way you'd expect adverbs to behave.&nbsp; 
				However, they also function quite happily as adjectives so we 
				can accept all of these and many more:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a weekly meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We met weekly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They take stock fortnightly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a fortnightly stock take</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
					We cannot, however, do this with <em>annually</em> or <em>
					seasonally</em> as those words only function as adverbs, 
					formed from the adjectives <em>annual</em> and <em>seasonal</em>.</li>
					<li>Less explicable are the words <em>kindly</em> and <em>unkindly</em> 
				which are formed as adverbs from the adjective <em>kind</em> so 
				we have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke kindly to the child and 
				unkindly to her father<br />
				</em>However, both words also function as adjectives in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally a kindly person, she was 
				unkindly when angered</em></li>
					<li>The word <em>wide</em> is also problematic because it 
					acts as a normal adjective in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a wide road</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the river was wide</em><br />
					etc. but is a predicative-only adjective in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His quotation was wide of the mark</em><br />
					and as an adverb modifying another in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plant them wide apart<br />
					</em>and as an adverb modifying a prepositional phrase in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep these children wide apart from the others</em></li>
					<li>Three odd words – <em>aplenty, akimbo</em> and <em>galore</em> – 
				always follow the noun attributively.&nbsp; 
				None can be used predicatively:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have food aplenty and drink galore<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The food is aplenty and the drink is galore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood with arms akimbo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *His akimbo arms<br />
				</em>There is some lexicographical disagreement with these 
					words.&nbsp; Oxford dictionaries once classified all of them 
					as adverbs rather than adjectives but have since decided 
					that at least <em>aplenty</em> and <em>galore</em> are 
					adjectives.&nbsp; Cambridge dictionaries describe them as 
					adjectives as does Merriam-Webster (although there's a bit 
					of hedging there with <em>akimbo</em> described as either an 
					adjective or an adverb).&nbsp; The word <em>ap<span class="auto-style93">le</span>nty</em> 
					has also (but not on this site) been described as a 
					postpositioned quantifying determiner which makes two if we 
					include <em>enough</em> in that category.<br />
					It is difficult to see how any of these can usefully be 
					described as adverbs because no substitute adverb is usually 
					available so we do not allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He greeted me with arms openly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We had food plentifully<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They had drink abundantly<br />
					</em>We can, however, replace them with adjectives and 
					allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He greeted me with open arms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had copious food<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had abundant drink</em><br />
					so, on this site, we stick with them being adjectives but 
					that's not a certain categorisation because they are clearly 
					sometimes adverbial in nature so they can be replaced with 
					adverbial phrases as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood with arms at his side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had food in large quantities<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had drink in great amounts<br />
					</em>so, in these senses, the words are adverbial even if 
					they aren't really adverbs.</li>

			<p>Do not classify words by what they look like or by what a 
			dictionary tells you they are.&nbsp; Look at what they are doing and 
			teach them accordingly.<br />
			Languages use word class similarly because they all arguably exhibit 
			elements of universal grammar such as nouns, adjectives, 
			determiners, adverbs and so on.&nbsp; The issue is how they do it 
			and then we find a bewildering range of possibilities.&nbsp; It 
			won't help our learners if we are sloppy or careless about assigning 
			word class indiscriminately, regardless of what a word is actually 
			doing.</p>
			<p>If, for example, our concern is to teach the use of a word like 
			<span class="style_black"><em>enough</em></span> as a quantifying determiner (coming before what it modifies), 
			then it will confuse learners if the word appears in a text in that 
			role and either of its other roles as a pronoun or a post-modifying 
			adverb.&nbsp; The following is, therefore, difficult to use as a 
			model because there are three uses of the word in a single short 
			text:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">A: Do we have enough money?<br />
			B: Not this month.&nbsp; We have already spent enough on the new 
			furniture.&nbsp; I ought to ask for a pay rise, I guess.&nbsp; I 
			work hard enough, don't I?</p>
