			<h1>Comparison</h1>

			<img alt="comparison" height="207" src="../../images/compare_seal_bird310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Making comparisons is a key communicative skill.&nbsp; 
			Unfortunately, it's also a neglected skill because most teaching 
			starts and stops with a consideration of how we form comparative 
			statements with adjectives and adverbs and how we use the 
			conjunctions <em>than</em> and <em>as/so ... as</em> to connect the 
			ideas.<br />
			As we shall see, there's rather more to it than that.</p>

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Adjective comparison</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There is no great mystery to how we use adjectives to make 
			comparisons with either the <em>than</em> or the <em>as/so ... as
			</em>formulation.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She is older than I </em>(the inflected form)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's more expensive than this </em>(the periphrastic form)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's not so nice as mine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is as good as it gets</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			At this point, it is important that you understand the difference 
			between the periphrastic forms (<em>more, most</em> and <em>less, 
			least</em>) and the inflected forms (the addition of -<em>er</em> 
			and -<em>est</em>).</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<img alt="equal" height="133" src="../../images/equal200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Equality</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The usual ways in which adjectives and adverbs are used to express 
			equality is by using the <em>as ... as</em> formulation in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is as big as a house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am as old as you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is as beautiful as a flower</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			It used to be suggested that the negative form should be the <em>so 
			... as</em> formulation as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not so long as the other one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are not so old as their cousins</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			In modern English, the distinction is no longer adhered to and not 
			worth teaching.<br />
			The only thing to note is that the <em>so ... as </em>formulation is</p>
			<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li>more formal</li>
				<li>not allowed in affirmative statements so we cannot have<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *She is so good at mathematics as you</em></li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>The second part of this correlating conjunction is frequently 
			ellipted.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>This is not as/so good (as something else)</em></p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

			</table>
			<p>The rules in English for making the comparative and superlative 
			forms of adjectives are slightly complicated.&nbsp; Often, 
			they are abbreviated for pedagogical purposes to something like:<br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the -<em>er / -est</em> endings + ...<em>than</em>... 
			for short adjectives and the <em>more / most</em> + ...<em>than</em>... 
			for longer adjectives.</span><br />
			For elementary learners, that may suffice but it will lead to error 
			because it oversimplifies to the point of inaccuracy.&nbsp; 
			Structural errors such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the boringest book I have ever read<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is a carefuller driver than you</em><br />
			will arise by applying rules like this and even phonological errors 
			such as pronouncing <em>simpler</em> as /ˈsɪm.pələ/ instead of /ˈsɪm.plə/ 
			may also follow.</p>
			<p>Here's a run-down of the major rules that learners need to 
			assimilate at some point:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It is possible 
		to use periphrastic forms with <span class="style_underline">all</span> 
		adjectives, especially when use predicatively.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donald Trump is wealthy but Bill Gates is more wealthy<br />
				</em>This is especially the case when the amplifier adverb
				<em>even</em> is added to the mix:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was rude but her husband was even more rude.<br />
				</em>But:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>A number of common monosyllabic adjectives resist the 
					periphrastic forms and these include:<br /><em>big, clean, far, fast, great, high, low, old, young, small, 
					thick, thin, wide.</em></li>
					<li>The adjectives <em>good </em>and<em> bad </em>always 
					resist the periphrastic forms.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>If the sound at the end of the adjective is an 
		unstressed vowel (such as /i/, /l/ or /ə(r)/, then the inflexional change is most 
		common:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noisier, wealthier, chubbier, narrower, gentler, subtler, cleverer, 
		maturer</em> etc.<br />
			To this list we can add some common disyllabic 
		ones such as <em>common, quiet, handsome, polite</em> etc. all of which 
				end in an unvoiced sound.<br />
				However, when an adjective ends with -<em>re</em> or -<em>er</em> 
				(pronounced /ə(r)/) some speakers abjure what is to them the 
				displeasing sound /ə.rə/ at the end of, e.g.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cleverer, bitterer, maturer</em><br />
				etc. and prefer to use the periphrastic form making, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>more mature, more slender, more eager, more clever, more 
				meagre</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Because the superlative form does not end in /ə(r)/ but in /rɪst/ 
				speakers may be less unhappy to use the inflected form.&nbsp; We 
				can get, therefore, the rather odd:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more clever, cleverest, more tender, 
				tenderest</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				Adjectives which occupy this uncomfortable space include:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>bitter, chipper, clever, eager, limber, meagre / meager</em> 
				[AmE]<em>, slender, sober </em>and<em> tender</em><br />
				Some others, including<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; inner, lower, outer, proper, rubber, silver, upper, utter</em><br />
				are <strong>usually</strong> ungradable or classifying so the 
				issue does not arise.</li>
				<li>With other disyllabic adjectives the periphrastic form is preferred:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more basic, most comic, more pot-bound, most hated</em> etc.</li>
				<li>Adjectives formed by suffixation with <em>-ful, -ish </em>and <em>
			-less</em> always make the comparative and superlative forms 
			periphrastically:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more useful, most foolish, more hopeless</em> etc.<br />
			All adjectives formed with <em>-able</em> and <em>-ible</em> are at 
			least trisyllabic so follow the same pattern.</li>
				<li>No participle adjectives, however long or short, inflect (we 
		always have the periphrastic <em>more tiring, more worn</em> and<em> most bored</em>, 
		not *<em>tiringer, *wornest, *injureder</em> or *<em>boredest</em>).</li>
				<li>The periphrastic forms, <em>more</em> and <em>most</em>, 
				have antonyms in <em>less</em> and <em>least</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more clever &gt; less stupid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more interesting &gt; less boring</em><br />
				The meaning and emphasis are different, of course.</li>
				<li>The 
		syllabic <em>'-le'</em> ending (/ᵊl/) on words like<em> simple, humble</em> 
				etc. 
		changes to a non-syllabic /l/ when used in the comparative or 
		superlative form.&nbsp; (So, e.g., <em>humbler</em> is pronounced /ˈhʌm.blə/ not /ˈhʌm.bᵊlə/.)</li>
				<li>Spelling changes are:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>final consonants are doubled if the preceding vowel is a 
				stressed single letter:<br /><em>big &gt; biggest<br />fat &gt; fatter</em><br />etc.</li>
					<li>when the base ends in a consonant + '<em>y</em>', the '<em>y</em>' is 
					dropped 
				and '<em>i</em>' is substituted:<br /><em>early &gt; earlier<br />snappy &gt; snappiest</em><br />etc.</li>
					<li>when the base ends in a silent -<em>e</em>, it is dropped:<br />
					<em>sure &gt; surer<br />safe &gt; safer</em><br />(An alternative way to state this rule for learners is to say 
				that only <em>-r</em> or -<em>st</em> rather than <em>-er</em> 
					or -<em>est</em> is added in this circumstance.)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>There's a group of common adjectives which make comparative and 
		superlative forms from different roots:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good-better-best, bad-worse-worst, 
		far-further/farther-furthest/farthest</em>.</li>
				<li>The form of 
		<em>older</em> commonly used in family relationships,
		<em>elder-eldest</em>, can only be used attributively (as in <em>the 
				eldest daughter </em>not <em>*the daughter is eldest</em>).&nbsp; <em>Older than</em> is preferred to 
		<em>*elder than</em>.</li>
				<li>The adjectives <em>well</em> and <em>ill</em> referring to 
				health form the comparatives with <em>better</em> and <em>worse</em> 
				and have no superlative forms.&nbsp; In fact, what appears to be 
				a comparative form, <em>better</em>, is often a simple synonym 
				for <em>well</em> as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He is completely better now.</em></li>
				<li>The adjectives <em>small </em>and<em> little </em>are often 
				interchangeable in the base forms.&nbsp; However, in the 
				comparative and superlative forms, <em>smaller </em>and<em> 
				smallest </em>are preferred to<em> littler </em>and<em> 
				littlest.</em>&nbsp; The latter two are often confined to 
				children's talk.</li>

			<p>Pedants among us will consume quite a lot of energy telling us 
			that the correct form of the pronoun after <em>than</em> is the 
			nominative case, <em>I, we, they</em> rather than the accusative 
			case <em>me, us, them</em> etc.&nbsp; Accordingly, it may be 
			insisted that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He is older than me</em><br />
			is wrong and should be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He is older than I</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They work harder than us</em><br />
			is wrong and should be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;They work harder than we</em><br />
			The justification for this lies in reinserting the ellipted item and 
			making the sentences as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He is older than I am</em><br />
			and not the clearly wrong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*He is older them me am</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They work harder than we work</em><br />
			and not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *They work harder than us work</em><br />
			etc., thus demonstrating that the pronoun is actually the subject of 
			the verb, not its object or complement.</p>
			<p>Informally, at least, the accusative forms of the pronouns are at 
			least as common as the 'correct' nominative pronouns.<br />
			In fact, the use of an accusative, object form of the pronoun can 
			also be justified by classifying <em>than</em> as a preposition 
			rather than a conjunction.&nbsp; In English, all prepositions are 
			followed by the accusative case.&nbsp; In an expression such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car weighs more than a ton</em><br />
			the word <em>than</em> is a preposition because we cannot 
			 rephrase  the clause to use <em>than</em> as a conjunction as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*The car weighs more than a ton weighs</em></p>
			<p>To add to this mix, we need to consider some potential ambiguity.&nbsp; 
			Consider these two sentences:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She likes you more than I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She likes you more than me<br />
			</em>In the first sentence, the meaning is that<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She likes you more than I like you</em><br />
			but in the second sentence, the meaning is that<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She likes you more than she likes me<br />
			</em>It is only by insisting on the use of the correct case for the 
			pronoun that the ambiguity can be avoided so the informal<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She likes you more than me</em><br />
			could carry either meaning.</p>

			<p>Adverbs generally follow the same set of rules that we saw above 
			for adjectives.&nbsp; The difference is that adverbs which end in -<em>ly</em> 
			take the periphrastic form rather than the inflected form so we get, 
			e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happily &gt; more happily &gt; most happily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gently &gt; more gently &gt; most gently</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They played more happily in the sunshine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke the most gently of them all</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p>Here are the exceptions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Two adverbs ending in -<em>ly</em> do not follow the rules:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li><em>early</em> can function as an adjective or an adverb as 
				in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the early bus </em>(adjective)<br />and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they came early</em> (adverb)<br />In both cases, the word follows the adjective form in the 
				comparative and superlative:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;early &gt; earlier &gt; earliest</em><br />so we get, e.g.:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					<em>We arrived earlier than you<br />
					</em>so:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They arrived more early</em><br />
					is actually wrong although it follows the general rule.</li>
					<li>The adverb <em>badly </em>takes the comparative and 
				superlative forms of the adjective <em>bad</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; badly &gt; worse &gt; worst<br />so we get, e.g.:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They played worse than you<br />
					</em>In this case, by contrast, it is just possible to have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They played more badly than you</em>
					<em>did</em><br />
					and if the emphasiser even is used, that is more common:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They played even more badly than you 
					did.</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>There are a number of adverbs that are identical to the 
				adjective forms, including, commonly, <em>late, hard, fast </em>
				and<em> long.&nbsp; </em>These form the comparatives and 
				superlatives by inflexion as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hit it harder and harder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrived later than you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove faster than I could<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke longer than was advisable</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>The adverb <em>soon</em> has no equivalent adjective and 
				follows the rules as for an adjective:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sooner we get there the better</em></li>
				<li>The adjectives <em>quick, loud </em>and<em> cheap </em>are often used 
				adverbially in informal English so we get, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought it cheaper than I thought possible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He played the music louder and louder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I drive quicker than her<br />
				</em>(There are many who aver that these forms are wrong but, 
				informally at least, they are commonly heard.)</li>
				<li>Far less commonly, adverbs may be formed with other 
				suffixes.&nbsp; When this occurs, the situation becomes slightly 
				complex.&nbsp; There are four main ways that this happens, for 
				example:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>Adding the suffix <em>wards (</em>or usually<em> 
					ward</em> in AmE) to get<em>
				northwards </em>etc.<br />
					Many of these adverbs, such as<em> backwards, forwards, 
					homewards </em>are, semantically, ungradable so issues do 
					not arise.<br />
					With others comparison is usually with <em>further / farther
					</em>so we get, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We carried on further northwards<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pushed it further upwards</em></li>
					<li>Adding the suffixes <em>wise</em> and <em>ways</em> to 
					get, e.g., <em>crabwise, clockwise, lengthwise, edgeways, 
					sideways</em> etc. results in ungradable adverbs so no 
					comparison can be made.&nbsp; We cannot have, e.g., <em>
					*more clockwise</em>.</li>
					<li>Adding the suffix <em>wide</em> gives unusual adverbs 
					such as <em>nationwide, countrywide, continent-wide </em>and 
					so on (often hyphenated) and these are gradable but the 
					comparatives such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The product sold more nationwide</em><br />
					etc. are very rare.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>A phenomenon known as the proleptic use of adjectives allows 
				for what seems to be a verb modified by an adjective rather than 
				an adverb.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll the dough flatter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hammer the sheet thinner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Screw the bolt tighter</em><br />
				It is not, in fact, that case that these modifiers are referring 
				to the verb.&nbsp; What they are referring to is the end state 
				of the noun phrase.&nbsp; The word proleptic means looking 
				forward or anticipating a state to be reached.</li>

			<p>These four words cause some difficulty but we'll take the easy 
			ones first.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em><strong>less</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em>
				<strong>least</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>The words <em>less</em> and <em>least</em> are similar in 
				form to the periphrastic uses of <em>more </em>and<em> most</em> 
				but they reduce the degree of an adverb or adjective rather than 
				increasing it.<br />
				No inflected form in English exists for this concept so we use 
				these modifiers with all gradable terms, regardless of their 
				length and form.<br />
				As with the adjectival and adverbial uses of <em>more</em> and
				<em>most</em> the word <em>least</em> is reserved for more than two items 
				in formal speech although, informally, <em>least</em> is often 
				used in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is the least intelligent of the two</em><br />
				where a purist would probably prefer<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is the less intelligent of the two</em><br />
				which would also be the form of choice in careful speech or 
				formal writing.<br />
				The words modify both adjectives and adverbs equally so we get, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked less quickly after his fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove the least fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was less happy with the second meal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were the least contented of all the customers</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>too</em> and <em>most</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>These have a simple function in many cases:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li><em>most</em> forms the superlative of adjectives 
					according to the rules set out above and in the guide to 
					adjectives and it also modifies nearly all adverbs in the 
					same way.&nbsp; We get, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the most interesting of all 
					of them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked the most quickly</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					In this sense, the words are always used in tandem with the 
					definite article because the reference is specific and 
					definite.</li>
					<li><em>too</em> usually suggests <em>more than is required</em> 
					and also modifies adjectives and adverbs in parallel ways.&nbsp; 
					We get, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is too heavy</em><br />
					meaning, <em>heavier than it should be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My teacher speaks too quickly</em><br />
					I.e., <em>more quickly than he should</em></li>
				</ul>
				However, these words also have an amplifying meaning, like this:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li><em>most</em> is often, in rather formal language used 
					to mean <em>very</em> or<em> extremely</em>.&nbsp; We get, 
					for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is most interesting</em><br />
					meaning <em>extremely interesting</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked most quickly</em><br />
					I.e., <em>very quickly<br />
					</em>etc.<br />
					With adjectives, this use is confined to non-inherent forms 
					so, while we allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is most happy</em><br />
					(i.e., <em>very happy</em>), we do not allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is most tall</em></li>
					<li><em>too</em> is also used to enhance the meaning of the 
					adjective or adverb and suggests that its use is somehow 
					inadequate to express the sense intended.&nbsp; Again, the 
					use is considered rather formal.&nbsp; We get, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is just too delicious</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You really are too kind</em><br />
					meaning, <em>more than delicious </em>and <em>more than just 
					kind.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She danced too beautifully</em><br />
					I.e., <em>beautifully </em>is an inadequate term<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't speak too well</em><br />
					I.e., <em>poorly</em>.<br />
					The modifier <em>too</em> is often paired with <em>just</em> 
					in this sense and this use is often synonymous with <em>very</em> 
					but only occurs in negative clauses.</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>more than</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This expression sometimes serves a simple functions to 
				compare adjectives and adverbs as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is more interested in science than 
				art<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drives more carefully than he used to</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				However, there is another use of <em>more than</em> which is not 
				used this way.&nbsp; This use implies either:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>The adjective is inadequate to describe the notion (see 
					the equivalent use of <em>too</em> above).&nbsp; For 
					example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She is more than busy these days</em><br />
					meaning that <em>busy</em> does not adequately describe how 
					she is.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was more than happy with the work</em><br />
					meaning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I was delighted with the work</em></li>
					<li>The second compared adjective is inaccurate and should 
					be better phrased with the first as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is more tired than angry</em><br />
					meaning <em>tired</em> is a better description than <em>
					angry.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is more lazy than stubborn<br />
					</em>meaning <em>lazy</em> is the better description.</li>
				</ul>
				In neither of these meanings can we allow the inflected form of 
				the adjective, regardless of its base form so:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is lazier than stubborn</em><br />
				is not allowed.</dd>

			<p>This construction, which has parallels in many languages, is a 
			correlative subordinator.&nbsp; It is unique in this role in English 
			in expressing proportional comparison, i.e., comparing <strong>
			relative</strong> notions of one thing rising or falling in parallel 
			with another.&nbsp; It can link a variety of grammatical elements 
			(although it is often, sadly, taught only as an adjective linker):</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>Linking adjectives:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hotter the weather, the lazier I get</em></li>
				<li>Linking adverbs and adjectives:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The faster he drove, the more frightened 
				I became<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The longer I waited, the more irritated I 
				became</em></li>
				<li>Linking nouns and adjectives:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more people, the noisier the party 
				will be</em></li>
				<li>Linking verbs and adjectives:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more he shouted, the redder he became</em></li>
				<li>Linking verbs and nouns:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more I drove the greater my tiredness</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this construction, the restrictions on the periphrastic forms 
			with short adjectives are not so severe so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The more old he became the more wise people thought him</em><br />
			is acceptable but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*He is more old</em><br />
			is not.<br />
			The conjunction can, in other words, be used with both the 
			inflexional and periphrastic forms of adjectives.<br />
			The conjunction has become institutionalized in some fixed 
			expressions such as <em>the more the merrier, the sooner the better
			</em>etc.</p>

			<p>Adjuncts, conjuncts, conjunctions, disjuncts and prepositional

			<a href="../phrases_clauses_sentences/conjunction.html" target="_blank">the guide to conjunction</a> for an explanation.&nbsp; There is

			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Adjuncts</strong></dt>
				<dd>Adjuncts serve to add information to the verb phrase and its 
				complement and two 
				adverbs in particular express the notion of comparison:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is <span class="style_black">
				comparatively</span> urgent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He became <span class="style_black">relatively</span> rich</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Conjuncts</strong></dt>
				<dd>Conjuncts fall outside the clause structure and usually 
				serve to link ideas between sentences.&nbsp; Those that act to 
				express comparison include, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting will be long, I'm afraid, but, </em>
				<span class="style_black"><em>more importantly</em></span><em>, 
				it will concern all departments<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She dances well.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">By 
				contrast/comparison</span>, her brother has two left feet</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Conjunctions</strong></dt>
				<dd>Conjunctions are an integral part of a clause and removing 
				them usually leaves nonsense.&nbsp; To express comparison of 
				some sort, they are usually subordinating or coordinating 
				conjunctions.&nbsp; The words <em>than, like</em> and the <em>as ... 
				as </em> or<em> as if</em> forms are conjunctions but others can be used.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He played <span class="style_black">like</span> 
				his life depended on it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove <span class="style_black">as if </span>she was the

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came by car <span class="style_black">whereas</span> I 
				walked<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They arrived early <span class="style_black">but</span> she late<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				What you say now is true <span class="style_black">although</span> 
				that wasn't always the case</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Disjuncts</strong></dt>
				<dd>Disjuncts show the speaker's attitude or the angle and are 
				slightly rarer as indicators of comparison.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Relatively 
				speaking</span>, this is not so important<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Comparatively viewed</span>, this 
				is less important</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Prepositions</strong></dt>
				<dd>Some prepositions can be used to take the place of the 
				conjunction <em>than</em>.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The price is higher <span class="style_black">vis-à-vis</span> 
				that of the competition<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The price is lower <span class="style_black">

			<p>All languages have a way of making comparatives and superlatives, 
			of course.&nbsp; How they do it may lead to errors in the production 
			of learners of English.&nbsp; It is impossible to be comprehensive 
			in what follows but the range of ways is some indication of the 
			challenges facing learners of English.</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>Isolating languages such as Chinese do not rely on 
				inflexion to change the meaning of words and, as one would 
				expect, use a particle (translatable often as <em>than</em>) to 
				show that one thing is being compared to another and adjectives 
				are not inflected.&nbsp; The order of words is often a source of 
				error in English such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The house than the cottage comfortable</em> 
				(meaning <em>The house is more comfortable than the cottage</em>)</li>
				<li>Japanese and Korean, too, form the comparative with a 
				particle and make no change to the adjective.&nbsp; 
				However, word order differences can lead to errors such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*London is Tokyo more cold</em> (meaning <em>London is 
				colder than Tokyo)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The cottage more small the house</em></li>
				<li>Many inflecting languages (especially European ones 
				including most Germanic, Scandinavian and Slavic languages) do 
				not employ the periphrastic formulations, using only adjective 
				inflexions to signal comparison, and that can lead to errors 
				such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*The house is comfortabler than the cottage<br />
				</em>Learners with these first languages should not, however, 
				have difficulty with the <em>as ... as </em>construction since 
				parallels exist.</li>
				<li>Many languages (such as Arabic) do not have a copular verb 
				like <em>be</em> and that can lead to errors such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The house more comfortable than the 
				cottage</em></li>
				<li>Arabic also has distinct forms of adjectives used in the 
				comparative and superlative and does not always make a 
				distinction between comparative and superlative and that can 
				lead to error such as :<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He better in the class</em><br />
				The language also requires the insertion of a particle to signal 
				comparison so the use of <em>than</em> in English should not 
				cause a problem.</li>
				<li>Greek only distinguishes between the comparative and 
				superlative by the insertion of the definite article and that 
				can lead to a similar mistake:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *She is the taller in the class</em></li>
				<li>Romance languages, such as Italian, French and Spanish, 
				despite inflecting verbs heavily, do not inflect adjectives to 
				show comparative and superlative meanings.&nbsp; The 
				periphrastic forms in English will be familiar by analogy but 
				may be overused and lead to error such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The more big house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The most old church</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In summary, presenting and practising ways to express comparative 
			and superlative meanings need to focus explicitly on form because 
			very few languages are at all similar to English in this respect 
			(and most are considerably simpler).&nbsp; Concept, on the other 
			hand, is not problematic.<br />
			A little comparative language work can often alert learners to the 
			need to be careful in this area and notice the differences between 
			language structures.</p>
