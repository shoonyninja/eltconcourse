		<p>Intensifying adverbs 
		have some unique characteristics.&nbsp; They are common, especially in spoken 
		language and their mastery can significantly enhance our learners' 
		communicative powers.</p>
			<h3>A word of warning:<br />
			<img alt="warning" height="133" src="../../images/sign_warning_a200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
		<p>Any search of the web for these things will 
		produce some misleading results.&nbsp; In many cases, they will be 
		wrongly (or even not) classified, wrongly described or not really 
		adverbs at all.&nbsp; The following attempts to avoid these pitfalls.<br />
			The reason for the confusion is often a naïve
			understanding of the term intensifier which, at first sight, 
			seems to imply only making things stronger (because that's what it 
			means in a non-technical sense).<br />
		This is, however, not a non-technical area.</p>
		<p>Intensifying adverbs do not always increase the effect of item they 
		modify, as a careless understanding of the term would suggest.<br />
		They can also suggest a low degree (downtoning) or an approximate degree.&nbsp; They 
		are all analysed here as intensifying adverbs because they all affect 
		the intensity of what is said or written.</p>

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Three types</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		<p>There are these three sorts of intensifying adverbs.&nbsp; In these 
		all the examples are of adverbs modifying adjectives to keep things 
		simple but, as we shall shortly see, there are many other items that 
		they can modify:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Amplifiers</strong> increase the strength of the item modified<br />
			<img alt="amplify" height="133" src="../../images/megaphone_a200.jpg" width="200" /><ol class="auto-style22">
				<li>Maximisers denoting the extreme end of a scale:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that is <span class="style_black">
				completely</span> wrong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you are <span class="style_black">totally</span> mistaken</em></li>
				<li>Boosters which enhance the strength of the item:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you are <span class="style_black">deeply</span> 
				mistaken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that is <span class="style_black">severely</span> limited</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Emphasisers</strong> usually express the speaker's point of view, making 
			it clear that something is to be considered emphatic and stressed.<br />
			<img alt="emphasise" height="133" src="../../images/emphasis_arrows200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; that is <span class="style_black">plainly</span> untrue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she's <span class="style_black">simply</span> wonderful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she is <span class="style_black">obviously</span> uncertain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's <span class="style_black">even</span> better</em></li>
			<li><strong>Downtoners</strong> diminish the strength of the item 
			they modify<br />
			<img alt="diminish" height="133" src="../../images/perspective_brick200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			They come in three shades:<ol class="auto-style22">
				<li><strong>compromisers</strong> (a small group not considered here further 
				which imply the speaker is not entirely certain)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's <span class="style_black">quite</span> 
				nice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he's <span class="style_black">sort of</span> friendly</em></li>
				<li><strong>diminishers</strong> and <strong>minimisers</strong> which reduce the effect of the 
				item they modify<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's <span class="style_black">mildly</span> 
				interesting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he's <span class="style_black">slightly</span> irritating<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it's <span class="style_black">just</span> possible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that is <span class="style_black">not in the least </span>
				entertaining</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is </em><span class="style_black">
				<em>merely</em></span><em> technical</em><br />
				(minimisers are generally negative in sense)</li>
				<li><strong>approximators</strong> which suggest that the quality is close but 
				not in fact quite there<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's <span class="style_black">
				practically</span> perfect</em><br />
				but not perfect<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she's <span class="style_black">almost</span> 
				approachable</em><br />
				but not actually approachable<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's <span class="style_black">
				virtually</span> illiterate</em><br />
				but not fully illiterate</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>A note on distinguishing the forms:</strong><br />
		<img alt="difference" height="133" src="../../images/difference_shoes200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
		if you want to distinguish precisely between an amplifier and 
		an emphasiser, there is a simple test.<br />
		Amplifiers can appear in sentences such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She didn't <span class="style_black">altogether</span> 
		enjoy the party but she enjoyed it <span class="style_black">a bit</span><br />
		</em>Emphasisers in the same sort of sentence produce nonsense:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*She </em><span class="style_black"><em>really </em>
		</span><em>didn't enjoy the party but she enjoyed it 
		<span class="style_black">a bit</span><br />
		</em><span class="auto-style4">(Thanks to Quirk <em>et al</em>, p444, for that.)</span></p>
		<p><strong>A note on fashion:</strong><br />
		<img alt="fashion" height="133" src="../../images/woman_model200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
		Amplifiers, and what are often called boosters in particular, go in and out of fashion as they 
		become worn by overuse and lose their effect.&nbsp; Expressions such as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm terribly happy to see you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She awfully nice</em><br />
		are now rarely heard although the boosters were in common parlance not 
		too long ago and may well come back into fashion.<br />
		Recently, the booster <em>so</em> has become very common as in, for 
		example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I so like your scarf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I so enjoyed meeting his mother<br />
		</em>and even modifying a noun phrase as in, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is so the person I want to meet</em><br />
		etc. but it, too, will one day fall from use as it becomes stale and its 
		strength is eroded.<br />
		Nobody knows what might replace it.&nbsp; Perhaps <em>heartily</em> will 
		see a return to fashion or a new booster altogether will be invented.<br />
		See also the comments on the use of <em>well</em> below.</p>
		<p>One intensifier adverb, <em>incredibly</em>, has recently lost its 
		sense of <em>difficult or impossible to believe </em>and now means 
		something close to <em>very</em>, at least in careless and informal 
		language.&nbsp; It, too, will fall out of fashion and may even be 
		restored to its previous meaning (with any luck).</p>

		<p>Adverbs, of course, are also a subclass of adverbials and function to 
		modify verb phrases and other language elements.&nbsp; That is, however, not what concerns us here.&nbsp; 
		Linked below is a general guide to adverbs and a guide to adverbials and 
		you can follow those links to consider a broader picture.</p>
		<p>These intensifying adverbs perform some discrete functions.&nbsp; They modify:</p>

			<li>prepositional phrases</li>
			<li>determiners</li>
			<li>noun phrases</li>

				There is a small class of these amplifiers of prepositional

				<li>Here the adverb, <span class="style_black"><em>almost</em></span>, is modifying a determiner, <em>every</em>.<br />
				It suggests an approximation.</li>
				<li>Here the adverb, <span class="style_black"><em>rather</em></span>, is modifying a noun phrase,

			<ol class="auto-style22">
				<li>In this sentence, the adverb is a simple amplifier.&nbsp; 
				That is by far the most common occurrence.&nbsp; Other 
				amplifiers include, e.g., <span class="style_black"> <em>very</em></span> (the most common by a 
				street) and these:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
					<tr>
						<td><em>absolutely<br />

						perfectly<br />
						pretty<br />
						readily<br />
						terribly<br />
						unbelievably<br />
						utterly<br />
						vastly</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				In that list the adverbs <em>
				awfully, pretty</em> and <em>terribly</em> are often considered 
				informal only.&nbsp; The word <em>pretty</em> is also, of 
				course, a common adjective.<br />
				Some of these are limited in terms of the adjectives they can 
				modify.&nbsp; For example<br />
				<em>readily</em> collocates with <em>explicable, available, 
				accessible </em>and a few other adjectives.&nbsp; It is much 
				more widely used to modify participle adjectives and passive 
				participles such as <em>understood, explained, accommodated, 
				admitted </em>and so on.<br />
				The adverb <em>openly</em> is even more restricted and 
				collocates with <em>hostile, aggressive, dishonest, corrupt </em>
				and little else although it, too, is frequently used with past 
				participles such as <em>displayed, rejected, shown</em> etc.<br />
				The adverb <em>easily</em> is similarly restricted, collocating 
				with <em>available, accessible, adjustable, affordable</em> and 
				little else.&nbsp; It, too, is often used to modify participle 
				adjectives or passive participles such as <em>filmed, noticed, 
				seen, read, taught</em> etc.<br />
				The amplifier <span class="style_black"><em>incredibly</em></span> 
				has, by overuse, become virtually meaningless or, at least, with 
				a meaning approximating to <em>very</em>.</li>
				<li>Here the adverb is a downtoner, reducing the impact of the 
				adjective, <em>mistaken</em>.&nbsp; Downtoners are rarer but 
				other examples include <em><span class="style_black">somewhat, insignificantly, 
				comparatively, marginally</span> </em>and<em> 
				<span class="style_black">faintly</span></em>.&nbsp; 
				That's almost a complete list, by the way, and not too taxing to 
				teach or learn.<br />
				A downtoner relies on the 
				following adjective for its function.&nbsp; For example, in<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was
				<span class="style_black">insignificantly</span> small<br />
				</em>the 
				adverb is actually an amplifier because it increases the 
				strength of <em>small.<br />
				</em> However, in<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was
				<span class="style_black">insignificantly</span> important<br />
				</em>it functions to reduce the impact of <em>important</em> and is a 
				downtoner.</li>
				<li>Here the downtoning adverb is peculiar in being the only one which 
				follows rather than precedes what it is modifying.&nbsp; It has 
				to be taught separately.</li>
				<li>This is an example of a small class of adverbs which 
				function to express a point of view, taking the place of 
				<span class="style_black"> <em>
				Considered psychologically...</em></span> .&nbsp; Here it is a 
				form of emphasiser serving to express the fact that the 
				speaker's view should be taken seriously.&nbsp; Other examples 
				include <span class="style_black"> <em>theoretically, technically, 
				politically, ethically, honestly, plainly</em></span> etc.&nbsp; There actually aren't 
				that many and they are usually described as style disjuncts.&nbsp; 
				There is a guide to adverbials which includes these 
				on this site, linked in the list of related guides at the end.</li>

		<p class="style_brown">With luck you have identified c. and d. as 
		the wrong ones but accepted a. and b.<br />
		The easy rule is that when 
		an adverb modifies another adverb it <span class="style_underline">must</span> 
		function as an intensifier of some sort.<br />
		An attempt to make it function in any other way results in non-English.<br />
		So, for example, if we take an adverb of manner as in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was quietly angry</em><br />
		which modifies the adjective, we get a well-formed sentence which makes 
		sense.<br />
		If, however, we try to make it modify an adverb, we 
		get something like:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *She spoke quietly angrily</em><br />
		and that is not acceptable.<br />
		So, when adverbs modify adjectives the usual outcome is acceptable 
		English.&nbsp; We can have<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was 
		<span class="style_black">quietly</span> 
		confident<br />
		</em>but not<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She argued 
		<span class="style_black">quietly</span> 
		confidently</em><br />
		Other 
		languages, by the way, do not have this restriction so it needs to be 
		taught.</p>
			<p class="style_brown">There are rare cases when an intensifier can modify the 
		adverb particle of a phrasal verb.&nbsp; For example, <em>He spoke

			<p>These three words cause difficulty both semantically and 
			syntactically so need separate treatment.&nbsp; They are 
			intensifiers, serving to amplify or tone down the item they modify 
			and can be used with adjectives and adverbs.&nbsp; There, 
			unfortunately, the similarity ends.<br />
			Semantically, the strength of these three lies below <em>too</em> 
			and <em>very</em> but much depends on co-text and context.<br />
			The usual way to describe the meaning is on a scale with <em>fairly</em> 
			as the least powerful and <em>rather</em> as the strongest of the 
			three.&nbsp; That's actually rather misleading.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong><em>fairly<br />
			</em></strong>is generally considered to be the weakest of the 
			three, meaning something like <em>moderately</em>.&nbsp;  It serves to tone down the strength of what it modifies.<ol class="redbulletlist">
				<li>It is used primarily with gradable adjectives and adverbs 
				and not with those that represent one end of a scale or which 
				are, in themselves, not scalable.&nbsp; For example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>We accept:<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was fairly lucky to do so well<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We came home fairly late<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A fairly heavy snowfall slowed the traffic<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was fairly probably that we would have more snow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A fairly likely outcome is more expense<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought it fairly cheaply<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They came fairly quickly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				It rained fairly heavily last night<br /></em>but ...</li>
					<li>we do not accept:<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That is fairly freezing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That was fairly delicious<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*The fairly boiling weather<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I felt fairly devastated<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She came fairly unexpectedly</em><br />because these adjectives represent the extreme of a scale so 
				cannot be modified with <em>fairly.</em></li>
					<li>nor do we accept:<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They were fairly alone<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They were fairly identical<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*A fairly untrue statement<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It was fairly perfectly done<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He spoke fairly mistakenly</em><br />because these adjectives are not scalable at all and cannot 
				be modified with <em>fairly.</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li >Very colloquially, however, <em>fairly</em> can be used with 
				ungradable adjectives and some verbs and in this case it serves to 
				amplify the sense rather than tone it down so 
				we can hear (but not usually read) for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was fairly disgusted, I can tell you!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was fairly freezing in the car!</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He fairly rushed in</em><br />
				etc.&nbsp; In all these cases, the function of <em>fairly</em> 
				to amplify the adjective or verb phrase is signalled by placing 
				heavy stress on the whole adjective phrase.</li>
				<li>Determiner position:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>when <em>fairly</em> modifies a gradable adjective + 
					noun phrase, it must come after the determiner, before the 
					adjective so we get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a fairly good party</em><br />
					or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; some fairly interesting book</em>s<br />
					not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *fairly a good party<br />
					</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *fairly some interesting books</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>fairly</em> cannot be used to intensify a noun so:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is fairly a mess<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They got fairly a bargain</em><br />etc. are disallowed.</li>
				<li><em>fairly</em> cannot modify a verb so:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I fairly like her<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She fairly hopes to be here</em><br />are not allowed.&nbsp; 
				(But see above for the colloquial use of <em>fairly</em> as an 
				amplifier when it can modify a verb phrase.)</li>
				<li><em>fairly</em> cannot modify comparative or superlative forms (see below 
				for what can).&nbsp; We cannot, therefore, have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It was fairly better<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She was fairly the tallest</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><em><strong>quite<br />
			</strong></em>is polysemous and causes difficulty because of its 
			colligational characteristics with certain adjective and adverb types.&nbsp; It can act to tone down or amplify what it modifies but there are restrictions.<ol class="redbulletlist">
				<li>when it modifies gradable adjectives, it means <em>moderately</em> 
				and tones the meaning down.<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>so in:<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was quite nice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					She was quite helpful<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were quite disappointed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrived quite quickly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boat sailed quite slowly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather was quite good<br />
					</em>the adverb 
				<em>quite</em> can be replaced with 
				<em>fairly</em> with very little change to the sense.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>when <em>quite</em> modifies an unscalable adjective or one which 
				already represents an extreme end of a scale, it means 
				<em>completely </em>and amplifies.<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>so, with extreme-end 
				adjectives:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She acted quite absurdly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are quite exhausted<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is quite superb</em><br />
					etc. the adverb is an amplifier</li>
					<li>and with unscalable adjectives:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is quite perfect<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are quite wrong<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am quite alone here</em><br />it also amplifies.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>determiner position:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>when <em>quite</em> modifies a gradable adjective + 
					indefinite article + noun 
					phrase, it normally comes before the indefinite article so we prefer:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quite a good party</em><br />
					to<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a quite good party<br />
					</em>although both orders are possible.</li>
					<li>when <em>quite</em> co-occurs with the definite article, 
					it must precede it so we allow<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quite the best outcome</em><br />
					but not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the quite best outcome</em></li>
					<li>with other determiners, it follows the determiner, so we 
					get:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some quite nice pictures<br />
					</em>and not<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *quite some nice pictures</em></li>
					<li>when <em>quite</em> modifies an unscalable or 
					extreme-end adjective, it can come in either position with 
					any determiner so we 
					get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quite a wonderful evening</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a quite wonderful evening</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>quite</em> can amplify the sense of nouns and noun 
				phrases.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was quite a party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was quite a fiasco<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was quite an idiot to do that</em></li>
				<li><em>quite</em> can modify verbs directly in the way that 
				<em>fairly</em> cannot so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd quite like to see her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She quite enjoys parties</em><br />
				etc., but not, as we saw above:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'd fairly like to see her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She fairly enjoys parties</em><br />
				If the verb is itself unscalable, the meaning is, again, <em>
				completely</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I quite agree with you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I quite abominate sugar in tea</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I quite understand</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li><em>quite </em>cannot modify comparative forms (see below) 
				but it can modify superlative forms and means <em>completely</em>.<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>We cannot have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*It was quite nicer weather<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*That's quite more expensive</em></li>
					<li>but we allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					She was quite the most miserable guest<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					It was quite the most delicious meal</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><em><strong>rather</strong></em><br />
			is, in terms of strength in a mid-position between <em>fairly</em> 
			and <em>quite</em> (in the sense of <em>completely</em>).<ol class="redbulletlist">
				<li><em>rather</em> acts to amplify positive attributes and tone down 
				negative ones<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>with positive attributes, especially when preceded by
					<em>really</em>, it is an amplifier<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					That's really rather good<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					That's rather generous of you</em></li>
					<li>with negative attributes, it tones down the power of the 
					adjective<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					That's rather ugly but it works<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					She's really rather arrogant but has good reasons to be</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>rather</em> is the only one of the three used with 
				comparative forms.<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li><em>We can have, therefore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was rather more expensive than I expected<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is rather ruder than she should be<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke rather 
					more hastily than I should have<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are rather hotter curries than I like</em></li>
					<li>but not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It was fairly more expensive<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She 
					spoke quite more rudely<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They are fairly hotter</em><br />etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>rather</em> cannot, however, modify superlative forms so while we 
				allow, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was quite the stupidest thing to say</em><br />we do not permit:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That was rather the stupidest thing to 
				say</em></li>
				<li><em>rather</em> can modify words at the extremes of scales 
				and carries the meaning of <em>considerably</em> as in, for example<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sisters are rather alike<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was rather extraordinary<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The play was rather marvellous<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was rather beautifully written</em><br />etc.</li>
				<li><em>rather</em> cannot, however, modify unscalable 
				adjectives in the way that <em>quite</em> can.&nbsp; So, we 
				cannot have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That is rather mistaken<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is not rather finished<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Are you rather ready?</em></li>
				<li>Determiner position:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>when <em>rather</em> modifies either of the two types of 
					adjective + noun phrase permitted, it can come before or 
					after the determiner so we can have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather a good party<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather a wonderful outcome<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a rather good party<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a rather wonderful outcome<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some rather good food</em></li>
					<li>when <em>rather </em>is used with quantifiers, it 
					follows but may not precede the determiner<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a few rather nice desserts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twelve rather rude children<br />
					</em>but not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *rather a few nice desserts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *rather twelve rude children</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>rather</em> can also modify verbs directly as can <em>quite</em>.&nbsp; So, we get:<em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rather / quite enjoyed the football</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We rather / quite liked the performance<br /></em>When it is 
				used with ungradable verbs, however, <em>rather</em> does not 
				carry the sense of <em>completely</em> as <em>quite</em> does.&nbsp; 
				There is, therefore, a difference between:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I rather agree with you<br />
				</em>(= I tend to agree with you)<br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I quite agree with you<br />
				</em>(= I completely agree with you)</li>
				<li><em>rather</em> can also amplify the sense of some nouns and 
				noun phrases in the same way that <em>quite</em> can.&nbsp; We can 
				have, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's rather a fool<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's rather a mess</em></li>
				<li><em>rather </em><span class="auto-style58">is the only one 
				of these three adverbs which can precede </span><em>too</em>
				so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's rather too expensive</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's fairly too expensive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That's quite too expensive</em></li>
		</ol>
		</li></ol><p>Here's a summary of the main points only.&nbsp; We have included the 
		colloquial use of <em>fairly</em> with more extreme-end verbs.&nbsp; Even with 
		this inclusion, <em>fairly </em>is the least flexible of the adverbs.<br />
		It does, however, exist as a simple adverb of manner or disjunct along 
		with its opposite so we can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He judged the result fairly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfairly, he awarded a penalty</em><br />
		etc.<br />

		</table>
		<p>This is quite a common occurrence but only a small group of intensifying 
		adverbs can do it.&nbsp; The effect can be to amplify, tone down or 
		approximate the prepositional phrase.&nbsp; Here are some examples:</p>
			<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
				<li><em>She is <span class="style_black">dead</span> against the 
			idea<br /></em>(Note that in, e.g.,<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She argued 
				<span class="style_black">strongly</span> against the idea<br />
				</em>the adverb is modifying the verb, not the prepositional phrase.)</li>
				<li><em>He submitted it <span class="style_black">well</span> inside 
			the deadline</em></li>
				<li><em>They wa<span class="auto-style59">lked
				<span class="style_black">way</span> beyond the end of the lane</span></em></li>
				<li><em>She ca<span class="auto-style59">me
				<span class="style_black">shortly</span> before the meeting 
				started</span></em></li>
				<li><em>They married <span class="style_black">long</span> after 
				the child was born</em></li>
				<li><em>They live <span class="style_black">far</span> away from 
				me</em></li>
				<li><em>I want to come <span class="style_black">straight</span> 
				to the point</em></li>
				<li><em>He kicked it <span class="style_black">right</span> over the 
			fence</em></li>
				<li><em>His lecture was <span class="style_black">entirely / 
				completely / totally / wholly </span>over my head</em></li>
				<li><em>She fell <span class="style_black">clear</span> through the 
			ceiling</em></li>
				<li><em>She has been <span class="style_black">all</span> over 
				the world</em></li>
				<li><em>They were <span class="style_black">nearly</span> in the 
				clear</em></li>
				<li><em>She was <span class="style_black">almost</span> in 
				despair</em></li>
				<li><em>My house is <span class="style_black">directly</span> 
				opposite the petrol station</em></li>
				<li><em>I kept it <span class="style_black">well</span> out of 
				sight</em></li>
				<li><em>She arrived <span class="style_black">way</span> after 
				midnight</em></li>
				<li><em>It jumped <span class="style_black">clean</span> over the 
			fence</em></li>
				<li><em>He held <span class="style_black">exactly</span> in the 
			middle</em></li>
			</ul>
		<p>The examples above include the five most common adverbs that can do this: 		
		<em><span class="style_black">dead, well, exactly, right</span> </em>and 
		<span class="style_black"><em>clear 
		/ clean</em></span> which are all amplifiers.<br />
		The use of <em>wide</em> in <em><span class="style_black">wide</span> of 
		the mark</em> is a fixed idiom deriving from archery.&nbsp; In this 
		case, it is adjectival rather than adverbial but behaves a little like a 
		prepositional phrase in itself.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His estimate was wide of the real cost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The actual quantity was wide of the amount we wanted<br />
		</em>The word is adverbial, however, in an expression such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep them wide apart<br />
		</em>where it modifies the adverb <em>apart</em>.</p>
			<p>Prepositional phrases can also be used with intensifiers which 
			tone the meaning down or approximate so we allow, too:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They fell <span class="style_black">almost</span> 
			into the river<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put it <span class="style_black">nearly</span> in the 
			centre<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car drove <span class="style_black">practically</span> 
			into the river</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; His house is <span class="style_black">roughly</span> 
			behind that hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dogs were kept <span class="style_black">wide</span> 
			apart from the other animals<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was <span class="style_black">approximately</span> 
			opposite t<span class="auto-style59">he garage</span></em></p>
			<p>A fairly recent development is the extended use of the 
			intensifying adverb <em>well </em>as a synonym for <em>very</em>.&nbsp; 
			It has occurred for centuries in expressions such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well pleased<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well organised<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well accepted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well bred<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well educated</em><br />
			and operates as an intensifier for positive participial adjectives.&nbsp; 
			As is the case with <em>very</em>, it is not normally used to modify 
			extreme or ungradable adjectives.<br />
			Of late, the use has also been developed beyond positive, 
			participial and gradable adjectives in informal speech to include 
			expressions such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well angry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well annoyed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well envious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well amazed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well heartbroken<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			There are those who denigrate this use as illiterate but time will 
			tell whether it becomes acceptable and how durable it will be.</p>
