			<h1>Lexicogrammar: the interface</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="interface" height="207" src="../../images/cogs_blueback310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>There is a noticeable tendency in language teaching to treat 
			meaning and structure as if they were self-contained areas of 
			knowledge about language.<br />
			It is, however, fairly clear that, for example, the distinction 
			between these two sets of sentences:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>I am feeling ill</em></li>
				<li><em>I feel ill</em></li>
				<li><em>I am living in Paris</em></li>
				<li><em>I live in Paris</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>is not simply one of whether the speaker chooses to use a 
			progressive aspect of the verb.<br />
			Sentences 1. and 2. are, for most purposes, synonymous and it makes 
			little difference whether the speaker chooses to use the verb 
			dynamically, as in 1., or statively, as in 2.<br />
			However, sentences 3. and 4. are different in meaning as well as 
			structure.&nbsp; Sentence 3. implies a temporary condition but 
			sentence 4. implies a permanent one.<br />
			The essence of the difference lies not in the grammar, which is 
			common to both pairs, but in the meanings of the verbs.<br />
			Put another way, the grammar and the meaning of words are not 
			separate systems treatable as discrete units but are interdependent.<br />
			That, roughly speaking, was what Halliday meant when he coined the 
			term lexicogrammar to describe the language system.&nbsp; In his 
			words:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">grammar and vocabulary are not different 
			strata; they are the two poles of a single continuum, properly 
			called lexicogrammar<br />
			<span class="auto-style1">Halliday / Matthiessen (2014: 24)</span></p>
			<p>This guide is a short one, focusing on some obvious but important 
			examples of times in which it is unwise to treat the systems of the 
			language as if they were either grammar or lexis (i.e., structure or meaning 
			carrying items) but to consider both systems together.&nbsp; Before 
			we do that, it is necessary to take a short diversion into 
			understanding our terms.</p>

			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>If we choose to separate the systems for the sake of argument, we 
			can, of course do so and consider syntax as separate from paradigm.<br />
			There are two types of relationship at work here:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Syntagmatic relationship</strong></dt>
			<dd>This describes the relationship which work horizontally between words.&nbsp; Subjects 
			use Verbs, Verbs sometimes take Objects, Adjectives modify Nouns, 
			Adverbs modify Verbs and so on.&nbsp; The relationship is to do with
			<strong>syntax</strong> (from the Greek meaning to arrange 
			together).</dd>
			<dt><strong>Paradigmatic relationships</strong></dt>
			<dd>Relationships work vertically in the sense that Noun 
			phrases can be replaced by other Noun phrases, Verb phrases by other 
			Verb phrases, Adjectives by other Adjectives, Adverbs by other 
			Adverbs and so on.&nbsp; The relationship is to do with <strong>word 
			and phrase class</strong>.&nbsp; The word paradigmatic derives from
			<strong>paradigm</strong> (from the Greek meaning to show 
			side by side).<br />
			It works like this:</dd>
</dl><p><img alt="syntagmatic" height="226" src="../../imagesgraphics/syntagmatic.png" width="620" /></p>
		<p>Each slot in the sentence can be replaced by words and phrases in the 
		same classes to 
		make new sentences (some of which might make sense) virtually <em>ad 
		infinitum</em>.&nbsp; The boxes give examples of items in a paradigmatic 
		relationship; the red arrows show the syntagmatic relationships.</p>
			<p>For many purposes in the classroom, it makes some sense to 
			analyse language this way and separate out considerations of syntax 
			from considerations of lexical relationships and word and phrase 
			class.</p>
			<p>However, the purpose of this guide is to explain why syntactical 
			arrangements alone do not explain the systems of a language and 
			lexical relationships alone also cannot do so.<br />
			In order to do that, we'll take some examples of where the interface 
			between grammar and meaning provides some insights.</p>

				<img alt="EXCEPTION" height="166" src="../../images/distinguish_lightbulb250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style31">
		<h2><em>Oh, that's just an exception</em></h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>There is a temptation, worth avoiding in the classroom, to 
			suggest that anything which appears to break a syntactical rule 
			qualifies as an exception and needs to be learnt separately.&nbsp; 
			So, for example, we might suggest that a syntactical rule is 
			exemplified by allowing, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked to work<br />
			</em>but forbidding<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She walked the way to work<br />
			</em>and stating that the rule is that this verb is, in English, 
			intransitive.&nbsp; So far, so good and so simple.&nbsp; However, 
			when learners then encounter:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We walked the dogs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked her to the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked an hour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They walked three miles</em><br />
			it is not terribly helpful to tell them that these are merely 
			exceptions to the rule.&nbsp; What we have, in fact, is an example 
			of something which happens frequently in all languages: <strong>
			meaning has altered what is syntactically possible</strong>.<br />
			What has happened is that our syntactical rule has been refined to 
			take semantic issues into account and is now:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>When <em>walk</em> means <em>go on foot</em> it is 
				intransitive.</li>
				<li>When <em>walk</em> means <em>exercise</em> or <em>take for a 
				short journey on foot </em>it is transitive.</li>
				<li>When <em>walk</em> mean <em>accompany</em>, it is 
				transitive.</li>
				<li>The verb can be used with distances and times as direct 
				objects.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and the issue is solved by appealing to <strong>meaning</strong>, not syntax.</p>
			<p>Exemplification follows of some of the key areas in English where 
			semantic considerations work with (not against) syntactical issues 
			to refine the rules of usage.</p>

		<h2>The article system</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>A particular source of confusion for learners from many language 
			backgrounds is the article system in English which compels speakers 
			to consider a range of factors which they may not have to think 
			about in their own languages including specificity, definiteness and 
			countability before deciding on the correct article to use.&nbsp; We 
			get from these considerations a rule which states that abstract 
			ideas take a zero article (Ø) because the reference is non-specific, 
			non-definite and uncountable.&nbsp; Thus it is that we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't approve of prejudice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was in danger<br />
			</em>and not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't approve of a prejudice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She was in a danger<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't approve of the prejudice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She was in the danger<br />
			</em>and all works well until we encounter, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prejudice against women is unacceptable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A prejudice he still has is to assume all politicians are 
			lying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a danger of it breaking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The danger is clear<br />
			</em>which appear to break the rule and must, therefore, be treated 
			as exceptions and separately learned.<br />
			A little thought, however, reveals that the issue is not 
			syntactical, it is semantic.&nbsp; Many mass nouns describing 
			abstract concepts can:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>be used both as mass nouns and as count nouns so we get, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The friendships she has are important to 
				her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sorrows of the family were many<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a pet hate of mine</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>be modified to move the concept from a generic, non-specific 
				meaning to a definite and specific reference so we can also 
				have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is one of the loves of her life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dinner was a real delight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dangers inherent in the process are clear<br />
				</em>(This small semantic issue also explains, incidentally, why 
				we have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States</em><br />
				and not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The America</em>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>No rule is being broken in these cases because the <strong>
			meaning</strong> of the nouns has altered to allow the general 
			syntactical rules for article use to be followed.</p>
			<p>The alternative to labelling some uses of the article system in 
			English as exceptions to the rules is to invent an unnecessary rule 
			to explain certain uses.&nbsp; We get, then:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bought a new flat.&nbsp; The flat was on 
			the second floor.<br />
			</em>explained by the invention of the known-unknown rule which 
			states that the unknown instance is preceded by the indefinite 
			article and a known reference by the definite article.<br />
			However, semantic considerations can be used to make this clear 
			without enjoining learners to acquire a new rule.<br />
			When the reference is indefinite but specific, the use of the 
			indefinite article is customary so we can explain:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man called while you were out<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A letter has arrived for you<br />
			</em>by invoking the meaning intended that I know <strong>what</strong> 
			sort of thing I am referring to (so references are specific to <em>
			man</em> and <em>letter</em>) but not exactly <strong>which</strong> 
			thing is in question (so the references are indefinite).<br />
			When the reference is to something both specific <strong>and</strong> 
			definite, the rule is to use the definite article (because we know 
			both <strong>what</strong> it is and <strong>which</strong> it is).&nbsp; This explains:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bathroom is upstairs<br />
			</em>because we know we are referring to a specific and definite 
			room.&nbsp; Of course, if we said:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bathroom is upstairs<br />
			</em>it would be clear that we are now referring to one bathroom 
			from a possible number of them and that would be specific reference 
			to a bathroom but indefinite reference to which bathroom and no rule 
			is broken.<br />
			If we apply that rule to the first example, it is clear that the 
			first reference to <em>flat</em> is specific (we know what it is) 
			but indefinite (we don't know which it is).&nbsp; The second 
			reference is, because of the meaning, <strong>not</strong> the 
			grammar, to something which is both specific (we know what it is) 
			and definite (we now know which it is: <em>her new flat</em>) so we 
			follow the usual rule and use the definite article for specific, 
			definite reference.&nbsp; The issue is, therefore, solved by 
			applying the rules and considering the <strong>meaning</strong> of 
			what is said rather than by inventing a new rule to explain it.</p>
			<p>The guide to the article system in English, linked below, 
			contains more consideration of semantic issues which, when ignored, 
			lead to the invention of new rules and the invocation of 
			exceptionality to explain what is actually a tightly rule-bound, 
			lexicogrammatical 
			system albeit one profoundly affected by meaning.</p>

		<h2>The passive voice</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>The system explained above is the traditional way of viewing the systems of a language 
			and in many cases it does make sense to separate them and teach, 
			say, the formation of passive-voice clauses as if it 
			were possible to analyse them without reference to the words and 
			meanings embedded in them.<br />
			Therefore, we can, taking a purely syntactical approach suggest 
			that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man drove the car</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car was driven by the man</em><br />
			describe the same proposition.<br />
			It's a short step from there to stating a rule that an active-voice 
			clause with a transitive verb taking a single object can be 
			transformed into a passive-voice equivalent.<br />
			Thus, it follows that we can present learners with, for example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style32">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style34" style="width: 225px">Active</td>
					<td class="auto-style33">&rarr;</td>
					<td class="auto-style35" style="width: 225px">Passive</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style34" style="width: 225px">The children 
					broke the plates</td>
					<td class="auto-style33">&rarr;</td>
					<td class="auto-style35" style="width: 225px">The plates 
					were broken by the children</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style34" style="width: 225px">The car 
					damaged the fence</td>
					<td class="auto-style33">&rarr;</td>
					<td class="auto-style35" style="width: 225px">The fence was 
					damaged by the car</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style34" style="width: 225px">She will do 
					the work</td>
					<td class="auto-style33">&rarr;</td>
					<td class="auto-style35" style="width: 225px">The work will 
					be done by her</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>and so on, quite literally, <em>ad infinitum</em>.<br />
			However, if we take that approach, we will soon run into trouble and 
			be forced to explain that although something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her daughter resembles her</em><br />
			is a well-formed active-voice clause with a discernible subject, a 
			transitive verb and an object as one would expect, so we can, 
			following the rules of syntax make:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is resembled by her daughter</em><br />
			and arrive at a perfectly formed (and just about understandable) clause 
			which is nevertheless disallowed in English.&nbsp; The reason it is 
			disallowed is not that it is a syntactical or grammatical exception, 
			it is to do with the meaning of the verb itself.</p>
			<p>What we have to do is look at the meaning of transitive verbs and 
			the relationships they have to their objects.<br />
			Here's what is meant:<br />
			Most transitive verbs imply that the subject of the clause is acting 
			on the object and so it is that we can make acceptable passive forms 
			from, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John kicked the ball &rarr; The ball was 
			kicked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary told a joke &rarr; The joke was told<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The storm damaged the house &rarr; The house was damaged</em><br />
			and thousands more clauses containing transitive verbs in which the 
			object is altered or acted on by the subject.<br />
			However, if we consider, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has a lot of money<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They possess four houses<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chair lacks a leg<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tank contains 45 litres<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottle holds a gallon<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This shirt fits me<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy took after his father<br />
			</em>then it is clear that the subject of the verb is not acting on 
			the object in the same way that the subjects act in the first set of 
			three examples.<br />
			What these verbs do is express a relationship between the subject 
			and the object rather than signalling that the object is affected, 
			changed or acted on by the subject and that is the reason that they 
			do not form passive clauses.&nbsp; We cannot have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A lot of money is had by her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Four houses are possessed by them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A leg is lacked by the chair</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			So our rule for how to form the passive in English has to be revised 
			to include the <strong>meanings</strong> of the verbs, not just their syntactical 
			relationships with other elements in the clause.</p>

		<h2>Relative pronoun clauses</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Relative pronoun clauses might, at first sight, be the subject of 
			syntactical issues alone because considerations of whether or not
			<em>that</em> can be used, whether or not the pronoun may be omitted 
			and whether or not the clause can be reduced by ellipting the 
			pronoun and the verb seem to be solely syntactical issues to do with 
			case and tense forms.<br />
			They are, however, also subject to issues to do with the language 
			user's intentions and the meanings which are expressed in a number 
			of ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>English distinguishes between defining and non-defining (or 
				restrictive and non-restrictive or identifying or 
				non-identifying, as you prefer) relative clauses and the type of 
				clause has a syntactical effect on how they may be constructed 
				(with or without the ellipsis of the pronoun or allowing the use 
				of <em>that</em> etc.).<br />
				However, the choice of clause type is not defined grammatically, 
				it is determined by the <strong>meaning</strong> that the 
				language signals.<br />
				We cannot allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The United States President who is here 
				at the moment will speak later</em><br />
				because we cannot define that which is unique so, in English 
				(but not in other languages for the most part), we have to 
				select a non-defining structure and mark it by punctuation or 
				tone group prosody allowing only:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States President, </em>||<em> 
				who is here at the moment,</em> ||<em> will speak later.</em><br />
				In other words, the nature of the subject of the clauses 
				determines the type of clause we are allowed and that is a 
				meaning issue.&nbsp; Any uniquely identifiable subject is 
				disallowed in a defining relative clause and that will include 
				people (identified by name or position), places (identified by 
				name, such as France, Germany, Asia, Mars etc.) and so on.<br />
				Therefore, we cannot allow, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Germany which is the richest country in 
				Europe </em>|| <em>is much admired</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Number 10 Downing Street which is in the 
				centre of London </em>||<em> is well known</em><br />
				and can only have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germany, </em>||<em> which is the richest 
				country in Europe, </em>|| <em>is much admired</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number 10 Downing Street, </em>|| <em>
				which is in the centre of London </em>||<em> is well known</em><br />
				The effect of this is to allow a certain ambiguity (another 
				meaning rather than syntactical issue) to creep in so we may 
				encounter, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The president of the company that is very 
				successful</em><br />
				which could refer to a successful company or a successful 
				president and has to be disambiguated by selecting the 
				appropriate pronoun rather than <em>that</em> and having either:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The president of the company which is 
				very successful</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The president of the company who is very 
				successful</em><br />
				and that is how the meaning the speaker wishes to signal 
				determines the syntax.</li>
				<li>The choice of pronoun in English is heavily dependent on 
				both the type of noun referent and the case of that noun.&nbsp; 
				That is to say, issues of <strong>both</strong> meaning <strong>
				and</strong> syntactical role are in play.<br />
				We find, obviously, that <em>who</em> and <em>whom</em> are used 
				to refer to people and the latter is accusative only.&nbsp; 
				There are, however, some more subtle relationships to do with 
				the meaning of the referent that are seen:<ol class="auto-style36">
					<li>The pronoun <em>which</em> may be applied to people but 
					only if the person in question is unknown to the speaker so 
					we can allow:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The police officer which arrested her made his report</em><br />
					but we do not allow<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *My local police officer which 
					arrested her made his report</em><br />
					and the difference is purely to do with the relationship 
					between the speaker and the subject of the clauses.</li>
					<li>Similarly, the pronouns <em>which</em> 
					and <em>who(m)</em> may both be applied to collectives of 
					people so we can allow both:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the committee which decided</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the committee who decided</em><br />
					and the choice will often depend on how well the people in 
					the group are known to the speaker.<br />
					However, immediately, there is a knock-on syntactical effect 
					because, in BrE at least, the verb and pronoun concord will 
					be altered so we get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the committee which decided 
					the issue and it presents its report later</em><br />
					<em>vs.:</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the committee who decided and 
					they present their report later</em><br />
					and that is an example of meaning altering syntax rather 
					than syntax being determined by grammatical relationships 
					alone.</li>
					<li>An allied issue is that the pronoun <em>who</em> can be 
					used to refer to some higher animals but only to ones with 
					which we are acquainted so we can state:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dog, who hardly barks at all, is a 
					much loved family pet</em><br />
					but we cannot state:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A dog, who barked all night, lives 
					somewhere close, I think</em><br />
					and we are forced to select <em>which</em> or <em>that</em> 
					as the pronoun.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>We can reduce a relative clause from, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lives in the house which was built by 
				his brother</em><br />
				to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lives in the house built by his 
				brother</em><br />
				without recourse to worrying about the meaning because this is a 
				syntactical issue subject to discernible structural rules which 
				can be set out in a paragraph or two (as is done in the guide to 
				the area, linked below).<br />
				There are, however, two issues to do with meaning which come 
				into play to determine whether a reduced clause is permissible 
				(or to be recommended):<ol class="auto-style36">
					<li>Time and tense:<br />
					We cannot reduce a sentence such as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lives in the house which has been 
					built by his brother</em><br />
					to<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lives in the house built by his 
					brother</em><br />
					because we lose the perfect aspect of the verb and send a 
					different signal.<br />
					We can also not reduce:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is going to live in the house 
					which will have been built by his brother</em><br />
					to<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is going to live in the house 
					built by his brother</em><br />
					because the <strong>sense</strong> of the proposition is not 
					maintained and the second sentences implies that the house 
					is already completed but the first makes it clear that it is 
					not.</li>
					<li>The nature of the subject:<br />
					If the subject of both clauses is the same, i.e., they are 
					co-referential, then only a non-defining clause can be used 
					so while we can allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman who is a gardening expert 
					will be here later to help</em><br />
					in which we define the woman, as one among many, we cannot 
					reduce that to:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The women a gardening expert will be 
					here later to help</em><br />
					because we know that <em>the woman</em> and <em>a gardening 
					expert</em> are the same entity and we cannot define the 
					same thing twice.&nbsp; We have, therefore, to make the 
					clause non-defining and only allow:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman, a gardening expert, will 
					be here later to help<br />
					</em>Issues of co-reference are to do with meaning, not 
					syntax.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All of these issues (and more are considered in the full guide to 
			the area) are to do with the meaning we wish to achieve and are not, 
			fundamentally, syntactical issues at all.</p>

		<h2>Adjuncts</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Part of the definition of an adjunct is that it is extra 
			information, often concerning the verb phrase, which is not essential to the clause and 
			can be safely omitted without damaging the syntax and acceptability 
			of the clause.<br />
			We get, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left in the morning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day, she left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked over the hill and down the lane to my house to see 
			me</em><br />
			and in all of those we have adverbial adjuncts adding information to the verb 
			phrase which can be omitted (albeit, of course, with a loss of 
			information) so we can equally have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked</em><br />
			and, because the verbs are intransitive, a two-word clause is well formed.<br />
			The same effect will work with transitive verbs although the object 
			must be retained unless they are ambivalent (like, e.g., <em>eat</em>):<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She painted the house yesterday in the 
			sunshine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They opened the box very carefully and slowly to see what it 
			contained<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week he timetabled the meeting later than usual to allow 
			people to arrive</em><br />
			and they can all be well-formed without the adjuncts as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She painted the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They opened the box<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He timetabled the meeting</em><br />
			although, again, information is lost.</p>
			<p>However, if we try this trick with some other verbs which have a 
			different sort of meaning, we encounter a problem.&nbsp; To see what 
			it is, try removing the prepositional phrases from:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put the box in the corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He placed the lamp in the corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rested the rock on the edge of the wall</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ventured further into the cave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stayed in a hotel by the river</em><br />
			and then we get the unacceptable:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He put the box<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He placed the lamp<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He rested the rock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We ventured<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She stayed </em>(unless the meaning is <em>remain</em> 
			rather than <em>reside</em>)<br />and there is, now, a need to consider meaning as well as syntax 
			to get to the root of the issue.</p>
			<p>Again, as we saw with the formation of passive clauses it is the 
			relationship which the verb signals that matters.<br />
			If, as in these examples, the verb expresses a sense of positioning 
			something (either oneself or another entity), then the place adjunct 
			is compulsory, not optional.<br />
			Verbs that do this include <span class="style_black"><em>keep, lay, place, plonk, position, 
			put, rest, set, site, situate, stick, stuff</em></span>.<br />
			and they are described as PP complement verbs.<br />
			The issue is, of course, semantic, not syntactical and to get the 
			structure right, we have to know that the prepositional phrases are 
			not adjuncts at all and that is a matter determined by the meanings 
			of the verbs.</p>
			<p>PP complement verbs are, therefore, not exceptions to the rules, 
			they are <strong>part of</strong> the rules.</p>

		<h2>Tense and aspect</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>A good example of the relationship between meaning and 
			structure concerns the use in English of the perfect aspect of the 
			verb combined with a progressive form as in, for example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>She has been working really hard recently and needs a 
				break</em></li>
				<li><em>They had been waiting for the train for hours and were 
				frozen stiff</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>and in both cases, we can see that the effect of the aspects is 
			twofold:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><span class="style_black">The progressive form emphasises the 
			duration of the event</span><br />and</li>
				<li><span class="style_black">The perfect form serves to embed 
			one event in a second event which it alters or enables in some way</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Despite the fact that many languages do not do this kind of thing 
			at all, the sense of the aspects in English is learnable and 
			teachable.<br />
			However, again, when we use different verbs which carry different 
			sorts of meaning, it becomes clear that there's a problem with 
			simple explanations.&nbsp; Consider:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style36">
				<li><em>Someone has been stealing vegetables from my garden</em></li>
				<li><em>She had been switching the heating off and on and the 
				house got colder</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Although the structures (i.e., the syntax) of sentences 1. and a. 
			and 2. and b. are parallel, it is clear that the meaning is not.</p>
			<p>The issue here is to do with what are called punctual or 
			momentary and durative verb senses.<br />
			Some verbs, such as <span class="style_black"><em>live, work, stay, 
			study, read</em></span> and a host more can be perceived as taking 
			up a time frame of some measurable length.&nbsp; For this reason, we 
			allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been living here for years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been working on the problem this week<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been staying at The Ritz<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had been studying French at university<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been reading Goethe lately</em><br />
			Other verbs cannot be used in the same sense and so the aspect which 
			the syntax of the verb phrase signals is very different:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has been hitting it with a hammer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have been arriving late most mornings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The light had been flashing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been tapping at the laptop keys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been upsetting my neighbours by parking there<br />
			</em>and in all these cases, the sense is not of a progressive 
			action, it is of a repeated or iterative action.<br />
			Certain verbs, referred to as telic (i.e., starting and finishing 
			almost simultaneously) in sense, cannot successfully be used with 
			progressive aspects at all because they produce rare or odd forms 
			such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They were popping the champagne cork<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *"That's my little success," he was quipping</em><br />
			and so on.</p>
			<p>To be clear, this is not a distinction between stative and 
			dynamic uses of the verbs (that comes next), it is dependent on the 
			meaning of the verbs alone.<br />
			Punctual verbs, for your reference, include at least: <em>arrive, 
			bang, begin, break, bump, burst, chop, crash, detonate, dip, dive, 
			drop, explode, flash, glow, hit, jolt, kick, light, meet, name, 
			open, pop, quip, rap, shatter, shoot, slam, smash, spit, spurt, 
			steal, stop, tap, thump, upset, volunteer, wake.<br />
			</em>With those verbs, a progressive form signals a repeated short 
			action, not a durative one.&nbsp; In some cases, moreover, an action 
			cannot be repeated at all (they are telic in the real sense) and the 
			progressive form is, therefore, not even allowed so for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I had been waking my sister<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They have been naming their child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *When I dropped it, the glass was shattering<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The bomb was detonating</em><br />
			are all malformed, not because they are syntactically flawed but 
			because they are semantically flawed.</p>
			<p>Again, the meanings of the verbs do not lead to exceptions to the 
			aspect rules of English, they are part of the rules.</p>

				please, promise, realise, recognise, remember, satisfy, suppose, 
				surprise, think, understand</em></span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is no denying that many of these 
			verbs do occur much more frequently in simple tense forms than in 
			progressive ones.&nbsp; On the other hand, a few, such as <em>
			measure</em>, are actually more frequently used dynamically.&nbsp; 
			Of the others, most are used both statively and dynamically with, 
			often, a shift in meaning and syntax is not independent of meaning.<br />
			Almost all these so-called stative verbs can be used dynamically and 
			it all depends on what the user of the language means and we can 
			take examples from the same four categories to show this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>She is appearing in the play<br />
				They are having trouble with their son</em></li>
				<li><em>She is not feeling well<br />
				The engine's sounding a bit rough</em></li>
				<li><em>She was hoping for better weather<br />
				They are wishing her happy birthday later</em></li>
				<li><em>She is denying all charges<br />
				I was forgetting all about the need to book a table</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is, in other words, rare to discover a verb in the lists above 
			which cannot be used dynamically and all of them take progressive 
			forms in non-finite clauses so we routinely allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Containing only four grams, the bottle is 
			tiny<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending how he feels, he'll be here later, I expect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing everyone's already here, let's start<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tasting the soup again, the chef pronounced it ready<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caring little for long walks, I stayed at home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needing some supplies, we went to the supermarket<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Realising the danger, they backed away from the edge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding his difficulty, we didn't press the matter</em></p>
			<p>It is probably clear by now that simply labelling verbs as stative 
			or dynamic is an inadequate and potentially harmful approach to 
			take because it ignores meaning.</p>

			<p>When asked for a rule of thumb to explain what adjectives do in 
			English it is simple to say something like <em>they describe or 
			modify a following or preceding noun or noun phrase</em> 
			and that works well until we encounter times when they don't 
			(really).<br />
			By some estimates, around 40,000 words in English qualify as 
			adjectives and the majority of them are unproblematic for learners.<br />
			If you are reading this somewhat esoteric guide, you will probably 
			be aware that we can say:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman was young</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was a young woman</em><br />
			and there is little to tell between those two propositions so most 
			adjectives can be used predicatively or attributively (as they are 
			respectively in these examples).<br />
			If we leave it at that, we have a reasonably good rule for the 
			syntax of adjective use which will hold up well for thousands of 
			adjectives.<br />
			However, the in-service guide to adjectives on this site is a long 
			one and that betrays the fact that all is not so simple.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				<td class="auto-style31">
		<h3>Inherent <em>vs.</em> non-inherent uses</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>While it is possible to say, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend is old</em><br />
			which will mean that he or she is somewhat advanced in years, when 
			we use the adjective attributively as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's an old friend</em><br />
			we are confronted by the fact that the adjective now describes the 
			<em>friendship</em> rather than the friend.&nbsp; The fact that the word <em>
			friendship</em> does not appear in the clause at all is somewhat 
			confusing if we are taking a purely grammatical approach and 
			focusing on word order and syntax.<br />
			We have, therefore, to take a semantic tool to the mechanism and see 
			why this is happening.&nbsp; To do that, we have to consider what is 
			an alienable or inalienable characteristics of the noun we are 
			considering.&nbsp; That is to say, are the characteristics we wish 
			to describe related to the noun or part of the noun itself?<br />
			For example, if we say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That woman is small</em><br />
			we are referring to an inalienable, inherent quality of the woman and we can 
			also phrase that as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is a small woman</em><br />
			so both types of syntax are available to us.<br />
			Another way of saying this is that the characteristic of smallness 
			is inherent in the noun and in neither case is the woman's size 
			subject to her or anyone else's will.</p>
			<p>However, when it comes to alienable qualities, the case is 
			altered so if we say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is a small businesswoman</em><br />
			using the adjective predicatively, we find that the reference now is 
			to the type of business the woman runs rather than the woman 
			herself.<br />
			Even attributively with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The small businesswoman at the back asked a question</em><br />
			we are constrained to understand that it is the business to which 
			the adjective refers, although attributive use can produce some 
			ambiguity.</p>
			<p>The rule, such as it is, is semantic not syntactical and, briefly 
			states:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Any adjective which cannot apply to a 
			relationship will automatically be understood as referring to an 
			inherent property of the noun</p>
			<p>That means, for example<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend is tall</em><br />
			can only be applied to the person because <em>tall</em> cannot be 
			used (because of its <strong>meaning</strong>) to modify a relationship.<br />
			Other adjectives which have to be considered semantically rather 
			than syntactically include: <span class="style_black"><em>close, long-standing, nodding, good, intimate, 
			distant, old, bitter, devoted, great</em></span> and more.<br />
			So, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They are bitter enemies<br />
			</em>will be seen to apply to the 
			enmity not the people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She's a distant cousin<br />
			</em>will be seen to apply to the 
			kinship not the person<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a long-standing member of staff<br />
			</em>will be seen to apply to the employment, not to the person<br />
			and so on.</p>
			<p>Another semantic issue concerns the adjectives <em>new, old, 
			young</em> and <em>elderly</em> which can be variably applied 
			depending on the intended meaning and no syntactical rule is 
			available to help us out so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a new colleague</em><br />
			will be taken to refer to the relationship not the person, but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a young colleague</em><br />
			will be taken to refer to the person not the relationship, and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's an old friend</em><br />
			can only refer to the relationship, but:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's an elderly friend</em><br />
			can only refer to the person.</p>
			<p>This is not, lest we get carried away into the stratosphere of a 
			lexical approach, a question of collocation.&nbsp; It is an issue 
			with meaning.</p>

			<p>While we can have, as we saw above, both:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a young girl</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl is young</em><br />
			further semantic issues arise from the meaning of the adjectives we 
			use and the message we want to send.</p>
			<p>If we wish to imply that the characteristic is under the control 
			of the person (or thing) in question then we are forced to employ 
			the predicative word ordering.&nbsp; We get, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police officer was patient</em><br />
			and that strongly implies that she may have become impatient at any 
			moment.<br />
			However, if we say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The patient police officer talked to the men</em><br />
			the implication is that the officer was always patient and not just 
			at that time.</p>
			<p>This phenomenon also affects imperative uses of adjectives, so, 
			while we can accept:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't be angry<br />
			</em>because we understand that being angry or not is a factor which 
			the hearer can control, we cannot accept:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Don't be English<br />
			</em>because one's nationality is a state not a factor under the 
			personal control.</p>
			<p>The same phenomenon also affects whether a verb may be used 
			progressively or statively so there is clearly a distinction 
			between, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was being interesting<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John is an interesting man</em></p>
			<p class="indentpara">
			<em>The 
			rule is that stative adjective use can be both predicative and 
			attributive but dynamic adjective use demands 
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>only</strong></span> the predicative 
			form.</em></p>
			<p>
			And this is, of course, a semantic rule which determines a 
			syntactical event.</p>

			<p>The general rule is, as you know, that adverbs modify verb 
			phrases and adjectives noun phrases so we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work slowly</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was slow / It was slow work</em><br />
			This is, naturally, a purely syntactical rule to do with examining 
			the structure of the sentence or clause and determining what word 
			class is 
			being modified and then selecting the correct word class to fill the 
			slot in the clause.&nbsp; There is no difficulty filling slots such 
			as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary was driving __________</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary is a __________ driver.</em></p>
			<p>However, here are some examples in which the rule appears to 
			break down:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hammer it <span class="styleblackbold">flat</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make it <span class="styleblackbold">wet</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Play it <span class="styleblackbold">loud</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pull it <span class="styleblackbold">straight</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll it <span class="styleblackbold">smooth</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pull it <span class="styleblackbold">tight</span><span class="style_black"><br />
			</span>
		</em>and in all these cases we have a simple imperative clause with a 
			transitive verb and a pronoun object.&nbsp; The syntactical rule 
			should allow only an adverb to fill the slot but the sentences are 
			all well formed.<br />
			The solution lies in meaning, as usual.&nbsp; The adjectives here 
			are not being applied to the verbs (because that is disallowed by 
			the rules of English syntax) but to the objects of the verbs which, 
			in this case, are pronouns but could be nouns so we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hammer the iron <span class="style_black">flat</span><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make the paper <span class="style_black">wet</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Play the music <span class="style_black">loud</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pull the cloth <span class="style_black">straight</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll the pastry <span class="style_black">smooth</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pull the rope <span class="style_black">tight</span></em><br />

			<p>It is a fairly simple matter to divide verbs in English into 
			those that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Intransitive verbs:<br />
				which never take an object such as: <span class="style_black"><em>
				go, come, arrive, cough, happen</em></span> and a few hundred 
				more and form clauses such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived at the hotel<br />
				</em>but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She arrived the hotel</em></li>
				<li>Ambivalent verbs:<br />
				which may take an object or not such 
				as: <span class="style_black"><em>break, close, drive, finish, 
				eat, smoke</em></span> and hundreds more and form clauses such 
				as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ate late<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ate lunch</em></li>
				<li>Transitive verbs:<br />
				which are those that must take an object such as: <em>
				<span class="style_black">believe, consider, lose, receive, take</span>
				</em>and hundreds more and form clauses such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lost my wallet<br />
				</em>but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I lost</em></li>
				<li>Ditransitive verbs:<br />
				which are those that can take both a direct and an indirect object 
				such as: <span class="style_black"><em>ask, give, hand, tell, 
				offer, pay, promise </em></span>and a few hundred more 
				(probably) which form clauses such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They gave the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They gave me the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They gave the money to me<br />
				</em>but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They gave</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>and the rules we apply to the verbs are all syntactical to do 
			with where we place the objects (if they are permitted) and what 
			order they come in.</p>
			<p>However, a glance at the following examples will show that there 
			are also lexical, semantic rules in action here, too.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>He considered the issue<br />
				He considered her a fool</em></li>
				<li><em>The chair broke<br />
				She broke the chair</em></li>
				<li><em>He read a book<br />
				He read them a story</em></li>
				<li><em>She called at seven<br />
				She called her father</em></li>
				<li><em>She built me a house<br />
				She built a house for me<br />
				She brought me a shirt<br />
				She brought a shirt to me</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here are some notes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first of these examples concerns the meaning of the verb
				<em>consider</em>.&nbsp; If it means <em>think about</em>, then 
				it is monotransitive and conforms to the usual rules.&nbsp; 
				However, if it means <em>deem</em> or <em>regard</em>, the two 
				objects become co-referential and the verb takes an object 
				complement.<br />
				The syntax is altered to take account of the meaning.</li>
				<li>Here we have a case of the appropriacy of the subject.&nbsp; 
				If the subject is animate (or at least active) and acts upon the 
				object, the verb is transitive and <strong>must</strong> take an 
				object.<br />
				If, on the other hand, the subject is inanimate, the verb is 
				intransitive and <strong>cannot</strong> take an object while 
				retaining the same meaning.<br />
				In the second case, the verb means <em>damage seriously</em> and 
				in the first, it means <em>become unusable</em>.<br />
				In the second sense, too, we have what is called an ergative 
				form.&nbsp; The ostensible, <strong>semantic</strong> object of 
				the verb is, in fact, <em>the chair</em> but the ergative use 
				raises it to the <strong>syntactical</strong> subject.</li>
				<li>With this pair the focus falls on the meaning of <em>read</em>.&nbsp; 
				When it means <em>speak aloud</em>, the verb can be ditransitive 
				or monotransitive but when it takes its usual meaning, the verb 
				is stubbornly monotransitive.&nbsp; The syntax, again, has to be 
				altered to take account of meaning.</li>
				<li>The verb <em>call</em> means either <em>visit</em> (in which 
				case it is intransitive) but when it means <em>telephone</em> it 
				is transitive or intransitive.&nbsp; Moreover, when it is used 
				transitively, it can only mean <em>telephone</em>.</li>
				<li>This is a clear case of a ditransitive use of the verbs but, 
				unfortunately, the dative shift with <em>build </em>only works 
				with the preposition <em>for</em> and not with the usual one, <em>to</em>.&nbsp; So 
				we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She built a house for me</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She built a house to me</em><br />
				The verb <em>bring</em> is more forgiving and allows both 
				formulations.<br />
				The reason lies in the meaning, as usual.&nbsp; When the 
				indirect object is the beneficiary, the usual choice falls on
				<em>for</em> but when the indirect object is the recipient, the 
				choice usually falls on <em>to</em>.<br />
				The verb <em>bring</em> can imply either a recipient or a 
				beneficiary and that is why both pronouns are allowable with the 
				dative shift so we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She brought a shirt to me</em><br />
				with the indirect object as the recipient<br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She brought a shirt for me</em><br />
				with the indirect object as the beneficiary<br />
				Hence, too, we have, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sent me the letter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sent the letter to me</em><br />
				because the indirect object is the recipient but we can also 
				allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She cooked me a meal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She cooked a meal for me</em><br />
				because the indirect object is the beneficiary.<br />
				That's rather subtle but a question of meaning not syntax.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Other verbs depend heavily on meaning for syntactical accuracy.<br />
			For example, <em>speak</em> and <em>talk</em> can be intransitive 
			(when they mean <em>say aloud </em>or <em>exchange information and 
			ideas</em>) but <em>say</em> and <em>tell</em> are never 
			intransitive.&nbsp; The verb <em>tell</em>, when it means <em>inform</em> 
			is transitive and can be ditransitive but does not allow the dative 
			shift at all because the meaning does not concern the indirect 
			object, it concerns the information so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me the train was delayed</em><br />
			is not convertible to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He told the train was delayed to me</em><br />
			However, when it concerns the act of communicating rather than 
			informing, the dative shift is allowed<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told a lie to her boss</em><br />
			So, because the sense of the verb has shifted, so the syntax shifts 
			to follow.<br />
			The other notable feature is when the direct object of <em>tell </em>
			is a nominalised clause, an indirect object is required because the 
			meaning of the verb is <em>inform</em> and that verb is, by nature, 
			transitive.<br />
			We allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me when the meeting started</em><br />
			but not:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She told when the meeting started</em><br />
			and the syntax is under the control of the lexis.</p>
