			<p>The words <em>will</em> and <em>would</em> derive from the same 
			Old English verb: <em>wyllan</em>.<br />
			The word<em> wyllan</em> is connected to the Old English <em>willa</em> 
			which meant <em>mind, will, determination, purpose, pleasant thing</em>.&nbsp; 
			Many connected words also meant something desirable such as <em>
			willspell</em> (good tidings), <em>willodlíce</em> (willingly) and
			<em>willsele</em> (a pleasant dwelling).<br />
			The verb <em>wyllan</em> had at least five distinct meanings:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>be about to</em> (simple futurity)</li>
				<li><em>be willing to </em>(promise)</li>
				<li><em>wish </em>(hope)</li>
				<li><em>desire </em>(want)</li>
				<li><em>be used to / used to </em>(habit or repetition)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and all five meanings can be identified in Modern English:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>I will leave now </em>(the sense of be about to)</li>
				<li><em>I will write soon</em> (the sense of promise)</li>
				<li><em>Would that the rain stopped</em> (the sense of wish)</li>
				<li><em>I will not have it!</em> (the sense of desire)</li>
				<li><em>I would often walk the dogs there </em>(the sense of 
				habit or repetition of actions)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The words carried and still carry these meanings and it is the 
			polysemous nature of the verb which causes the problems.&nbsp; It 
			doesn't help if teachers and coursebook writers can't disentangle 
			the meanings, of course.<br />
			(Not discussed here is the transitive verb <em>will</em> meaning to 
			make something happen by the power of thought.&nbsp; Also left out 
			of this guide is the use of the verb <em>will</em> to mean leave as 
			a legacy or the noun <em>will</em> as in <em>to make a will </em>or
			<em>willpower</em>.&nbsp; If those are thrown into the mix when the 
			modal auxiliary forms are being considered, learners <strong>will</strong> get confused.)</p>
			<p>The modern word <em>would</em> is derived from the past tense (<strong>and</strong> 
			past subjunctive) of <em>wyllan</em> which was <em>wolde</em>.<br />
			The past simple and the past subjunctive were distinguishable in Old 
			English but in Modern English the tenses have the same form for all 
			verbs (except the verb <em>be</em>).<br />
			The confusion, therefore, arises because we can no longer 
			look at the form of the verb to distinguish between the subjunctive use of the verb (to express 
			conditionality or doubt), the predictive use of the verb (to express 
			futurity) and the volitional use of the verb (to express 
			willingness).</p>
			<p>The past subjunctive appears in subordinate clauses, referring to 
			an unreal or improbable present or future event / state.<br />
			When we say, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I wish my mother <span class="style_black"><strong>were</strong></span> 
			here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks as if she <span class="style_black"><strong>knew</strong></span> 
			him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would go now if I <span class="style_black"><strong>were</strong></span> 
			you</em><br />
			we are using the past subjunctive form of the verb.</p>
			<p>The past simple of <em>will</em> appears when we say, for 
			example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He said his mother <span class="style_black"><strong>
			would</strong></span> come tomorrow</em><br />
			which is the past of<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He says his mother will come tomorrow</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew there <span class="style_black"><strong>would</strong></span> 
			be a problem</em><br />
			which is the past of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know there will be a problem</em></p>

			<p>We need to distinguish carefully between the five meanings of the

			<p>As we saw, the Old English verb signified futurity but also 
			willingness.<br />
			The modern English verb does the same and may signal pure futurity 
			or willingness (also known as volition) to do something.&nbsp; It is 
			not arguable that willingness generally refers to an action in the 
			future or the future in the past but signalling willingness refers 
			to the <strong>current</strong> situation, not to the future act 
			itself.<br />
			It is, to be fair, not always easy, but usually possible, to 
			untangle the two commonest meanings of <em>will</em> and <em>would</em>.<br />
			The problem arises when teachers or the materials they use confuse 
			these first two meanings of the verb.<br />
			Here are some examples of what is meant:</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style35" style="width: 199px">
					<strong>Example</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style36"><strong>Comment</strong></td>

					<td class="auto-style15" style="width: 199px">
			<em><strong>Will you marry me?</strong></em></td>
					<td class="auto-style16">This is not asking about the 
					future.&nbsp; This question is concerned with finding out 
					the addressee's <strong>current</strong> attitude.<br />
					It does not require the responder to speculate about 
			future events and <em>will</em> is not being used to refer to future 
			time at all.<br />
					It means <em>
					<span class="style_black"> Are you willing NOW to marry me?</span></em>&nbsp; The 
			question is about the <strong>present</strong> not the future.</td>
					<td class="auto-style33" rowspan="2">volition</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style15" style="width: 199px">
					<strong><em>Would you marry me if I were rich?</em></strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style16">This is the same verb, with the 
					same meaning, with the subordinate clause in the 
					subjunctive.<br />
					It means:
					<span class="style_black"> <em>Given an unlikely 
					circumstance (my being rich), are you willing IN YOUR 
					CURRENT IMAGINATION to marry me?</em></span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style17" style="width: 199px">
			<em><strong>Will she marry him in September?</strong></em></td>
					<td class="auto-style18">This is a question about the future 
					because it asks the hearer to speculate about the future.<br />
					It is not asking whether she wants or is willing to marry 
					before September but concerns the likelihood of the even 
					happening in the future.</td>
					<td class="auto-style32" rowspan="2">futurity</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style17" style="width: 199px">
					<strong><em>She thought she would marry before she was 
					thirty.</em></strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style18">This also refers to the future but 
					to the future in the past.&nbsp; It is akin to the back-shifting 
					of tenses in reported or indirect speech such as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he thought it would rain</em><br />
					which is one way of reporting<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think it's going to rain"</em></td>

				</table>
			<p>There are levels of volition:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Weak</strong> volition with the verb unstressed and 
				often used in the 2nd person as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Will you open the window, please?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'd come if someone asks him</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Medium-strength</strong> volition, often in the 1st 
				person and often implying a promise or undertaking of some kind.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't bother you with my troubles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'd come early to help get things ready if you want</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Strong</strong> volition, with the verb stressed, 
				often in the 3rd person and implying insistence which the 
				speaker disapproves of, usually.&nbsp; This form is <strong>
				never</strong> contracted to <em>'ll</em> or <em>'d</em>.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He </em><strong><em>will</em></strong><em> 
				argue with me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He </em><strong><em>would</em></strong><em> drink too much at 
				parties<br />
				</em>(It is probably worth noting that the use of <em>shall</em> 
				instead of <em>will</em> here means that it is the speaker's 
				insistence not someone else's as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She </em><strong><em>shall</em></strong><em> 
				marry him!</em>)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A special example of the difference in meaning comes when we 
			consider conditional sentences.&nbsp; The usual rule is that we can 
			only use <em>will</em> or <em>would</em> once in conditional 
			sentences (in BrE) so, for example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I'll come if you call</em><br />
			is allowed, but<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *I'll come if you will call</em><br />
			is not allowed<br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>If you won the lottery, you would be able to marry her</em><br />
			is allowed, but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;*If you would win the lottery, you would be able to marry 
			her</em><br />
			is not.<br />
			The rule works fine <strong>providing</strong> the meaning of the verb is concerned 
			with futurity or with an imaginable, if unlikely, or impossible 
			future.</p>
			<p>However, it falls down as soon as we consider volition or 
			willingness.&nbsp; Then we can have, for example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I'll come if you will do the driving</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; You would be healthier if you would cut down your smoking</em><br />
			In both these cases, we have the first verb referring to the future 
			(<em>will come, would be</em>) but the second (<em>will do, would 
			cut down</em>) referring to volition so repeating the verb (but
			<strong>not</strong>  its meaning) is allowable.</p>
			<p>The two meanings are not always easily separable.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<img alt="futurity" height="139" src="../../tenses/tensesandaspects/tenseimages/futurity.png" width="400" /></p>
			<p>The problem in the middle lies with the intention of the speaker.&nbsp; 
			It may be a prediction about the future based on sound evidence or 
			it may be a medium-strength expression of willingness.&nbsp; Only the whole context 
			allows us to see which is meant.<br />
			The distinction is important because the intrinsic meaning of an 
			expression of willingness (which is a present reference) has to be 
			separated from the extrinsic meaning of inevitability concerning 
			future events (which is a proper future reference).<br />
			If we don't have this clear in our heads when we are setting the 
			language in context, we will induce errors in our learners.<br />
			A slightly more technical way of saying all this is:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li><em>will</em> and <em>would</em> used to talk about the future are in the 
				realm of epistemic modality (i.e., referring the likelihood or 
				otherwise of an event)</li>
				<li><em>will</em> and <em>would</em> to talk about volition are in the realm of 
				dynamic modality (i.e., referring to a person's ability or 
				willingness)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For more examples, go to
			the guide 
			to talking about the future in English.<br />
			For more on the distinction between types of modality refer to
			the guide 
			to types of modality.<br />
			Both those guides are linked in the list at the end.</p>

			<p>When we talk about wishes and desires, we are in the area of 
			unreal events.&nbsp; If it is currently raining, one can wish for it 
			to stop but not wish for it to start.&nbsp; If we are a smoker we 
			can wish we weren't but not wish we smoked.<br />
			These two ideas fall under two types of suasion:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The optative:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directed at things we cannot personally affect 
				or change</li>
				<li>The hortative:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directed at changing someone else's behaviour (exhortative) 
				or getting them to cooperate (cohortative)</li>
			</ol>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong><span class="auto-style56">The optative</span></strong><br />
				<img alt="optative" height="133" src="../../images/pray_stfrancis200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>The optative can be expressed using either <em>will</em> or 
				<em>would</em>, 
				although, because we are usually referring to unreal events 
				outside our control, <em>would</em> is more common in this function 
				and also occurs in the past as one would expect.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish it would rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope it will rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished he would say something<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wishes he will ask her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the sun will shine</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt>As can be seen from these examples, the optative use of the 
				verb is closely related to the epistemic uses we looked at 
				above.&nbsp; The verb is being used to talk about likelihood or 
				unlikelihood as well as the personal view of the desirability of 
				something.<br />
				<br />
				</dt>
				<dt><strong><span class="auto-style56">The hortative</span></strong><br />
				<img alt="beg" height="133" src="../../images/beg_hand200.gif" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>When we are trying to alter someone else's behaviour, or get 
				them to cooperate with ours, we can 
				do so from a position of authority (so are happy to use <em>will</em>) 
				or from a position of inferiority or equality (when <em>would</em> 
				is more useful because it distances and sounds more polite).&nbsp; 
				Because these are imperatives of a sort and threaten the face of 
				the hearer, they are often phrased 
				as interrogatives to allow the possibility of their being 
				refused.<br />
				For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Will you close the door, please?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you mind waiting?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you stop now?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you please get out?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you get that for me?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like some cake?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to pay, now, please</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would rather stay, if you don't mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would sooner not do that</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt>This use of the verb is more closely akin to the dynamic use 
				of the verb seen in the examples above because it refers to 
				people's willingness to do something, not the likelihood or 
				otherwise of their doing it.</dt>
				<dt>As was noted, the hortative comes in two flavours and both 
				can be expressed using will/would:</dt>
				<dd>Exhortative:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Will you get that for me?</em><br />
				Cohortative:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Would we be better working together?</em></dd>
