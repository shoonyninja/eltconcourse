			<p>Ambiguity is not, of course, a phenomenon which is confined to 
			English.&nbsp; All languages can be used in a way that allows two 
			possible interpretations, sometimes more, of what seems to be a 
			simple enough statement or question.<br />
			In English, for example, the following has recently occurred:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="auto-style1">He: </span>Welcome 
			home.&nbsp; I've saved you a job.<br />
			<span class="auto-style1">She:</span> Thanks, that's good of you.<br />
			<span class="auto-style1">He:</span> Don't be sarcastic.<br />
			<span class="auto-style1">She: </span>What?!</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" class="tableblueborder">

			<div id="save" style="visibility: hidden">
			<p>The answer lies in the polysemous nature of the verb <em>save</em>.&nbsp; 
			It has more than one meaning although the meanings are clearly 
			connected.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It means <em>set aside for action or use in the future </em>
				as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have saved enough money for my holiday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have saved the best idea till last</em></li>
				<li>It means <em>avoid having to use or do</em> as in, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have saved an hour's work by using the new program<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has saved the company lots of money</em></li>
				<li>It also means <em>rescue</em> as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was saved from drowning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The castaways were saved by a passing fishing boat</em><br />
				of course but that is not relevant here.</li>
			</ol>
				<p>What has happened in this little dialogue is:</p>
				<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li><em>He</em> is using the verb to mean 
				<em>set aside or keep for later</em> (meaning 1., above) but <em>she</em> has understood that it 
				meant <em>avoid having to do something</em> (meaning 2.).<br />Naturally, 
					<em>he</em> expected <em>her</em> not to be delighted to be told there 
				was a job waiting to be done, having been saved for her, so <em>he</em> 
				interprets her thanks as being an attempt at sarcasm.</li>
					<li><em>She</em>, on the other hand, have assumed that the second meaning of the verb
					<em>save</em>, 
				is understandably confused at being accused of sarcasm because 
				the thanks were sincerely intended.<br /></li>
				</ul>
			<p>What we have is an example of lexical ambiguity inherent in the 
				polysemous nature of the verb.</p>
		</div>
			<p>Many of the examples below are culled from other guides on this 
			site in which ambiguity is considered almost in passing.&nbsp; Here, 
			it is the focus.</p>

			<p>This guide considers three main possible sources of ambiguity, 
			explains what the problem is and tries to suggest some ways to 
			remove the ambiguity.&nbsp; The three are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Lexical ambiguity</strong><br />
				The source for this is the fact that some words have homonyms 
				which look and sound the same but carry different meaning.<br />
				In spoken language, homophones will have the same issues and in 
				written language homographs may also be a source of ambiguity.<br />
				The issue we saw above with the word <em>save</em> is not, 
				however, to do with homonymy; it concerns polysemy, the 
				phenomenon of words have different but connected meanings rather 
				than different and unconnected meanings.&nbsp; The borderline 
				between homonyms and polysemes is, however, somewhat blurred.<br />

				It is unlikely that any of these examples set in context, will

				<li><strong>Syntactical ambiguity</strong><br />
				There are a number of ways ambiguity can arise from the syntax 
				of a sentence or clause and they are mostly to do with what 
				modifies what or what qualifies as an independent constituent of a 
				sentence or clause (related areas as we shall see).<br />
				They can also be to do with how tense forms in English are 
				understood and how subordination and coordination are understood.<br />

				Syntactical ambiguity arises from the phenomenon of syntactical 
				homonymy and can sometimes be almost impossible to untangle 
				without reconstructing the clause or sentence.</li>
				<li><strong>Semantic ambiguity</strong><br />
				Some see this as a subset of syntactical ambiguity but it is 
				noticeably different because much depends on the shared

				It concerns what is meant, not what is necessarily understood by

			<p>It is quite rare for a lot of polysemes and homonyms, <strong>
			especially those concerning content words</strong>, to cause a great 
			deal of difficulty because the context almost always determines the 
			meaning that is meant.<br />
			We are unlikely to misinterpret, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took an aspirin<br />
			</em>as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stole an aspirin<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She dug the garden<br />
			</em>as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She appreciated the garden<br />
			</em>although misunderstanding is always possible if the context is 
			too thin.</p>
			<p>Function words and auxiliary verbs are a very different matter because 
			the meaning they convey relies on the co-text.<br />
			Here are some examples but no guide to ambiguity can ever cover all 
			the possible sources.</p>

				<td class="auto-style56">
				&nbsp;</td>

		</table>
		
			<p>The verb <em>will</em> is polysemous because it applies to a future time 
			in one sense and to a current willingness in another.&nbsp; So,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you marry me?<br />
			</em>concerns the woman's current willingness to commit to something,
			but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will she marry him?<br />
			</em>is a question requiring speculation about the future.<br />
			In the first example, the modal auxiliary verb refers to dynamic 
			modality (volition) and in the second to epistemic modality 
			(propositional truth).<br />
			That is the reason that <em>will </em>can appear in both parts of a 
			conditional sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give you a lift if you will share the 
			petrol costs<br />
			</em>Normally, the rule is not to use <em>will </em>in both clauses 
			but it is correct here because the first incidence of <em>will</em> refers to the future 
			and the second refers to the hearer's willingness to do something.<br />
			It is only useful to tell learners that we cannot use <em>will</em> 
			in both parts of a conditional sentence if we are clearly using the 
			verb in one of its main meanings.&nbsp; In other words, being 
			careful to avoid ambiguity.</p>
			<p>A fundamental reason why modal auxiliary verbs cause so much 
			trouble for learners is their polysemous nature.<br />

				&dagger; This ambiguity cannot occur in writing because <em>can</em>

			eight possible meanings (present possibility, future possibility, 
			past possibility, present ability, future ability, past ability,

			<h4>Scope<br />
			<img alt="radio" height="133" src="../../images/radio_telscope200.jpg" width="200" /></h4>
			<p>This sentence:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The hardworking students passed the examination<br />
			</em>is ambiguous because this may mean either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The students who worked hard passed the examination<br />
			</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (and other 
			students, less hardworking, did not)<br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The students, who worked hard, passed the examination<br />
			</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (all of them were hardworking and all of 
			them passed)<br />
			Other adjectives are open to similar multiple interpretations.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The available money is inadequate<br />
			</em>in which the adjective <em>available</em> can mean:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>all the money</em> (with no more to come)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the money available now </em>(with more to come)<br />
			This can be disambiguated in two ways:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li>By making a relative pronoun clause and distinguishing 
				between defining (restrictive) and non-defining (unrestricted) 
				forms:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The money, which is available, is 
				inadequate<br />
				</em>(i.e., it is all available)<br />vs.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The money which is available is 
				inadequate<br />
				</em>(i.e., only the money which is available, not all of it)</li>
				<li>By post-positioning the adjective:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The available money<br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of it<br />
				vs.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The money available now<br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some of it with more to come</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The second disambiguation trick works with other adjectives as 
			in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The visible stars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stars visible tonight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present staff<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The staff present now<br />
			</em>The first refers to all the visible stars, the second to only 
			those visible tonight, the third to the entire staff at the moment 
			and the fourth to only those employees who are here.</p>
			<p>Determining how an adjective should be understood in the sense of 
			what is included and what excluded is not always simple.&nbsp; It is 
			not that we have a polysemous word acting as an adjective (although 
			that happens) but where the scope of modification starts and stops.</p>
			<p>The adjective <em>bad</em> is somewhat ambiguous in this respect.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She felt bad<br />
			</em>could imply that she felt unwell or that she felt guilty although 
			this can be disambiguated with the use of the adverb so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She felt badly<br />
			</em>can only mean <em>unhappy</em> or <em>guilty</em>, not <em>unwell</em>.</p>
			<h4><a name="classifiers"></a>Classifiers, epithets and punctuation<br />
			<img alt="class" height="133" src="../../images/classify_birds200.jpg" width="200" /></h4>
			<p>There is some ambiguity in written language whether a word is 
			intended as an adjective (an epithet) or a classifier because:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			a senior school teacher<br />
			</em>could be interpreted as<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a teacher at any type of school who is 
			experienced and older</em><br />
			or<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a teacher who happens to work in a senior school</em><br />
			In the former, the word is adjectival and in the latter it is a 
			classifier.</p>
			<p>Commas are often optional but required when there is possible 
			ambiguity.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a large house plant<br />
			</em>is unlikely to be misunderstood as a plant only for use in large 
			houses but to avoid any ambiguity, it can be written as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a large, house plant<br />
			</em>Compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a small garden plant<br />
			</em>in which there is ambiguity which can be eradicated by punctuating 
			it as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a small, garden plant<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a small-garden plant</em></p>
			<h4><em>old </em>and<em> new</em>: inherent and non-inherent 
			meanings<br /><em><img alt="car" height="133" src="../../images/car_vintage_authentic200.jpg" width="200" /></em></h4>
			<p>The adjective <em>old</em> may be applied to inanimate and animate nouns 
			but when it is applied to animate nouns the meaning will vary 
			depending on how it is used (attributively or predicatively).&nbsp; 
			So, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is an old friend</em><br />
			will be understood non-inherently as applying to a long-lasting 
			friendship, not to the person but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend is old</em><br />
			will be understood as applying to the friend, not the friendship.<br />
			Unfortunately the word <em>old</em> has two common antonyms: <em>new</em> 
			and <em>young</em> and they are differently understood depending on 
			the nature of the noun to which they are applied.<br />
			So, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a new friend</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; All these students are new</em><br />
			will not be seen as applying to the people but to their recent 
			arrival whereas<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a young friend</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The students are young</em><br />
			can only be understood as applying to the people directly.<br />
			However:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a new car in the car park<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That car in the car park is new<br />
			</em>are truly ambiguous and could mean<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car has only recently appeared in the car 
			park<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car has recently been manufactured<br />
			</em>and only context can disambiguate the meaning.</p>
			<p>A further, connected source of ambiguity lies in the fact that 
			some adjectives can apply to a person and to a relationship so, for 
			example, while it is clear that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a new friend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are old rivals</em><br />
			both apply to the friendship and the rivalry, not the people 
			involved, it is less clear whether the adjectives in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a reliable friend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a remarkable friend<br />
			</em>refer to a reliable / remarkable person or a reliable / 
			remarkable friendship.<br />
			Ambiguity can be avoided by using the adjective predicatively 
			because then the assumption will always be that it applies to the 
			person:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend is reliable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her friend is remarkable</em></p>
			<h4><a name="compandsuper"></a>Comparative forms<br />
			<img alt="2" height="133" src="../../images/two_espresso200.jpg" width="200" /></h4>
			<p>The question here is whether the words <em>more</em> and <em>less</em> 
			are acting as adverbs modifying adjectives or as determiners 
			modifying noun phrases.&nbsp; It matters because the meaning changes 
			depending on the grammatical function of the word.&nbsp; In that 
			sense, this straddles the boundary line between lexical and 
			syntactical ambiguity.<br />
			Here are three examples:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style101">
				<li><em>They provided more accurate figures</em><ol class="auto-style100">
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>= <em>They provided more 
					figures which were as accurate as the old ones</em><br />
					or</li>
					<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = <em>They provided figures which 
					were more accurate than the old ones</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>I want more useful work from you</em><ol class="auto-style100">
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = I want more work from you which 
					is as useful as the work you have done<br />
					</em>or</li>
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = I want work from you which is 
					more useful than the work you have done</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>She had less expensive work done</em><ol class="auto-style100">
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = She had less work done which 
					was as expensive as the previous work<br />
					</em>or</li>
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = She had work done which was not 
					as expensive as the previous work</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The ambiguity arises from the fact that in:<br />
			i.a., ii.a. and iii.a., the words <em>more</em> and <em>less</em> 
			are determiners referring to the noun phrases <em>accurate figures, 
			useful work</em> and <em>expensive work</em><br />
			but in:<br />
			i.b., ii.b. and iii.b., the words <em>more</em> and <em>less</em> 
			are adverbs modifying the adjectives <em>accurate, useful </em>and
			<em>expensive</em></p>
			<p>It is impossible to tell by looking at the sentences what the words 
			<em>more</em> and <em>less</em> are doing grammatically.&nbsp; 
			Rephrasing as above will remove the ambiguity.</p>
			<h4>Superlative forms<br />
			<img alt="Mountaineer, Mountain, Peak, Man, Climbing, Climber" height="133" src="../../images/man_top_mountain.jpg" width="200" /></h4>
			<p>Compare<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl is most intelligent<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most intelligent girl<br />
			</em>both of which are possibly ambiguous because they can mean 
			either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very intelligent girl<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl who is more intelligent than the all 
			the others<br />
			</em>The use of the definite article determiner can disambiguate 
			this because<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most intelligent girl<br />
			</em>will only be understood in the second sense.<br />
			The key here is not to word class because in all the examples, the 
			word <em>most</em> is an adverb modifying the adjective.&nbsp; 
			However, the word is polysemous because is means <em>very</em> or
			<em>extremely</em> and it forms the superlative of an adjective 
			expressing the uppermost degree.</p>

			<p>At first sight, a sentences such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He's driving</em><br />
			is not ambiguous, especially when it's linked to an image as here.<br />
			However it can mean:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Driving is what he is doing right this minute<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He won't answer his phone.&nbsp; He's driving.</em></li>
				<li>Driving will be his preferred mode of travel for the

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's driving to work these days because

				<li>Driving is what he has agreed to do in the future<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can have another beer because he's 
				driving me home later</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is where we encounter a famous Chomskyan concept.&nbsp; 
			Chomsky, to whom there is a guide linked at the end, chose to 
			demonstrate what he meant by deep structure with the example 
			sentence:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visiting aunts can be boring<br />
			</em>because that can mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aunts who visit can be boring<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The activity of paying a visit to aunts can 
			be boring</em></p>
			<p>It is, in fact a bit of a four-way cheat in our terms here 
			because the ambiguity relies on:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Selecting a transitive verb so that there is manufactured 
				ambiguity concerning subjects and objects.&nbsp; You cannot, for 
				example, construct a similarly ambiguous sentence with verbs 
				like <em>arrive</em> or <em>speak</em> because you get the 
				unambiguous:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking clocks can be irritating</em></li>
				<li>Selecting a semantically allowable transitive verb.&nbsp; You 
				cannot, for example, construct a similarly ambiguous sentence 
				with verbs like <em>explain</em> or <em>show</em> because you 
				get the unambiguous:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Showing your anger can be inadvisable</em></li>
				<li>Using the uninflected modal auxiliary verb, <em>can</em>, to 
				disguise the verb-noun concord.&nbsp; You cannot, for example, 
				construct a similarly ambiguous sentence without the modal 
				auxiliary because that produces:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visiting aunts bore me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visiting aunts bores me</em><br />
				which contain no ambiguity because the first has a plural noun 
				as the subject and the second has a singular gerund as the 
				subject.&nbsp; We don't need to think about deep structure to 
				disambiguate the sentences, simply leaving out the modal 
				auxiliary verb will do.</li>
				<li>Selecting a verb which has a gerund form (a verbal noun) and 
				a participle form which can act as an adjective.&nbsp; You 
				cannot, for example, construct a similarly ambiguous sentence 
				with verbs like <em>wear</em> or <em>repair</em> because neither 
				<em>wearing</em> nor <em>repairing</em> can operate as participle adjectives 
				although the verbs are transitive.&nbsp; 
				We allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wearing warm clothes can be useful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repairing computers needs some care<br />
				</em>but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *These are wearing clothes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is a repairing man</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is quite difficult to make a parallel sentence to the one 
			Chomsky used although:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Eating apples can be healthy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drinking water can be good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cleaning materials may be expensive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burning rubbish could be dangerous</em><br />
			and just possibly<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Climbing plants can be dangerous<br />
			</em>(if you are a field mouse)<br />
			will show the same kind of ambiguity.<br />
			The parlour game is to think of ten more.</p>
			<p>In fairness, this was not the point that Chomsky was making.<br />
			He used ambiguity as a way of revealing the inadequacies of a 
			structuralist approach to grammatical analysis and was not concerned 
			with communicative effect.</p>
			<p>Tense-form ambiguity is a much more important issue for teaching.</p>

			<p>Misuse of the -<em>ing</em> participle in non-finite 
				clauses often results in what is called a dangling or unattached 
				participle.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting on the bus, John's wallet fell 
				from his pocket<br />
			</em>is semantically and grammatically flawed because it was not the 
				<em>wallet</em> that got on the bus.&nbsp; 
				To avoid this kind of ambiguity, the participle and the main clause 
				verb need to have the same subject.&nbsp; The use of a finite 
				clause solves the issue:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While he was getting on the bus, John's 
			wallet fell from his pocket<br />
				</em>In this case, little ambiguity is caused because we know 
			that wallets do not, of their own volition, take public transport.</p>
			<p>However, there are times when the rule is not quite so clear cut.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Mary getting off the bus<br />
			</em>is likely to be interpreted as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Mary while she was getting off the bus<br />
			</em>but could mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was getting off the bus, I saw Mary<br />
			</em>We need to be more careful here because both the possible 
			subjects are able to take public transport.<br />
			In order to repair the ambiguity, we have to rephrase the sentence 
			as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Mary when she was getting off the bus<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Mary when I was getting off the bus</em></p>
			<p>The rule of attachment to the same subject is often relaxed 
				so we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_black"><em>Being</em></span><em> Friday, the staff left 
				early<br />
			</em>which is not ambiguous because the staff cannot be Friday.<br />
			On the other hand,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Being</span> optimistic, Mary will 
				be able to do the job<br />
				</em>is ambiguous depending on whether the speaker 
				or <em>Mary</em> is the optimist.<br />
			The ambiguity here is explained a little more (and a little more 
			clearly) below, under semantic ambiguity.</p>
			<p>These sorts of non-finite clauses used to express temporal or causal 
			relationships can give rise to some ambiguity of meaning.<br />
			For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Being in New York, she went to see him<br />
			</em>could mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While she was in New York, she went to see him<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Because she was in New York, she went to see him.</em></p>
			<p>In all such cases, rephrasing the thought using finite rather 
			than non-finite verb forms solves the problem as can using the right 
			subordinating conjunction as in the examples above.</p>

			<p>It is often difficult to determine which verb an adverb modifies 
			when there are two verbs in the same sentence.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The people who came quickly got lunch</em><br />
			has two interpretations depending on which verb is being modified by
			<em>quickly</em>:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li>The modified verb phrase is <em>came</em>, in which case we 
				have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People who were quick to arrive got lunch</em></li>
				<li>The modification belongs with the verb <em>got</em>, in 
			which case we have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people who came 
				got lunch quickly</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>We can rephrase this to remove the ambiguity as we have done 
			here.&nbsp; The key is to put the adverb in the right place.<br />
			It can also be disambiguated by pausing in speech after <em>quickly</em> 
			(and signalling sense 1.) or after <em>came</em> (and signalling 
			sense 2.).<br />
			That is straightforward with middle-position adverbs such as those 
			of manner which are mobile but even easier with adverbs of 
			indefinite frequency as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The men who arrived late frequently missed 
			lunch<br />
			</em>vs.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The men who frequently arrived late missed 
			lunch<br />
			</em>because these adverbs conventionally precede the main verb.</p>
			<p>There are also times when it is not clear whether an adverbial is 
			functioning to modify a verb or its subject or object.<br />
			For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His friends at that time were working<br />
			</em>could mean:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>His friends were working at that time</em><br />
				which modifies the verb phrase, or</li>
				<li><em>The friends he had at that time were working</em><br />
				which modifies the noun phrase</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and unless we know whether the prepositional phrase is modifying 
			the noun or the verb phrase,
			we cannot arrive at the meaning.&nbsp; This is an example, arguably, 
			of phrase constituent ambiguity, which is considered in much more 
			detail later.&nbsp; The concepts of syntactical and 
			phrase-constituent ambiguity overlap with blurred edges.<br />
			Simple rephrasing (as above) will disambiguate the meanings.</p>
			<p>Finally, there are times when an adverbial can apply to either of 
			two verbs.&nbsp; When verbs form strings in the syntax (i.e., they 
			catenate) some ambiguity sometimes arises in deciding which verb the 
			adverbial is modifying so, for example, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She undertook to do the work straightaway</em><br />
			it is not apparent whether</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>the undertaking happened immediately</em><br />
				in
				which <em>straightaway</em> is modifying the verb <em>undertake</em>, or</li>
				<li><em>the doing of the work will happen immediately</em><br />
				in
				which <em>straightaway</em> modifies <em>to do the work</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The intuitive response from many will be that the adverbial 
			modifies the nearest verb so interpretation b. is probably inferred.&nbsp; 
			We can disambiguate the sentence by moving the adverbial and 
			producing:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Straightaway, she undertook to do the work</em><br />
			which signals interpretation a.</p>

			</table>
		
			<p>Some conjunctions cause ambiguity issues.</p>
			<h4><em>although</em> and <em>while</em></h4>
			<p>Both <em>although</em> and <em>while</em> are subordinating 
			conjunction of concession and occur unambiguously in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like reading in the evening while my 
			husband prefers watching TV<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I like reading in the evening, my husband prefers 
			watching TV<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<p>A little care is needed, however, because <em>while</em> is also 
			a temporal subordinator so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it is raining, I'll take a walk<br />
			</em>is unambiguous because <em>although</em> has only one function 
			but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is raining, I'll take a walk<br />
			</em>can mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it is raining I'll take a walk<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as it is raining I'll take a walk<br />
			</em>It could also mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it is raining I'll take a walk<br />
			</em>because <em>while</em> sometimes carries the sense of causality 
			usually signalled by <em>so</em> or <em>because</em>.</p>
			<h4><em>but</em> and <em>although</em></h4>
			<p>There is also scope for ambiguity with the distinction between 
			coordinators and subordinators.<br />
			In coordinated clauses 
			we can omit the subject, providing it is common to both clauses so we get, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary was exhausted but worked on till six<br />
			</em>in which it is clear that <em>Mary</em> is the subject of both clauses.<br />
			We cannot do this with subordination so we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Although Mary was very tired, worked on till six</em></p>
			<p>There is, however, a little more to it than that because in a 
			sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was exhausted but John worked on till six</em><br />
			it is averred by some that <em>He</em> and <em>John</em> must refer 
			to different people.&nbsp; In other words, <em>He</em> cannot be a 
			cataphoric reference to <em>John</em> in a coordinated sentence.&nbsp; 
			This is somewhat questionable and the sentence is at best ambiguous 
			insofar as <em>He</em> and <em>John</em> could refer to the same 
			person or to different people depending on context and co-text.<br />
			With subordination, on the other hand, cataphoric reference is 
			assumed so in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he was exhausted, John worked on 
			till six</em><br />
			it is inevitable that <em>he</em> and <em>John</em> will be assumed 
			to be the same person.</p>
			<h4><em>so</em> and <em>so that</em>: purpose or result?</h4>
			<p>The conjunction <em>so </em>also causes problems because it 
			implies both a result and a cause.<br />
			It is <strong>resultative</strong> in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night was very clear so I could see the 
			ships out to sea<br />
			</em>It is <strong>causative</strong> in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dug a deep hole so the tree was firmly 
			planted<br />
			</em>However, ambiguity can arise with a sentence such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Someone stole my car so I couldn't get to work</em><br />
			which means either:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>The result of the theft of my car was that I couldn't 
				get to work</em><br />
				or</li>
				<li><em>Someone stole my car to prevent me getting to work</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The way to disambiguate is to replace <em>so</em> with <em>because</em> when we are 
			referring to result and then we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because someone had stolen my car I couldn't 
			get to work<br />
			</em>which is unambiguous, or to rephrase the thought as in b.</p>
			<p>The same consideration applies in these examples.&nbsp; 
			It is <strong>resultative</strong> in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ground was icy so that I was careful how 
			I walked<br />
			</em>in which the care is a result of the ice and <em>so that</em> 
			is acting as a coordinating conjunction.<br />
			It is, however, <strong>purposive</strong> and a subordinating 
			conjunction in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put salt on the driveway so that the ice 
			would melt</em></p>
			<p>This means that, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was standing in the light so that I could 
			see him<br />
			</em>is ambiguous and means either:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>The result of his standing in the light was to make him 
				visible</em><br />
				(coordinating the clauses)<br />
				<strong>or</strong></li>
				<li><em>He stood in the light in order to make himself visible<br />
				</em>(subordinating the second clause to the first)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Again, we have to rephrase to exclude the possibility of 
			ambiguity.</p>
			<h4><em>before</em></h4>
			<p>Temporal conjunctions can also cause ambiguity if handled 
			carelessly.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I expected he would be happy with the figures before the meeting 
			started<br />
			</em>can be interpreted either as:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>Before the meeting started, I expected he would be happy with the 
			figures</em><br />or</li>
				<li><em>That he would be happy with the figures before the meeting started 
			was what I expected</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The ambiguity can be resolved by moving the temporal clause to 
			the initial position as in a.</p>
			<h4><em>if</em> and <em>when</em></h4>
			<p>The conjunctions <em>if</em> and <em>when</em> also cause 
			problems.&nbsp; In, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When possible, the work should be completed 
			without disturbing the residents<br />
			</em>has two interpretations:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>Whenever it is possible, the work should be completed 
				without disturbing the residents<br />
				</em>or</li>
				<li><em>If it is possible, the work should be completed without 
				disturbing the residents</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Resolving the ambiguity simply means being careful to use<em> if</em> 
			when a conditional rather than temporal meaning is intended.</p>
			<h4><em>if</em> and <em>whether</em></h4>
			<p>Consider:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me if you need any help<br />
			</em>which has two interpretations:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>Tell me if you need any help<br />
				</em>as a true conditional in which the imperative depends on 
				the need for help<br />or</li>
				<li><em>Tell me whether you need any help</em><br />
				which is not conditional and simply asks for the speaker to be 
				informed</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Disambiguation again involves using <em>if</em> only in 
			conditional senses.</p>
			<h4><em>because</em></h4>
			<p>Some ambiguity may arise with negative causality so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't come because of the chance that she would be there</em><br />
			may be interpreted either as:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>The reason I didn't come was because there was a chance 
				she would be there<br />
				</em>or</li>
				<li><em>The reason I came was not that there was a chance that 
				she would be there</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Only context and intonation (stressing <em>because</em>) will disambiguate 
			the meaning unless we rephrase the whole meaning as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a chance she would be there so I 
			didn't come<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That there was a chance she would be there 
			was not the reason I came.<br />
			</em>This is also considered below when we come to the ambiguity 
			that negative sentences can evince.</p>
			<h4><em>to </em>and<em> in order to</em></h4>
			<p>The word <em>to</em> is sometimes just an abbreviation 
			of <em>in order to</em>.<br />
			This can create some ambiguity.<br />
			Compare for example:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>I agreed to go to the restaurant</em></li>
				<li><em>I agreed to get a bit of peace.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the first case, we have a <em>to-</em>infinitive doing its 
			usual catenative job referring to a prospective event.<br />
			In the second case, however, <em>to </em>is an abbreviation of <em>
			in order to</em> and is not catenative.<br />
			Here's a slightly different example:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>I agreed to the proposal to finish the meeting early</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>is ambiguous because it means either:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>I agreed to the proposal that the meeting should finish 
				early</em><br />
				or</li>
				<li><em>I agreed to the proposal in order to finish the meeting 
				early</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>and only rephrasing such as above can disambiguate the sentence.</p>

			<p>This is a major area of ambiguity and the final one to tackle 
			under syntactic ambiguity.<br />
			There is a dedicated guide to disentangling clause constituents on 
			this site, linked below, so here we will rely on a few examples of 
			the sorts of ambiguity that can arise.<br />
			Here are the examples:</p>
			<h4>Instrumental phrases</h4>
			<p>Many case-grammar languages have a way of marking instrumental 
			case but English doesn't, preferring to rely on prepositional 
			phrases.&nbsp; Unfortunately, prepositions themselves are 
			polysemous.&nbsp; The preposition <em>with</em> carries the meaning of an 
			instrument as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cut down the tree with an axe<br />
			</em>and of accompaniment as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man in the corner with the dog.<br />
			</em>This causes problems.</p>
			<p>For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anne hit the intruder with a chair<br />
			</em>is probably not ambiguous at all (but it is conceivable that 
			the intruder was carrying a chair).<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anne shot the intruder with a knife<br />
			</em>is also unambiguous because you can't shoot someone with a 
			knife so the only interpretation is that the intruder carried the 
			knife.<br />
			However,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anne hit the intruder with a gun<br />
			</em>is truly ambiguous because it can be interpreted as either:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>Anne used a gun to hit the intruder</em><br />
				or</li>
				<li><em>Anne hit the intruder who was carrying a gun</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>So rephrasing is necessary to make the sense clear.</p>
			<h4>Prepositional phrases as modifiers of nouns or verbs</h4>
			<p>Take:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shouted to the man by the river<br />
			</em>which has two interpretations:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>By the river I shouted to the man</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>It was by the river that I shouted to the man</em></li>
				<li><em>I shouted to the man who was by the river<br />
				</em>or<br />
				<em>It was the man by the river that I shouted to</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>It depends on whether we consider <em>by the river</em> to be an 
			independent phrase or one which is attached to the noun.<br />
			The subject of the sentence is clear: it is <em>I</em>.<br />
			The object, however, can either be:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>the man by the river</em><br />
				or</li>
				<li><em>the man</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The adverbial phrase which modifies the verb is then absent (if 
			a. is the object) or is <em>by the river</em> if b. is the object.<br />
			In other words, we have to decide whether the shouting happened by 
			the river or not.<br />
			We can use a diagram to make it clear:<br />
			<img alt="river" height="107" src="../../imagesgraphics/ambiguity_phrases465.jpg" width="465" /></p>
			<p>In the first case the verb phrase in blue has the blue adverbial 
			modifying it with the verb's object in red.&nbsp; The phrase <em>by 
			the river</em> is independent and can be moved to the beginning to 
			get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the river I shouted to the man</em><br />
			In the second case the verb phrase is unmodified and the object is 
			in red but <em>by the river</em> is not an independent phrase 
			because we cannot move it to the beginning and retain the same 
			sense.</p>
			<p>Here are some more examples taken from various guides on this 
			site for you to untangle:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>He used the computer in his office</em><ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>Which computer did he use?</li>
					<li>Where did he use the computer?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><em>The teacher shouted at the boy in room 13</em><ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>Where did the shouting happen?</li>
					<li>Which boy did the teacher shout at?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><em>He cut up the tree in the corner</em><ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>Which tree did he cut up?</li>
					<li>Where did the cutting up happen?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><em>John upset the lady in the garden</em><ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>Who did John upset?</li>
					<li>Where did the upsetting happen?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><em>He read the book on the island</em><ul class="greenbullet">
					<li>Where did he read?</li>
					<li>What was the subject of the book?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Disambiguation in writing</h4>
			<p>In written language, it is impossible to disentangle independent 
			and mobile phrases so rephrasing is the option.&nbsp; This often 
			means:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Moving the prepositional phrase:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At his office he used the computer</em></li>
				<li>Making a cleft sentence:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the boy in room 13 that the 
				teacher shouted at</em></li>
				<li>Otherwise defining the object:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He cut up the corner tree</em></li>
				<li>Making a passive:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tree in the corner was cut up</em></li>
				<li>Using a relative pronoun clause:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John upset the lady who was in the garden</em></li>
				<li>Changing the prepositions and producing, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read the book about the island</em></li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Disambiguation in speaking</h4>
			<p>In speaking we can deliberately move the tonic syllable to disambiguate what might otherwise be 
			unclear.&nbsp; For example, the sentence:</p>
			<p><em class="auto-style17">Anne hit the man with the chair</em></p>
			<p>has two possible interpretations as we saw.</p>
			<p>We can disambiguate this in speaking by paying 
			attention to how the utterance is stressed.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			<table cellspacing="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2" class="auto-style136">1</td>
					<td class="auto-style18"><em>Anne</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style19"><em>hit the</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style139"><em><strong>MAN</strong></em></td>
					<td class="auto-style19"><em>with a chair</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style137">pre-head</td>
					<td class="auto-style138">head</td>
					<td class="auto-style141">nucleus</td>
					<td class="auto-style138">tail</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2" class="auto-style133">2</td>
					<td class="auto-style134"><em>Anne</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style135"><em>hit the man with a </em></td>
					<td class="auto-style140"><em><strong>CHAIR</strong></em></td>
					<td class="auto-style135">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style18">pre-head</td>
					<td class="auto-style19">head</td>
					<td class="auto-style139">nucleus</td>
					<td class="auto-style19">-</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In case 1, the pitch movement is most obvious on the word <em>man</em> 
			so that becomes the focus of attention.<br />
			In case 2, <em>chair</em> is the focus because that is where the 
			pitch movement occurs.<br />
			Disambiguating which meaning is intended by pausing and tone shifts 
			are what Wells refers to as the demarcative function of intonation, 
			i.e., the separating off of the crucial data.</p>
			<h4>Position and direction adjuncts</h4>
			<p>The usual rule in English is that position adjuncts cannot 
			co-occur with dynamic verbs of motion but directional adjuncts of 
			place can so we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is climbing at the top<br />
			</em>because<em> at
			</em>refers to place, not direction,<em>
			</em>but we do allow<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is climbing to the top<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is sitting at the top.</em></p>
			<p>An ambiguity can arise, therefore, concerning whether, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children were running outside<br />
			</em>means:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the children were outside, they were 
			running<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children were in the process of moving 
			from inside to outside<br />
			</em>Usually, the assumption will be that direction of movement is 
			the intended message but that is not always the case.<br />
			Because some prepositional adjuncts are always directional, the 
			ambiguity cannot arise, for example, with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to walk into the garden<br />
			</em>but can with the preposition <em>in</em> and <em>outside </em>
			which refer to both direction and position so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked in the airport<br />
			</em>might mean he did some walking in the airport or that he moved 
			into the airport on foot and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They threw it outside the house<br />
			</em>might mean they threw it from inside to outside or that it was 
			outside the house before they threw it.<br />
			The former is what people will usually understand.</p>
			<h4><em>yes-no</em> questions</h4>
			<p>Nearly all <em>yes-no</em> questions are, by their nature 
			ambiguous in terms of what they are asking.&nbsp; Really simple 
			questions such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is John here?</em><br />
			are not ambiguous because the direction of the question can only be 
			John's presence or absence.<br />
			However, a question such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did Mary cook the turkey last night?</em><br />
			contains four phrase elements (the subject, the verb phrase, the 
			object and the adverbial of time).&nbsp; It means, therefore, that a
			<em>yes-no</em> question could be directed at any of these 
			constituents.&nbsp; Like this:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it Mary who cooked the turkey last night?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it last night that Mary cooked the turkey?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it the turkey that Mary cooked last night?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did Mary do to the turkey last night?</em><br />
			and only the co-text and context can disambiguate this in writing 
			although sentence stress can make the sense clear in spoken 
			language by stressing <em>Mary, last night, the turkey</em> and <em>
			do</em> respectively.<br />
			The disambiguation which the cleft forms allows is, incidentally, 
			one of the motivations for their use although, as we see from the 
			fourth question, the verb 
			cannot be the focus of a cleft sentence form and the question is 
			differently formed.&nbsp; We cannot allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Was it cook that Mary did to the turkey last 
			night?</em><br />
			There is more on cleft sentences in the guide to them, linked below.</p>

				<h3><a name="causative"></a>Causative structures</h3></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>You are probably aware that two verbs in English, <em>have</em> 
			and <em>get</em>, function in causative structures to place the 
			focus on what is done rather than who did it.&nbsp; So, for example, 
			it is easy to see that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got my house painted last year<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the report re-written with the new 
			figures<br />
			</em>both signal the fact that the speakers / writers did not affect 
			the action personally but persuaded, cajoled, required or paid for 
			others to do it for them.&nbsp; (The guide to the causative which 
			explains how this is achieved is linked below.)</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, the structures themselves allow of multiple 
			interpretations and, in many cases, only context and co-text can 
			help us to the meaning.</p>
			<p>Ambiguity arises because the structures themselves are used to 
			signal different meanings so, for example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Often the meaning is transparent so, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had her car repaired by the garage at the end of the road<br />
				</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got her car repaired by the garage at the end of the road<br />
				</em>are both unambiguously causative structures which signal 
				what she required the garage to do.</li>
				<li><em>She had her car stolen for the insurance money</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>She got her car stolen for the insurance money</em><br />
				both refer to a fraudulent act.</li>
				<li><em>She had her car stolen while she was on holiday</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>She got her car stolen while she was on holiday</em><br />
				both probably refer to an unfortunate event.</li>
				<li><em>She had her foot caught in the lift doors</em><br />
				refers to an unfortunate state <strong>or</strong> event and is 
				not causative<br />
				but<br />
				<em>She got her foot caught in the lift doors</em><br />
				can <strong>only</strong> refer to an unfortunate event not a 
				state but is similarly not causative.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So, standing alone, a sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got the safe broken open</em><br />
			can carry three different senses (fraudulent act, misfortune or 
			simple causative).<br />
			Context is needed to know which is the correct interpretation.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, again, both verbs can signal the speaker's 
			accomplishment, not the fact that the speaker did not perform the 
			action personally.&nbsp; Further ambiguity arises because English 
			does not distinguish the form of a participle used verbally and one 
			used adjectivally.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the report finished on time<br />
			</em>will usually be interpreted as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I succeeded in getting the report finished on 
			time<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the report nearly finished when the new 
			figures came in<br />
			</em>signals the fact that the report writing was almost 
			accomplished.&nbsp; In both cases, the word <em>finished</em> is 
			interpretable as a participle adjective equal to <em>a (nearly) 
			finished report .</em><br />
			When the context and co-text do not help, however, ambiguity arises 
			so, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to get the car washed for the wedding<br />
			</em>can mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to wash the car for the wedding<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to have the car washed for the wedding<br />
			</em>and only context and co-text can disambiguate the senses.<br />
			Compare, too, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go the kitchen floor swept and mopped by 
			six o'clock<br />
			</em>which almost certainly refers to the speaker's achievement, 
			with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the kitchen floor swept and mopped by 
			the maid<br />
			</em>which is clearly causative.</p>
			<p>No ambiguity can arise, therefore, when the adjective is not 
			derived from a verb so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the figures right<br />
			</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the figures right<br />
			</em>are unambiguous, but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the figures worked out<br />
			</em>and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I had the figures worked out<br />
			</em>are both ambiguous.<br />
			These uses of ostensibly causative structures when no causal effect 
			is implied is non-intuitive and confuses learners easily.</p>

			<p>Now we come to semantic ambiguity caused mostly by the 
			hearer's inability to understand what belongs to what in the 
			utterance.</p>

				<td class="auto-style99">
				<em>the gardener's shed</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style56">
				&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>The genitive in English does more than refer to possession and 
			therein lies a good deal of scope for ambiguity.</p>
			<p>In the example above of the shed, for example, it is unclear 
			whether the reference is to:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>a particular gardener's workplace </em>(association)</li>
				<li><em>a shed owned by a gardener </em>(possession)</li>
				<li><em>the type of shed typically used by gardeners </em>(description)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Additionally:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>a young man's job</em><br />
				does not necessarily refer to a job held by a young man but 
				refers to a type of physically demanding work</li>
				<li><em>a doctor's surgery</em><br />
				does not usually refer to a surgery owned by a doctor but one in 
				which a doctor (any doctor) carries out medical work</li>
				<li><em>an agricultural worker's cottage</em><br />
				is most unlikely to belong to a particular worker but describes 
				a type of modest building</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Rephrasing is the only way to disambiguate but it is often a 
			clumsy alternative and many prefer to leave the ambiguity standing 
			and rely on the context to make it clear which meaning of the 
			genitive is intended.</p>
			<p>Another function of the genitive is described as 
			objective insofar as it refers to the object of a verb.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the woman's imprisonment<br />
			</em>probably refers to the fact that the woman is the object and 
			was imprisoned but it needn't because it can be a subject genitive 
			as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the woman's imprisonment of the children<br />
			</em>in which the woman is the subject and did the imprisoning.&nbsp; 
			From that we can then abstract a genitive:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the children's imprisonment by the woman.<br />
			</em>But, in order to disambiguate, we have to select a different 
			form of the genitive and use the <em>of-</em>phrase, periphrastic 
			structure instead of the <em>'s</em> inflexion.&nbsp; Then we can arrive at a distinction between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the imprisonment of the woman<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the woman's imprisonment<br />
			</em>which is less ambiguous, although still not wholly unambiguous.</p>
			<p>Another example is:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man's investigation<br />
			</em>which
			could mean:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>the investigation into the man</em><br />
				or</li>
				<li><em>the investigation done by the man</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>If a. is intended then<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the investigation of the man<br />
			</em>is preferred (the man was investigated, not the man did the 
			investigation).<br />
			If b. is the preferred sense then<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man's investigation<br />
			</em>will be preferred, but ambiguity remains.<br />
			The rule of thumb is to reserve the <em>of</em>-formulation for objective 
			genitives and keep with the '<em>s</em> formulation for humans in subjective 
			genitive expressions whenever there is a need to avoid ambiguity.</p>

			<p>What do you understand by the following negative statements?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He didn't speak to the girl in the red dress at the party.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She didn't meet the man who bought the house on Thursday.</em></p>
			<p>Both sentences are ambiguous and mean either:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>He didn't speak to the girl in the red dress</em><br />
			or<br />
				<em>He spoke to the girl in the red dress but not at the party</em></li>
				<li><em>She didn't meet the man who bought the house</em><br />
			or<br />
				<em>She met the man who bought the house but not on Thursday</em><br />
				(In this case, too, incidentally, we do not know whether the 
				Thursday applies to when she didn't meet the man or whether the 
				man bought the house on Thursday.)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We can disambiguate these to some 
			extent when speaking by stressing the element we want to negate:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He didn't speak to the girl in the red dress at the 
			</em><span class="style_underline"><strong><em>PARTY</em></strong></span>.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't 
			meet the man who bought the house on </em>
			<span class="style_underline"><strong><em>THURSDAY</em></strong></span>.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He didn't speak to the girl in the red </em>
			<span class="style_underline"><strong><em>
			DRESS</em></strong></span><em> at the party.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't 
			meet the man who bought the </em><span class="style_underline">
			<strong><em>HOUSE</em></strong></span><em> on Thursday.</em><br />
			Or, as we saw above we can subtly alter where the tonic stress 
			falls.<br />
			So, in the first two, we have <em>party</em> and <em>Thursday</em> 
			as the nucleus with no tail and in the second we move the nuclear 
			stress to <em>dress</em> and <em>house</em> and have a falling tone 
			on the tails, <em>at the party</em> and <em>on Thursday</em>.</p>
			<p>In written language, 
			no such resources are available so we have to alter the ordering of the elements to make meaning 
			clearer.<br />
			For example:<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
			At the party, he didn't speak to the girl in the red dress.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 
			Thursday, she didn't meet the man who bought the house.</em><br />
			Even then, 
			some ambiguity might remain so to be 100% clear, we need to rephrase 
			entirely with something like:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;He didn't speak to the girl in the red dress until after the 
			party.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't meet the man who bought the house until the 
			following Friday.</em></p>
			<p>As you see, the tendency in English to apply negation to phrases 
			rather than words can lead to a considerable amount of ambiguity.<br />
			A general, if sloppy, rule is:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">If the negation is ambiguous, hearers will usually assume that it is 
			the final part of the sentence that is being negated.</p>
			<p>So for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He didn't drive<br />
			</em>means he travelled in a different way<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He didn't drive my car<br />
			</em>implies he drove his own or someone else's car<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He didn't drive my car carefully<br />
			</em>will normally be understood to mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He drove my car carelessly<br />
			</em>rather than<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He didn't drive my car<br />
			</em>In other words, to re-state the rule slightly differently</p>
			<p class="indentpara">If there is a danger of some ambiguity, the scope of 
			negation is confined to the final element of a negative utterance.</p>
			<p>Occasionally, especially in writing where the use of emphasis, tone 
			units and special sentence stress is less available, some negative 
			statements can be ambiguous and must be rephrased to make the scope 
			of negation clear.</p>

			<p>In spoken language, the senses can be disambiguated by stressing 
			the determiners <em>any</em> and <em>a few</em>, stressing the pre-determiners 
			<em>half 
			(of)</em> and <em>all (of)</em>, stressing the preposition <em>due to</em> and by placing a rising intonation contour 
			on <em>his working style</em>.<br />
			In written English, that form of disambiguation is not available so 
			careful writers will rephrase to avoid the possible confusion.</p>
			<p>English is unusual in forming what is called transferred negation 
			(for much more, see the guide to negation, linked below).&nbsp; This 
			means, for example, that we prefer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think he's coming</em><br />
			over<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he's not coming</em><br />
			even though the second of these is more logical.<br />
			There is, however, a danger of some ambiguity when negation is 
			transferred (or understood to be transferred). So, for example:<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
			John doesn't think his sister is happy</em><br />
			can be interpreted two ways:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style100">
				<li><em>John believes his sister is unhappy</em><br />
				or</li>
				<li><em>John does not think his sister is happy, he knows she 
				is.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The second interpretation is rare and will be signalled as such, 
			either by the insertion of an additional clause as above or by heavy 
			emphasis being placed on the main verb.</p>

			<p>Careless handling of theme and rheme often results in ambiguity 
			or, at least, some confusion.<br />
			For example, if we take the two alternative forms:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>She wanted to see her sister so she took the train to London</em></li>
				<li><em>She took the train to London because she wanted to see her 
				sister</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>we need to understand that they are not synonymous and simply 
			randomly selected alternative forms.</p>
			<p>In sentence 1. the Theme is<em><span class="style_black"><br />
			</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">She wanted 
			to see her sister<br />
			</span></em>and the rheme is <em>she took a train to London<br />
			</em>In sentence 2. the theme is<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>She took the train to London</em></span><br />
			and the rheme is <em>she wanted to see here sister</em><br />
			The theme is the jumping off point and the rheme acts to 
			complete the thought.</p>
			<p>Now, because rhemes form the following themes in coherent 
			English, naturally, the first sentence would be followed by a second 
			saying something about <em>London</em> (the rheme of the first sentence), such as:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<em>While she was there, she took the opportunity to visit the British 
			Museum</em><br />
			and the second sentence would be more naturally followed by 
			something about the <em>sister</em> such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She was delighted to see her<br />
			</em>If we follow the first sentence with something more appropriate to 
			the second we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wanted to see her sister so she took the 
			train to London.&nbsp; She was delighted to see her.</em><br />
			in which we are left in a state of ambiguity regarding who was 
			delighted to see whom because we have been ambushed by the 
			incoherent use of theme-rheme structure and expected to read or hear 
			something about London.</p>
			<p>Moral: rhemes are used as themes in following sentences to avoid 
			ambiguity.</p>

			<p>Case is not evident in English except in the realm of pronouns 
			where it is critical to understand what did what to whom or whose 
			item was whose.</p>
			<p>Consider these two sentences:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>She likes you more than I</em></li>
				<li><em>She likes you more than me</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In sentence 1., the meaning is that<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She likes you more than I like you<br />
			</em>but in sentence 2. it is<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She likes you more than she likes me<br />
			</em>It is only by insisting on the use of the correct case for the 
			pronoun that the ambiguity can be avoided so the informal<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She likes you more than me<br />
			</em>could carry either meaning.</p>
			<p>The ambiguity is very common because in informal speech, the 
			accusative (object) case of the pronoun is conventionally used so, 
			e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He likes spicy food more than me<br />
			</em>would normally be interpreted as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is more fond of spicy food than I am<br />
			</em>although, because the accusative pronoun, <em>me</em>, has been 
			used, it really means:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is more fond of curry than he is fond of 
			me<br />
			</em>The only way to disambiguate is to use rather formal and 
			correct language and say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He likes spicy food more than I<br />
			</em>to mean we are comparing tastes, and reserve<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He likes spicy food more than me<br />
			</em>to mean we are comparing taste for food with liking for a 
			person.</p>
			<p>An additional issue with pronoun forms concerns the fact that the 
			English system is defective, not always distinguishing case, so, for 
			example, the pronoun <em>you</em> serves for all cases in English.&nbsp; 
			It is simply impossible in the following to decide what the sentence 
			means:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He likes Mary more than you<br />
			</em>could mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He likes Mary more than you like Mary<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He likes Mary more than he likes you</em></p>

			<p>There is on this site a guide to
			adverbials, linked below.&nbsp; For now, we just need to know that 
			adjuncts modify adjective, adverb and verb phrases, conjuncts 
			link whole clauses and sentences together (which is why they 
			are sometimes called linking adverbials) and disjuncts modify the 
			whole of clauses, not just the verb phrase (which is why they are 
			sometimes called sentence adverbials).</p>
			<h4>Conjunct problems</h4>
			<p>If the adverb is not separated by commas or by pausing between 
			separate tone units from the rest of the clause, then some ambiguity 
			arises.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Her husband was displeased and she ended up similarly unhappy</em><br />
			means that we are comparing her unhappiness with her husband's 
			displeasure so the adverb is only modifying the adjective, which is 
			commonly what adverbs do.<br />
			However,<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Her husband became displeased and she ended up, similarly, unhappy</em><br />
			betokens that we are comparing her ending up unhappy with her 
			husband's becoming displeased and the adverb is functioning as a 
			conjunct linking the whole second 
			clause to the first.<br />
			</p>
			<p>Fronting the adverbs removes the danger of ambiguity so the adverb 
			in:<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Her husband became displeased.&nbsp; Similarly, she ended up unhappy</em><br />
			is&nbsp;only interpretable as a conjunct.</p>
			<h4>Disjunct problems</h4>
			<p>One of the examples in the opening tables was:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Being honest, he was seen 
						as rude</em></p>
			<p>Which is interpretable in two ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>My honest opinion is he was seen as rude</em><br />
				or</li>
				<li><em>Because he was honest he was seen as rude</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There, it was listed under syntactical ambiguity but it is also a 
			semantic problem because the hearer does not know who is being 
			referred to as <em>honest</em> so the issue considered here.<br />
			If the speaker wishes to make it clear that he or she is trying to 
			be honest then the phrase <em>Being honest</em> attaches to all that 
			follows.&nbsp; It is a style disjunct because the speaker is 
			signalling how the hearer should understand what is said.<br />
			We can rephrase to remove the ambiguity, of course, as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because he was being honest he was seen as 
			rude<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may speak honestly, he was seen as rude</em></p>
			<p>Other disjuncts can also be interpreted as adjuncts unless the 
			phrasing in speech is carefully produced and punctuation is used 
			successfully.&nbsp; Even then, however, ambiguity can remain without 
			rephrasing the thought.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>To be fair, Mary treated everyone equally</em><ul class="bluebullet">
					<li><span class="greenbullet">Who is or was being fair, the 
					speaker or Mary?</span></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><em>To balance the argument, the man was quite objective</em><ul class="bluebullet">
					<li><span class="greenbullet">Who is or was doing the 
					balancing, the speaker or the man?</span></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><em>Speaking confidentially, the accountant has told me the 
				truth</em><ul class="bluebullet">
					<li><span class="greenbullet">Who is or was speaking 
					confidentially, the speaker or the accountant?</span></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.<br />
			All three examples have the disjunct separated off by commas at the 
			beginning of the sentence as is conventional so they should be 
			understood as disjuncts referring only to the speaker's style.&nbsp; 
			They will, however, especially in rapid speech, often be 
			misinterpreted as reference to the subject and verb phrase so rephrasing is 
			often the only 
			solution.<br />
			Prepositional phrases, despite the polysemous nature of prepositions 
			themselves, instead of non-finite verb forms often help so we could 
			get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fairness, Mary treated everyone equally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On balance, the man was quite objective<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between you and me, the accountant has told me the truth</em></p>

			<p>These adverbials (which are almost always adverbs) limit the range 
			of the verb in some way.&nbsp; The usual list includes:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She only bought a shirt<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They even lied about 
			the results<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They just left it where they found it<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I merely asked<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She nearly succeeded<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I simply want an answer</em></p>
			<p>They need careful handling in terms of word ordering to avoid 
			ambiguity.&nbsp; Some can act outside the adverb role and even when 
			they are adverbs, placement is important.<br />
			For example:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Only he came to the meeting</em> (nobody else came [determiner])<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He only came to the meeting</em> (and did not speak [adverb])<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He came only to the meeting</em> (and to nothing else [adverb])<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He came to the only meeting</em> (and there was only one meeting 
			[adjective])<br />
			all mean something slightly different as do:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She just washed the shirt<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She washed just the shirt</em><br />
			because the first implies that she did nothing else to the shirt and 
			the second that she washed nothing except the shirt.<br />
			In AmE the first sentence can also mean<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has recently washed the shirt.</em></p>
			<p>Other examples of what happens when we move the limiters are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They lied even about the results<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They left it just where they found it </em>(in which the 
			meaning of <em>just</em> changes from <em>only</em> to <em>exactly</em>)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want simply an answer</em><br />
			The rule of 
			thumb to avoid ambiguity is to place the limiter immediately before the item it 
			modifies.</p>

			<p>All speakers of all languages, everywhere, occasionally 
			misunderstand each other.&nbsp; Most will have some kind of idiom 
			akin to <em>getting the wrong end of the stick</em> although 
			whatever it is is unlikely to be about sticks.<br />
			There is a guide on this site, linked below, to pragmatics which 
			covers this area in a little more detail.&nbsp; Here, we will deal 
			with two related concepts.</p>

			</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>This is to do with what it is the speaker's intention to 
			communicate, independent of the form of the language used to realise 
			the function.<br />
			For example, a question such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like to try that again?</em><br />
			may, in fact, be an imperative meaning:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; That was not good enough.&nbsp; Try again</em><br />
			but, if the hearer and speaker are at odds with what it means the 
			preferred response of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, sorry.&nbsp; I'll have another go</em><br />
			might be replaced by the dispreferred<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, not really.</em><br />
			It may also be a threat along the lines of:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you try that again, I will retaliate</em><br />
			but the hearer may not comprehend the intention behind the question 
			and ambiguity and misunderstanding will occur.&nbsp; There is more 
			on this in the guide to pragmatics, of course.</p>

			</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>We owe this concept to Grice (who gets much more discussion in 
			the guide to pragmatics) who was concerned to elucidate how people 
			figure out what the illocutionary force is that lies behind the 
			language they hear or read.<br />
			He settled on four maxims, the breaking of any of which will signal 
			some unexpected intention.&nbsp; The four are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Quality: Don't say what you believe to be false.<br />
				Breaking this maxim can result in some ambiguity because saying, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't see the argument<br />
				</em>may be ambiguous if the speaker intends to say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I disagree<br />
				</em>(i.e., does understand the argument but doesn't like it)<br />
				but the hearer understands<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please explain again<br />
				</em>and goes on to do so, reiterating the argument to the 
				exasperation of the hearer.</li>
				<li>Quantity: Be informative enough and don't over-inform.<br />
				Breaking this maxim can also result in ambiguity because if a 
				speaker says, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's someone at the door<br />
				</em>the hearer (who has heard nothing) may take that to be 
				simple information on which there is no need to act but the 
				speaker may intend<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you heard the doorbell and I'd 
				like you to answer it<br />
				</em>and is <strong>deliberately</strong> over-informing to make 
				the point.</li>
				<li>Relation: Be relevant.<br />
				If, in a conversation about getting the car repaired one speaker 
				suddenly intrudes with, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, do you have Anne's phone 
				number?<br />
				</em>the hearer may suffer from a good deal of ambiguity until 
				the speaker makes it clear that Anne is a car mechanic.</li>
				<li>Manner: Avoid obscurity.&nbsp; Avoid ambiguity.&nbsp; Be 
				brief.&nbsp; Be orderly.<br />
				Any of the many ways in which the language can exhibit ambiguity 
				discussed in this guide, whether lexical, syntactical or 
				semantic, can lead to breaking this maxim.<br />
				If, for example, a speaker says:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expected Mary would meet me before I 
				got to the airport<br />
				</em>the hearer may perceive ambiguity in terms of whether the 
				meeting or the expecting happened before the speaker arrived at 
				the airport and wonder if the speaker is being intentionally or 
				accidentally ambiguous.&nbsp; It may take a little while to sort 
				this out.</li>
