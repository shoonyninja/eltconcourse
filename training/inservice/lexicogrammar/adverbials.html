		<p>As the graphic is intended to show, adverbials give us extra 
		information about the verb.&nbsp; Specifically, they answer the four 
		questions above.<br />
		Adverbs, as you will know if you have followed
		the guide to adverbs, linked at the end in the list of related guides, also tell 
		us about the verb (and are, therefore, a special type of adverbial).&nbsp; 
		Specifically, adverbs tell us about</p>
		<ul class="bluebullet">
			<li class="bluebullet">How<br />
			<em>She walked <span class="styleblackbold">ridiculously slowly</span></em></li>
			<li class="bluebullet">Where<br />
			<em>She 
		walked <span class="styleblackbold">out</span></em></li>
			<li class="bluebullet">When or How often<br /><em>She
		<span class="styleblackbold">frequently</span> walked<br />
			She walked <span class="styleblackbold">yesterday</span></em></li>
			<li class="bluebullet">How much<br /><em>She 
		walked <span class="styleblackbold">extensively</span></em></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Some of what follows will cover some adverbs but in the context of 
		different types of adverbial rather than as a distinct and discrete word 
		class.</p>
		<p>The point to remember is: <strong>adverbs are all adverbials but adverbials 
		are not all adverbs</strong>.<br />Very briefly:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>He went <span class="styleblackbold">yesterday<br /></span>
			</em>contains an adverb, <em>yesterday</em>, acting as an adverbial 
			telling us when he left.&nbsp; By some definitions, even this is 
			really a noun acting as an adverb.</li>
			<li><em>He went <span class="styleblackbold">by car<br /></span></em>contains a prepositional phrase, 
			<em>by car</em>, acting as an 
			adverbial telling us how he travelled.</li>
			<li><em>She spoke <span class="styleblackbold">hurriedly<br /></span>
			</em>contains an adverb, <em>hurriedly</em>, acting as an adverbial 
			telling us something about her manner of speaking.</li>
			<li><em>She spoke <span class="styleblackbold">because I prompted her<br />
			</span></em>contains a subordinate clause, <em>because I prompted her</em>, 
			acting as an adverbial telling us why she spoke.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In only two of the sentences above (1 and 3), is the adverbial actually an 
		adverb (and one of those is slightly questionable).</p>
		<p>To be sure if you understand the distinction,
		<a href="adverbialsalphahp.htm">try this mini-test</a>.<br />
		If you couldn't do the test easily, follow
		<a href="adverbs.html" target="_blank">the guide to adverbs</a> (new 
		tab) before 
		you return to this page.</p>
			<p>It is quite commonly assumed that adverbs are the most important 
			class of adverbials and should be taught that way.<br />
			However, the facts do not bear this out.<br />
			Adverbs and adverb phrases, such as <em>slowly</em> or <em>
			exceptionally quickly</em>, only constitute around one fifth of adverbials.<br />
			By far the most frequent realisation of adverbials in English, over 
			half, is <em>via</em> 
			a prepositional phrase such as <em>to the door, over the hill, 
			before the meeting</em> and so on.<br />
			The rest are divided up between non-finite <em>to</em>-infinitive 
			clauses, noun phrases, non-finite -<em>ing</em> and -<em>ed / -en</em> clauses and finite 
			clauses, none of which is very common.&nbsp; We make no apology, 
			therefore, for our focus below on adverb and prepositional phrases.</p>
			<p>Here are some simple examples of the forms that adverbials take:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Adverb phrases:<ol class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em>They lost <strong>heavily</strong></em></li>
					<li><em>Her mother fell <strong>very seriously</strong></em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Prepositional phrases:<ol class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em>He worked <strong>in the garden</strong></em></li>
					<li><em>Her brother visited <strong>after work</strong></em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Noun phrases:<ol class="smallredbullet">
					<li class="auto-style101"><em>She arrived <strong>yesterday</strong></em></li>
					<li class="auto-style101"><em>He stayed <strong>two weeks</strong></em></li>
				</ol>When a verb is transitive, the noun phrase is normally the 
				object of the verb rather than acting as an adverbial.&nbsp; For 
				example, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read the story yesterday</em><br />
				<em>the story</em> is not functioning as an adverbial but the 
				noun <em>yesterday</em> is adverbial.<br />
				</li>
				<li>Finite clauses:<ol class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em>They </em>s<em>tayed<strong> where they had always 
					stayed</strong></em></li>
					<li><em>She arrived <strong>when the fun was over</strong></em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Non-finite clauses:<ol class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em><strong>Entering</strong> he found them together</em></li>
					<li><em><strong>Broken</strong> the machine was useless</em></li>
					<li><em>I am dying <strong>to see her</strong></em></li>
				</ol>Expressions with the <em>to-</em>infinitive can sometimes 
				be analysed in two ways:<br />
				In the example here, the phrase <em>to see her</em> is an 
				adverbial because the word<em> to </em>cannot be replaced with
				<em>in order to</em> but in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stopped to look in the window</em><br />
				the phrase <em>to look in the window </em>can be replaced with
				<em>in order to look in the window</em> and this is an example 
				of a complex subordinator, sometimes called the infinitive of 
				purpose and not a simple non-finite clause structure.&nbsp; This is not 
				usually a difference with which you want to trouble learners.<br />
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here's a summary of the way that adverbials can be realised in the 
			grammar of English.&nbsp; The focus here is on form but functions 
			are exemplified.</p>

			<p>The diagram above focuses on the form of adverbials, here we focus on 
		their function.</p>
		<p>You will have noticed if you did the mini-test, that adverbials come 
		in all sorts.&nbsp; <strong>Any</strong> language which gives us 
		information about the verb (<em>where, when, why, how</em>) can be classed as an 
		adverbial and taught that way.<br />
		Just like adverbs proper, adverbials perform four major functions.&nbsp; 
		Here are some examples of them:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To express how:<ol class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em>They arrived <span class="styleblackbold">by car</span></em></li>
					<li><em>She broke the glass <span class="styleblackbold">using her fist</span></em></li>
					<li><em>They spent the money <span class="styleblackbold">really quickly</span></em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>To express when:<ol class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em>They sold the house <span class="styleblackbold">before they moved to Canada</span></em></li>
					<li><em>Mary arrived <span class="styleblackbold">after midnight</span></em></li>
					<li><em>She left it <span class="styleblackbold">too late</span></em></li>
					<li><em>Her son was born <span class="styleblackbold">that day</span></em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>To express why:<ol class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em><span class="styleblackbold">As I was in London</span>, I went to see her</em></li>
					<li><em>I came <span class="styleblackbold">to see you</span></em><br />
					(This, too, is a prepositional phrase rather than an 
					non-finite form <em>per se</em>.)</li>
					<li><em>She left <span class="styleblackbold">as a result of his call</span></em></li>
					<li><em>I stopped <span class="styleblackbold">to listen</span></em><br />
					(The preference is to consider this as a subordinator (replaceable with <em>in order to listen</em>)<em>
					</em>but this is frequently referred to as an infinitive of 
					purpose.)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>To express where:<ol class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em>They walked <span class="styleblackbold">down the road</span></em></li>
					<li><em>They stayed <span class="styleblackbold">indoors</span></em></li>
					<li><em>She walked <span class="styleblackbold">three miles</span></em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		<p>
		<img alt="function" height="575" src="../../imagesgraphics/adverbials_function.png" width="620" /></p>
		<p>Now <a href="adverbials1hp.htm">try this test</a> to see if you can 
		identify what's what with adverbials.</p>
			<p>The list in the diagram above focuses only on four functions of 
			adverbials &ndash; to express: manner, time, reason and place.&nbsp; 
			Adverbials fulfil a range of other functions, too, as we shall 
			shortly see.</p>
		<p>Elsewhere on this site is an alternative, functional way of looking 
		at adverbials, and for that you need to go to
		the guide to circumstances, linked below.<br />
		Also on this site, there is
		a guide to 
		prepositional phrases which is centrally relevant to this area.</p>
		<p>There are some punctuation issues.&nbsp; Adverbials, especially in 
		the initial position are often separated in some way from the rest of the clause.&nbsp; 
		So, while:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I explained it to him in Italian<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrives on Thursday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ate good food while I was there</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		are all correctly punctuated, when the adverbial takes the initial 
		position we need:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>In Italian, I explained it to him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Thursday, she arrives <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was there, I ate good food<br />
		</em>There's a bit more on adverbial positions in sentences and the 
		punctuation below.<br />
		Writers and publishing houses differ in this regard and no punctuation 
		after the adverbial is often encountered.</p>

		<p>Adverbials come in three main flavours.&nbsp; Consider the following 
		sentences, focusing on <span class="styleblackbold"><em><strong>the bit in black</strong></em></span>:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>I saw him </em> <span class="styleblackbold"><em><strong>yesterday afternoon</strong></em></span><em>.</em></li>
			<li><span class="styleblackbold"><em><strong>Obviously</strong></em></span><em>, he didn't seem 
			happy.</em></li>
			<li><em>He isn't happy </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em><strong>yet</strong></em></span><em> he gets on with 
			life.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>In sentence 1, we have an adjunct</strong></dt>
			<dd>Adjuncts are integrated into the sentence but their removal 
			leaves a well-formed and understandable sentence although we lose 
			some information.<br />
			The definition of what qualifies as an adjunct is a fraught area, 
			much discussed.<br />
			Technically, some analysts see an adjunct as anything in a clause 
			which can be removed to leave a well-formed sentence.&nbsp; So, for 
			example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week she went on holiday</em><br />
			we have two adjuncts: <em>last week</em> and <em>on holiday</em>, which can be removed 
			to leave:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went</em><br />
			Others will include adjectives and other items as adjuncts because 
			they, too, can often be removed without the result being a malformed 
			sentence.<br />
			Here, because we are concerned with adverbials which, by definition 
			modify verb phrases, we will mostly confine the term adjunct to any adverbial which 
			modifies the verb phrase in some way and which is an integral, 
			though not obligatory, part of the clause.&nbsp; We will also 
			consider as adjuncts adverbials which modify adjectives and other 
			adverbs but that is a lesser focus in what follows.<br />
			A simple test for adjuncts is to try fronting them:<br />
			We can front an adjunct in a positive declarative sentence so we 
			allow, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly, she drove away</em><br />
			but we cannot front an adjunct in a negative declarative clause so 
			we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Slowly, she didn't drive.<br />
			</em>We shall see below that there is a form of adverbial which 
			often appears to be an adjunct but is structurally and semantically 
			somewhat different.&nbsp; It is called a subjunct and subjuncts are 
			subordinate in some way, and cannot be the topic of an either-or or 
			alternative question.</dd>
			<dt><strong>In sentence 2, we have a disjunct</strong></dt>
			<dd>Disjuncts are used to evaluate the form or the content of what 
			is said.&nbsp; They occur outside the clause structure itself.&nbsp; 
			Removing them leaves a well-formed sentence or clause but we lose 
			the speaker's viewpoint.&nbsp; In this case, compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't seem <span class="styleblackbold">obviously</span> happy<br />
			</em>where we have an adjunct giving us some extra information about 
			the adjective.&nbsp; That is to say, it is the adverb acting to 
			modify the adjective in the usual way.<br />
			However, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="styleblackbold">obviously</span> didn't seem happy<br />
			</em>we have a disjunct expressing the speaker's <strong>attitude</strong> to 
			the proposition that he didn't seem happy.&nbsp; The speaker is 
			implying that he or she believes the proposition to be true.<br />
			Disjuncts frequently come in the initial position before the clause 
			to which they refer but, as we see above, they don't have to.<br />
			For effect, in speaking, we insert a pause after a disjunct and that 
			can be represented by punctuation in writing.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patently, John was not interested.<br />
			</em>As the examples in this bit show, we can front disjuncts in 
			negative declarative sentences.</dd>
			<dt><strong>In sentence 3, we have a conjunct</strong></dt>
			<dd>Conjuncts are also outside the clause structure and connect ideas in sentences or between sentences.&nbsp; 
			We can rephrase Sentence 3 as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He isn't happy.&nbsp; </em>
			<span class="styleblackbold"><em>However</em></span><em>, he gets on 
			with life<br />
			</em>The word <span class="styleblackbold"><em>However</em></span> 
			is a conjunct.&nbsp; Some conjuncts are conjunctions (like
			<span class="styleblackbold"><em>yet</em></span> in example sentence 3) 
			and there is a separate guide to conjunction 
			on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
			Like disjuncts, too, but unlike adjuncts, conjuncts may be fronted 
			in negative declarative sentences and clauses so we can allow, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My train was late.&nbsp; Consequently, I 
			didn't get to the meeting.</em></dd>

			<p>This all seems rather technical &ndash; does it really matter?<br />

			<p>We should pause for a moment to consider another slightly 
			technical distinction: the difference between an obligatory adverbial and an adverbial adjunct.&nbsp; Both are adverbials but they differ 
			in how they are used.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>By definition (<em>adjunct</em>
				<span class="style_underline">means</span> <em>a non-essential 
				extra</em>), adjuncts provide optional data and removing them 
				does not affect the central meaning of the clause.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran <span class="styleblackbold">to the door</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran <span class="styleblackbold">off</span><br />
				</em>contain the prepositional phrase adjunct, <em>to the door </em>
				or the adverb adjunct <em>off, </em>but the clause can stand alone and still maintain its meaning as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran</em></li>
				<li>However, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put my laptop on my desk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put my laptop away<br />
				</em>we have a non-adjunct adverbial prepositional phrase, <em>on my desk</em> 
				and the non-adjunct adverb <em>away</em>, and we cannot omit 
				either and leave a comprehensible clause:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I put my laptop</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>What we are dealing with here is a semantic rather than 
			grammatical distinction because some verbs in some of their senses require adverbial 
			complementation.&nbsp; These verbs are often called <strong>PP 
			complement transitive verbs </strong>because they are usually transitive and 
			require a prepositional phrase or other adverbial complement.&nbsp; The verbs are usually those referring to 
			causing something to be somewhere and they include:<br />
			<em>
			<span class="styleblackbold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep, lay, place, plonk, position, 
			put, rest, set, site, situate, stick, stuff, treat</span></em>.<br />
			In none of these cases can we have a well-formed sentence which lacks 
			a place adverbial although the polysemous nature of some of them 
			make it possible in certain senses.&nbsp; For example, we cannot 
			have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *John laid the book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I placed the vase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I stuck the suitcase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She positioned the car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She plonked herself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The woman rested her head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They set the chair</em><br />
			and so on although, of course, the following with other senses of 
			the verb are possible:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chicken laid an egg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I placed my bet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rested my case<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary set the clock</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ventured a question</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			The verb <em>treat,</em> in the sense of <em>behave towards</em> rather than 
			the medical sense, is unusual because it requires an adverbial 
			referring to manner rather than place so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He treated her</em><br />
			is not acceptable except in a medical sense or if the verb means <em>
			indulge </em>but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He treated her very well</em><br />
			is fine.</p>
			<p>There are some verbs, normally intransitive, including <em>stay, 
			live, lie</em> and <em>venture</em> which can be included in the 
			list of PP complement verbs when they mean <em>live 
			temporarily, reside, place oneself horizontally </em>and <em>move 
			oneself into danger</em>, respectively, so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed in a hotel<br />
			</em>is possible but, in the same sense of the verb,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I stayed<br />
			</em>is not and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived in a small cottage<br />
			</em>is acceptable, but, in the same sense of <em>resided</em>,<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *I lived</em><br />
			is not because it means <em>survived </em>or<em> existed</em>.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lay on the bed<br />
			</em>is acceptable but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lay<br />
			</em>is not.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ventured into the castle<br />
			</em>is acceptable, but in the same sense of the verb<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We ventured<br />
			</em>is not.<br />
			When <em>stay</em> simply means <em>remain</em>, it requires no 
			complementing adverbial so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John left but I stayed<br />
			</em>is acceptable and when <em>venture </em>means <em>dare</em> the 
			same applies but the verb is transitive in this sense, so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ventured a question</em><br />
			is acceptable without an adverbial but must retain a direct object.</p>
			<p>Many intransitive verbs can, of course, be used without an 
			adjunct of any kind so we allow, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog disappeared<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It rained<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary stood</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			However, it is quite rare for intransitive verbs to be used without 
			an adjunct so we would probably feel more comfortable with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog disappeared into the woods<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people came on time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It rained really hard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary stood in the corner</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			This is purely a semantic and stylistic issue, not one to do with 
			the syntactical structures of the clauses in which adjuncts appear.</p>
			<p>There's some confusion out here on the web because one 
			well-respected site states:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as I can figure out, 
			adverbials are only indispensable after the verbs (sic) put.</em></span><br />
			(Lott, D)<br />
			As we saw above, that is not a sustainable assertion because we have 
			identified at least a dozen other verbs which share a similar 
			characteristic.&nbsp; A bit more 'figuring out' is called for, perhaps.</p>

			<p>This horrible expression refers to the fact that words and 
			phrases can slide between classes because they can perform 
			different functions depending on the intended meaning.</p>
			<p>Some words and phrases exhibit this phenomenon and can act as 
			adjuncts in the normal way, modifying verbs, verb phrases, other 
			adverbs and adjectives.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train <span class="styleblackbold">eventually</span> 
			arrived at the station<br />
			</em>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary <span class="styleblackbold">clearly</span> believed him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was <span class="styleblackbold">happily</span> drunk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argued <span class="styleblackbold">rather</span> 
			aggressively<br />
			</em>all the <span class="styleblackbold">adverbs</span> are adverbial 
			adjuncts acting to modify a verb phrase, a verb, an adjective and an 
			adverb respectively.<br />
			However, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>Obviously</em></span><em>, 
			she was trying to be helpful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Happily</span>, 
			the train arrived on time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a good deal of argument.&nbsp; </em>
			<span class="styleblackbold"><em>Eventually</em></span><em>, a decision 
			was made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wasn't coming.&nbsp; </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>
			Rather</em></span><em>, she actually came but very late.<br />
			</em>we have the adverbs acting as disjuncts (the 
			first two examples) and conjuncts (the second two examples).</p>
			<p>Some words can perform all three functions and their meaning 
			differs slightly in each role.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to eat <span class="styleblackbold">
			naturally</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Naturally</span>, she was very 
			unhappy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a huge amount of work needed.&nbsp;
			<span class="styleblackbold">Naturally</span>, it will be expensive.</em><br />
			In the first case, the word <em>naturally</em> is acting as an 
			adjunct to modify the verb <em>eat</em>.&nbsp; It means:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to eat natural rather than synthetic or 
			processed food.</em><br />
			In the second case, the word <em>naturally</em> is acting as a 
			disjunct, expressing how the speaker feels about the content of what 
			is being said.&nbsp; It means:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not surprised that she was very 
			unhappy.</em><br />
			In the third case, the word <em>naturally</em> is acting as a 
			conjunct, connecting the two sentences.&nbsp; It means:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>There is a huge amount of work needed.&nbsp; It logically 
			follows that it will be expensive.</em></p>
			<p>What this means is that we have examples of categorical 
			indeterminacy: we do not know, just by looking at it, whether the 
			item in question is an adjunct, a conjunct or a disjunct.&nbsp; We 
			need to see what it is doing to assign it to a category.</p>

		<p>We need here to distinguish briefly between arguments and adjuncts.&nbsp; 
		Arguments are not usually omissible but adjuncts are.<br />
		Omissibility is the usual test for an adjunct so while we can remove the 
		phrase <em>in the garden</em> from<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary and her mother worked in the garden</em><br />
		and leave a well-formed sentence:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary and her mother worked</em><br />
		showing that the phrase is an adjunct, we cannot remove the phrase <em>
		Mary and her mother</em> from the sentence and leave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>Worked in the garden</em>.<br />
		Equally, we can remove <em>happily</em> from:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; John happily joined the game</em><br />
		showing that <em>happily</em> is an adjunct, we cannot remove <em>the game</em> 
		and leave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*John happily joined</em><br />
		because <em>the game</em> is an argument, not an adjunct.<br />
		Perceptive readers will note that some arguments are, in fact omissible 
		because some verbs are ambivalent so we can allow, e.g., both:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary ate the pie immediately</em><br />
		and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary ate immediately</em><br />
		so the test is not always absolute.<br />
		To get around this, some propose what is known as the relative clause 
		test so while we can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary ate the pie which was left over from the 
		party</em><br />
		showing that <em>the pie </em>is an argument, we cannot have<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Mary ate immediately which was then<br />
		</em>showing that <em>immediately</em> cannot be considered an argument.</p>
			<p>(Because this guide is focused on adverbials, we are only considering 
		adverbial adjuncts in what follows.&nbsp; Adjuncts can also modify, for 
		example, noun phrases as in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument after dinner was soon settled</em><br />
		in which the adjunct, <em>after dinner, </em>modifies the noun phrase
		<em>the argument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was very happy</em><br />
		in which the adjunct <em>very</em> modifies the adjective <em>happy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove too quickly</em><br />
		in which the adjunct <em>too</em> modifies the adverb <em>quickly</em>.<br />
		The technical terms for these sorts of adjuncts are, respectively, 
		adnomial, adajectival and adadverbial but those are not terms which 
		should detain you or your learners.)</p>
			<p>Adjuncts are by far the most common and flexible adverbials because they perform 
		a wide range of functions in English.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>viewpoint (</strong>sometimes called <strong>angle)<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="head" height="133" src="../../images/cogs_head_woman200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>in expressions such as<em><span class="styleblackbold"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Politically</span>, 
			the man was inept<br />
			</em>or<em><span class="styleblackbold"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economically</span>, 
			the country is in trouble<br />
			</em>the speaker is fronting the adverbial 
			to draw attention to the view of the situation which is important.&nbsp; 
			Often, this means putting the adverbial first.&nbsp; Another, 
			non-adverb, example is<em><span class="styleblackbold"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as 
			studying is concerned</span>, I'm really lazy.<br />
			</em>Note that these are not examples of disjuncts (see below) 
			because the adverbial will not 
			necessarily apply to the whole following text or express the 
			speaker's view of how a statement is to be understood:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The man was <span class="styleblackbold">politically</span> inept<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The country is in trouble <span class="styleblackbold">economically</span></em><br />
			In both these case, the adjunct is modifying only part of the clause, the adjective in the first case and the prepositional phrase in the 
			second example.<br />
			In effect, we are saying that it is only in political matters that 
			the man was inept and only so far as the economy is concerned that 
			the country is in trouble.<br />
			Disjuncts, on the other hand, apply to the whole of a clause (which 
			is why they are sometimes referred to as sentence adverbs or 
			adverbials).<br />
			It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between a viewpoint adjunct 
			and a style disjunct because style disjuncts also refer to how the 
			speaker wants to be understood rather than commenting directly on 
			the statement itself.&nbsp; If you have this confusion, it helps to 
			think of viewpoint adjuncts as expressing the speaker's angle or 
			'take' on the statement.<br />
			<strong>Modification:</strong><br />
		 Viewpoint adjuncts allow very limited modification so, 
			for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purely <span class="styleblackbold">economically</span> ...</em><br />
			is possible but:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Very <span class="styleblackbold">economically</span> ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Rather <span class="styleblackbold">socially</span> ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Quite <span class="styleblackbold">chemically</span> ...<br />
			</em>are not available.<br />
			Viewpoint adjuncts may also be 
			realised by non-finite verb forms in, 
			for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Seen organisationally</span>, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Considered socially</span>, ...</em><br />
			but this is quite rare.</dd>
			<dt><strong>process<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="cogs" height="133" src="../../images/cogs_blue200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>these adjuncts refer to how something is done and there are 
			three main sorts:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>Manner:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke <span class="styleblackbold">impressively<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They walked <span class="styleblackbold">hand in hand<br />
			</span></em>etc.</li>
				<li>Means:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They got here <span class="styleblackbold">by bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He 
			got in <span class="styleblackbold">without paying</span></em></li>
				<li>Instrument:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cut it <span class="styleblackbold">with a saw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The parcel was delivered <span class="styleblackbold">by hand</span></em></li>
			</ol>
			Usually, these adjuncts come at the end of clauses.<br />
			In some languages, these kinds of processes may demand alternative 
			case structures.<br />
			In some analyses, instrumental adjuncts are analysed separately.<br />
			<strong>Modification:</strong><br />
		    Process adjuncts of manner when they are adverbs allow extensive 
			modification:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke very / extremely / exceptionally
			</em>etc.<em> <span class="styleblackbold">impressively</span></em><br />
			Prepositional phrases (including those used for manner, means and 
			instruments) cannot be easily modified so we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They walked very <span class="styleblackbold">arm in arm</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She arrived much <span class="styleblackbold">by taxi</span></em><br />
			although a few expressions such as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He travels <span class="styleblackbold">only / a lot by train</span></em><br />
			are possible.&nbsp; In such cases, there is a strong argument that 
			we are modifying the verb, not the adjunct.</dd>
			<dt><strong>subject focused<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="subject" height="133" src="../../images/children_subject_object200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>these adjuncts refer to the subject of the verb and are nearly 
			always adverbs or prepositional phrases of manner.<br />
			Examples are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is being <span class="styleblackbold">wilfully</span> dim<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I did it <span class="styleblackbold">on purpose</span></em><br />
			In both cases, the adjunct refers directly to the subject of the 
			verb, not to the verb itself.&nbsp; For this reason, they can often be replaced by an expression using a copular verb and 
			an adjective such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He appeared <span class="styleblackbold">wilful</span><br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was <span class="styleblackbold">intentional</span><br />
			</em>Commonly, these will appear directly before or after the main 
			verb phrase and any complement or object but can be fronted for emphasis.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="styleblackbold">intentionally</span> 
			insulted her<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He left her alone <span class="styleblackbold">deliberately</span><br />
			<span class="styleblackbold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stupidly</span>, I forgot my keys<br />
			</em><strong>Modification:</strong><br />Depending on the meaning of the adjuncts, modification is 
			possible so we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very <span class="styleblackbold">stupidly</span>, 
			I forgot to ask<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was wholly <span class="styleblackbold">intentionally</span></em> 
			<em>said</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He left her alone quite / very <span class="styleblackbold">deliberately</span></em><br />
			etc. but, as usual, prepositional phrases allow fewer modifications:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They did it clearly <span class="styleblackbold">on purpose</span></em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They did it wholly / completely
			<span class="styleblackbold">on purpose</span></em><br />
			are allowable but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They did it very <span class="styleblackbold">
			on purpose</span></em><br />
			is not because <em>very</em> can only modify adverbs when it functions itself 
			as an adverb.</dd>
			<dt><strong>spatial / place<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="place" height="133" src="../../images/people200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>as you might imagine, these refer to where things happen.&nbsp; 
			There are two sorts and they are often prepositional (although 
			clauses can be used as well as adverbs):<ol>
				<li>Place:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stayed <span class="styleblackbold">in a bed and 
			breakfast place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She slept <span class="styleblackbold">where 
			she had always slept<br />
			</span><span class="style_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They stayed
			</span> <span class="styleblackbold">there</span></em></li>
				<li>Direction:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They climbed <span class="styleblackbold">
			over the hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They went <span class="styleblackbold">where no 
			one had gone before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</span><span class="style_blue">They marched </span> <span class="styleblackbold">
			onwards</span></em></li>
			</ol>
			Again, these usually come at the end of a clause.<br />
			You may see place adjuncts described as locative adjuncts (but not 
			on this site).<br />
			<strong>Modification:<br />
			</strong>Because most place adjuncts are prepositional phrases, 
			modification is rare and limited:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They went clear <span class="styleblackbold">
			over the hill</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went right <span class="styleblackbold">down the road<br />
			</span></em>Place adjuncts have their own 
			guide linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
			Not all place adverbials, in particular, qualify as adjuncts because 
			they are sometimes an obligatory rather than optional part of the 
			clause.&nbsp; This is explained above in the section on PP 
			complement verbs such as <em>put, place, stick </em>etc.&nbsp; For example in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My pyjamas lay on the bed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car stayed in the garage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I laid the book down<br />
			</em>we have prepositional phrases or an adverb acting as adverbials 
			and in no case can we omit the adverbial and leave a well-formed 
			clause.</dd>
			<dt><strong>temporal / time<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="clock" height="133" src="../../images/clock_late200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>again, no prizes for guessing that these refer to time but there 
			are some different sorts, realised by clauses, adverbs and 
			prepositional phrases:<ol>
				<li>When:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			decided to stay <span class="styleblackbold">after the wedding was 
			finished</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We spoke<span class="styleblackbold"> after the meeting</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left</em> <span class="styleblackbold"><em>yesterday</em></span></li>
				<li>Duration:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			They watched television<span class="styleblackbold"> while I did all 
			the cooking</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They chatted <span class="styleblackbold">throughout the 
			performance</span><br />

			<strong>Modification:</strong><br />
			Many time adjuncts which are adverbs can be modified and the range of 
			modifiers is quite large:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She very 
			<span class="styleblackbold">frequently</span> arrives late<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spoke extremely 
			<span class="styleblackbold">briefly</span></em><br />but other time adjuncts allow no or very limited modification:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spoke immediately / directly
			<span class="styleblackbold">after the meeting</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stayed exactly 
			<span class="styleblackbold">for a week</span></em><br />although modifying the noun is more natural:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stayed <span class="styleblackbold">for</span> 
			exactly <span class="styleblackbold">a week</span></em><br />Time adjuncts have their own 
			guide linked in the list of related guides at the end.</dd>
			<dt><strong>focus<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="focus" height="133" src="../../images/focus_camera200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>these are mostly adverbs but prepositional phrases are also 
			common in this function.<br />
			Limiting:<span class="styleblackbold"><br /><em>chiefly, most importantly, 
			in particular, only, purely </em></span>etc.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a lot we can do to help,
			<span class="styleblackbold">in particular</span> with the new website</em><br />
			which implies that our help will probably be limited to the website.<br />
			Additive:<span class="styleblackbold"><br /><em>also, in addition to, as 
			well as</em></span> etc.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a lot to be done and we
			<span class="styleblackbold">also</span> have very little time</em><br />
			Again, we need to distinguish focusing adjuncts from attitudinal 
			or content disjuncts (see below).<br />
			As adjuncts, these sorts of phrases and adverbs focus attention on 
			part of the clause only.&nbsp; As disjuncts, they modify the whole 
			clause so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="styleblackbold">chiefly</span> 
			came to say goodbye</em><br />
			the word <em>chiefly</em> focuses the hearer on the verb and is an 
			adjunct which could be replaced by <em>only</em> or <em>just</em>, 
			for example, or left out altogether, of course.<br />
			However, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Chiefly</span>, 
			this is a question of finding enough money</em><br />
			the word <em>chiefly</em> applies to the whole of the following 
			text.&nbsp; It is a disjunct and cannot be replaced with <em>only</em> 
			or <em>just</em>.<br />
			<strong>Modification:<br /></strong>These adverbials cannot be modified so you can't say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *very <span class="styleblackbold">in 
			particular</span><br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *extremely <span class="styleblackbold">only</span></em> etc.<br />
			They are also 
			known as <strong>particularisers</strong>, by the way.</dd>
			<dt><strong>intensifying<br />
			<img alt="intense" height="133" src="../../images/firework200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
			<dd>these come in different sorts but are nearly all adverbs with a 
			few prepositional phrases:<br />
			Emphasisers 
			(which add weight and usually modify noun phrases, adverbs or 
			adjectives):<span class="styleblackbold"><br /><em>definitely, certainly</em></span> 
			etc.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's <span class="styleblackbold">definitely</span> 
			the wrong way to talk to her</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is <span class="styleblackbold">decidedly</span> 
			dull<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is <span class="styleblackbold">certainly</span> beautifully 
			drawn</em><br />
			Amplifiers 
			(which scale upwards and can often modify verbs, adverbs and 
			adjectives):<span class="styleblackbold"><br /><em>completely, very much, 
			absolutely, entirely, deeply, heartily</em></span> etc.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="styleblackbold">heartily</span> 
			agree</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was <span class="styleblackbold">absolutely</span> 
			idiotically designed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story was <span class="styleblackbold">deeply</span> sad</em><br />
			Downtoners 
			(which reduce the effect and modify verbs, adjectives, noun phrases 
			and adverbs):<span class="styleblackbold"><br /><em>partly, hardly, quite, 
			nearly, somewhat</em> </span>etc.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is <span class="styleblackbold">somewhat</span> 
			rude to most people, I'm afraid</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is <span class="styleblackbold">quite</span> 
			a mess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="styleblackbold">nearly</span> got lost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was <span class="styleblackbold">barely</span> 
			competently done</em><br />
			Approximators (which express inexactitude and modify verbs, 
			adjectives, noun phrases and adverbs):<br />
			<span class="styleblackbold"><em>approximately, roughly, more or less, 
			in the region</em></span> of etc.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can <span class="styleblackbold">more or less</span> 
			see the point</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was <span class="styleblackbold">roughly</span> 
			level<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost is i<span class="styleblackbold">n the region of</span> 
			$1000<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was done <span class="styleblackbold">more or less</span> 
			perfectly</em><br />
			<strong>Modification:<br /></strong>Emphasisers can be modified with <em>very
			</em>and<em> most</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will most <span class="styleblackbold">certainly</span> be 
			here later<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is very <span class="styleblackbold">definitely</span> the 
			case<br />
			</em>Amplifiers and downtoners are not modified or only allow <em>
			very<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is very <span class="styleblackbold">deeply</span> hurt<br />
			</em>etc. and not always then because:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is very <span class="styleblackbold">
			entirely</span> right</em><br />
			is not possible.<br />
			There is a guide to these 
			adverb modifiers on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.</dd>
			<dt><strong>limiting<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="limit" height="133" src="../../images/barrier_iron_fence200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>these adverbials (which are almost always adverbs) limit the 
			range of the verb in some way.&nbsp; The usual list includes<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="styleblackbold">only</span> 
			bought a shirt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="styleblackbold">even</span> lied about it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="styleblackbold">just</span> left it where they 
			found it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="styleblackbold">merely</span> asked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="styleblackbold">nearly</span> succeeded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="styleblackbold">simply</span> want an answer</em><br />
			They need careful handling in terms of word ordering to avoid 
			ambiguity.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only he came to the meeting </em>(nobody else 
			came [determiner])<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He only came to the meeting </em>(and did not speak [adverb])<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came only to the meeting </em>(and to nothing else 
			[adverb])<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came to the only meeting</em> (and there was only one 
			meeting [adjective])<br />
			all mean something slightly different as do:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She just washed the shirt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She washed just the shirt</em><br />
			because the first implies that she did nothing else to the shirt and 
			the second that she washed nothing except the shirt.<br />
			All these limiters need to be handled in the same way.&nbsp; The 
			rule of thumb is to place the limiter immediately before the item 
			it modifies.<br />
			This means, of course, that the terms migrate between word classes 
			(see above).&nbsp; To operate as adjuncts, the words need 
			immediately to precede or follow the verb phrase.</dd>
			<dt><strong>sequencing<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="order" height="133" src="../../images/orderly200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>these often come at the beginning of a clause and include, e.g.:<span class="styleblackbold"><br /><em>originally, first, thirdly, in the first place, then, subsequently</em></span> etc.<br />
			There is a distinction again to be made between sequencers which act as 
			adjuncts and those, analysed below, which act as conjuncts.<br />
			In, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He made lunch and <span class="styleblackbold">then</span> 
			took it to the garden to eat</em><br />
			the adverb <em>then</em> is acting as a sequencer adjunct telling us 
			the ordering of events, not linking the clauses (the coordinator <em>
			and</em> does the linking).<br />
			However, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made lunch and <span class="styleblackbold">then</span> 
			took it to the garden to eat<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>Afterwards</em></span><em>, 
			he cleared up the kitchen and washed the crockery and cutler</em>y<br />
			the adverb <em>afterwards</em> is a conjunct linking the first 
			sentence (about making lunch) to the second by anaphoric reference.<br />
			Another example of an adjunct sequencer appears in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He comes from London
			<span class="styleblackbold">originally</span></em><br />
			<strong>Modification:<br /></strong>Sequencer adjuncts are not modified so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Very thirdly we took the dog for a walk<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *So originally he comes from France</em><br />
			are not acceptable.</dd>
			<dt><strong>causal / effectual<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="balls" height="133" src="../../images/ballbearing_toy200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>There are four adverbs in particular which do this:<em> 
			<span class="styleblackbold">hereby, herewith, thereby</span></em> and 
			<em class="styleblackbold">therewith</em>.<br />
			The first two refer to the <em>here</em> and <em>now</em> and occur in clauses such 
			as:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You are <span class="styleblackbold">hereby</span> informed that the transfer has been made 
			according to your wishes<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The undersigned <span class="styleblackbold">herewith</span> agrees to pay the sum required</em><br />
			The second two refer to the <em>there</em> and <em>then</em> and occur in clauses such 
			as:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The children attended the concert and 
			<span class="styleblackbold">thereby</span> learned some 
			appreciation of Mozart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He inherited his grandfather's estate and 
			<span class="styleblackbold">therewith</span> became 
			rich</em><br />
			All four are performative in the sense that the acts of informing, 
			agreeing, attending and inheriting contain the sense of the results 
			of the events.&nbsp; They are all very formal and, in the case of
			<em>therewith</em>, arguably archaic, forms.<br />
			There is more in the guide to cause and effect, linked below.<br />
			In some analyses, this type of adjunct function is referred to as 
			consecutive.</dd>
			<dt><strong>conditional<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="link" height="133" src="../../images/link_rope_binding200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>Usually, conditional structures are considered separately (as 
			they are on this site) but a clear and persuasive argument can be 
			made that the structure is a main clause modified by an adjunct 
			clause as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please come <span class="styleblackbold">if you 
			have time</span></em><br />
			in which the verb <em>come</em> is modified to show the conditions 
			under which the event will occur.<br />
			Technically, the main clause here is called the apodosis and the 
			conditional adjunct clause is the protasis, incidentally.<br />
			Some care needs to be taken to distinguish between <em>if</em> 
			acting as a conditional conjunction and acting as a temporal 
			conjunction (when it belongs in the section above).<br />
			For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will do it if she has time<br />
			</em>it is clear that her doing it is contingent on her having time 
			but in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be here if you need help<br />
			</em>there is no sense of contingency because my being here is not 
			conditional on your needing help.</dd>
			<dt><strong>goal oriented<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="goal" height="133" src="../../images/sport_football_goal200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>Adjuncts containing items such as <em>in order to, so that he 
			could, to</em> etc. often function to show the goal of an activity 
			as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came <span class="styleblackbold">to help</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke quietly <span class="styleblackbold">so as not to 
			disturb him</span></em><br />
			etc.<br />
			Care needs to be taken here to distinguish between <em>to</em> 
			acting as part of an infinitive form and the same word acting as a 
			shorthand for <em>in order to</em>.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to help</em><br />
			or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expected to arrive late</em><br />
			we have a case of verbal catenation because the verbs <em>want</em> 
			and <em>expect</em> are usually catenated with the <em>to-</em>infinitive.&nbsp; There is 
			no sense here that we can replace this with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I want in order to help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I wanted so that I could help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I expected so I could help</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I expected in order to arrive late<br />
			</em>and in the well-formed cases, we do not have a goal-oriented adjunct, 
			just a simple catenation.</dd>
			<dt><strong>modal<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="dice" height="133" src="../../images/dice_rolling200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>Modal adjuncts often refer (as do modal auxiliary verbs) to concepts 
			of the probability of a proposition being true, as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="styleblackbold">probably
			</span>arrived late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's <span class="styleblackbold">definitely </span>not coming<br />
			</em>This is elsewhere analysed on this site under the heading of 
			epistemic modality.<br />
			Other adjuncts may express deontic modality (to do with duty, 
			permissibility or obligation) as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You <span class="styleblackbold">wisely
			</span>didn't press the point<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="styleblackbold">needlessly </span>explained it all over again</em><br />
			Others may express dynamic modality (showing willingness or ability) 
			as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried <span class="styleblackbold">in vain</span> to persuade her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="styleblackbold">successfully </span>negotiated a discount</em><br />
			A few may express alethic modality (to do with inevitable conditions 
			independent of the setting) as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parallel lines <span class="styleblackbold">of necessity</span> do not meet</em></dd>
			<dd></dd>
		</dl>
			
			<p>Here is a summary of adjuncts but you should bear in mind two 
			things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Not all analyses use these categories so you may come across 
				alternatives which are just as valid.</li>
				<li>This is not a teaching syllabus although teaching the items 
				which are most frequent, most elaborated or most closely related 
				will pay dividends in keeping things clear.</li>

			</table>
			<p>Before we leave adjuncts alone, it is worth noting which sorts 
			of adjuncts can be safely used with certain verb uses.&nbsp; The 
			issue here is stative <em>vs.</em> dynamic verb use and one of what is 
			semantically allowable.</p>
			<p>If we take the example sentence here:<br />
			<span class="styleblackbold"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was then a 
			pianist in the park</em></span><br />
			it is simple to see that there are two adjunct adverbials:
			<span class="styleblackbold"><em>in the park</em></span> and
			<span class="styleblackbold"><em>then</em></span>.</p>
			<p>However, if we break the statement down, we can allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a 
			pianist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a pianist in the park<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was then a pianist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was in the park</em><br />
			all of which are perfectly acceptable grammatically.<br />
			However, we cannot have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was then</em></p>
			<p>We are dealing with temporal <em>vs</em>. spatial or locative adverbials and 
			they have different characteristics:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Temporal adjunct adverbials cannot be used alone <strong>if the verb 
			is stative</strong> so we would also not allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She was 
			yesterday<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They seemed then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He became last week</em><br />and so on.<br />
				But we do allow dynamic verb use as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was staying there yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were being difficult at that time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was becoming angrier as the argument went on</em></li>
				<li>Locative adjuncts can be used alone with a stative verb use and 
			their presence allows the use of temporal adjuncts 
				<span class="style_underline">in addition</span> so we 
			can have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was here<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was here yesterday<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They seemed at work<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They seemed at work then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He got home last week</em><br />and so on.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When we have a dynamic verb in use, we can allow the temporal 
			adjunct to appear alone so we also allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She found it last week<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrived in tandem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came immediately</em></p>
			<p>When we have a subject or object complement, we can allow 
			temporal adverbials with stative verb uses so we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She became angry last year<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was the manager for a while<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made her angry eventually</em><br />
			and so on.</p>
			<p>By the same token, all other forms of adjunct adverbials, viewpoint, subject, focus, intensifiers and limiters as well as and 
			process adverbial adjuncts (which are usually of manner, means or 
			instruments) cannot be used with stative verb uses.&nbsp; We do 
			not, therefore, encounter:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They are obviously<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is politically<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She became chiefly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They were definitely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was only<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is slowly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They were with a hammer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He became gradually<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She was by bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He knew carefully<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She appeared stupidly</em><br />
			and so on.</p>
			<p>The same considerations apply, however, so we can use these 
			adverbial adjuncts freely with dynamic verb uses and have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They acted politically<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked carefully<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They definitely broke it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She only paid for the drink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They specifically complained<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did it wilfully<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She broke it with the hammer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They travelled by water</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p>And when we have a subject or object complement of the verb these 
			adjuncts are allowed even if the verb is stative in use, so we can 
			allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He became gradually the person to consult<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is slowly growing old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is economically ignorant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is definitely very sad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were only in the audience<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew the answer immediately<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She appeared slowly more unhappy<br />
			</em>etc.</p>

			</table>
			<p>In some analyses, subjuncts are considered a subcategory of 
			adjuncts but they are, in fact, both structurally and semantically a 
			distinct category.</p>
			<p>A subjunct is distinguishable from an adjunct in that it performs a subordinate role in the clause.<br />
			In the foregoing, adjuncts and subjuncts are both exemplified but 
			there is a distinction in terms of how they behave syntactically and 
			semantically.</p>
			<p>For example, in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John willingly went to the concert</em><br />we have an adjunct, 
			<em>willingly</em>, which modifies how we 
			perceive the verb.&nbsp; We can ask a question such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did John go willingly or reluctantly?</em><br />and it makes perfect sense 
			because <em>willingly</em> and <em>reluctantly</em> are adjuncts 
			which can be contrasted.<br />We cannot, however, perform the same actions with subjuncts so, for 
			example, in:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He has already left</em><br />we have a subjunct, 
			<em>already</em>, which modifies not just the 
			verb but the entire clause.&nbsp; If we ask a question such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Has he already or not left?</em><br />the result is not acceptable because subjuncts cannot be the subject 
			of an either-or question.<br />
			If we remove the subjunct, the the question has validity so we can 
			sensible ask:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has he left or not?</em><br />
			Equally, for example, we cannot have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Has Mary generally or frequently seen her 
			mother?</em><br />
			because the adverbs are functioning as subjuncts which cannot be 
			contrasted this way.</p>
			<p>To confuse matters slightly, some adverbials can act as adjuncts, 
			disjuncts 
			or subjuncts depending on the context and co-text.<br />
			For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John spoke happily about his school days<br />
			</em>we have the adverb <em>happily</em> acting as an adjunct which 
			modifies the verb in the usual way.&nbsp; Therefore, the question:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did John speak happily or not?<br />
			</em>is a sensible one.</p>
			<p>However, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happily, John spoke about his school days<br />
			</em>the adverb is either:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>a subjunct, so the question:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Was it happily or sadly that John spoke about 
				his school days?</em><br />
				is not sensible, or</li>
				<li>a disjunct which shows the speaker's view of the event and 
				means:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was pleased that John spoke about his 
				school days<br />
				</em>See below and the separate guide for more about disjuncts.</li>
			</ol>
			Because subjuncts are defined as subordinate to adjuncts, some 
			analyses will also ascribe words such as <em>very, extremely, quite</em> 
			and so on to the class of subjuncts because they modify an adjunct 
			rather than modifying the verb phrase itself.&nbsp; So, for example, we 
			can analyse a clause such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The engine is difficult start in very cold weather<br />
			</em>in which we have an adverbial (<em>in very cold weather</em>) 
			containing the subjunct <em>very</em> and we can remove it and also 
			remove the whole phrase (as we can with adjuncts) while leaving a 
			well-formed sentence.<p>For teaching purposes, the distinction between subjuncts and 
			adjuncts is unlikely to be very helpful but subjuncts can perform a 
			useful range of semantic functions that are worth a teaching slot:</p>

		<p>These are often simple adverbs (such as <span class="styleblackbold">
		<em>honestly, candidly</em></span>) but can be prepositional phrases 
		(e.g.,<span class="styleblackbold"> <em>from my point of view</em></span>), 
		non-finite clauses (e.g., <span class="styleblackbold"><em>to be honest, speaking 
		frankly</em></span>) 
		or finite clauses (e.g.,<span class="styleblackbold"> <em>if you ask me, 
		should 
		you want an honest opinion</em></span>).<br />
		There are two main sorts:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>style</strong></dt>
			<dd>style disjuncts indicate what the speaker / writer wishes the 
			hearer / reader to understand in terms of the way in which something is said.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em><span class="styleblackbold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frankly</span>, I don't think he's up 
			to the job<br />
			</em>where the speaker is using the disjunct to make it clear that 
			this is an honest opinion.<br />
			The disjunct <span class="styleblackbold"><em>personally</em></span> 
			shows that the speaker is not being general and
			<span class="styleblackbold"><em>seriously</em></span> refers to a lack 
			of flippancy and so on.<br />
			Prepositional phrases are slightly less common but occur in, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">From where I'm 
			standing</span>, this seems a crazy idea.</em><br />
			Non-finite clauses are also rarer than simple adverbs but occur in, 
			for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Being honest</span>, 
			I'm not really sure.</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">To be honest</span>, 
			I don't know</em><br />
			Finite clauses are frequently conditional so we get, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Unless I am very 
			much mistaken</span>, that's incorrect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">If you ask me</span>, that's just 
			what we need<br />
			</em><strong>Style disjuncts refer to the speaker or writer, not to 
			the content.</strong></dd>
			<dt><strong>attitude</strong></dt>
			<dd>attitude disjuncts indicate how the speaker / writer feels about 
			the <strong>content</strong> of what is being communicated.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em><span class="styleblackbold">Arguably</span>, that is a false 
			conclusion<br />
			</em>the speaker is softening the proposition by making it clear 
			that this is not an undeniable fact.<br />
			The disjunct <span class="styleblackbold"><em>obviously</em></span> 
			makes it clear that the truth of the content is clear to see and
			<span class="styleblackbold"><em>of course</em></span> implies that it is a logical deduction and so on.<br />
			Attitude disjuncts also display a mix of forms and are not only 
			adverbs.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			Finite clauses:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">It seems arguable 
			to me that </span>this is the wrong approach</em><br />
			which indicates that the approach may be right.<br />
			Non-finite verbs forms:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">All things being 
			equal</span>, that's the best idea</em><br />
			which indicates that it is only the best idea if everything is 
			balanced.<br />
			Prepositional phrases:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">On the face of it</span>, 
			we need to spend more money<br />
			</em>which indicates that the need to spend money is superficially 
			the case but may not be on closer consideration.<br /><strong>Attitude disjuncts refer to the information in the 
			statement, not to the speaker or writer.<br />
			</strong>You may find attitude disjuncts described as <strong>content 
			disjuncts</strong> because, obviously, they refer to the content, not the 
			speaker.&nbsp; If that is an easier term to remember and apply, use 
			it because the terms are synonymous.</dd>
		</dl>
			<p>Occasionally, some doubt is expressed concerning whether the term<em> 
			disjunct</em> is actually useful at all and we may encounter, for 
			example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">... what about an adverbial like
			<span class="auto-style103">In my opinion</span>, what category does 
			that fit into? It seems to stretch a point to call it a disjunct as 
			it does not particularly express the speaker’s attitude to what they 
			are saying ...<br />
			<span class="auto-style102">(Lott, D)</span></p>
			<p>The line taken in this guide is actually that this is exactly 
			what the phrase does.&nbsp; It tells the listener that the speaker 
			is limiting the statement to a personal view only and is therefore a 
			style disjunct.&nbsp; It is, to be sure, not an attitude disjunct 
			(which would be confined to expressing the speaker's view of the 
			content of a proposition) but it is still a disjunct.</p>
			<p>The two types of disjunct set out here perform identifiable 
			semantic roles.</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Style disjuncts may:<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li>refer to the how truthful the speaker is being as in, 
					e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be candid ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... so they say</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>indicate limitations as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... in my opinion<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... only for the sake of argument ...</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>refer to the manner of what is being communicated as in, 
					e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between you and me ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidentially, ...</em><br />
					etc.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Attitude disjuncts may:<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li>refer to general likelihood of something being true as 
					in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguably, ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undeniably, ...</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>refer to obligation of advisability as in e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely, ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wisely, ...</em></li>
					<li>express a speaker's emotional reaction as in e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazingly, ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happily, ...</em><br />
					etc.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>(For more, see the dedicated guide to disjuncts, linked in the 
			list at the end.)</p>
			<p><strong>Modification of disjuncts</strong><br />
		Because most disjuncts can be expressed through the use of -<em>ly
		</em>adverbs, modification is often possible so we can have, for 
		example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite arguably, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perfectly frankly, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purely personally, ...</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		However, when they are expressed as prepositional phrases or 
		finite or non-finite 
		clauses, modification is not appropriate:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Quite in my opinion, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Perfectly to be frank, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Purely speaking personally, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Merely if you want my view, ...</em></p>

		<p>We need to differentiate between viewpoint and style or attitude 
		because the former is expressed using adjuncts and the latter two using 
		disjuncts.&nbsp; Briefly:</p>
		<ul class="bluebullet">
			<li><strong>viewpoint</strong> refers to the domain in which the 
			statement is being made (i.e., the topic the speaker wishes to 
			emphasise).&nbsp; For example,<br />
			<em><span class="styleblackbold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agriculturally</span>, this is an 
			important region<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an important region
			<span class="styleblackbold">agriculturally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to discussing agriculture</span>, 
			this is an important region</em><br />
			where the speaker / writer is setting the statement in context by 
			using an adjunct (<span class="styleblackbold"><em>agriculturally / 
			When it comes to discussing agriculture</em></span>)<br />
			<span class="style_red"><strong>These are adjuncts or subjuncts, not disjuncts.</strong></span><br />
			(In some analyses, viewpoint is called <strong>angle</strong>.)</li>
			<li><strong>style </strong>and <strong>attitude</strong> refer to 
			the way the speaker / writer wants to be understood and not to the 
			topic area.<strong><br />
			</strong>
			<strong>Attitude</strong> (or content) disjuncts refer to and emphasise 
			a view of the content of what is said or written.&nbsp; They show 
			the speaker / writer's opinion or stance concerning the statement<em>.&nbsp; </em>
			For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			This is, <span class="styleblackbold">patently</span>, the wrong way 
			to go about it<span class="styleblackbold"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguably</span>, this is 
			the wrong way to go about it<br />
			</em><strong>Style</strong> disjuncts concern how the 
			speaker / writer wants the statement to be understood.&nbsp; For example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="styleblackbold">honestly</span> don't believe he 
			likes me<span class="styleblackbold"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly</span>, I don't 
			believe he likes me<span class="styleblackbold"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be perfectly 
			honest</span>, I don't believe he likes me<br />
			</em><span class="style_red"><strong>Style and Attitude are 
			expressed using disjuncts.</strong></span></li>
		</ul>
		<p>For teaching purposes, incidentally, it is not usually necessary to 
		distinguish overtly between style and attitude or content disjuncts but it is wise 
		to focus on one type only at a time for conceptual ease.<br />
		You may see disjuncts referred to as <strong>sentential adverbials
		</strong>or<strong> sentence adverbials
		</strong>(because they modify the whole sentence).<br />
		There is a 
		separate guide to disjuncts on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end 
		which also considers how the categorisation into two main classes of 
		disjuncts may be further refined.</p>

		<h3><strong>Conjunct or conjunction?</strong></h3>
		<p>There is a technical and slightly arguable distinction between 
		conjuncts and conjunctions.&nbsp; The usual analysis is that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Conjunctions act <span class="style_underline"><strong>within</strong></span> sentences to coordinate two ideas or to 
		subordinate one to the other.<br />
			These are conjunctions
		<span class="styleblackbold">in <strong>black</strong></span>:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She called </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>
			<strong>and</strong></em></span><em> 
		I was delighted to see her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrived late </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em><strong>because</strong></em></span><em> 
		they stopped to eat</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had <span class="styleblackbold"><strong>
			scarcely</strong></span> sat down to eat <span class="styleblackbold">
			<strong>when</strong></span> the telephone rang<br />
			</em>In the first case, two clauses are being coordinated (one is not 
		dependent on the other but additional to it).&nbsp; In the second case, 
		the reason following the subordinating conjunction <em>because</em> is 
		dependent on the understanding of the main clause.<br />
			In the last case, we have a subordinating correlative conjunction of 
			time.</li>
		
			<li>Conjuncts exist <span class="style_underline"><strong>outside</strong></span> the clauses which they connect 
			but relate the second idea anaphorically (back) to the first.&nbsp; There 
			is usually some sense of either coordination or subordination but there is always a strong 
			sense of cohesion:<br />
			These are conjuncts <span class="styleblackbold">in <strong>black</strong></span>:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was out of the house at the time.&nbsp;
		<span class="styleblackbold"><strong>Otherwise</strong></span>, I'd have been delighted to 
		see her.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She did the work competently.&nbsp;  <span class="styleblackbold">
		<strong>By contrast</strong></span>, his work was sloppy and the result shabby.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Conjunctions and conjuncts can be used to express the same thoughts 
		so, for example, one can have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was late <span class="styleblackbold">because </span>her train broke down.</em><br />
		and express the same thought as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Her train broke down.&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Consequently</span>, she was late.<br />
		</em>Stylistically and structurally, however, the forms are different 
		and mistaking a conjunct for a conjunction or <em>vice versa</em> 
		usually leads to error.</p>
		<p>Conjuncts and conjunctions frequently co-occur so we get, for 
		example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She came to the party <span class="styleblackbold">and</span>,
		<span class="styleblackbold">moreover</span>, brought her brother</em><br />
		where the word <em>and</em> is acting as a conjunction and the word <em>
		moreover</em> is a conjunct.<br />
		or:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took the car without permission
		<span class="styleblackbold">but</span>, <span class="styleblackbold">
		consequently</span>, broke the law</em><br />
		where the word <em>but</em> is an adversative conjunction and the word <em>
		consequently</em> is a causal conjunct.</p>
		<p>There is a guide to conjunction on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>
		<h3><strong>Conjuncts can:</strong></h3>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>enumerate or sequence<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="sequence" height="133" src="../../images/birds_ducks200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd><span class="styleblackbold"><em>firstly, secondly, thirdly, a), 
			b), in the first place </em></span>etc.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em><span class="styleblackbold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primarily</span> because I haven't the 
			money.&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Secondarily</span> because it 
			doesn't interest me<br />
			</em>Other examples include:<br />
			<span class="styleblackbold"><em>finally, lastly, for a start, to begin 
			with, at the outset</em></span><br />
			See above for the distinction between sequencing adjuncts, which are 
			integrated into the clause, and sequencing conjuncts which exist 
			outside the clause.<br />
			Certain disjuncts simply list rather than sequence and may include
			<em class="styleblackbold">to begin with, additionally, and, also</em> etc.</dd>
			<dt><strong>explain or exemplify<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="explain" height="133" src="../../images/explain_board200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd><span class="styleblackbold"><em>i.e., e.g., for instance, for 
			example</em></span> etc.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cleverest two students, </em>
			<span class="styleblackbold"><em>namely</em></span><em> John and Adam, 
			have secured their places at Oxford<br />
			</em>This form of conjunct is frequently used to signal apposition, 
			i.e., co-reference as in, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new house, <span class="styleblackbold">that is</span> the 
			house on the corner, has been sold</em><br />
			where <em>The new house</em> and <em>the house on the corner</em> 
			refer to the same thing.<br />
			Other examples include:<br />
			<span class="styleblackbold"><em>in other words, viz., that is to say, 
			by which is meant</em></span><br />
			There is some overlap between this class and the conjuncts used

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll get to you as soon as I can.&nbsp; By seven,

			<dd><em><span class="styleblackbold">incidentally, by the way </span>
			</em>etc.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought this in town yesterday.&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">
			By the by(e)</span>, did you know they've made the High Street one 
			way?<br />
			</em>Other examples include:<br /><em><span class="styleblackbold">now, well, meanwhile, parenthetically, as 
			an aside</span></em><br />
			Subject shifting is not usually extreme in any language.&nbsp; The 
			topic is generally shifted to a parallel idea which is nevertheless 
			relevant to what has gone before and the expectation often is that 
			the speakers will return to the main topic after a digression.&nbsp; 
			We do not, therefore, usually encounter something like:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; ?I have just come back from holiday.&nbsp;
			<span class="styleblackbold">By the way</span>, did you know that 
			Mary is married now?</em><br />
			but we may have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have just spoken to Jane.&nbsp;
			<span class="styleblackbold">By the way</span>, did you know that 
			Mary is married now?</em><br />
			providing Jane and Mary are in some way connected.</dd>
			<dt><strong>infer<br />

			<dd><span class="styleblackbold"><em>reading between the lines, in other words, then, in that 
			case. else, otherwise</em></span><br />
			These conjuncts link a previous comment with a conclusion which may 
			be inferred from what has been said or written.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: I can't help with that.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>In other words</em></span><em>, 
			you can't be bothered.</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government needs to act.&nbsp; </em>
			<span class="styleblackbold"><em>Otherwise</em></span><em>, things will 
			go from bad to worse.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to leave.&nbsp; </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>
			Else</em></span><em>, we'll miss the last train.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: I am very busy right now.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: I take it, </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>then</em></span><em>, 
			that you can't help.</em><br />
			Both <em>else</em> and <em>otherwise</em> function as negative 
			conditionals and the examples above can be  rephrased as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we don't leave, we'll miss the train.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the government doesn't act, things will go from bad to 
			worse.</em><br />
			Other inferential conjuncts express the fact that the speaker / 
			writer has drawn a logical conclusion from has preceded.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You don't want any chocolate?&nbsp; Well,
			<span class="styleblackbold">in that case</span>, I can have it.</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>set in time<br />
			</strong>
			<img alt="clock" height="133" src="../../images/clock_alarm_clapper200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>Temporal conjuncts refer to the relative times of two 
			propositions.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went shopping.&nbsp; 
			<span class="styleblackbold">Meanwhile</span>, my wife 
			took the children to the zoo</em><br />
			Other examples include,<span class="styleblackbold"> <em>in the meantime, in the intervening time 
			/ years / days months in the interim</em></span> etc.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>You may, incidentally, see conjuncts called conjunctive adverbs, 
		cohesive conjunctions or transitional conjunctions.&nbsp; All these 
		terms capture something of the flavour of what they do but we have 
		stayed with the term conjuncts for simplicity's sake.</p>
		<p><strong>Modification of conjuncts</strong><br />
		Conjuncts, even when they are <em>-ly
			</em>adverbs, cannot usually be modified so we cannot allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Very firstly, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Extremely for instance, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *More besides, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Absolutely likewise, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Very alternatively, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *More meanwhile, ...<br />
			</em>although a few take modification with <em>only, purely, merely
			</em>and<em> just</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only for example, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just for instance, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merely incidentally, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purely by contrast.<br />
			</em>but such modification is rare and unpredictably successful.</p>

		<p>Much erroneous language or unnatural expression is caused by the 
		failure to distinguish between conjuncts and conjunctions.&nbsp; Here 
		are some examples:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She came to the party <span class="styleblackbold">moreover</span> with her 
		boyfriend</em><br />
		where the speaker has failed to realise that <em>moreover</em> is a 
		conjunct, not a conjunction.&nbsp; The sentence is better  rephrased either with a conjunction:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She came to the party <span class="styleblackbold">and</span> 
		brought her brother</em><br />
		or as two clauses connected with a conjunct:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came to the party; <span class="styleblackbold">
		moreover</span> bringing her boyfriend.</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They were happy with the work.&nbsp; 
		<span class="styleblackbold">Although</span> it 
		cost more than they expected.<br />
		</em>where the speaker has failed to realise that <em>although</em> is a 
		conjunction, not a conjunct.<br />
		Again, the sentence is better  rephrased with a conjunction:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were happy with the work
		<span class="styleblackbold">but / although</span> it cost more than they expected</em><br />
		or with a conjunct:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They were happy with the work.&nbsp;
		<span class="styleblackbold">However</span>, it cost more than they 
		expected.</em><br />
		</p>
		<p>The words <em>though</em> and <em>although</em> are often presented to 
		learners as synonyms.&nbsp; Conceptually, they are but syntactically 
		they are not.&nbsp; The word <em>though</em> can be a conjunct or a 
		conjunction but <em>although</em> is <span class="style_underline">only</span> 
		a conjunction.&nbsp; We can accept, therefore:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was done on time.&nbsp; It was more expensive 
		than I expected, <span class="styleblackbold">though</span>. </em>(conjunct)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was done on time <span class="styleblackbold">though</span> it was more expensive than I 
		expected </em>(conjunction)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was done on time <span class="styleblackbold">although</span> it was more expensive than 
		I expected</em> (conjunction)<br />
		but not:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The work was done on time.&nbsp; It was more expensive 
		than I expected, <span class="styleblackbold">although</span>.<br />
		</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The work was done on time.&nbsp;

			</table>
		<p>
		There are constraints concerning word ordering, phrasing and punctuation 
		with adverbials.<br />
		A quirk of place adjuncts is that, in some circumstances, they require 
		or conventionally allow the inversion of the subject and verb as in, for 
		example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Here</span>'s your money</em><br />
		not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*<span class="styleblackbold">Here</span> your money is</em><br />
		or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">In the hallway</span>, 
		stood an enormous grandfather clock<br />
		</em>although, in this case,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">In the hallway</span>, an enormous 
		grandfather clock stood<br />
		</em>is possible.<br />The usual insertion of the <em>do</em> operator in simple tenses is 
		not required in this case.&nbsp; So we do not find, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;*<span class="styleblackbold">In the garden </span>did we 
		eat lunch</em><br />
		but do find:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the garden we ate lunch</em><br />
		etc.</p>
		<p>
		In writing, most adjuncts can, and sometimes must, be separated by 
		commas from the rest of the clause.&nbsp; We can have, therefore:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is <span class="styleblackbold">frequently</span> 
		late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Frequently</span>, he is late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found my car keys <span class="styleblackbold">under the sofa</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Under the sofa</span>, I found my 
		car keys</em><br />
		In spoken language, the comma is represented by a slight pause and the 
		use of two tone units, like this:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="styleblackbold">||
		<em>Under the sofa </em>||</span><em> I found my 
		car keys </em>||<br />
		Disjuncts and conjuncts, because they are not integral to the clause, 
		are usually separated by commas from the clause and, in speech, by a 
		slight pause before, after or at both ends of the adverbial.</p>
		<p>
		Some of what follows is also covered in separate guides (links below) 
		but here is a summary of the most important issues.:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Adjuncts:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>Viewpoint adjuncts often occur in initial position to signal 
				the setting for what follows.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Technically</span>, 
				this is known as a grommet strangler</em><br />
				That is not always the case because they can, more rarely, come 
				at the end of clauses, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The nation's in trouble, <span class="styleblackbold">
				politically</span></em><br />
				They can also come in medial position but are separated by commas 
				in this case:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, <span class="styleblackbold">economically</span>, a 
				difficult issue</em></li>
				<li>Process adjuncts occur most frequently in end position (or 
				immediately following the verb) to 
				explain how something was done.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He broke it <span class="styleblackbold">with a stone</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They came <span class="styleblackbold">by bus</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sent the letter <span class="styleblackbold">by courier</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spoke <span class="styleblackbold">
				persuasively</span></em><br />
				Placing these adjuncts initially is sometimes doable but the 
				adverbial is then strongly marked for special emphasis.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">By bus</span> they came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">With a stone</span> he broke it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">By courier</span> she sent the letter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Persuasively</span>, she argued 
				here case</em><br />
				but these forms are rare and medial position for these adjuncts is 
				generally forbidden so we do not find:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He broke with a stone it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They by bus came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She sent by courier the letter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She persuasively spoke.</em></li>
				<li>Subject adjuncts refer to the subject of the verb and will 
				often occur directly after it.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="styleblackbold">deliberately</span> broke the vase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="styleblackbold">wilfully</span> mismanaged the project<br />
				</em>They can also come in end position:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She broke the vase 
				<span class="styleblackbold">deliberately</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They mismanaged the project <span class="styleblackbold">wilfully</span></em><br />
				Subject adjuncts are frequently adverbs of manner and can never 
				come between the verb and its object so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She broke 
				deliberately the vase</em><br />
				is not allowable.<br />
				When such adverbials are subjuncts, they can often be placed in 
				the initial position as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Deliberately,</span> 
				she broke the vase</em></li>
				<li>Place adjuncts generally come in end position with direction 
				before position.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They took the car
				<span class="styleblackbold">to the workshop near the station</span></em><br />
				It is also the case that the smaller location precedes the 
				larger<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They went <span class="styleblackbold">to a 
				house in London</span></em><br />
				Again, prepositional-phrase place adjuncts cannot separate the verb from its object 
				or complement so neither:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They took <span class="styleblackbold">to 
				the workshop</span> the car</em><br />
				nor<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They <span class="styleblackbold">to a 
				house</span> went <span class="styleblackbold">in London</span></em><br />
				is allowable.</li>
				<li>Time adjuncts are much more complicated and syntax is a real 
				issue for learners.&nbsp; For more, see the guide to them, 
				linked in the list at the end.<br />
				Briefly and incompletely:<ol class="auto-style57">
					<li>Those that refer to specific times and durations usually 
					come in end position;<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke very
					<span class="styleblackbold">briefly</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They came <span class="styleblackbold">yesterday around dinner 
					time</span></em></li>
					<li>Those that refer to definite frequency also come at the 
					end:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I buy my groceries
					<span class="styleblackbold">monthly</span></em></li>
					<li>Those that refer to indefinite frequency precede the 
					main verb but follow any auxiliary verbs:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has <span class="styleblackbold">
					often</span> spoken of you<br />
					</em>However, if a frequency time adjunct is not a 
					single-word adverb, it comes conventionally at the end of 
					the clause as in, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I speak to her <span class="styleblackbold">from time to time</span></em></li>
					<li>Time subjuncts that relate two times also follow that pattern<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have <span class="styleblackbold">
					already</span> finished the book</em><br />
					but can (and sometimes must) occur terminally:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have done it
					<span class="styleblackbold">already</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hasn't arrived <span class="styleblackbold">yet</span></em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Focus adjuncts by their nature often occur initially:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Chiefly</span>, 
				the issue is one of time</em><br />
				but can appear terminally adding end weight:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue is one of money,
				<span class="styleblackbold">mostly</span></em><br />
				and if they occur in medial position are separated by commas or 
				pauses:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem, <span class="styleblackbold">
				centrally</span>, is one of political will</em></li>
				<li>Intensifiers of all types usually occur directly before the item they 
				modify:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is <span class="styleblackbold">
				certainly</span> not very bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are <span class="styleblackbold">definitely</span> here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put it <span class="styleblackbold">right</span> at the top 
				of his list<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is <span class="styleblackbold">somewhat</span> peripheral 
				to the argument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's <span class="styleblackbold">roughly</span> the same 
				thing</em></li>
				<li>Sequencers, by their nature, usually take initial position:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Firstly</span>, 
				we need to understand how the thing works</em><br />
				and are unusual in any other position but can occur elsewhere as 
				in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to understand how the thing 
				works, <span class="styleblackbold">at the outset</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need, <span class="styleblackbold">before doing anything</span>, 
				to know how the thing works</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Disjuncts, most frequently, come in the initial position because 
			they refer to the whole of the following text.&nbsp; This is the 
			same whether they refer to style or attitude:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">From my point of 
			view</span>, this is a bit of a mess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">In theory</span>, this is doable<br />
			</em>Disjuncts of both kinds can be placed elsewhere.<br />
			In medial position:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is, <span class="styleblackbold">from where 
			I am standing</span>, a bit of a disaster</em><br />
			or in end position:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a bit of a disaster,
			<span class="styleblackbold">in my opinion</span>.</em><br />
			In all positions, the convention is to separate them with commas.</li>
			<li>Conjuncts, for similar reasons, usually occur at the beginning 
			of the clause to be connected and refer anaphorically to a preceding 
			idea.&nbsp; Many conjuncts are virtually confined to this position, 
			including <em><span class="styleblackbold">again, also, besides, furthermore, what's more, 
			similarly, likewise</span> </em>and others:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is giving some lectures this term.&nbsp;
			<span class="styleblackbold">Well</span>, a connected series, really.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was badly delayed.&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">
			As a result</span>, I got to work very late.</em><br />
			but they can occur in other positions and, in the case of 
			<span class="styleblackbold"> <em>too, 
			anyhow, anyway, to boot</em></span> and <span class="styleblackbold"> <em>though</em></span> often come at the end:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a bit grumpy.&nbsp; It seems so to me,
			<span class="styleblackbold">anyway</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John's coming to the party on Saturday.&nbsp; He's bringing 
			his brother, <span class="styleblackbold">too</span>.</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a slow way to do it.&nbsp; It's not very effective,
			<span class="styleblackbold">to boot</span></em><br />
			If, unusually, they are placed in medial position, they are separated 
			by commas:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is a respected authority.&nbsp; He is,
			<span class="styleblackbold">besides</span>, the author of six books on 
			the subject.<br />
			</em>The word <em>though</em> when acting as a conjunct, may occur 
			terminally as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knows what he's talking about.&nbsp; He's a bit too sure 
			of himself, <span class="styleblackbold"><strong>though</strong></span>.</em></li>

		<p>Adverbials of most sorts can be placed in the initial position of a 
		clause. &nbsp;However, doing so often raises them to the status of a theme 
		which is, in Halliday's words,</p>
		<p class="indentpara">what the message is concerned with: the point of 
		departure for what the speaker is going to say<br />
		<span class="auto-style99">Halliday (1994: 38)</span></p>
		<p>In functional linguistic analysis, marking an adverbial in this way 
		makes it the theme of the utterance and all that follows it until 
		another theme appears, is the rheme.</p>
		<p>So, for example, stating:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Mary believes, <span class="styleblackbold">apparently</span>, 
		there is little point in continuing</em><br />
		is not at all the same at all as saying:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="styleblackbold">Apparently</span>, Mary 
		believes there is little point in continuing</em><br />
		because in the first sentence, the theme (the point of departure) is <em>
		Mary</em> and the rest of the sentence concerns <em>Mary</em> as the topical theme 
		whereas in the second example, the theme, <span class="styleblackbold"><em>
		apparently</em></span>, is interpersonal and the point 
		of departure is what the speaker believes to be the case.&nbsp; The 
		topical theme of <em>Mary</em> remains in place.</p>
		<p>Another example is a comparison between:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="styleblackbold">In addition</span>, the work 
		will be expensive</em><br />
		and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The work will, <span class="styleblackbold">in addition</span>, 
		be expensive</em><br />
		In the first of these we have a textual theme (the conjunct phrase, <em>
		In addition</em>) and in the second, a topical theme (<em>the work</em>).<br />
		Communicatively, theme and rheme structures are important in terms of 
		marking what message is being transmitted.<br />
		There is a guide linked in the list of related guides at the end to theme and 
		rheme structures on this 
		site.</p>

		<p>Probably the simplest way is to take each category above in turn and 
		plan a lesson around it.&nbsp; To do that, we need to set the adverbials 
		in a likely context.&nbsp; You should also be aware that some of the 
		structures here are quite simple and some a little more unusual and 
		difficult to grasp.<br />
		The important thing for teachers is to know the various functions of 
		adverbials and not try to present the area as a muddle of time, manner, 
		place and reason adverbials.&nbsp; Mixing the presentation to include 
		adjuncts, disjuncts and conjuncts in the same text is especially 
		confusing.&nbsp; In other words, to use a rephrasing conjunct, don't 
		make things harder than they already are.<br />
		One way is to start simply and work up to more complexity.&nbsp; Here 
		are two examples:</p>
		<table class="auto-style7">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style9">
				<img alt="story 1" height="313" src="../../imagesgraphics/adverbial_story1.png" width="310" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style8">
				<img alt="story 2" height="312" src="../../imagesgraphics/adverbial_story2.png" width="310" /></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>This kind of thing can be done with a focus on prepositional phrases, 
		clauses or whatever you like.&nbsp; Almost any simple sentence can be 
		elaborated in this way.&nbsp; The exercise can be quite tightly 
		controlled by your asking only for certain sorts of adverbial 
		elaboration, of course.</p>
		<p>To provide some freer and consolidating practice, adverbials can be 
		the focus of a process writing lesson with the learners progressively 
		elaborating each clause or verb phrase in a text to make it richer and 
		more informative (as well as easier to read).<br />
		Some text types will lend themselves to the production of certain 
		adverbials.&nbsp; For example, texts describing places will require 
		place adverbials, those recounting a story will probably require time 
		and reason adverbials and so on.&nbsp; Suiting the text type to the 
		target adverbial type is important.</p>

			<li>All the above can be taught by focusing in two ways, separately 
			or together:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>on the sort of grammar: prepositional phrases, noun phrases, 
				clauses, adverbs etc.</li>
				<li>on the function: to concede, to reinforce, to show the 
				speaker's feeling, to express when, why, where and how etc.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>What is taught will depend on the learners' levels and needs.&nbsp; 
			For example:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>some learners who need conversational or presentational 
				strategies and skills will want to focus on conjuncts as a way 
				of improving fluency and holding or giving up a turn</li>
				<li>some might need to focus carefully on clausal ways to show 
				reasons for the purposes of academic writing</li>
				<li>some will need disjunct competence to express feelings and 
				intentions
				and so on</li></ol>
			</li>
			<li>Our learners need not be troubled with terms like disjunct or 
			conjunct but teachers need to be able to analyse the language they 
			introduce and practise so that learners aren't presented with a jumble 
			of different types of adverbials.</li>
			<li><strong>Other languages</strong><br />
			To attempt a survey of how adverbial use and form varies across 
			languages would take another website, even if the information were 
			easily obtainable.&nbsp; Of one thing you may be reasonably sure: it 
			will be different in your learners' first languages.<br />
			In particular, we noted above that adjuncts in English may not be 
			fronted in negative declarative clause so while we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazily, John walked into town</em><br />
			we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Lazily, John didn't walk into town</em><br />
			and that is not a restriction that applies in other languages.<br />
			In this negative example, the adverb <em>lazily</em> will be 
			understood as an attitudinal disjunct and imply that the speaker is 
			making a judgement about John's character at the time.<br />
			Raising your learners' awareness,
			<strong>before</strong> tackling any of the types of adverbial, of how their languages differ from 
			English is not wasted time because the identification of differences 
			and similarities often allows learners to focus on what they need to 
			master.&nbsp; Translation exercises can help considerably if the 
			constituents of sentences are highlighted.&nbsp; Here's an example:<br />

			Learners work together to identify how the chunks of information are 
			ordered and expressed in their first language(s).<br />
			If you have a multi-lingual group, they can then talk to each other 
			to explain the differences (because explaining something to someone 
			else is often a good way to check you have understood it).<br />
			The sentences to analyse can, naturally, be constructed to focus on 
			the kinds of adverbials you feel are the most important for your 
			group to master.<br />
			The object of the exercise is to spot important differences, 
			especially in terms of phrase ordering, phrase positioning and the 
			fronting of adverbials so follow-up discussion and elicitation of 
			patterns of similarity and difference is imperative.<br />
			The theory is that noticing permits focusing and focusing enhances 
			learning.<br />
			It can be an informative, intriguing and entertaining procedure.</li>
