		<p>
		It is sometimes averred that English does not have a case grammar.<br />
		While it is true that English makes few changes associated with case, 
		all languages exhibit case in one way or another.&nbsp; Verbs, for 
		example, have subjects (nominative case) and objects (accusative case) 
		and, while simple nouns do not alter to show which role they perform, 
		pronouns, as sub-set of nouns, certainly do.<br />
		There is, for example, an obvious difference between:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told him</em><br />
		and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told her</em><br />
		which is signalled by the forms of the pronouns.</p>

		<p>Case is a grammatical category which shows the relationships 
		between nouns (or noun phrases), pronouns, determiners and adjectives 
		and other items in a clause.<br />
		In some languages, not only nouns, pronouns, adjectives and 
		determiners are altered to show case but case may also affect the form 
		of participles and prepositions.</p>
			<p>For example, in the English sentences:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>The man kissed the woman</em></li>
			<li><em>The woman kissed the man</em></li>
		</ol>
			<p><strong>In English</strong>, we only know who did what to whom by the order of the words.&nbsp; 
		The subject comes first in both sentences so we know that is the doer of 
		the action.&nbsp; The object follows the verb so we know that is the 
		receiver of the action.&nbsp; If we reverse the order, we reverse the 
		sense.<br />
			In sentence 1. the man did the kissing and in sentence 2. the woman 
			started it.</p>
			<p>We have now identified two of the three cases in English: the
		<span class="style_brown">subjective</span> case, also called the
		<span class="style_brown">nominative</span> and the
		<span class="style_brown">objective</span> case, also called the
		<span class="style_brown">accusative</span>.<br />
		(If none of the above makes any sense to you, follow
			<a href="../../initial/lexis/personal_pronouns.html" target="_blank">the guide to pronouns</a> 
			(new tab) in the initial training area of this site.)</p>
		
		<p>Modern English does not inflect adjectives to show case at all and 
		only adds <em>'s</em> to nouns to show the genitive case.&nbsp; 
		Determiners such as articles, numerals and demonstratives do not change 
		to indicate case but possessive determiners and personal pronouns are 
		altered to show case.<br />
		In all other circumstances, nouns and adjectives are unchanged whatever 
		their relationship to other items in the sentence is.</p>
			<p>This is not the situation in other languages, some of which 
			depend heavily on making changes to adjectives, pronouns and nouns 
			to show what their relationship is to other items in a clause.<br />
			This means that in English, there is no change to the underlined 
			words in these examples although the role the words are playing 
			grammatically is very different.&nbsp; For comparison, the 
			translation into German, which has a complex case structure is shown 
			and you can see that many of the words (articles, prepositions and 
			adjectives in this case) change to show the relationships between 
			the words in the sentences.</p><table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">

					<h2>The three cases in English</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>Modern English has only three cases and it is often not clear from 
		the form of words which case is being used.&nbsp; This is why, in some analyses, 
		English does not have a case structure at all because it has so few ways 
		of marking elements of syntax to signify the relationships.<br />
		English does, however have a case-based pronoun structure (<em>I</em> 
		vs. <em>me</em> vs. <em>my </em> v<em>s. mine, </em> vs<em>. myself</em> etc.) and it can distinguish other 
		items in terms of subject and object (<em>who</em> vs. <em>whom</em>, 
		for example) or possession (using <em>whose</em> or adding <em>'s</em> 
			to a noun).<br />
			Arguably, only the following 6 words are inflected in Modern English 
			to show case: <em>I, we, he, she, they</em> (and in formal language 
			also <em>who</em>).&nbsp; Old English had a complex case structure but 
		most inflexions have been lost in the transition to Modern English.<br />
			(This ignores the fact that the genitive in English is marked either 
			with the <em>'s</em> inflexion or with the periphrastic <em>of-</em>phrase.)</p>
			<p>Here are the three 
			cases with examples <strong>highlighted</strong>:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Subject</strong> or <strong>Nominative</strong><br />
			<img alt="one case" height="133" src="../../images/labels_suitcase200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			This refers to the doer of a verb:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>John </strong>came in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The hammer</strong> did the trick<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>She</strong> went away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A lot of discussion</strong> followed</em><br />
			Subjects are noun phrases, usually, but can be finite clauses as in, 
			e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>That John was allowed out early</strong> 
			surprised me</em><br />
			or non-finite clauses as in e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Turning on the tap</strong> let the 
			water flow into the garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>To do that </strong>would be very foolish</em></li>
			<li><strong>Object</strong> or <strong>Accusative</strong><br /><em><img alt="two cases" height="133" src="../../images/two_cases200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			</em>This refers to the thing or person acted on or the goal of a 
			movement:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told <strong>Mary</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent <strong>all the money</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hit <strong>him</strong><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They began <strong>a long voyage upriver</strong><br />
			</em>Again, objects are usually noun phrases but can be finite clauses as 
			in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think <strong>he has written to her</strong><br />
			</em>or non-finite clauses as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I imagined <strong>seeing a unicorn<br />
			</strong></em>In some functional grammar analyses, the complement 
			of&nbsp;a preposition is referred to as the prepositional object as 
			in, e.g.:<em><strong><br />
			</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to <strong>the railway station<br />
			</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over<strong> the bridge<br />
&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; behind <strong>the garage<br />
			</strong></em>etc.<br />
			Referring to prepositional objects makes sense in a case analysis, 
			too, because all prepositions in English are followed by nouns or 
			noun phrases in the accusative so, for example, we have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By <strong>whom</strong> was it done?</em> 
			(not <em>who</em>)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between you and <strong>me</strong></em> (not
			<em>I</em>)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She invited <strong>them</strong> </em>(not
			<em>they</em>)<br />
			etc.<br />
			The object in English can be direct as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I brought <strong>her</strong></em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I brought <strong>it</strong></em><br />
			or indirect as in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I brought <strong>her</strong> it</em><br />
			but English makes no distinction between direct and indirect objects 
			in the structure of any words.<strong><br /></strong>Many languages which have more developed case 
			structures distinguish between the direct object (the accusative) 
			and the indirect object (the dative).&nbsp; A range of languages 
			will also distinguish between concepts of position and movement 
			towards or away from.&nbsp; In German, for example,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is on the table<br />
			</em>translates as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Es ist auf <strong>dem</strong> Tisch</em><br />
			using the 
			masculine dative case ending on the definite article (<em>dem</em>), 
			but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put it on the table</em><br />
			translates as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ich legte es auf <strong>den</strong> Tisch</em><br />
			using the 
			masculine accusative ending on the definite article (<em>den</em>).<br />
			Modern English no longer 
			makes this distinction but Old English had the same four cases as 
			Modern German with complex inflexions on nouns, adjectives and 
			determiners.<br />Other languages may reserve a single case for prepositional objects 
			and others may use a range of cases depending on the meaning of the 
			preposition (or, in some cases, irregularly and randomly).<br />
			Because English does not distinguish between direct and indirect 
			objects the case of either is sometimes described as <strong>oblique</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>Possessive</strong> or <strong>Genitive</strong><br />
			<em>
			<img alt="three cases" height="133" src="../../images/three_cases200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			</em>This is often assumed to refer to ownership but the term 
			Possessive, as is shown in the guide to it, is misleading because the case refers 
			in English to more than ownership:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>car's</strong> engine caught fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>My </strong>opinion was ignored<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's <strong>mine</strong> to spend as I like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision <strong>of the court </strong>is to set him 
			free.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have <strong>John's</strong> letter in front of me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Whose</strong> idea is that?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Her</strong> imprisonment was unfair<br />
			</em>The Genitive in English is quite 
			complicated and genitive structures vary in meaning as well as 
			occurring as integral parts of object and subject phrases and 
			clauses.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>English does not alter the noun or any determiner to mark Nominative or Accusative cases 
		so only word order is a guide to the grammatical function.&nbsp; That 
		means that:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The delay caused a problem</em><br />
		is only distinguishable from<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A problem caused the delay</em><br />
		by word ordering.<br />
		Pronouns are usually marked but not in all cases because the system is 
		defective.&nbsp; The pronouns <em>you</em> and <em>it</em>, for example, 
		serve as both the Nominative and Accusative forms:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She told <strong>you</strong></em> (Accusative<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>You</strong> told her</em> (Nominative)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>It</strong> broke</em> (Nominative)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They broke <strong>it</strong> </em>(Accusative)<br />
		The Genitive is marked in English but with some limitations, discussed 
		elsewhere.</p>
		<p>An argument can be made for a fourth case in English, the dative.&nbsp; 
		The case is marked in many languages, such as German and applies to a 
		certain type of object.&nbsp; In English, it can be said to apply to the 
		indirect object noun phrase used with a ditransitive verb such as <em>give, 
		send</em> or <em>make</em>.&nbsp; The indirect object is either</p>
		<ol class="auto-style7">
			<li>the person or thing affected by the action, in which case it can 
			usually be  rephrased with a <em>to</em> expression as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sent me a letter</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sent a letter to me</em></li>
			<li>the person or thing which is the beneficiary of the action, in 
			which case it can usually be replaced with a <em>for</em> expression 
			as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She made me a birthday card</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She made a birthday card for me.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>However, in English, there is no change to the noun to signify case 
		and no change either to signify a difference between indirect and direct 
		object pronouns so the dative case is usually invisible (which doesn't 
		mean it doesn't exist).<br />
		The alteration in syntax for the indirect object in English 
		as in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She read the children a story<br />
		</em>changing to:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She read a story to the children<br />
		</em>is called 
		the <strong>dative shift </strong>or<strong> dative alternation</strong>, incidentally.</p>
		<p>A list of ditransitive verbs in English is available <em>via</em> a link at 
		the end.</p>

		<p>A large number of languages, including Slavic languages, Germanic 
		languages (except English), Romance languages, Persian, 
		Turkish, Greek and a host more are described as synthetic, meaning that 
		words are formed by the synthesis of a root and an affix.&nbsp; This is 
		not a clear-cut category because some languages are more 
		enthusiastically synthetic than others and even an isolating (or 
		analytic) languages 
		such as English shows some tendency to alter the form of the word to 
		mark case, especially with pronouns.</p>
		<p>If you speak some German, the following will be familiar to you:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="3"><em>Der Mann küsste die Frau</em></li>
			<li><em>Die Frau </em><em>küsste den Mann</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Sentences 3 and 4 are direct translations of sentences 1 and 2 above.&nbsp; 
		Notice, however, that there is subtle difference: the definite article 
		for<em> Mann</em> changes from<em> der</em> to <em>den </em> in sentence 2.&nbsp; 
		This is because German is one of many languages which distinguishes 
		between cases by changing the form of words.&nbsp; It can also change 
		the form of adjectives and nouns to reflect the case.&nbsp; In this 
		example, the article for <em>the woman</em> is the same in both cases.<br />
		The second thing to note is that reversing the word order does <strong>
		not</strong> reverse the meanings of the sentences:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="5"><em>Die Frau der Mann küsste</em></li>
			<li><em>Den Mann die Frau küsste</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>A German speaker might be mildly surprised by the word-order change 
		but under no illusions about who did what to whom because the accusative 
		ending on the article is intact so we know that the man is the object in 
		sentence 6 and it was she who did the kissing.&nbsp; In sentence 5, the 
		article is <em>der</em> so we know that<em> the man</em> cannot be the 
		object of the verb.</p>
		<p>Exactly the same thing is possible in a whole range of languages.&nbsp; 
		Here's how it looks in Greek, for example:</p>

		<p>Lots.&nbsp; The better news is that most European (i.e., 
		Indo-European languages) have no more than eight or nine and many don't really 
		have a case grammar at all (although all languages have cases).&nbsp; 
		The main cases are:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>abessive</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>signals <em>without something</em>.<br />
			In English the meaning is almost solely expressed with the 
			preposition <em>without.<br />
			</em>For example:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They left without me</em></dd>
			<dt><em><strong>ablative</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>indicating <em>movement away from something</em> or <em>a cause 
			of something</em><br />
			For example, <em>the house</em> is in the ablative case in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
			car drove away from the house</em>.<br />
			In<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stopped work 
			because of the weather<br />
			</em>the ablative form of <em>the weather</em> 
			is selected in many languages.<br />
			In English, the case is usually represented by prepositions such as
			<em>away from, from, owing to </em>or<em> because of</em>.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plane flew from Athens to London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy ran away from us</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was late owing to the weather</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			(The last of those, in German, requires an ablative use of the 
			genitive, incidentally.)</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>accusative</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>signals the direct object (see above).&nbsp; In English, all 
			prepositions are followed by the accusative so we say<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between you and me</em><br />
			not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between you and I</em>.</dd>
			<dt><strong><em>comitative</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>signals accompanied by something or someone and is quite rare 
			(Korean has this case).&nbsp; Most languages content themselves with 
			a preposition or postposition to signal the sense.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>dative</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>the indirect object, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave me a kiss</em>.<br />
			<em>she</em> is the nominative, <em>me</em> is in the dative and
			<em>a kiss</em> is in the accusative case (although Modern English never 
			distinguishes between the dative and accusative in the form of any 
			word).<br />
			We can move these around in English but we have to add <em>to</em> 
			to signify the dative case:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave a kiss to me<br />
			</em>which would, for example be:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sie gab mir einen Kuss<br />
			</em>in German with <em>mir </em>in the Dative case and <em>einen 
			Kuss</em> in the Accusative (signalled by the addition of <em>-en</em> 
			to the article).<br />
			The dative case in English is not distinguished although 
			prepositions such as <em>to</em> and <em>for</em> represent it as 
			in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read a story to the children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She cooked dinner for me</em></dd>
			<dt><em><strong>ergative</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>the ergative case applies to verbs in which the ostensible 
			grammatical subject of the verb is, semantically, the object of the 
			verb.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door opened</em><br />
			means, in fact:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something or someone opened the door</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door was opened</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The potatoes boiled</em><br />
			means:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone boiled the potatoes</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The potatoes were boiled</em><br />
			In English, we allow this use of ergative verb forms but do not mark the noun for case.&nbsp; Other languages allow 
			the same use but it is an identifiable case with special verb and 
			noun forms.&nbsp; For example, in Basque:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I boil the water = Ura irakiten dut</em><br />
			but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The water is boiling = Urak irakitzen du.<br />
			</em>For more on ergative verbs, which are quite common in English, 
			see the guide to verb and clause types, linked below.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>essive</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>signals <em>as something</em>.&nbsp; In, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked as a waiter</em><br />
			the noun <em>waiter</em> will be signalled by inflexion as essive in 
			nature.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>genitive</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>indicating possession, origin or description (at least)<br />
			For example,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My house is here</em><br />
			contains the genitive determiner, <em>
			my.<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government's policy<br />
			</em>contains the genitive marker <em>'s</em> but refers to a 
			description of the policy rather than its owner.<br />In some languages, the form of the noun will also change to 
			signify the genitive case.&nbsp; For example,<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; centre of the town</em><br />
			in Czech is<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; centrum města</em><br />
			with the ending on the word for town,
			<em>město,</em> changing from <em>o</em> to <em>
			a</em>.<br />
			English marks the genitive in two ways (see below) as well as using 
			the pronoun / determiner <em>whose</em> to express the idea.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>instrumental</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>indicates something being used for a purpose<br />
			For example, in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hit it with a hammer<br />
			</em>the word <em>hammer</em> 
			is in the instrumental case.<br />
			In Polish, for example, the word hammer translates as <em>młotek</em> 
			but <em>with a hammer</em> translates as <em>młotkiem</em>.<br />
			Latin has such a case, usually called the ablative which includes 
			the locative (see next).<br />
			This case in English is usually represented by the prepositions <em>
			by</em> and <em>with</em> although other expressions such as <em>
			using, by use of </em>and<em> through </em>as well as <em>via </em>
			also express the idea.<br />
			A further case, the <strong><em>instructive</em></strong> in, e.g., 
			Finnish refers to <em>with the aid of something</em>.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>locative</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>indicates a location<br />
			For example, in some languages the form of <em>the box</em> in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			We left it in the box<br />
			</em>would change to indicate locative case.<br />
			So, for example, the Czech for <em>Prague</em> is <em>Praha</em> but
			<em>in Prague</em> translates as <em>v Praze</em>.<br />
			In some languages the locative is further subdivided into categories 
			such as absolute position (<em>on the hill</em>), orientation (<em>on 
			the left of the hill</em>) and direction (<em>towards the hill</em>).<br />
			It is helpful to mention to learners whose first languages 
			distinguish this case in the grammar that it corresponds, roughly, 
			in English to the prepositions<em> in, on, towards, by</em> and <em>at</em>.<br />
			Japanese distinguishes destination from origin by having two 
			separate verb cases: ablative (from a place or origin) and elative 
			(to a place or destination).<br />
			A few languages (notably Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian) also have 
			subdivisions of the locative:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
				<li><strong><em>adessive</em></strong> (at something)</li>
				<li><strong><em>aditive / allative</em></strong> (onto something)</li>
				<li><strong><em>comitative</em></strong> (with something)</li>
				<li><strong><em>elative</em></strong> (out of something)</li>
				<li><strong><em>inessive</em></strong> (into something)</li>
				<li><strong><em>superessive</em></strong> (below / under 
				something)</li>
			</ul>
			</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>nominative</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>the subject (see above).&nbsp; This case is, in most languages, 
			the unmarked form of a noun and its determiners and adjectives.&nbsp; I.e., it is 
			considered the prototypical form and is the one which dictionaries 
			will cite when referring to the meaning of words.</dd>
			<dt><strong><em>partitive</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>this is a rare case which is akin to the genitive structure in 
			English of, e.g., <em>a pane of glass.&nbsp; </em>It exists in 
			Finnish and Estonian and some other languages.&nbsp; In some 
			analyses, the word <em>some</em> is considered a partitive article 
			(but not on this site).</dd>
			<dt><strong><em>sublative</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>is a rare case signalling <em>with respect to something</em>.&nbsp; 
			So in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to your enquiry</em><br />
			the word <em>enquiry</em> is in the sublative case and that is 
			signalled in some languages by inflexion.</dd>
			<dt><strong><em>translatative</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>is a rare case signalling <em>turning into something</em> as in, 
			for example, in English:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She became the manager</em></dd>
			<dt><em><strong>vocative</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>indicating the addressed person or thing<br />
			For example, in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning, Mary!<br />
			</em>some languages will 
			change the form of <em>Mary</em> to indicate that she is being 
			addressed.<br />
			So, for example, in Greek<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dimitris arrived</em><br />
			translates as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ο Δημήτρης έφτασε (O Dimitrees eftase)</em><br />
			but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, Dimitris</em><br />
			translates as <br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Γεια σου Δημήτρη (yasu Dimitree)</em><br />
			with the '<em>s</em>' ending dropped to indicate that <em>Dimitris</em> is 
			being addressed.</dd>

			<p>It is not possible to describe the exact function of cases in all 
		languages because there is a lot of variability in how the languages 
		deploy the cases if and when they do.&nbsp; German, for example, uses 
		the dative case or even the genitive to describe cause and Greek uses 
		the genitive where other languages will use the dative, an adjective or 
		a compound noun.&nbsp; Some 
		languages have cases not in this list.</p>
			<p>Here is a short alphabetic list of how many common (or 
			interesting) languages work in terms 
			of case:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Albanian</strong></dt>
				<dd>has 4 cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive 
				governing all adjectives and nouns and differing depending on 
				the type of reference (definite or indefinite).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Arabic</strong></dt>
				<dd>has 3 cases (nominative, accusative and 
			genitive) in most varieties.&nbsp; Arabic varies widely across the 
				areas where it is spoken and is probably better classified as a 
				macro-language or language family.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Basque</strong></dt>
				<dd>has nine cases: nominative, ergative, dative, genitive 
				(origin), genitive (possession), comitative, inessive (within 
				something), illative (into 
				something) and ablative.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Bengali</strong></dt>
				<dd>has 5 cases: nominative, accusative, dative, genitive and 
				locative.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Bulgarian</strong></dt>
				<dd>has a case structure but only 
			obviously in the pronoun system (a bit like English).&nbsp; 
				Unusually for a Slavic language, the case forms have mostly been 
				discarded.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Chinese languages</strong></dt>
				<dd>have no inflexions but they 
			do, of course, have ways of distinguishing cases, either by the use 
			of particles or word ordering, much as English does to show the 
			indirect object.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Cambodian (Khmer), Lao </strong>and <strong>Thai</strong></dt>
				<dd>have no inflexions at all and all case relationships are 
				signalled by the use of prepositions or particles of one kind or 
				another.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Danish</strong></dt>
				<dd>works very similarly to English in only adding an 's' to 
				signal the genitive and using prepositions to signal other 
				cases.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Dutch</strong></dt>
				<dd>unlike other Germanic languages, has no case structure in 
				its modern form.</dd>
				<dt><strong>English</strong></dt>
				<dd>case structure is nowadays mostly 
			confined to the pronoun system (and there's
			a guide to the pronoun 
			system linked in the list of related guides at the end).&nbsp; Even 
				the pronoun system is defective, however, with some items 
				showing no changes.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Estonian, Finnish </strong>and<strong> Hungarian</strong></dt>
				<dd>all have very well-developed case structures: Finnish has 15(!) 
				cases, Estonian 14 and Hungarian just seven.&nbsp; In the case 
				of Finnish, we can encounter nouns and determiners in: 
				nominative, accusative and genitive cases as we would expect but 
				also in the partitive, inessive, elative, illative, adessive, ablative, allative, essive, translatative, instructive, abessive 
				and comitative.<br />
				Estonian lacks only the accusative from that list and Hungarian 
				is satisfied with only seven cases: genitive (used with many 
				prepositional relationships), superessive (<em>below, at, inside, 
				over</em> etc. something), sublative (with respect to something), 
				allative, adessive, ablative and comitative-instrumental.</dd>
				<dt><strong>German</strong></dt>
				<dd>has 4 cases: nominative, accusative, 
			dative, genitive.&nbsp; It 
			also uses case to distinguish between position or direction towards.&nbsp; 
				Prepositions are variably and unpredictably associated with 
				certain cases.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Greek</strong></dt>
				<dd>has 4 cases (nominative, accusative, 
			vocative, genitive) and often deploys the genitive to signal an 
			attribute or a classifier (hence the overuse in English of expressions such as <em>the 
				room 
			of the teachers</em> rather than <em>the teachers room</em> or <em>
			The Airport of Kalamata</em> rather than <em>Kalamata Airport</em>).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Gujurati</strong></dt>
				<dd>has six cases: nominative, accusative / dative, genitive, 
				ablative and locative.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Hindi </strong>and <strong>Urdu</strong></dt>
				<dd>have, in their modern forms, only two cases: direct (i.e., 
				nominative) and oblique (applying to direct or indirect 
				objects).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Icelandic</strong></dt>
				<dd>unlike other Scandinavian languages, has retained a 4-case 
				structure: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Japanese </strong>and<strong> Korean</strong></dt>
				<dd>have a range of cases including nominative, accusative and 
				dative but how they are used is very different from European 
				languages and case is marked by particles placed after the noun.&nbsp; 
			Japanese does not mark case on pronouns and Korean does not even 
			have a third-person pronoun as such.&nbsp; Japanese and Korean are 
				unusual in having two nominative cases, one referring to the 
				topic of the discourse and the other to the grammatical subject.&nbsp; 
				Japanese also has a genitive, locative, dative, accusative, elative 
				(referring to destination) and ablative case (referring to 
				origin).<br />
				Korean is slightly more complicated, adding a comitative case 
				and an essive case as well as a vocative.<br />
				Case forms in both languages are affected by considerations of 
				respect and politeness.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Latvian</strong> and <strong>Lithuanian</strong></dt>
				<dd>Latvian has 5 cases: nominative, accusative, dative, 
				genitive and locative and Lithuanian adds an instrumental case 
				to the list.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Romance languages</strong>, such as <strong>Spanish</strong>,
			<strong>French, Romanian, Catalan</strong> and <strong>Italian</strong></dt>
				<dd>do not mark 
			nouns for case so word order is stricter (and more like English).&nbsp; The pronoun systems 
			in these languages are well developed in terms of case structures, 
				however.&nbsp; Case relationships are routinely signalled, as in 
				English, by the use of 
				prepositions.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Russian </strong>and other <strong>Slavic languages</strong></dt>
				<dd>has 6 cases (nominative, accusative, 
			dative, genitive, instrumental, propositional (to talk about, also 
			called locative in some grammars).&nbsp; Ukrainian is similar as 
				are Polish and Slovak, and Czech adds a vocative to the list as 
				does Serbo-Croat.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Swedish, Norwegian </strong>and<strong> Danish</strong></dt>
				<dd>are much like English with only the pronoun system affected 
				by case (nominative, accusative and genitive in the first two 
				language and nominative, oblique and genitive in Danish).&nbsp; 
				However, see Icelandic (above).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Tamil</strong></dt>
				<dd>has seven cases: nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, 
				instrumental, comitative and locative.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Turkish</strong></dt>
				<dd>has six cases: nominative, accusative, 
			dative, genitive, locative and ablative.&nbsp; The ablative is used 
				to indicate a comparative structure and may govern some 
				postpositions (with others governed by nominative and dative 
				forms).</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Wikipedia claims that <strong>Tsez</strong>, a Northeast 
			Caucasian language, has, counting the locative and non-locative 
			cases together, no fewer than 64 cases.&nbsp; They are not listed 
			here.</p>

		<p>Apart from the general case to be made in favour of language teachers

			<li>Languages with complex case structures represent many of the 
			relationships for which English deploys prepositions (something 
			which makes it harder for speakers of the languages to get to grips 
			with the English preposition system).<br />
			So, if you are teaching learners whose first languages denote 
			certain relationships between items in a clause by using case 
			markers, it makes sense to focus on how English denotes, for 
			example, the difference between accusative and dative or how it 
			signals instrumental relationships (such as <em>with a spade</em> 
			etc.)</li>
			<li>It highlights the need to focus very clearly on word order.&nbsp; 
			It is word order <em><strong>alone</strong></em> which distinguishes 
			the meaning of the sentence pairs in English and that may come as a 
			surprise to many learners.</li>
			<li>If you know how your learners' first languages operate in regard 
			to case, it makes teaching things like pronouns much more 
			straightforward.</li>
			<li>Knowing that, for example, some languages will deal differently 
			with spatial relationships helps teachers to explain language items 
			such as the difference between <em>out of</em> (an ablative in many 
			languages) and <em>outside</em> (a locative, or essive).</li>
			<li>You cannot understand how to form acceptable relative clauses in 
			English without some knowledge of case because the distinction 
			between <em>who</em> and <em>whom</em> will not be clear and the 
			fact that the relative pronoun can be omitted in some circumstances 
			is dependent on recognising whether it is in the nominative or 
			accusative case.&nbsp; For more, see the guide to relative pronoun 
			clauses linked in the list at the end.</li>
			<li>There is evidence that adult learners in particular will use the 
			structures of their first languages to try to work out the 
			difficulties presented by a second language.&nbsp; Knowing what 
			those first-language structures are helps language teachers explain 
			and plan.</li>
