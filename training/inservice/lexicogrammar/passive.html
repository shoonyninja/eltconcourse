			<li>Because we are less interested in the agent and more concerned

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was arrested<br />
			</em>We are not concerned with the agent (probably, we know it's the 
			police or some other law-enforcement people).&nbsp; We are concerned 
			with what happened to her (the patient, not the agent).</li>
			<li>Because it's obvious what the subject is so unnecessary to state 
			it.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is widely admired<br />
			</em>We are aware that it is people who generally do the admiring.</li>
			<li>Because we don't know what the subject is.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My car

			</em>I don't know who stole the car.</li>
			<li>Because, stylistically or for social reasons, we are concerned

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There is, in fact, a fifth reason for using the passive.&nbsp; It 
			is actually more universal than any of the four stated above.<br />
			In English, and many other languages, there is a documented tendency 
			to do two things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Place new information towards the end of the utterance.&nbsp; 
				This is end <strong>focus</strong>.</li>
				<li>Place more complex phrases and clauses towards the end of 
				the utterance.&nbsp; This is end <strong>weighting</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Examples will help:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>end-focus</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who wrote the report?&nbsp; It was done by Peter.<br />
				</em>Here, the new information required by the question has been 
				placed at the end and, to do that, the speaker has selected the 
				passive.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is the car not here?&nbsp; It was taken for a 
				service.<br />
				</em>Here, again, the service is the essential information that 
				is new to the hearer so the passive is selected.</dd>
				<dt><strong>end-weighting</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not surprised that he was allowed to leave early 
				in order to get home before the snow came.<br />
				</em>Here, the complex finite clause has been shifted to the end 
				and the passive voice chosen to accommodate this.&nbsp; Compare 
				the much more awkward:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he was allowed to leave early in order to get home 
				before the snow came did not surprise me.</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The concepts of end-focus and end-weighting are not always easy 
			to explain to learners or for them to grasp and apply but they serve 
			to explain many uses of the passive including, but not limited to, 
			the four we identified above.&nbsp; For more, see
			the guide to postponement, linked in the list of related guides at 
			the end.</p>

			<h3>Markedness</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The passive is, in most languages, <strong>marked</strong>.&nbsp; 
			That is to say that the neutral form of the sentence is normally the 
			active and the passive is <strong>selected</strong> because the speaker / writer 
			wishes to draw attention in some way to an item in the sentence 
			which is seen as significant.<br />
			There is a general guide to the concept of markedness linked in the 
			list at the end.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is not the place to discuss the nature of theme-rheme 
			structures.&nbsp; There is a guide to the area linked from the list 
			of related guides at the end.<br />
			Here, it is enough to note that the passive is frequently used to 
			maintain and create cohesion in texts.</p>
			<p>It sometimes works like this.&nbsp; Either:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The noun phrase which appears in a passive sentence is 
				elevated to the subject position in the next or a subsequent 
				sentence or</li>
				<li>The subject of the verb in the first sentence is demoted in 
				a subsequent passive sentences.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Examples will probably help:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Sentence 1: <em>The <strong>building work</strong> was accomplished on time and within budget.</em><br />Sentence 2:
				<em>The <strong>construction </strong>took longer than we 
				expected but we are happy 
				with the result.</em></li>
				<li>Sentence 1: <em>The <strong>raw materials</strong> come in by lorry to the main depot.</em><br />
				Sentence 2: <em>There, the <strong>seeds</strong> are filtered 
				and the process can begin.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>An alternative is that the agent of the passive in the first 
			sentence is raised to the subject position in sentence 2 and then 
			may be further raised to the subject of an active third sentences, 
			like this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The window was broken by <strong>the boys</strong> 
			next door.&nbsp; <strong>They</strong> were forced to pay for it 
			by their parents.&nbsp; <strong>The boys</strong> pooled their 
			pocket money and took it to the neighbours.</p>

			<h3>Subject and Object<br />
			<img alt="SUBJECT OBJECT" height="133" src="../../images/children_subject_object200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>If we have a normal active sentence such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The girl ate some chocolate</em><br />
			most people can unhesitatingly identify that we have:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>a subject (<em>the girl</em>)</li>
				<li>a verb (<em>ate</em>)</li>
				<li>an object (<em>some chocolate</em>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, when it comes to passive sentences, people have more 
			difficulty describing the parts of the sentence and especially in 
			establishing what the subject and the object are in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Some chocolate was eaten by the girl<br />
			</em>because we are used to the idea that it is the subject which 
			does something and the object is the thing or person to which 
			something happens.</p>
			<p>Here's the answer (or one that will do for our purposes):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the active sentence the subject is the agent (<em>she who 
				did the eating</em>) and the object is the patient (<em>that 
				which was eaten</em>).<br />
				We have a subject agent and a patient object.&nbsp; That is most 
				people's intuitive understanding of the terms subject and 
				object.</li>
				<li>In the passive formulation, the subject of the verb is now 
				the patient (<em>some chocolate</em>) and the agent is now 
				introduced by the <em>by</em>-phrase (and is no longer the 
				subject of the verb).<br />
				We have, therefore, a subject patient rather than a subject 
				agent.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Agent and Patient<br />
			<img alt="patient" height="133" src="../../images/examine_vet200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>Some confusion sometimes occurs when people confuse the nature of 
			agents and patients with those of subjects and objects of verbs.&nbsp; 
			So, here is the second part of the answer:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The role of subject and object is determined, in English, 
				syntactically, by word ordering with the Subject preceding the 
				verb and the Object following it.&nbsp; In other languages, the 
				word and/or its determiner and any other modifying elements will 
				be marked in some way to show its case: 
				nominative forms for the subject and accusative forms for the 
				object (and, perhaps, dative forms for the agent).<br />
				Some 
				languages, such as Japanese, have an agentive case, too.<br />
				As we have seen, subjects can be agents or patients depending on 
				the sense.</li>
				<li>Agents and patients, on the other hand, are not determined 
				syntactically, they are determined by the information they 
				encode and how the information flows along the clause or 
				sentence.<br />
				In other words, it is the <strong>communicative</strong> 
				function which determines what is agent and what patient rather 
				than <strong>grammatical</strong> function as is the case with 
				subjects and objects.<br />
				The agent, whatever its grammatical form, is that which does the 
				action.<br />
				The patient, whatever its grammatical form, remains that which 
				is acted upon by the agent.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Theme and rheme<br />
			<img alt="theme" height="133" src="../../images/finger_theme_rheme200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>An allied but distinct way of looking at the structures from a 
			functional grammar standpoint is to distinguish between the theme 
			and its accompanying rheme.&nbsp; So, here's the third part of the 
			answer:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The theme of an utterance is its starting point, what the 
				sentence is about.&nbsp; So, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl ate the chocolate</em><br />
				the theme is <em>The girl</em><br />
				but in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chocolate was eaten by the girl</em><br />
				the theme is <em>The chocolate</em>.</li>
				<li>The rheme is everything that follows the theme until a new 
				theme appears, usually in a separate sentence.&nbsp; So, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl ate the chocolate</em><br />
				the rheme is <em>ate the chocolate</em><br />
				but in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chocolate was eaten by the girl</em><br />
				the rheme is <em>was eaten by the girl</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Many find that considering Agent vs. Patient and/or theme vs. 
			rheme a clearer way of explaining the passive than focusing on 
			Subject vs. Object.</p>

			</em>Passive 1: <em>He was given a book<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</em>Passive 2: <em>A book was given to him<br />
			</em>Many other languages do not allow both forms, usually reserving 
			the passive for the direct object only, so only the second passive 
			sentence here could be formed.&nbsp; This creates both 
			productive and receptive error.<br />

					<h2>prepositional complements</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>English can raise the complement of a preposition (i.e., the noun 
			phrase which completes the prepositional phrase) to make it the 
			subject of a passive sentence.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Active: <em>She spoke to the people in the bar</em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Passive<em>: The people in the bar were spoken to</em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Active: <em>They worked on the car</em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Passive<em>: The car was worked on</em><br />
			This leaves the preposition 'stranded' but is common in English.<br />
			A lot of languages don't do that at all and it will confuse many 
			learners.&nbsp; Many languages cannot split a prepositional phrase 
			like this and it will produce error such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It was worked on the car<br />
			</em>For more on how preposition and adverb particles are dealt with 
			in the passive forms of multi-word verbs, see the guide, linked in 
			the list of related guides at the end.</p>

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>the verb<em> to be</em></h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>English uses the same verb (<em>be</em>) to form both a dynamic 
			passive and a stative passive.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Dynamic passive:
			<em>During the game, the window was broken<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</em>Stative passive:
			<em>It was cold in the room because the window was broken<br />
			</em>In many languages, this confusion between state (arguably the 
			adjectival use of the participle) and action is not possible because 
			a different verb would be used in each case.&nbsp; For example, in 
			German, the first sentence would be<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Das Fenster wurde gebrochen<br />
			</em>in which the verb <em>werden</em> 
			signals the dynamic passive and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Das Fenster war gebrochen<br />
			</em>in which the verb <em>sein</em> 
			signals the stative passive.<br />
			Many other languages do something like that and the English use of
			<em>be</em> for both meanings is not immediately grasped.&nbsp; 
			Learners who are looking for parallel constructions in English to 
			those in their first languages may, therefore, be induced into 
			errors such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window became broken.<br />
			</em>English can make a dynamic-stative distinction with the verb
			<em>get</em> as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window got broken during the game<br />
			and that will be intuitively acceptable to learners whose first 
			languages routinely make the distinction.<br />
			Stylistically, however, some consider the use of <em>get</em> for 
			this sense to be too informal in some contexts.</p>
			<p>Many languages, such as Greek and Polish, do not readily convert 
			participles into adjectives in the way that English does and so the 
			confusion is avoided.&nbsp; It means, however, that these learners 
			may be reluctant to use a past participle adjectivally and hunt for 
			a distinct adjective form (which may not be available).&nbsp; That 
			can lead to error such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;*The money was transferal from the bank</em><br />
			If the state of something is described, it may be called a 
			resultative passive but most analyses will simply refer to it as the 
			adjectival use of the participle.</p>
			<p>A rich source of confusion in English is that we use the verb <em>be</em> to 
			signal both the passive voice and the continuous/progressive aspect.&nbsp; 
			In a sentence such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was being questioned by the police<br />
			</em>The verb signals the passive in its first form (<em>was</em>)

			<p>This is an allied point.&nbsp; In English it is not always clear 
			whether the participle form is actually part of a passive 
			construction or an adjective.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was decided<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			They were determined<br />
			</em>are both adjectival and describe the people.&nbsp; They are 
			also, obviously, formed from verbs but it is not possible to make an 
			active sentence:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Someone decided her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Someone determined them</em><br />
			but in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were exhausted<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She was delighted</em><br />
			the case is not so clear because we can form active sentences such 
			as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work exhausted them<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The film delighted her<br />
			</em>Many languages will have a different form for an adjective 
			formed from a verb and the verb's tense form.&nbsp; English doesn't 
			and this causes both receptive and productive error.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Some verbs in English are almost always used in stative senses.&nbsp; 
			The verbs <em>understand, say, think</em> and <em>know</em> are 
			obvious examples.&nbsp; In these cases a passive construction loses 
			the sense of an agent and a patient.&nbsp; With these verbs, a dummy<em> 
			it</em> is often inserted to form the subject.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is known to be hot tempered<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It is known that he is hot tempered<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She is understood to have left the country<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It is understood that she has left the country<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He is said to be an expert<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It is said that he is an expert<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I am thought to be intolerant<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It is thought that I am intolerant<br />
			</em>Few of these constructions exist in the same way in other 
			languages and they cause trouble for learners.<br />
			Note, too, the stative use in, e.g.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The law was designed to protect children</em></p>

			<p>English has more than one auxiliary verb to make a passive so we

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was imprisoned<br />
			</em>which refers to a state or action depending on context.&nbsp; It can mean<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was taken to jail</em><br />
			a dynamic passive, or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She 
			spent time in jail</em><br />
			a stative passive.<br />
			But we can also make a passive with <em>get</em>, as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got imprisoned</em><br />
			in which only the first sense of the example 
			with <em>be</em> can be understood here because <em>got</em> implies 
			a dynamic passive.</p>
			<p>The agent <em>by-</em>phrase is acceptable with the verb <em>be</em> but 
			sometimes unusual 
			or plain wrong with the verb <em>get</em>:<br />
			So, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was imprisoned by the authorities<br />

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?She got imprisoned by the authorities</em><br />
			is not, and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was taught by his sister</em><br />

					<h2>complex tenses</h2>

			</table>
			<p>English can combine the passive with the full range of tense and 
			aspect forms as well as modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will have been arrested<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The car will be being serviced<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She had been spoken to<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The wall was being built and had been being built for some time.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The car should have been being serviced but the workshop made a 
			mistake<br />
			</em>Some consider the complex forms combining 
			progressive with perfect with passive with a modal to be clumsy but 
			they are, nevertheless, possible in English.<br />
			Many languages, especially those with a more limited range of modal 
			auxiliary verbs, cannot do this kind of thing.<br />
			Unpacking what each auxiliary verb implies in such sentences is 
			cognitive challenging and that leads to receptive error.<br />
			Productively, such forms are also challenging, especially in spoken 
			languages because the learner has to do two things:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			a) get all the auxiliary verbs in and in the right order<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			b) produce a fluent utterance with all the weak forms of, e.g., <em>
			should, have</em> and <em>been</em> in place: /ðə kɑː ʃəd həv bɪn 
			ˈbiːɪŋ ˈsɜː.vɪst/</p>

			</table>
			<p>If the term colligation is unfamiliar, there is
			a guide on this site linked in the list of related guides at the 
			end.<br />
			Briefly, 
			it refers to grammatical collocation.</p>
			<p>When <em>make</em> is used passively, its colligational 
			characteristics change.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They made him go<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He was made </em><span class="style_underline"><em>to</em></span><em> 
			go<br />
			</em>It is simply non-intuitive to many learners that the verb <em>
			make</em> should require a different grammar when it is used in the 
			passive but that the verb <em>let</em> does not require such a 
			change so we can have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I let the class out early</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The class was let out early</em><br />
			with no changes to the grammar of the verb<br />
			Errors such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She was made visit him<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*He was let to go<br />
			</em>result.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the verb <em>let</em> often cannot be used with a 
			following, or catenative, verb in the passive, so, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They were let to play outside</em><br />
			is not available, but when an adverb modifier instead of a 
			non-finite verb is used:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were let outside</em><br />
			is acceptable.</p>
			<p>The verb <em>have</em> when it is used causatively to mean <em>
			oblige</em> also behaves anomalously so we allow the active:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They had me do the work again</em><br />
			but not the passive:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was had do the work again</em></p>

			<p>Sometimes, the object of a verb is a passive <em>to-</em>complement.&nbsp; 
			The verb <em>expect </em>is commonly used this way but there are 
			others such as <em>require</em>.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We require you to finish the work</em> (active sentence with <em>
			you</em> as the object of <em>require</em>)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We require the work to be finished </em>(passive sentence 1 with
			<em>the work</em> as the patient)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are required to finish the work</em> <em>
			(by us)</em> (passive sentence 2 
			with <em>you</em> as the patient)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work is required to be finished (by you)</em> (passive sentence 3 &ndash; 
			the double passive)<br />
			Some people consider the double-passive construction to be 
			clumsy, even wrong.<br />
			It is certainly a form which learners are rarely going to need to 
			produce but it crops up in written English more often than it should 
			and takes a bit of unpacking to get at the meaning.</p>

					<h2>other passive verbs and the ergative</h2>

			</table>
			<p>English has a number of other verbs which convey passive meaning.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had her house painted<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			They got their money stolen<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			We have to have the car serviced<br />
			</em>(For more on causative constructions, 
			see the guide, linked in the list of related guides at the end.)</p>
			<p>Other examples of passive meaning but active constructions are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house needs fixing up<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The dog wants feeding<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The shirts sold well<br />
			</em>Many languages will simply not allow an active construction 
			such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shirts retailed for £12</em><br />
			to mean the passive idea of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shirts were retailed for £12<br />
			</em>These are examples of what is called the 
			ergative case, in which the ostensible grammatical subject is 
			semantically the object of the verb.&nbsp; So, for example, we can 
			have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She cooked the vegetables</em><br />
			in which we have an obvious subject and object and from which we can 
			make a passive:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The vegetables were cooked</em> (<em>by her</em>).<br />
			However, this verb in English is one of the group which allows the 
			ergative, too, so we can also have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The vegetables cooked</em> <em>nicely</em><br />
			which appears to be an active clause but in which the object has 
			been raised to the subject position and the sense is passive.<br />
			The ergative case is marked morphologically 
			in many languages (see below for a short list) but English does not 
			mark it so a sentence such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The door opened<br />
			</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The air warmed<br />
			</em>look like simple active sentences but the sense is often 
			passive and might be expressed as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone opened the door / The door was opened<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The draught pushed door open / The door was pushed open by 
			the draught<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun warmed the air / The air was warmed by the sun</em></p>

			<p>The <em>by</em> + agent structure is not available with some of 
			these verbs or is questionable:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She had / got her house painted by the man down the road</em><br />
			is acceptable, but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*The house needs repairing by him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The dog wants feeding by someone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The shirts sold well by the shop</em><br />
			are all disallowed.<br />
			Some languages are much more forgiving and have no passive 
			structures at all, simply using the active form and allowing the 
			context to determine whether the sense is active or passive.&nbsp; 
			Others do things differently and may have an alternative set of verb 
			inflexions or auxiliaries to signify this sense of the passive (see 
			below).</p>
			<p>Some other verbs work similarly and there is a noticeable 
			tendency to elide the passive auxiliary in English and produce 
			sentences such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The garden flooded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bus is now boarding</em><br />
			where the subject is semantically illogical.</p>
			<p>Stylistically, the use of the ergative form performs a similar 
			function to the use of passives in that it allows the speaker / 
			writer to avoid identifying the agent.&nbsp; Hence its treatment

			<p>More limitations operate in the passive voice than they do in the

			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li><strong>Transitivity</strong>:<br />
				Intransitive verbs such as <em>arrive, go, 
				lie, sneeze </em>and<em> sit </em>cannot have a passive form 
				simply because there is no object to raise to the status of 
				agent.&nbsp; However:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li>There is variation across languages in terms of which 
					verbs are transitive and which intransitive.</li>
					<li>Some verbs which are normally considered intransitive, 
					such as <em>walk</em> can be used transitively informally or 
					in certain senses.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked the dogs → The dogs were walked<br />
					</em>(compare <em>I walked home</em>, which is intransitive)<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shone the light on the desk → The light 
					was shone on the desk<br />
					</em>(compare
					<em>The sun shone brightly,</em> which is intransitive)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left the keys on the table → The

					</em>(compare <em>She left early</em>, which is 
					intransitive)</li>
					<li><em>S</em>ome verbs have ergative forms, in which the 
					subject is actually the object of the verb, so we can have transitive uses:<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The grapes grew<br />
					</em>is intransitive so no passive can be formed but<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					They grow grapes here<br />
					</em>is transitive, so we can have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Grapes are grown here<br />
					</em>and<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The soup boiled<br />
					</em>is intransitive so there is no passive but<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I boiled the soup<br />
					</em>is transitive and allows<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soup was boiled</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Active-only verbs</strong>:<br />
				some verbs in English are transitive but 
				only used, in certain senses, in the active form.&nbsp; In other 
				words, they are semantically forbidden the passive use.&nbsp; For 
				example:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>have</em> meaning <em>own</em> or <em>possess</em>:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has a lot of money → *A lot of money is had by her<br />
					</em>(The verb <em>own</em> can be used passively, e.g.: <em>
					That house is owned by her brother</em>)</li>
					<li><em>possess:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					They possess four houses → *Four houses are possessed by 
					them</em></li>
					<li><em>lack:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The chair lacks a leg → *A leg is lacked by the chair</em></li>
					<li><em>contain:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tank contains 45 litres → *45 litres are contained by the 
					tank</em></li>
					<li><em>hold </em>meaning <em>contain</em>:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottle holds a gallon → *A gallon is held by the

					<li><em>become </em>meaning<em> suit:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					That hat becomes you → *You are become by that hat</em></li>
					<li><em>go with</em> meaning<em> match:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tie goes well with the shirt → *The shirt is gone well

					<li><em>fit </em>meaning<em> be the right size:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					This shirt fits me → *I am fitted by this shirt</em></li>
					<li><em>resemble:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					He resembles his mother → *His mother is resembled by him</em></li>
					<li><em>take after</em> meaning<em> resemble:<br />

					*His continual chatter was endured by her</em></li>
					<li><em>enjoy </em>meaning<em> take pleasure in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They enjoyed the film → ?The film was enjoyed by them</em></li>
					<li><em>match </em>is a marginal case:<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The tie matches his shirt → ?His shirt is matched by his tie</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The verb <em>bear</em>, meaning to have children, is rare in 
				the active and there is an odd spelling issue with the existence 
				of '<em>e</em>' in the past participle in the active and its 
				absence in the passive.&nbsp; The passive use is obligatory when 
				referring to dates and places of birth, e.g.:<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li class="bluebuttonlist"><em>She bore three children<br />
					She had borne three children</em></li>
					<li class="bluebuttonlist"><em>Three children were born<br />
					She was born in 1965 in London → ?Her mother bore her in 
					1965 in London</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>The verb </strong> <em><strong>reputed</strong></em> only appears in the passive:<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li class="bluebuttonlist"><em>He is reputed to be extremely rich 
					→ *People repute him to be extremely rich</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>A few verbs are generally preferred in the passive (but can 
				be used actively).&nbsp; When they are used actively, the sense 
				is sometimes marked for emphasis:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>deem</em>, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was deemed inappropriate</em><br />
					not, usually<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I deemed it inappropriate</em></li>
					<li><em>populate</em>, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The town was populated by immigrants in the 1500s</em><br />
					not, usually<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immigrants in the 1500s populated the 
					town</em></li>
					<li><em>strand</em>, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The passengers were stranded at the 
					airport, by the snow</em><br />
					not, usually<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The snow stranded the passengers at 
					the airport<br />
					</em>(The words <em>overpopulated</em> and <em>
					underpopulated</em> are adjectival only and there are no 
					active verbs.&nbsp; So we allow, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The country is over / underpopulated</em><br />
					but not:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They over / underpopulate the town</em>)</li>
					<li><em>strew</em>, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lawn was strewn with rubbish by 
					the partygoers</em><br />
					not, usually<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The partygoers strewed the lawn with 
					rubbish</em></li>
					<li><em>take aback</em>, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was taken aback by his rudeness</em><br />
					not, usually<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; His rudeness took her aback</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Prepositional verbs</strong> are less cooperative than simple verbs 
				in the passive.&nbsp; When the use is metaphorical or 
				figurative, the passive is permitted.&nbsp; When these verbs are 
				used in their literal sense they are followed by prepositional 
				phrases rather than adverb particles and the passive is at best very clumsy, 
				even unacceptable.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went into the matter in some depth → The matter 
					was gone into in some depth<br />
					</em>is allowed because the use is figurative but<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					He went into the house→ *The house was gone into<br />
					</em>is not allowed because the verb is being used literally.</li>
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called for changes → Changes were called for<br />
					</em>is allowed because the use of <em>call</em> is 
					figurative and so is:<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I can live with the problems → The problems can be lived 
					with<br />
					</em>because <em>live with</em> is figurative but<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I lived with her → *She is lived with by me<br />
					</em>is not allowable because the meaning is literal.</li>
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They agreed to the changes → The changes were agreed 
					to by 
					them<br />
					</em>is allowable but<em><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					They agreed with me → *I was agreed with by them<br />
					</em>is not.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Non-finite clauses</strong> cannot usually be raised to the agentive 
				position.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>We noticed that she was unhappy → It was noticed (by us) that 
				she was unhappy<br /></em>is acceptable because the clause is finite but</li>
					<li><em>We tried to cheer her up → *To cheer her up was tried<br />
					</em>and</li>
					<li>She remembered meeting him<em> → *Meeting him was 
					remembered by her<br />
					</em>are not because <em>to cheer up</em> and <em>meeting</em> 
					are both non-finite forms.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Co-references</strong>: if the object and subject of the verb are the 
				same, the passive is not allowed.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>He saw himself as others see him → *Himself was seen as 
				others see him</em></li>
					<li><em>They gave each other presents → *Each other were given 
				presents</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Possessives</strong>: if the subject can be said to possess the 
				object, e.g., by the use of a possessive determiner or by 
				implication, the passive 
				is not usually allowed.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>She shook her head→ *Her head was shaken by her</em></li>
					<li><em>They shook hands → *Their hands were shaken by them</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Modal meaning shifts</strong>: some modal 
				auxiliaries imply a change of meaning when the passive is used.&nbsp; 
				For example:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>She may see the film</em> (possibility or 
					likelihood, i.e., epistemic modality)<em><br />
					The film may be seen by her</em> (permission, i.e., deontic 
					modality)</li>
					<li><em>You can't move the furniture</em> (permission, i.e., 
					deontic modality)<em><br />
					The furniture can't be moved</em> (ability, i.e., dynamic 
					modality)</li>
				</ul>
				</li>

			passives and stative passives is not consistently signalled so, for 
			example<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window was broken</em><br />
			can mean either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone broke the window</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window was in a broken</em> <em>state</em><br />
			We can distinguish the two concepts with the passive verb <em>get</em> 
			as in, e.g.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window got broken in the fight<br />
			</em>but many will consider the use colloquial or even slang.<br />
			Many other languages, including German, Swedish, Spanish and 
			Italian, use a different verb to distinguish the ideas (<em>sein</em> 
			and <em>werden</em> in German, <em>ser</em> and <em>estar</em> in 
			Spanish, <em>essere</em> and <em>venire</em> in Italian, <em>vara</em> 
			and <em>bli</em> in Swedish etc.).</p>

			</table>
			<p>In some languages, such as Albanian, Bengali, Tamil, Icelandic 
			and Swedish, there is a middle voice which is neither active in the 
			full sense nor properly passive.<br />
			For example, the ergative use of the verb, in which the ostensible 
			grammatical subject is semantically the object of the verb, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shoes sold well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The beans soaked in water overnight</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soup boiled over</em><br />
			would be rendered in these languages by a different grammatical 
			structure from the active form used in English or a recognisable 
			passive form because the sense is actually passive.&nbsp; <em>Shoes</em>, 
			<em>beans</em> and <em>soup</em> do not, conceptually do such things: people sell 
			shoes and people prepare food.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Italic languages</strong></dt>
				<dd>These languages, such as French, Italian, Spanish etc., often 
				use a similar auxiliary to form passives.&nbsp; That, however, 
				is where the similarities mostly end.&nbsp; Ditransitive verbs 
				with their dual possible passive forms, in particular, and many 
				of the other phenomena above will cause both form and meaning 
				problems.&nbsp; The forms of complex tenses and aspects are 
				particularly troublesome because these languages tend to inflect 
				the verb rather than use auxiliaries to signal tense.<br />
				There is also a tendency in some of these languages, e.g., 
				French, to avoid the passive formulation altogether by employing 
				what is sometimes called the 'fourth person', a form usually 
				translated into English as 'one'.&nbsp; For example, in French, 
				it is possible to translate<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door was opened</em><br />
				as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a ouvert la porte</em> (literally, <em>
				One has opened the door</em>)<br />
				Finnish and Estonian also routinely use a similar formulation.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Chinese languages</strong></dt>
				<dd>do not conjugate verbs to show tense or voice.&nbsp; They 
				do, however, use a particle, <em>bèi</em>, to signal the passive 
				voice and alter the word order, raising the object of the active 
				sentence to the subject position in the passive.&nbsp; Passive 
				constructions are conceptually not problematic but the forms in 
				English are.&nbsp; This is even worse with 
				progressive and perfect aspects for which there is no 
				corresponding form.&nbsp; All 10 of the issues above will be 
				problematic.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Korean and Japanese</strong></dt>
				<dd>both signal the passive by verb suffix.&nbsp; The concept is 
				straightforward but the use of auxiliaries is troublesome.&nbsp; 
				Korean has no equivalent of causatives at all.&nbsp; Equally, 
				the preposition passives (2, above) are not known.&nbsp; 
				Japanese also uses the passive to show respect and reserve and 
				has a separate passive form which is used for something 
				unwelcome happening to someone.&nbsp; That form is akin to the 
				English use of the passive causative such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had their house broken into</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Thai</strong></dt>
				<dd>has no auxiliary verbs or verb inflexions.&nbsp; 
				Disturbances to familiar word ordering will also present 
				problems.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Turkish</strong></dt>
				<dd>has a passive structure so the concept is not difficult.&nbsp; 
				However, the language often has separate verbs for those in 
				English which have both transitive and intransitive uses.&nbsp; 
				The multiple meanings and uses of <em>be</em> also cause 
				problems.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Arabic</strong></dt>
				<dd>distinguishes between the passive and active only in 
				pronunciation.&nbsp; Arabic speakers may ignore passive 
				constructions and use the active in all cases in English.&nbsp; 
				They will, however, have fewer problems understanding the 
				structures in section 10 above, especially forms such as <em>The 
				shirts sold well.<br />
				</em>(Arabic is probably better described as a language group 
				rather than a single language because the many varieties are 
				often not mutually comprehensible.)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Russian and Polish</strong></dt>
				<dd>have passive constructions and the concept and forms are not 
				too difficult for speakers of these languages to grasp.&nbsp; The 
				use of multiple auxiliary verbs in complex tenses will, however, 
				cause serious difficulty.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Germanic and Scandinavian languages</strong></dt>
				<dd>use a passive verb (usually <em>become</em> rather the <em>
				be</em>) and also employ auxiliaries.&nbsp; The simple forms of 
				the passive will present few terrors but more complex and 
				unusual forms will be difficult.&nbsp; Note, too, the point 
				above about the use of different verbs to form dynamic and 
				stative passives.</dd>

			<p>This is a major area of grammar so the following is not 
			prescriptive.&nbsp; It is simply some advice.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The passive needs to be approached piecemeal because of the 
				complications and varieties of forms.&nbsp; Until the 
			basic form is mastered, more complicated forms will simply sow 
			confusion.</li>
				<li>You cannot teach the passive at all unless your learners can 
				handle issues of transitivity.</li>
				<li>Concept checking needs to be regularly and consistently 
				done.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style5">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style8"><em>She has been speaking</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style9">Who spoke?&nbsp; Did anyone speak to her?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style10"><em>She has been spoken to</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style11">Who spoke?&nbsp; Did she speak?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style10"><em>I had my house repaired</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style11">Who did the work?&nbsp; Who asked for the work?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style6"><em>She was being questioned</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style7">Who asked the questions?&nbsp; Who answered?</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				etc.</li>
			
				<li>If the passive formulation is known <strong>and understood</strong> 
				for a simple tense, it can easily be taught for perfect and 
				progressive aspects because the same auxiliary is used in all 
				cases.<br />
				It is a small step from being able to see that the active form<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They gave me a prize</em><br />
				bears some equivalence to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was given a prize</em><br />
				and from there to understand the relationship between<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have given me a prize</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been given a prize</em><br />
				After that, more complex tense forms can be handled <strong>but 
				only if the aspect is clear</strong>.</li>
				<li>The four main reasons we select passive forms in English 
				(above) need to be taught separately.&nbsp; There's no future in 
				jumbling them up.&nbsp; Learners who speak languages with 
				similar or even parallel structures will have little difficulty 
				appreciating the reasoning.&nbsp; Others may have serious 
				conceptual issues to overcome.&nbsp; Teach meaning, i.e., 
				speaker intention, first.</li>
				<li>Bear in mind that speakers / writers select the passive voice 
				for a reason.&nbsp; The active and passive forms are not simple 
				equivalents so the user's <strong>intention</strong> must be 
				clear.<br />
				Be very wary, therefore, of exercises which require learners to 
				transform active to passive sentences or <em>vice versa</em>.&nbsp; 
				Such exercises send out the message that the two forms are 
				simply interchangeable with no change in meaning.&nbsp; As we 
				saw above, that's just not true.</li>
				<li>The alternative forms of passives in English (section 10, 
				above) will cause problems for everyone but the concept of 
				passiveness is inherent in all of them.&nbsp; Conceptually, 
				then, they are easier to handle after straightforward passives 
				have been acquired.</li>
