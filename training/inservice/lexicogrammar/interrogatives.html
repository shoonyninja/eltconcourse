			hardly need to analyse how it is done in English.&nbsp; That's a 
			mistake because English is, in many respects, unlike most other 
			languages in the ways it forms questions, although, of course, the 
			meanings and functions of questions are common to all languages.</p>

			<p>We can take these six question types one at a time but first we 
			need to get two technical terms straight.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>assertive and non-assertive forms</strong></dt>
				<dd>The assertive forms of determiners, adverbs and pronouns are 
				those that generally appear in simple statements.<br />
				Non-assertive forms usually appear in negatives and questions.<br />
				For example (assertive forms <span class="style_black"><strong>
				in black</strong></span>, non-assertive forms
				<span class="style_red"><strong>in red</strong></span>):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have </em> <span class="style_black"><strong>
				<em>some</em></strong></span><em> work to do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you need </em> <span class="style_red"><strong><em>any</em></strong></span><em> 
				help?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've </em> <span class="style_black"><strong><em>already</em></strong></span><em> 
				got </em> <span class="style_black"><strong><em>someone</em></strong></span><em> to 
				do that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you started </em> <span class="style_red"><strong><em>yet</em></strong></span>?<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm </em> <span class="style_black"><strong><em>still</em></strong></span><em> 
				thinking about it<br />

				<em>any 
				longer</em></strong></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was there </em> <span class="style_red"><strong><em>anything</em></strong></span><em> 
				else?</em><br />
				The importance of distinguishing the forms will become clear 
				soon.&nbsp; For more, see the guides to assertion and non-assertion 
				and to making negatives in English (links at the end).</dd>
				<dt><strong>operators</strong></dt>
				<dd>The operator in English (and other languages) is a 
				grammatical term.&nbsp; In English grammar, for our purposes 
				here, it is the auxiliary form of the verbs <em>do, be</em> 
				and <em>have</em>.&nbsp; In these examples, the operator is
				<span class="style_black"><strong>in black</strong></span>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_black"><strong><em>
				Does</em></strong></span><em> she know you?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_black"><strong><em>
				Have</em></strong></span><em> you had enough?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_black"><strong><em>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_black"><strong><em>
				Do</em></strong></span><em> you want to go?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_black"><strong><em>
				Has</em></strong></span><em> she seen the film?<br />

					<h3>Forming Yes / No questions</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The way to make yes / no questions is to put the operator before 
			the subject.</p>
			<h4>Primary auxiliary verbs</h4>
			<p>It's generally quite simple with auxiliary verbs 
			and works like this:<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He has been to the States &rarr; Has he been 
			to the States?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is arriving later → Is she arriving later?</em><br />
			and so on.</p>
			<p>The verbs <em>be</em> and <em>have</em> work in the same way even 
			when they are the main verbs rather than functioning as auxiliaries 
			as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is here → Is he here?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has your address → Has she your address?</em></p>
			<p>In British English the verb <em>have</em> is troublesome for 
			learners because there are alternative forms, the first of which is 
			rarer and more formal:<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you my telephone number?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you got my telephone number?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have my telephone number?</em><br />
			In American and related varieties of English, the preferred form is 
			to use the <em>do</em> operator only to render the question as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have my telephone number?</em></p>
			<p>When in its function as an operator, the verb <em>do</em> also 
			forms questions by simple inversion of the verb and the subject.&nbsp; 
			This occurs in tag questions, <em>doesn't it</em>?</p>
			<h4>Modal auxiliary verbs</h4>
			<p>These work in the same way as far as central or pure modal 
			auxiliary verbs are concerned with a simple inversion of verb and subject:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She can play the piano → Can she play the piano?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They must leave → Must they leave?</em><br />
			There are complications with semi-modal auxiliary verbs and marginal modal 
			auxiliary verbs to which there is a separate guide on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>
			<h4>Present and Past simple</h4>
			<p>In these two tenses only in English, the <em>do</em> operator is 
			employed to make questions and the inflexion on the verb (if one is 
			present in the declarative) is omitted:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The present simple:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>Do </em></strong></span><em>you 
				like asparagus?<br />
				</em>
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>Does</strong></em> </span><em>she work 
				here?</em></li>
				<li>The past simple:<br />
				<em><span class="style_black"><strong>Did</strong> </span>she 
				ask the boss?<br />
				</em>
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>Did</strong></em> </span><em>you miss 
				the bus?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>A very natural temptation for low-level learners of English is to 
			add the verbal inflexion because that is what they have expended 
			some effort on learning.&nbsp; We get, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *Does he likes the school?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Did you missed the bus?</em><br />
			etc.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Question intonation</strong></dt>
				<dd>Although individual speakers vary, the general way 
				intonation works is either as a rise at the end of the question

				<img alt="ye no intonation" height="123" src="../../imagesgraphics/yes_no_intonation.png" width="250" /></dd>
				<dt><strong>Focusing</strong></dt>
				<dd>In spoken language, focus is achieved by placing the nuclear 
				stress on a selected part of the question, so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she arrive on </em> <strong><em>time</em></strong>?<br />
				focuses on <strong>when</strong> she arrived but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did </em> <strong><em>she</em></strong><em> arrive on time?</em><br />
				focuses on <strong>who</strong> arrived and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she </em> <strong><em>arrive</em></strong><em> on time?</em><br />
				focuses on <strong>what</strong> she did.</dd>

			<p>The meaning of yes / no questions depends to an extent on the

			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Neutral orientation</strong></dt>
				<dd>When the speaker has no pre-determined orientation, the
				<span class="style_red"><strong>non-assertive forms</strong></span> 
				are used:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wants some help → Does she want </em>
				<span class="style_red"><strong><em>any </em></strong></span><em>help?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is already here → Is she here </em>

				<em><strong>
				anything</strong></em> </span><em>the matter?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp; He has a house somewhere else → Does he have a house
				</em>
				<span class="style_red"><em><strong>anywhere</strong></em> </span><em>else?</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Positive orientation</strong></dt>
				<dd>When the speaker has a pre-determined bias concerning the 
				truth of a proposition, however, <span class="style_black">
				<strong>assertive forms</strong></span> are used 
				because the speaker is expecting a positive answer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want some help → Do you want
				</em>
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>some</em></strong></span><em> help?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has already left → Has she left </em> <span class="style_black">
				<strong><em>already</em></strong></span>?<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's something the matter → Is there
				</em>
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>something</em></strong></span><em> the 
				matter?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has a house somewhere else → Does he have a house
				</em>
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>somewhere</em></strong></span><em> 
				else?</em><br />
				Positive orientation also explains the use of assertive 
				forms in questions that are really offers such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like <span class="style_black">
				<strong>some</strong></span> coffee?</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Negative orientation</strong></dt>
				<dd>When the speaker expects a negative outcome, the situation 
				gets more complicated.<br />
				The primary way negative orientation is signalled is through 
				negative questions:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody came →
				</em>
				<span class="style_underline"><em>Didn't</em></span><em> anybody come?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't speak French → </em> <span class="style_underline">
				<em>Can't</em></span><em> 
				you speak French?</em><br />
				Unfortunately, negative questions can also signal positive 
				meanings because they imply that the speaker is surprised by the 
				truth of a proposition, having assumed the contrary, so, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_underline"><em>Can't</em></span><em> 
				you give me any help, at all?</em><br />
				implies that <em>I thought you could</em>.<br />
				It is possible, too, to use assertive forms with negatively 
				oriented questions although slightly rare so we allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Couldn't you give her some help?</em><br />
				which may imply that the speaker is making a request rather 
				than asking a question.<br />
				Negative questions are also used to express irritation because 
				they imply a frustrated positive assumption, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They promised to deliver it in three days.&nbsp;
				<span class="style_underline">Isn't</span> it here yet?</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p><strong>Alternative word ordering in negative questions</strong></p>
			<p>All the yes / no negative question forms above have an 
			alternative word ordering which is both more emphatic and more 
			formal.<br />
			It consists of removing the <em>n't</em> construction and placing
			<em>not</em> immediately after the main verb as in, for example:<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ought you not to go to school?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she not turn you down?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were they not told about the dangers?</em><br />
			and all these forms imply strongly that the speaker is orientated 
			positively or negatively depending on the sense so the answers that 
			are expected are, respectively:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I should<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, she did<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No they weren't</em></p>

			<p>
			Fundamentally, tag questions are formed in two ways:</p>
			<h4>
			Balanced tags<br />
			<img alt="unbalanced" height="133" src="../../images/balance_necklace200.jpg" width="200" /></h4>
			<p>
			For example (<span class="style_black">tags <strong>in black</strong></span>):</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>You've finished, </em> <span class="style_black"><em>
				<strong>haven't you</strong></em></span><em>?</em></li>
				<li><em>You haven't finished, </em> <span class="style_black">
				<em><strong>have you</strong></em></span><em>?</em></li>
				<li><em>They have arrived, </em> <span class="style_black"><em>
				<strong>haven't they</strong></em></span><em>?</em></li>
				<li><em>He hates it, </em> <span class="style_black"><em>
				<strong>doesn't he</strong></em></span><em>?</em></li>
				<li><em>He doesn't like it, </em> <span class="style_black"><em>
				<strong>does he</strong></em></span><em>?</em></li>
				</ul>
			<p>In balanced tags:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Negative sentences take a positive tag and vice versa:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't understand, 
				</em> 
				<span class="style_black"><em>does she</em></span>? (negative + positive)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary can come too, 
				</em> 
				<span class="style_black"><em>can't she</em></span>? (positive + negative))</li>
				<li><strong>With main or lexical verbs in present and past 
				simple tenses </strong>such as <em>like, 
				hated, enjoy, do, arrived</em> etc., we use the auxiliary verb <em>do</em> 
				in the tag as the operator:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't go, did he?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She smokes too much, doesn't she?</em></li>
				<li><strong>With central or pure modal auxiliary verbs</strong> like <em>can, must, could</em> etc., we 
				simply invert the verb and the subject to make a tag:<br />
				&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They couldn't see her, could they?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The play should be popular, shouldn't it?</em></li>
				<li><strong>With the verb <em>be</em></strong>, 
				whether it is an auxiliary or a copular verb, we simply invert the 
				order of subject and verb to make the tag:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are John, aren't you?</em> (as a main identifying verb)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You aren't alone, are you? </em>(as a main verb with an 
				adjective complement)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are working too hard, aren't you?</em> (as an auxiliary 
				forming the progressive)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was arrested, wasn't she? </em>(as an 
				auxiliary forming a passive voice sentence)</li>
				<li><strong>With the verb <em>have</em></strong> 
				the situation is slightly more complicated:<ul class="smallbluebullet">
					<li>When it is an auxiliary forming a tense, we treat it like 
					<em>be</em>, inverting the subject and the verb:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has arrived, hasn't she?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She had left already, hadn't she?</em></li>
					<li>When it functions as a main verb, meaning something like 
					<em>possess</em>, both forms are possible:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have a lot of money, don't they?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They have a lot of money, haven't they?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They don't have much money, do they?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They haven't much money, have they?</em><br />But, when we insert 
					<em>got</em> after the verb, only the 
				inverted form is possible:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We haven't got a lot of time, have we?</em><strong><br />not</strong><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We haven't got a lot of time, do we?</em><br />American and British usage differs in some respects here 
				because AmE uses <em>got</em> less frequently in this sense as 
				we saw.</li>
					<li>When it functions as a main verb with a different 
					meaning (such as <em>take</em> or <em>eat</em>) the <em>do</em> 
					operator is used when the tense requires it and inversion is 
					not allowed so we get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="smallredbullet">She had a shower, didn't 
					she?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have only coffee for breakfast, don't they?</span></em><span class="smallredbullet"><br />
					not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span class="smallredbullet">*She had a shower, 
					hadn't she?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They have only coffee for breakfast, haven't they?</span></em><br />
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Unbalanced tags<br />
			<img alt="unbalanced" height="133" src="../../images/man_falling200.jpg" width="200" /></h4>
			<p>Unbalanced tags involve positive + positive or negative + negative and have 
			number of uses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Inference:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				So, the car's over the road, is it?</em><br />
				i.e., I have figured this out from where we are walking</li>
				<li>Sarcasm, suspicion or irony:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				So you think you know me, 
				do you?</em><br />
				i.e., you are presuming too much or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you 
				don't believe me, don't you?</em><br />
				i.e., it's not your place to make judgements</li>
				<li>Threat:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
				You'd take my money, would you?</em></li>
				<li>Conclusion:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, he likes the book, does he?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;
				So, he 
				hasn't had the time, hasn't he?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style42">
					<h3>Intonation, Pronunciation and Meaning in tag questions</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<h4>Meaning is closely tied to intonation.</h4>
			<p>Balanced tags exhibit two tones:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In many cases, the tone of voice falls on the tag, like this:</li>
			</ol>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="tag example" height="63" src="../../imagesgraphics/tageg2.png" width="200" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="tag example" height="68" src="../../imagesgraphics/tageg1.png" width="179" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>When the voice falls like this, the tag functions to mean 
			something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Please say you agree with me.</em><br />
			In 
			other words, it asks for confirmation that the speaker is correct; 
			it signals a positive orientation.&nbsp; 
			Notice that the words <em>lovely</em> and <em>late</em> are also 
			stressed here.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">When the tone rises, like this:</li>
			</ol>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="tag example" height="65" src="../../imagesgraphics/tageg4.png" width="200" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="tag example" height="63" src="../../imagesgraphics/tageg3.png" width="180" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>then the sentences function as true interrogatives.&nbsp; Notice 
			that now we stress the verb because that is the focus of our 
			attention.</p>
			<p><strong>In all <span class="style_underline">unbalanced</span> tag questions, the tone rises on the 
			verb in the tag and falls on the pronoun, like this:<br />
			<img alt="unbalanced" height="48" src="../../imagesgraphics/unbalanced_tag_intonation.png" width="250" /></strong></p>
			<p>An exception is declarative questions with tags and we'll come 
			to that shortly.</p>
			<h4>Meaning depends on speaker intention and orientation</h4>
			<p>The communicative function of the sentence is drawn from the 
			first clause.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You want a drink, don't you?</em><br />
			where the speaker is probably sure the answer will be 'yes' 
			with:<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't want a drink, do you?</em><br />
			where a falling tone would imply the speaker expects a negative 
			response but a rising tone would indicate surprise.<br />
			The same thing happens with modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You couldn't do it for me, could you?</em><br />
			where a rising tone indicates a request, with:<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You could do it for me, couldn't you?</em><br />
			where a rising tone indicates a request but a falling tone indicates 
			almost a command.</p>
			<h4>Pronunciation is a small issue</h4>
			<p>It is rare for weak forms of vowels to occur in tags.&nbsp; For 
			example, the 
				verb <em>can</em> is usually contracted to /kən/ in connected 
				speech but in the tag, it retains its full pronunciation as /kæn/.&nbsp; 
				E.g.:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> I can come, can't I?</em> is usually transcribed as /ˈaɪ kən 
				kʌm ˈkɑːnt aɪ/ but<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> I can't come, can I?</em> is usually /ˈaɪ kɑːnt kʌmm ˈkænnaɪ/</p>
			<h4>Assertive and non-assertive use</h4>
			<p>If a positive response is expected, assertive forms will be used:<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You need <span class="style_black"><strong>
			some</strong></span> more time, don't you?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You need </em><span class="style_black">
			<strong><em>something</em></strong></span><em> to eat, don't you?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have finished </em> <span class="style_black"><strong>
			<em>already</em></strong></span><em>, 
			haven't you?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They aren't </em> <span class="style_black"><strong><em>still</em></strong></span><em> 
			here, are they?</em><br />
			If a negative response is expected, non-assertive forms will 
			dominate:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't need </em> <span class="style_red">
			<strong><em>any</em></strong></span><em> more time, do you?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You haven't finished </em> <span class="style_red"><strong>
			<em>yet</em></strong></span><em>, have you?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have </em> <span class="style_red"><strong><em>no</em></strong></span><em> 
			money, have they?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They aren't here </em> <span class="style_red"><strong>
			<em>any longer,</em></strong></span><em> are they?</em></p>
			<h4>Transferred negation</h4>
			<p>A peculiarity of English is the transfer of negation and the 
			forms of tags which arise from it.<br />
			For example, the statement:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think he'll arrive<br />
			</em>has the tag<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... will he?<br />
			</em>rather than the expected:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... do I?<br />
			</em>because the negation has been transferred from the subordinate 
			clause (<em>he'll arrive</em>), where it logically belongs, to the 
			main clause.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You think he won't come, don't you?</em><br />
			For more on this, see the guide to negation linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>

					<h3>A note on other languages</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>A few languages work like English with tags following grammatical 
			rules for forming questions and negatives but many do not.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			Many languages, including Polish, German, Greek and others 
			can use a phrase or a single word meaning, roughly, <em>True? </em>or
			<em>Not 
			true?</em>&nbsp; So, e.g.:<br />
			German: <em>nicht wahr? </em>[not true?], Spanish: <em>¿verdad?</em> [true?], 
			Polish: <em>prawda?</em> [true?] or <em>nieprawdaż?</em> [not true?], Greek:
			<em>δεν είναι ετσι; (then eenay etsi?)</em> [is it not 
			so?] and so on.<br />
			Some languages have a small range of words or phrases to ask for 
			agreement such as French: <em>n'est ce pas?</em> [isn't it] 
			or <em>d'accord?</em> [agree?] or even, simply, <em>non?</em> [no] 
			appended to the declarative clause.<br />
			In many languages there exists a small word used only for tag 
			questions such as Mandarin (<em>ma?</em>), German dialects (<em>gell?</em>) 
			Portuguese: (<em>né?</em>) and so on.</p>
			<p>In most languages, the forms have become fossilised and do not 
			vary in the complicated ways that the tags vary in English.&nbsp; 
			This presents obvious problems for learners.</p>

					<h2><a name="alternative"></a>Alternative questions</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Alternative questions are sometimes seen as a subset of yes / no 
			questions because they have similar forms and similar issues 
			concerning the questioner's orientation and communicative intention.<br />
			There are two sorts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Resembling yes / no questions:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like tea or coffee?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you stay late or do you have to go?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want a biscuit, some cake or a bit of chocolate?</em></li>
				<li>Compound questions which begin with a <em>wh</em>-question 
				and then offer the alternatives:<br />
				&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Which do you want?&nbsp; Cake or biscuits?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did he go?&nbsp; London or Manchester?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Intonation is crucial</p>
			<p>We saw above that on yes / no questions, the general way 
			intonation works is either as a rise at the end of the question or a 
			fall-rise towards the end.&nbsp; Not so with alternative questions 
			in which the intonation rises after each member of the list, like 
			this:<br />
			<img alt="alternative intonation" height="66" src="../../imagesgraphics/alternative_q_intonation.png" width="310" /><br />
			Using the wrong intonation can cause communicative failure because, 
			if the questioner's voice rises only on the final element, the 
			hearer will assume it is a yes / no question.&nbsp; Consider these 
			two dialogues:<br />
			An alternative question:<br />
			<img alt="alternative" height="59" src="../../imagesgraphics/alternative_q_intonation2.png" width="200" /></p>
			<p>To which the expected answer is one or the other<br />
			A yes / no question:<br />
			<img alt="yes no" height="65" src="../../imagesgraphics/yes_no_intonation2.png" width="200" /></p>
			<p>To which the answer may be <em>Yes, please</em> or <em>No, thank 
			you</em> (or<em> I'd rather have a beer</em>).</p>
			<p>It is possible to convert any yes / no question into an 
			alternative question by adding <em>or not</em> with rising 
			intonation after the central question so<br />
			<img alt="yes no" height="57" src="../../imagesgraphics/yes_no_intonation3.png" width="200" /><br />
			can be converted into:<br />
			<img alt="alternative or not" height="49" src="../../imagesgraphics/alternative_intonation3.png" width="200" /></p>

			We will consider them in isolation and talk about what else they do

			have the general meaning of<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know what this refers to so

			This is why <em>wh-</em>questions are frequently referred to as 
			content questions because the answer is expected to supply the 
			missing content.</p>
			<p>We can elicit a range of information using these nine words.</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>manner:<br />
				<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; How did she do that?</em></li>
				<li>origin:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did you find out?</em></li>
				<li>subject noun phrase:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who said that?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				What went wrong?</em></li>
				<li>object nouns and clauses:<br />
				<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; What did she say?<br />
				&nbsp; &nbsp;
				Which do you want?</em></li>
				<li>location:<br />
				<em>&nbsp; &nbsp;
				Where did they go?</em></li>
				<li>time:<br />
				<em>&nbsp; &nbsp;
				When did they go?</em></li>
				<li>reason:<br />
				<em>&nbsp; &nbsp;
				Why was she crying?</em></li>
				<li>purpose:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you give me that?</em></li>
				<li>possession, relationship, attribute or source:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose is it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose sister is she?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose policy is that?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose letter upset you?</em></li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li><em>How</em> questions are normally answered by using a 
				whole sentence.&nbsp; An example might be<br />
				&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_blue"><em>How did you know?</em></span><br /><em>&nbsp;<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Mary told me</span></em><br />
				It is unlikely that an answer would be<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<span class="style_black"><em>Immediately</em></span><br />
				but that is possible.&nbsp; Adverbs are sometimes what the 
				question is getting at as in e.g.,<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue"><em>How was he driving?</em></span><br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<em>Very carefully</em></span><br />
				but that is a fairly rare event.<br />
				The issue is that the simple word <em>how</em> is polysemous: it 
				means <em>in what way</em> and it means <em>from what origin</em> 
				depending on the context and the speaker's intention.</li>
				<li><em>What</em> questions are almost always directed at 
				non-human nouns or noun phrases so an answer to the question 
				might be something like<br />
				&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_blue"><em>What was she wearing?</em></span><br /><em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeans and a T-shirt</span></em><br />
				<em>What</em> questions rarely refer to humans and we prefer<br />
				&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_blue"><em>Which person did you ask?</em></span><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who(m) did you ask?</em><br />
				over<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_blue"><em>What person did you ask?</em></span></li>
				<li><em>Where</em> questions are used to elicit spatial 
				information.&nbsp; The answer will normally be a place adverbial, an 
				adverb or a 
				prepositional phrase, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_blue"><em>Where did they go?</em></span><br /><em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To London<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; London<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Home</span></em></li>
				<li><em>When</em> questions usually elicit a time, a 
				prepositional phrase adverbial or a subordinate clause so possible answers are<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W</em><span class="style_blue"><em>hen did they go?</em></span><br /><em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 6<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				When everyone had finished</span></em></li>
				<li><em>Why</em> questions are also normally answered with whole 
				sentences (sometimes much more) or clauses beginning with a word 
				like <em>because</em> such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_blue"><em>Why was she crying?</em></span><br /><em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it was so sad<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Because he'd been so rude</span></em><br />
				We can omit <em>because</em> although it is implied as in, e.g.:<br />
				<span class="style_black">
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car had broken down again</em></span><br />
				These questions also frequently elicit a clause beginning 
				with a <em>to-</em>infinitive<em>, in order to</em> and <em>so that</em>:<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make him feel guilty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to make him feel guilty<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that we'd take pity on her</span></em><br />  
				The word <em>why</em> is also polysemous.&nbsp;  We need to be slightly careful to distinguish between 
				the <strong>reasons</strong> something happens and the <strong>
				purposes</strong> of someone's actions.&nbsp; For example,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does iron sink in water?</em><br />
				means:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How come iron sinks in water?</em><br />
				and requires an understanding of the properties of <em>iron</em> and 
				<em>water</em> such as:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it is 
				denser than water due to its crystalline nature</em></span><br />
				On the other hand:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you put it in the water?</em><br />
				means:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did you put it in the water for?</em><br />
				and that requires the responder to discuss purposes, not 
				reasons, such as:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I 
				wanted to soak off the dirt</em></span><br />
				This is a slightly subtle point to do with the polysemous nature 
				of the word <em>why</em> but it is important when one is framing 
				questions in the classroom, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do we need a preposition here?</em><br />
				refers to the <strong>reason</strong> for the item, but:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do w<span class="auto-style48">e</span> 
				use </em>for<em> and not </em>to<em> in this sentence?<br />
				</em>refers to the <strong>purpose</strong> of the preposition.</li>
				<li><em>Who</em> questions traditionally refer to people as the subject 
				of the verb but also, frequently, to the object.&nbsp; They always 
				refer to people, never inanimate objects and rarely non-humans.&nbsp; 
				They elicit noun phrases.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W</em><span class="style_blue"><em>ho told you?</em></span><br /><em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man in the shop<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Those people</span></em></li>
				<li><em>Whom</em> questions can <strong>only</strong> be 
				reference to human objects of the verb.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_blue"><em>Whom did you tell?</em></span><br /><em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The man in the shop<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Those people</span></em><br />
				In colloquial English <em>whom</em> is frequently 
				replaced by <em>who</em> so the question could easily have been<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who did you tell?</em><br />
				but it still refers to the object, not the subject of the 
				verb.</li>
				<li><em>Which</em> questions imply a choice from a limited 
				number of options that the questioner is aware of.&nbsp; They 
				can apply to people and to non-animate items as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which shirt do you want?<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blue one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That one</span></em><br />
				but if they are 
				used to refer to people, they <span class="style_underline">must</span> be accompanied by a noun such 
				as <em>girl, boy, man, person, customer</em> etc., all of which 
				refer to classes of people.&nbsp; The question cannot be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_blue"><em>*Which did you tell?</em></span><br />
				but could be<br />
				&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_blue"><em>Which police officer did you tell?</em></span><br />
				<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tall one<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Him<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				That one</span></em></li>
				<li><em>Whose</em> questions refer to people and very rarely to 
				animals or inanimate objects.&nbsp; Possible answers will 
				include the possessive <em>'s </em>marker or involve the use of 
				a possessive determiner or pronoun:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> <span class="style_blue"><em>Whose is that hat?</em></span><br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="style_black"> John's<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Your mother's<br />

				</em><span class="auto-style48"> Questions with <em>w</em></span><em>hose</em>, 
				although they refer to the genitive case, cannot be answered 
				with the <em>of</em>-formulation.&nbsp; For example, although we

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the government's policy<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the policy of the government<br />
				</em>the question:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose policy is it?<br />
				</em>can elicit:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government's<br />

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It got very windy yesterday</em><br />

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What got very windy yesterday?</em><br />
				is meaningless because the answer would be <em>it</em>.<br />
				However, the dummy subject or existential <em>there</em> can be 
				the focus of the question:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a shed at the end of the garden<br />
				</em>can be elicited with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is at the end of the garden?</em></li>

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John appeared tired<br />

				*What was she?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*What did they grow?</em><br />
				are not possible without altering the meaning in the last case

				(However, the word <em>how</em> can elicit an adjective subject

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How was she?<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked better</span></em>)</li>
				<li>We cannot ask about the verb.&nbsp; We can say<br />

			<p> Unlike yes / no questions, the intonation in most <em>wh</em>-questions 
			falls towards the end of the unit instead of rising.&nbsp; Compare 
			these two questions and say them aloud:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>What time is the meeting?</em></li>
				<li><em>Are you coming to the meeting?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Question intonation on questions 
			formed with <em>wh</em>-words like:<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; What time is the meeting?</em><br />
			generally falls, but on a yes/no question such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Are you coming to the meeting?</em><br />
			it tends to rise.&nbsp; The effect can be represented like 
			this:<br />
			<img alt="question intonation" src="../../imagesgraphics/meeting_intonation.png" /></p>
			<p> This is not an absolute rule &ndash; very little of intonation 
			contains such things &ndash; but it is a clear tendency.&nbsp; Many 
			languages rely solely on intonation to make questions from 
			statements and the usual form is to have rising intonation so 
			speakers of these languages will be tempted to transfer the pattern 
			to <em>wh</em>-questions and sound unnaturally insistent.<br />
			They may also naturally transfer what they have learned about 
			intonation in yes / no questions and sound quite rude.<br />
			This is an area that needs to be taught because many learners will 
			assume that intonation always rises on questions and are in danger 
			of sounding rude and demanding if they do this with <em>wh</em>-questions.</p>

			<h4>how</h4>
			<p>Most <em>wh</em>-words 
			have a straightforward meaning.&nbsp; The word <em>how </em>is 
			somewhat different because it operates with a range of adverbials 
			and can elicit:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>duration:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; How long have you been waiting?</em></li>
				<li>frequency<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; How often does she do that?</em></li>
				<li>degree<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much does he want the job?</em></li>
				<li>distance <strong>or </strong>duration:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long is the journey?</em></li>
				<li>personal feeling:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are you?</em></li>
				<li>quality:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How was the trip?</em></li>
				<li>extent:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How interesting did you find it?</em></li>
				<li>quantity:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many do we need?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The issue here is the word is followed by a range of other 
			items (quantifiers, adverbs, adjectives etc.) and its meaning alters 
			considerably.&nbsp; Other languages do not have such a common 
			multiword so the area needs handling carefully.&nbsp; Learners can 
			easily become confused.</p>
			<h4>what</h4>
			<p>The word <em>what</em> also exhibits multiple meanings but to a 
			lesser extent.&nbsp; We can have, for example:<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; What did you tell her?</em><br />
			which refers to a nominalised clause and elicits answers such as:<br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;</span><em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp; That I was coming later</span><br />
			</em>or we can ask:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			What can I help you with?</em><br />
			which refers to a clause or noun phrase and elicits answers such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting this PC to work properly</span></em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; This blessed computer program</em></span><br />
			We can also ask:<br />
			&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
			What flight are you on?</em><br />
			which elicits a noun phrase such as:<br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; BA507</em></span><br />
			This word also allows a rare negative question use as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What didn't they do?</em><br />
			which presupposes that they neglected to do something.&nbsp; Most 
			other <em>wh</em>-words do not allow this use although <em>why</em> 
			does (see next).<br />
			(It may also suggest that they did a very large number of things and 
			the statement (as it becomes) tells the listener that the speaker 
			can think of nothing that was omitted.)</p>
			<h4>why</h4>
			<p>This is the only one in the series of nine words which routinely allows a 
			negative question.&nbsp; This is because we can pre-suppose the fact 
			that something was not done.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why didn't she come?</em><br />
			presupposes the fact that she was absent.<br />
			With other <em>wh</em>-words, that sort of presupposition is 
			not usually possible in the negative.&nbsp; We can, as we just saw 
			have something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What didn't you ask?</em><br />
			presupposing that something was not asked.<br />
			But we cannot have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Where didn't she come?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *When didn't they go?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *How didn't she drive?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *How didn't she hear?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Whose isn't that?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Whom didn't you meet?</em><br />
			because such questions pre-suppose that she didn't come somewhere, 
			they didn't go at some time, she didn't drive in a certain manner, 
			she didn't hear in some way, something belongs to nobody and 
			somebody was not met all of which are 
			vanishingly rare things to imagine.<br />
			A marginal case is <em>which</em> as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which didn't you want?</em><br />
			and that presupposes that something was rejected.</p>

			<p>Formality in English requires the <em>wh</em>-word to be

			<p>That's the general rule but the longer the clause 
			between the <em>wh</em>-word and the preposition, the more difficult 
			it gets to construct an informal sentence.&nbsp; Would you accept, 
			e.g.,<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>What did you use to get the awful mess out of the pipe and clear 
			away all the dirty water from the sink with?</em><br />
			or<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>What time are you going to ask them all and their friends from 
			Holland to meet us under the pier at?<br />
			</em>(We can also construct the awful child's question:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Daddy, what did you bring that book that I didn't want to 
			be read to out of up for?</em>)</p>

			<p>The most frequent way to emphasise <em>wh</em>-questions is the

			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li class="greybullet"><em>Who ever did that?</em></li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>How ever did you manage it?</em></li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>Which ever did you choose?</em></li>

				<li class="greybullet"><em>Why ever were you late?</em></li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>Whose ever car was that?</em></li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>When ever are you going to 
				finish?</em></li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>What ever did she mean?</em></li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>Where ever can she be?</em></li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>Whom ever did you tell?</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some things to note:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>There are other popular emphasisers such as <em>the hell, in 
				heaven's name, on earth </em>etc.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who in heaven's name is that?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What on earth have you done?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the hell are you going to pay?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				One taboo word is also used as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the fuck do you want?</em></li>
				<li>The <em>ever</em> expressions are normally written as two words to distinguish their 
				function.&nbsp; When they are written as one word, they usually 
				function as adverbs to 
				mean <em>It doesn't matter who/what/when/how/which</em> etc.&nbsp; 
				For example<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Whoever comes late must sit over there<br />
				</em>is not emphatic.&nbsp; It means <em>anyone who comes late</em>.<br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				<em>when</em> does.&nbsp; The same applies to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can sit

				<li>The emphatic <em>why ever </em>only occurs as two words in 
				English.</li>

			<p>This is the final and simplest form of question-making in 
			English.&nbsp; Because it is so simple, learners are tempted to 
			overuse it.&nbsp; Many languages make questions routinely this way by 
			simply varying the intonation on a declarative sentence to make it 
			interrogative (and in some languages, such as Greek, it is the sole 
			way to make yes/no questions).&nbsp; English can do it but it is unusual, 
			and almost never occurs in formal writing.<br />
			In speech, declarative questions often express surprise or shock.&nbsp; 
			In writing, they are, informally, signalled by exclamation and 
			question marks together.</p>
			<p>Declarative questions are in the same form as statements but the 
			intonation is that of a question:<br />
			Statement:<br />
			<img alt="statement" height="73" src="../../imagesgraphics/statement_intonation.png" width="200" /></p>
			<p>Declarative question:<br />
			<img alt="declarative" height="74" src="../../imagesgraphics/declarative_question_intonation.png" width="200" /></p>
			<p>Considerations apply here concerning assertive and non-assertive 
			forms and the orientation of the questioner.&nbsp; That orientation 
			can be positive:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You have had someone to help you?</em><br />
			or negative:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You have had no one to help you?</em><br />
			Non-assertive forms are not possible with declarative questions so, 
			e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *You have had anyone to help you?</em><br />
			is not possible.<br />
			Positively orientated declarative questions are often suffixed with 
			expressions such as <em>I suppose, I imagine, obviously, I take it, 
			I assume</em> etc. as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You asked Mary, I take it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's broken, I assume?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You paid, obviously?<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<p>It is possible to insert a tag at the end of declarative 
			questions as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You've been to The British Museum, have you?</em><br />
			but in this case the tag intonation resembles that of a normally 
			balanced tag and not the unbalanced rise-fall illustrated above 
			because no criticism is intended.</p>

					<h3>Casual declarative questions</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>A casual form of declarative questions is seen in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Want to go out?</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had lunch?</em><br />
			in which the operator or primary auxiliary and the subject pronoun 
			are ellipted.<br />
			There are some restrictions, however:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>In the simple present tense, this will only work for verbs 
				used statively (i.e., in a continuous aspect but with a simple 
				form of the verb) and <em>want</em> is the most common example.&nbsp; 
				Other verbs will work in this way such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like to see the clowns?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a minute to spare?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear that?<br />
				</em>and so on.</li>
				<li>With a prospective aspect, an adverbial needs to be inserted 
				so parallel forms would be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like to see the clowns tomorrow?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a minute to spare later?</em></li>
				<li>With verbs used dynamically, in present tense forms, or with 
				reference to the future this won't work because the construction 
				then becomes an imperative as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get on the bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass the salt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain the problem</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the bus tomorrow</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass the exam</em><br />
				etc., none of which is interrogative and have to be rephrased as 
				proper interrogatives as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall we get on the bus?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you pass the salt?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you explain the problem?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you take the bus tomorrow?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think you're going to pass the exam?</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>The use does, however, work for past simple forms because 
				the context usually makes it clear that no imperative is 
				intended so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoy the film?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dance a lot?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the bus?</em><br />
				etc. may all be curtailed forms of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you enjoy the film?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you dance a lot?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you take the bus</em><br />
				providing the time reference is clear from context and co-text.</li>
				<li>Dynamic uses are allowed in present perfect forms 
				because they cannot be misinterpreted as imperatives so we find:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Done the washing up?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Been to London?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spoken to Mary?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sold the car yet?</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Seen the news?</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>And they are allowed in progressive forms with present or 
				prospective meanings because, again, no ambiguity is risked so 
				we also encounter:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going to take the train?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoying the party?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing Mary next week?</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>It is marginally possible for such forms to appear as past 
				progressive structures as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cycling to work at the time?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking the train in those days?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Living abroad last year?</em><br />
				but these are rare and always require a time adverbial to make 
				the sense (and the tense) clear.&nbsp; They may alternatively be 
				followed by tags such as <em>were you?, was she?, were they?
				</em>etc. to show the tense.</li>

			<p>Embedded questions are sometimes called indirect questions and 
			the term indirect implies the extra level of politeness which 
			attaches to the form.&nbsp; Structurally, embedding also implies how 
			the questions are formed.<br />
			That is done depending on the type of question we wish to embed.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong><em>yes-no</em> and alternative questions</strong><br />
				These are formed by inserting a positive <em>if</em> or <em>whether</em> clause after the 
				introductory formula, like this:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is she his mother? → Can you tell me if 
				she is his mother?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you coming to the party? → Could you tell me whether you 
				are coming to the party?</em></li>
				<li><strong><em>wh</em>-questions</strong><br />
				These are formed by inserting a positive <em>wh</em>-clause 
				after the introductory formula, like this:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the train &rarr; Can you tell me 
				where the train is?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is that man? → Do you know who that man is?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The most common (and most commonly taught) introductory formulae 
			are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you tell me ...<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me ...<br />
			</em>but a range of other possibilities is available, including:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you tell me + wh- 
					/ if / whether…?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Do you know + wh- / if / whether…?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Do you have any idea + wh- / if / whether …?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Would it be possible to tell me + wh- / if / 
					whether…?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Is there any chance you can tell me + wh- / if / 
					whether…?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Would you be kind enough to tell me + wh- / if / 
					whether...?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Will he tell me + wh- / if / 
					whether...?</em></p>
			<p>The intonation on embedded questions, when the effort is being 
			made to be polite, generally rises along the whole of the utterance.</p>
			<p>Embedded questions are parallelled in three other functions in English:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Polite requests<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please let me know whether you will be 
				able to come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do tell me if you can be there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell me where I should leave my luggage</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				And, again, there are a number of clichéd phrases which can be 
				used, including:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if you can tell me ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I was wondering …<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I’d like to know …</em></li>
				<li>Reported questions:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the bank? → She asked me where 
				the bank is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you going to talk to the boss? → He asked me whether I 
				was going to talk to the boss</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Imperatives:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get him to tell you when it will arrive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell me where to leave the luggage<br />
				</em>etc<em>.</em></li>
			</ol>

			<p>Forming interrogatives in English is not, as we have seen, 
			particularly simple.&nbsp; To help people, it is useful to know how 
			our learners' first languages form questions because that allows us 
			to plan how to teach the area and predict or pre-empt obvious 
			difficulties caused by language interference.</p>
			<p>Most languages have words for universal concepts like <em>what, 
			when, how, who</em> etc. but such words do not always come at the 
			beginning of the clause so, for example, Turkish forms:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The bank where?</em><br />
			instead of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Where is the bank?</em></p>
			<p>As we saw above, many languages have more-or-less fixed question 
			tags forms, too, relying on a single structure or word to make all 
			tag questions regardless of their content.</p>
			<p>Forming yes/no questions is also quite variable across languages.<br />
			There are three main ways to form these sorts of questions and some 
			languages employ more than one so appear more than once in the lists 
			here:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Inversion of verb and subject</strong></dt>
				<dd>Just as English inverts the auxiliary verb and the subject 
				noun phrase to make, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Can he come?</em><br />
				from<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He can come</em><br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Has she seen the film?</em><br />
				from<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has seen the film</em><br />
				many other languages do this routinely with lexical or main verbs, too, 
				rather than confining the inversion to auxiliary verbs so, for 
				example, from<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He arrives soon</em><br />
				the question is formed as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Arrives he soon?</em><br />
				Languages which do this include<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Danish<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Dutch<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				French (but also with an unusual pre-modifier, <em>est-ce que</em> 
				which translates as <em>is it that</em> and may be preceded by a
				<em>wh-word</em>)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				German<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Norwegian<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Romanian<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Swedish<br />
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Intonation change only</strong></dt>
				<dd>We saw above that English can form declarative questions by leaving 
			the ordering of the elements of a clause alone and marking the 
			question by rising intonation so we have, for example:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You saw Mary?</em><br />
			instead of<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Did you see Mary?</em><br />
			A range of important languages use intonation as the only way to 
			form questions and some also use intonation routinely instead of 
			inverting the subject and verb or using any other form of question 
				marker.&nbsp; They include:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arabic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chinese languages<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Czech<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Persian languages (Farsi Dari, Tajik)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; French<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greek<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italian<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Korean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Polish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Portuguese<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romanian<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russian</dd>
				<dt><strong>Affixation or particle insertion</strong></dt>
				<dd>English does not have a single interrogative particle or 
				affix but many languages leave the word order of a declarative 
				clause unchanged and insert a question marker either as a suffix 
				on the verb or as a particle usually in the clause final 
				position.<br />
				These languages include:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farsi (a clause final particle <em>aya</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finnish (which inserts the interrogative morpheme <em>ko</em> 
				after the verb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Japanese (a clause final particle <em>ka</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Korean (a clause final particle <em>aya, eyo</em> or <em>iyo</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thai (a clause final particle <em>mai</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turkish (a clause final particle <em>mi</em>)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Embedded questions</strong></dt>
				<dd>Many languages, such as Spanish, German and other Germanic 
			languages, do as English does and embed the question in a clause so 
			that there is no doubling of the question word order.&nbsp; In 
			English, and a range of other languages, we cannot have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Do you know what time does the train leave?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I was wondering can you help?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I want to know can she be here<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*Can you tell me if is she coming?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*Could you explain what is he doing?</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			However, even more languages <strong>do</strong> allow this kind of word order and 
			mistakes are frequently made.&nbsp; In French, for example, the 
			direct question form is similar to English so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the metro station? = Où est la station de métro ?</em><br />
			but the indirect question retains the question form:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know where the metro station is? = Est-ce que vous savez 
			/ Savez-vous où 
			est la station de métro ?<br />
			</em>more or less literally:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you 
			know where is the metro 
			station?</em></dd>
			</dl>
