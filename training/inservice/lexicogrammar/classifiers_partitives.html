				<li>Partitive noun <em>vs</em>. collective noun.<br />
				The names give the clue:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>a partitive noun refers to a part of something greater 
					so, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bar of chocolate</em><br />
					is a smaller portion of a greater item (an identifiable 
					amount of all the chocolate in the known (and unknown) 
					universe)</li>
					<li>a collective noun refers to a larger unit made of smaller parts (it is the reverse of a partitive).&nbsp; For 
					example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an army</em><br />
					refers to a unit larger than the individuals (<em>soldiers</em>, 
					usually but sometimes <em>ants</em>) making it up.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Collective noun <em>vs</em>. assemblage noun.<br />
				Both types of noun refer to the larger unit made of smaller 
				amounts rather than the other way around.&nbsp; However:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>Collective nouns usually contain semantically the units 
					of which they are made up so we do not need to say what the 
					unit is.&nbsp; We do not find, therefore:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an army of soldiers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a jury of people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bench of judges</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a library of books</em><br />
					etc. because it is tautologous to add the smaller units.&nbsp; 
					We know what makes up <em>an army, a jury, a bench</em> or
					<em>a library</em>.<br />
					If we use a collective noun metaphorically, it often takes 
					on the characteristics of an assemblage noun as in, for 
					example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an army of schoolgirls<br />
					</em>and we need the unit because it is not what we are 
					expecting.</li>
					<li>Assemblage nouns are a subset of collective nouns and usually 
					<strong>do</strong> need the units to be 
					specified (or understood from context and co-text) so we do 
					not usually find<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at that herd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack is over there</em><br />
					unless we are quite clear that we know what the <em>herd</em> and 
					<em>pack</em> consist of.&nbsp; We would prefer, therefore:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a herd of cows</em> (rather than <em>wildebeests, 
					elephants</em> or <em>zebras</em> etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a pack of dogs</em> (rather than <em>hyenas, jackals, cards

				</li>

			<p>For our purposes, classifiers encompass all three types of noun

			So, when you come across a website that claims that <em>a cup of tea</em> 
			is an example of a collective noun, move on rapidly because whoever 
			wrote it has very little idea how English nouns work.</p>

			<p>In general, European languages do not use classifiers for all 
			nouns but other languages are different.&nbsp; In particular, East 
			Asian languages, including Chinese languages, Japanese, Burmese, 
			Thai and 
			Korean, for example, require a counter or classifier when referring 
			to nouns.&nbsp;
			Japanese is our example here but many other languages have similar 
			systems.<br />
			These classifiers arguably constitute a closed word class in those 
			languages for which there is no equivalent class in English at all.<br />
			Japanese has a very significant number of classifiers 
			(also known as counters) for particular types of noun which must be 
			inserted before the noun:</p>

					shirts</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>and so on for literally hundreds of types of objects including 
			buildings of various sorts, time periods etc.</p>
			<p>In classifying languages such as Japanese and Cantonese, you cannot 
			say, e.g., <em>five biscuits</em> without inserting the appropriate 
			classifying determiner (in this case, the 
			classifier for flat hard objects).&nbsp; Native speakers of 
			classifying languages, incidentally, may argue among themselves 
			concerning which classifier is appropriate to which set of nouns.<br />
			Speakers of these languages are obliged to consider the qualities 
			of whatever they are counting before they can decide on the 
			appropriate determiner.<br />
			Speakers of English do not have to do that but they do have to 
			consider other characteristics, notably whether a noun is a count or 
			mass noun before deciding on an appropriate determiner.&nbsp; Users 
			of other languages get luckier and need to make no such judgements.</p>
			<p>Some languages also change verb structures to include the nature of 
			the thing which is the object of the verb.&nbsp; In English, which 
			does not do this, the verb <em>give</em>, for example, is unchanged 
			whatever the properties of the object being given.&nbsp; Some 
			languages might have as many as six different forms of the verb 
			depending on whether one is giving a mass noun (such as <em>sugar</em>), 
			a stick-like object, a liquid, a shirt or something amorphous such 
			as <em>cotton</em> or <em>fluff</em>.<br />
			English, in common with most European languages, does not do this and 
			that can cause problems for learners from certain language 
			backgrounds (as well, of course, for learners with European language 
			backgrounds trying to acquire languages which use counters).</p>
			<p>Classifiers are particularly important in many African languages.&nbsp; 
			For example, in Zulu, a Bantu language, there are 13 classes of noun 
			signalled by prefixation including humans, proper names and kinship 
			terms, plurals, lengthy items (such as snakes), abstract concepts 
			and so on.<br />
			Swahili, another Bantu language, has no fewer than 22 prefix classes 
			denoting, <em>inter alia</em>, small things, long, thin things, 
			actions, plants and trees, human artefacts, very large things and so 
			on.</p>

			<p>Clearly, English is not so sophisticated but certain classifiers 
			are used (although we don't usually call them by that name; they are 
			generally analysed as <strong>partitives</strong>).&nbsp; There are 
			two types but grammatically and semantically, they differ little.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Mass partitives</strong></dt>
				<dd>A common way 
			to use partitives in English is to make the uncountable countable.&nbsp; 
			What we do is use a specific or general term (the partitive) + <em>of
				</em>+ 
			the mass noun.&nbsp; The partitive can then be made plural.<br />For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An <span class="style_black">item</span> of 
			furniture</em> (a general partitive)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two 
				<span class="style_black">rashers</span> 
			of bacon</em> (a restricted partitive)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Three 
				<span class="style_black">strips</span> of land</em> 
			(a typical partitive)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Some 
				<span class="style_black">heaps</span> of junk</em> 
			(a general partitive)<br />What we call here typical partitives are sometimes referred to as 
				specific partitives because they are specific to the type of nouns they 
			modify.&nbsp; In that way English parallels languages which use 
				counter classifiers because the selection of the correct 
				partitive depends on consideration of the characteristics of the 
				noun in question:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it soft, solid, flat, thin, liquid 
				etc.?</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Count partitives</strong></dt>
				<dd>Count nouns, too, can be used with partitives.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <span class="style_black">pile</span> 
				of books<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <span class="style_black">heap</span> of tables<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
				<span class="style_black">bundle</span> of newspapers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
				<span class="style_black">row</span> of houses</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six <span class="style_black">packets</span> 
				of lentils<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few <span class="style_black">boxes</span> of pencils</em><br />etc.<br />Count partitives are 
				also often restricted in some way semantically, 
				depending on the nature of the objects to which they can be 
				applied.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Partitives are distinguished from other types of classifications 
			because they denote part of a whole or part of a larger number.&nbsp; 
			For example, if we say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass me a slice of that cake</em><br />
			we are referring to part of a cake which is available.<br />
			even when we say<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought the last carton of milk</em><br />
			we are probably not referring to something of which more is 
			immediately available&nbsp; We understand that potentially more is 
			available in the world or the vicinity.&nbsp; It is not necessary 
			for more milk to be physically available at the time of speaking, 
			only that more is <strong>potentially</strong> available.</p>

			<h3>Partitive or quantifier?</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>On this site, quantifiers such as <em>some, any, every, several, 
			a few, little</em> etc. are dealt with in the guide to determiners, 
			linked below.&nbsp; 
			Technically, partitives are different insofar as they denote a 
			specific amount of something distinctive rather than an amount of just anything.<br />
			Another way of expressing that is to think of partitives as semantic 
			categories, dependent on meaning, while quantifiers, because of 
			their particular characteristics in terms of modifying singular, 
			plural and mass nouns fall into grammatical categories.</p>
			<p>There exists, however, in a range of languages not including 
			English, something called a partitive article and that is 
			represented in English by the words <em>some</em> and <em>any</em> 
			which act in an article-like way.<br />
			French and other Romance languages are good examples.&nbsp; In 
			French, for example, we encounter a range including <em>du, de l’ de 
			la, de l’ </em>and<em> des</em> and Italian is just as sophisticated 
			with partitive articles including <em>della, delle, dell', del, dei, 
			degli</em> and <em>dello</em> with complex rules in both languages 
			for their correct use which challenge even native speakers at times.<br />
			English does not have a partitive article system and all those 
			expressions usually translate with the quantifying determiners <em>
			some</em> or <em>any</em>.<br />
			Finnish, incidentally, manages to have a partitive case.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Partitives are sometimes analysed as pre-determiners because they 
			can precede a determiner.&nbsp; They parallel pre-determiners proper.&nbsp; 
			The structure of pre-determiners + determiners is, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did <span class="style_black">half 
			my </span> 
			work for me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ate <span class="style_black">all the</span> cake<br />

			rotten</em><br />

			e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did <span class="style_black">a heap of
			</span>my work for me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ate <span class="style_black">three slices of</span> the

			<h3>Gradability</h3>

			</table>
			<p>Apart from measures such as <em>pint, yard, square mile, pound, 
			millilitre</em> and so on which grade for quantity, English 
			essentially only has three common partitive-<strong><em>like</em></strong> 
			expressions which grade for quality: <em>sort, kind</em> and <em>
			type</em>.<br />
			We have, therefore, what looks like a partitive (because the grammar 
			(see below) is parallel) but which is not identifying a quantity or 
			item of something greater:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a new <span class="style_black">kind</span> 
			of apple<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a better <span class="style_black">sort</span> of 
			bread</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went to a different
			<span class="style_black">type</span> of school</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			These expressions are not partitives in themselves because they can 
			be preceded by a partitive proper (something partitives don't do 
			because they are mutually exclusive).&nbsp; We can have, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fruiterer has a box of a new
			<span class="style_black">kind</span> of apple<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a loaf of this new <span class="style_black">sort</span> 
			of brown bread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They ate a plate of a different <span class="style_black">
			type</span> of fish</em></p>
			<p>There are a few other expressions which are parallel but much 
			less common, including:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a litter of a new </em>
			<span class="style_black"><em>breed</em></span><em> of dog<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They discovered a roost of a more interesting </em>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a pane of a new </em><span class="style_black"><em>

			partitive proper.</p>

			<h3>Classifier use</h3>

			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Many nouns normally used as mass concepts may be used as 
			classifiers.&nbsp; When this happens, they lose their nominal status 
			and become akin to adjectives (although they are not adjectives, in 
			fact).<br />
			So, as an alternative to partitive use, we can find the mass noun 
			converted to a classifier, like this, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pane of glass &rarr; a glass pane<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an ingot of silver → a silver ingot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a lump of sugar → a sugar lump<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a grain of rice → a rice grain</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bar of gold → a gold bar</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			However, these are unreliably acceptable uses because we probably 
			would not accept:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?a furniture heap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?a coal lump<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?a paper sheet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?a soap bar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?a grit grain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?an evidence item<br />
			</em>and so on.<br />
			In particular, any metaphorical or figurative use of the partitive 
			is unlikely to be acceptably converted to a classifier use of the 
			mass noun so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *an intelligence flash<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *an honesty scrap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a work stack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a hope glimmer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a confusion cloud<br />
			</em>are all disallowed.<br />
			What is acceptable is often a matter of opinion and there are no 
			rules to discover the level of acceptability.&nbsp; The advice for 
			learners, therefore, is to avoid these unless one is sure of their 
			correctness.</p>

			<p>All partitives in English are simple to form and take the 
			structure of:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determiner + Partitive + <em>of</em> + Noun 
			phrase</strong></span><br />
			as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a stack of jazz records<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that sheet of typing paper</em><br />
			although the noun may itself be modified by a determiner or other 
			modifier so we may 
			have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a block of that chocolate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pile of those books<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a slice of that delicious cake<br />
			</em>and partitives themselves may take determiners (only those 
			which can apply to count nouns), be plural and be modified so we may have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three thin slices of fruit cake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lots of tall panes of glass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two long rows of expensive cars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that untidy heap of books<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a hot rasher of bacon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the slices of Christmas cake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both piles of books<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<p>However, there are some constraints concerning which determiners 
			can appear in partitive constructions.&nbsp; Most can, so we allow:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a slice of a cake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a rasher of the bacon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a block of any material<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pint of both beers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a glass of either juice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cloud of many flies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cup of your coffee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pile of some stones<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a group of several people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a loaf of whichever bread you have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sliver of that / this / those / these sausage(s)</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a glass of each wine</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			On the other hand, we do not encounter:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a slice of all cakes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a bowl of every soup</em><br />
			because these two determiners are universal and do not allow the 
			noun to be conceived as divided.</p>

			<p>The overlap is between the types of partitives in question and

			(although it also acts as a more restricted count partitive in the case 
			of <em>shoes, socks, scissors</em> and <em>trousers</em>).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a pile of<br />

			and mass nouns (<em>work, furniture, books, trouble, problems, paper
			</em>etc.) but is semantically restricted in the sense that it 
			cannot be used for liquids (<em>*pile of water / milk / beer </em>
			etc.) or non-tangible nouns such as <em>light, advice, help</em> or <em>sound</em> 
			(but <em>pile of trouble</em> is a common enough metaphorical exception).</p>
			<p>In the restricted and typical partitive columns belong a number of 
			metaphorical idioms (clichés, if you prefer) such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pang of hunger / guilt<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			torrent of abuse<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			scrap of difference<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			article of faith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grain of intelligence<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			glimmer of hope / life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flash of insight<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			drop of sympathy<br />
			</em>The notorious politician-speak partitive <em>raft of</em> (<em>policies, 
			measures</em> etc.) belongs here, too.</p>
			<p>There are further issues to do with mass <em>vs</em>. count noun 
			uses.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>General partitives are used to make a huge range mass nouns 
				countable.&nbsp; We can have, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three pieces of information<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two bits of advice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a touch of irony<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a piece of furniture</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *three pieces of facts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *two bits of apples<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a touch of raisins<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a piece of books</em></li>
				<li>Typical partitives, because they refer to the physical 
				properties of matter are often (not invariably) usable with both 
				mass and count nouns.&nbsp; We get, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a ball of string</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a ball of rubber bands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a jar of cream</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a jar of cherries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cloud of dust</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cloud of insects</em></li>
				<li>Restricted partitives are almost always confined to defining 
				a quantity of a mass noun.&nbsp; We have, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pane of glass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a blade of grass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a scoop of ice cream</em><br />
				and so on, but none can be used with count nouns so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a bolt of cloths<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a gust of breezes</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a loaf of bread rolls</em><br />
				and so on are not allowed.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>An advantage for learners is that the general partitives can 
			usually be used to replace the typical or restricted partitives when 
			these are not known so we can have, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass me that, erm, bit of paper</em><br />
			instead of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass me that sheet of paper.</em></p>
			<p>The problem for learners is obvious.&nbsp; Apart from the 
			general partitives which can be used with almost any mass noun:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>the 
			restricted partitives have to be learned as language chunks and</li>
				<li>the typical partitives have to be associated with certain 
				types of noun only</li>

			This is not an easy area for learners of the language by any means.<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><strong>Restricted partitives</strong> which collocate with a single noun or 
				two are best treated as language chunks.&nbsp; A <em>rasher of 
				bacon</em>, for example, uses a partitive which cannot be 
				applied to any other noun.</li>
				<li><strong>Typical partitives</strong> need a slightly different approach 
				because there are physical notions attached to them of, e.g., flatness 
				and thinness (<em>slice, plate, sheet</em>), size (<em>speck, 
				grain</em>), shape (<em>lump, bar</em>), arrangement 
				possibilities (<em>row, pile, heap, stack</em>), containers (<em>jar, 
				box, bottle</em>) etc.<br />
				We need to help learners to notice these generalities and that 
				can only be done by explicitly mentioning the typical partitive 
				when introducing the mass noun.&nbsp; There's little point in 
				knowing the word <em>soap</em> if you can't talk about <em>a bar 
				of soap</em>.</li>
				<li>Some partitives are typical for <strong>time and location</strong>.&nbsp; 
				They include, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end of </em>(+ <em>day, road, street, 
				week </em>etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>middle of</em> (+ <em>morning, room, road, week, summer
				</em>etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>beginning of</em> (+ <em>day, spring, book, meeting</em> 
				etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>back of</em> ([in BrE only for location] + <em>house, 
				car, garden, building</em> etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>front of </em>([only for location] + <em>house, garage, 
				door, book, desk</em> etc.)<br />
				etc.<br />
				These partitives are usually found with <em>of </em>+ a 
				determiner  such as<em> the</em> or <em>that </em>and 
				may include an adjective phrase such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the end of a long tiring day</em><br />
				rather 
				than simply <em>of</em>.</li>
				<li>As we saw above, many partitives can be used metaphorically, 
				<strong>as if</strong> they were 
				typical of the noun they classify.&nbsp; In these cases, the 
				rules above are broken for effect and the use should not be 
				mistaken for literal senses.&nbsp; So, for example, we get:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>a stack of work</em></li>
					<li><em>a slice of responsibility</em></li>
					<li><em>a cloud of confusion</em></li>
					<li><em>a grain of humility</em></li>
					<li><em>a pile of
					/ stack of trouble, problems, money, arguments</em></li>
					<li><em>torrent of abuse</em></li>
					<li><em>a glimmer of hope</em></li>
					<li><em>a scrap of evidence</em> or<em> difference</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			That is a defendable position but, because there are obvious 
			differences within the general term <em>collective</em>, we will 
			take a slightly more precise route and distinguish between 
			collective nouns and assemblage nouns.<br />
			They both refer to groups.</p>
			<p>The two categories discussed in this section denote the reverse 
			relationships to partitives.</p>
			<ol class="auto-style93">

				<h2>Semantic issues</h2>

			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Group nouns come in two sorts which are semantically distinguished:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><strong>Collective nouns<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="family" height="133" src="../../images/family200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				refer the whole made up of its parts so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an army</em><br />
				is understood as a large collection of fighting people<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a family</em><br />
				is a unit of related individuals and so on.<br />
				We usually know what forms the individual units because, by 
				their nature, the collective nouns imply the types of things to 
				which they refer.&nbsp; So we can say, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the jury has reached a verdict<br />
				</em> 
				and we know that <em>jury</em> is a collective noun for people 
				who are called to decide a legal case.<br />Equally, for example, we know the individual components of:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an army<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a committee<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the police<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the congregation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the audience<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the family<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cavalry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the senate<br />
				</em>and so on and it is rarely necessary and stylistically 
				questionable to add what the noun 
				is composed of, so we do not hear:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a jury of members<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an army of soldiers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a committee of members<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a congregation of worshippers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; police of police officers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an audience of spectators<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a family of relations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cavalry of horse riders<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a senate of lawmakers</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				The reason for this is that the nature of the items that make up 
				these nouns is already a semantic component of the noun itself 
				just as, for example, the word <em>bachelor</em> contains the 
				sematic component of <em>adult, male</em> and <em>unmarried</em> 
				so to say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an army of soldiers</em><br />
				is just as tautological as to say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an unmarried adult bachelor</em><br />
				<strong>Metaphor</strong><br />
				Nevertheless, if a collective noun is used in an unusual or 
				metaphorical way, the <em>of-</em>phrase is often used to make 
				that clear so we may have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a shoal of creditors</em> (a metaphor for
				<em>sharks</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an army of rats</em> (a metaphor for <em>
				soldiers</em> or <em>attackers</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a family of words </em>(a metaphor for <em>relatives</em>)<br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li><strong>Assemblage nouns<br />
				<img alt="flock" height="133" src="../../images/birds_geese200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</strong>(such as a skein of geese)<strong>
				</strong>are slightly different.<br />
				Assemblage nouns are sometimes called venery nouns (a word 
				derived from the Old French verb meaning <em>hunt</em>) and 
				initially used only for animals which were game of some kind 
				(e.g., <em>a paddling of ducks</em>).<br />
				With exceptions, assemblages <strong>do</strong> 
				need us to say what they consist of unless the context has 
				already made it clear.&nbsp; We cannot, therefore, simple say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the flock is over there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pack is here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bunch are on the table</em><br />
				and so on unless we add<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of sheep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of cards<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of bananas</em><br />
				or from the context it is clear what we are referring to (<em>sheep</em> 
				not <em>birds</em>, <em>cards</em> not <em>dogs</em>, <em>
				bananas</em> not <em>grapes, keys</em> or <em>friends</em> etc.).<br />
				There are a few very restricted assemblage terms to which this 
				does not apply although it would still be rare to say or hear:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pride is coming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gaggle is noisy</em><br />
				without mentioning that we are referring to <em>lions</em> and
				<em>geese</em> respectively.&nbsp; So, too:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a herd</em><br />
				has little meaning unless one knows what the constituent parts 
				are, either by context or by the addition (which is the 
				preferred route) of an <em>of-</em>phrase, so we say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at that herd of elephants</em><br />
				even when it is obvious what sort of animals are in question.&nbsp; 
				Thereafter, we may well use the word alone because the<em> of 
				elephants</em> bit is understood.<br />
				By the same token, we would not normally say:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a band<br />
				</em>without saying <em>of what:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of outlaws<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of musicians<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of enthusiasts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of thunderstorms</em><br />
				and so on.<br />The context, of course, makes it clear sometimes 
				what we are talking about so at a concert, referring to <em>a 
				band</em> will usually signify a band of musicians of some kind.<br />
				Some animals and other entities have very restricted assemblage nouns to refer to 
				them.&nbsp; So, for example, we have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a charm of finches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a shoal of fish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a troop of monkeys</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				There are a number of rare, fanciful (and often invented) 
				assemblage nouns for some creatures including, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a murder of crows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an exaltation of larks</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				Even in cases where the assemblage noun is restricted to only 
				one, or a severely limited number of, things, the <em>of</em>-phrase 
				is still conventionally used.&nbsp; Nobody is likely to say, 
				then<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at that pod</em><br />
				without adding:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; of dolphins / porpoises / whales</em><br />
				Restricted assemblage nouns for animals are very probably worth ignoring for teaching purposes 
				because they are functionally almost worthless and of dubious 
				historical validity (many were invented by Dame Juliana Berners 
				in the 15th century).<br />
				<strong>Metaphor</strong><br />
				is also possible with assemblage nouns when the items or people 
				are considered to be acting in a certain way so we may have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a troop of schoolchildren</em> (monkey-like 
				behaviour)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a herd of supporters</em> 
				(hoofed-animal-like behaviour)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a bunch of relatives </em>(clump-like behaviour)<br />
				and so on.</li>

				but in the case of collectives, the <em>of-</em>phrase is optional or 
			determined by the fact that the collective noun is being used 
			metaphorically as here, hence the brackets.&nbsp; Metaphorical use 
			of collective nouns converts the noun to an assemblage noun.<br />
			For teaching purposes, therefore, it is useful to treat group and 
			partitive expressions together when considering form but equally 
			useful to distinguish them when considering meaning.<p>There is one 
			obvious grammatical difference to do with concord, too:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Partitive expressions may be used with singular or plural 
				verb and pronoun forms depending on strict grammatical 
				considerations.&nbsp; The choice of plural or singular concord 
				depends solely on the partitive itself.&nbsp; So we have, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three bars of soap were used and they had to be replaced<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A jar of olives is in the cupboard so take them from there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ate four portions of vegetables and found them delicious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put a few lumps of coal on the fire and they burnt well</em><br />
				Even when the partitive refers to a mass noun, pluralising the 
				partitive results in plural verb and pronoun forms.</li>
				<li>Collective nouns are not grammatically so consistent.<ul class="redbullet">
					<li class="greybullet">Collective nouns proper are 
					frequently used in the singular with singular verb and 
					pronoun forms and it is considered bad form to use plural 
					forms in formal language so we have, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The army is helping out and it is 
					being asked to do more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The family is all here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee has decided</em><br />
					and so on.<br />
					However, in British English, plural forms are often used 
					under the influence of notional concord (which refers to the 
					way the speaker / writer perceives the group: as individuals 
					or a single entity), so we will hear:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government are introducing 
					legislation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The board have met<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The audience were unimpressed</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					We also often see a mix of concord as in, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee which reached its 
					decision were criticised<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee who reached their decision is incompetent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The congregation was told to get on their knees<br />
					</em>For a little more, see the guide to concord, linked 
					below.<br />
					When an internal conflict is detected, British English 
					usually settles on plural concord so we get, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jury is unanimous about the first charge but on the second, they are divided.</em></li>
					<li class="greybullet">When a singular collective noun 
					is used routinely without specification of the units that 
					make it up, the preferred and safe choice especially in 
					formal language is to keep with singular verb and pronoun 
					forms:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His collection is famous for its 
					completeness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anthology is exceptional<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pool is limited<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The atlas has been revised</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					General American usage is almost always to use the singular 
					forms in these circumstance.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Ass<span class="greybullet">emblage nouns are influenced 
				by proximity concord (the effect of the nearest noun to the 
				verb, determining its form).&nbsp; We can have, therefore, in British 
				English, both singular and plural forms and, sometimes, an 
				uneasy mixture:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The herd has been driven to market 
					and they have been sold</em></span><br />and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The herd of cows have been driven to 
					market and it has been sold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack was dangerous<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack of dogs were dangerous and it was avoided</em><br />and so on.<br />The use of the usually obligatory 
				<em>of-</em>phrase containing a plural noun influences the kind 
				of concord which is used.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This grammatical inconsistency in British English is not present 
			in many other varieties so American usage will almost always settle 
			on singular verb and pronoun forms for singular subjects.<br />
			Most other languages will do the same when a parallel structure 
			exists.</p>

			<p>There are few of these but two issues are worth noting:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The <em>of</em> construction may be missed altogether when 
				learners hear the phrase because it is often very severely 
				reduced either to /əv/, /ə/ or to /v/.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a herd of cows<br />
				</em>will sound like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ə.hɜːd.əv.kaʊz/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ə.hɜːd.ə.kaʊz/<br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ə.hɜːd.v.kaʊz/<br />
				Learners may also fail, of course, to produce the weakened form 
				of the preposition.</li>
				<li>Usually, both the partitive, collective or assemblage noun 
				will carry some stress but the main stress will fall on the main 
				noun, as one would expect so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a rasher of bacon<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pane of glass<br />
				</em>will usually be pronounced as:ˌˈ<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ə.ˌræ.ʃər.əv.ˈbeɪk.ən/<br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ə.ˌpeɪn.əv.ˈɡlɑːs/<br />
				respectively.<br />
				Speakers may of course, use special stress to mark some 
				elements, especially when the use is metaphorical in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a huge army of caterpillars on my vegetables<br />
				</em>when the pronunciation, stressing the assemblage noun for 
				effect, might be:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				/ðə.wəz.ə.hjuːdʒ.ˈɑː.mi.əv.ˈkæ.tə.pɪ.ləz.ɒn.maɪ.ˈve.dʒɪ.təb.l̩z/<br />

			<p>There is one final difference between partitives and assemblages 
			or collective nouns which should be mentioned although there are 
			disagreements in this area:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Partitives follow the general rule in English of being right 
				headed (or head final) in terms of meaning and word class.<br />
				Just as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a taxi driver</em><br />
				is a kind of <em>driver</em> not a kind of <em>taxi</em> and<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; a hill walker</em><br />
				is a kind of <em>walker</em> not a kind of <em>hill</em> so, for 
				example<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a coat of paint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a dab of paint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a smear of paint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a drop of paint</em><br />
				are all ways essentially to describe the <em>paint</em>, not the
				<em>coat</em>, <em>dab</em>, <em>drop</em> or <em>smear</em>.</li>
				<li>Assemblage and collective nouns can be seen to break the 
				right-headed rule in English and that can confuse.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a jury of schoolchildren<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a jury of old women<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a jury of your equals</em><br />
				etc. all describe the type of <em>jury</em>, not the individuals 
				in it.<br />
				Equally,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a herd of cows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a herd of antelopes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a herd of elephants</em><br />
				etc. all describe the type of <em>herd</em>, not the animals in 
				it.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Those who disagree will take one of two positions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>All</strong> partitives, collective and assemblage 
				nouns break the right-headed convention so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a rasher of bacon</em><br />
				describes the <em>rasher</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an army of robots</em><br />
				describes the <em>army</em> and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a flock of sheep</em><br />
				describes the <em>flock</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>None</strong> breaks the rules so:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a rasher of bacon</em><br />
				describes the <em>bacon</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an army of robots</em><br />
				describes the <em>robots</em> and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a flock of sheep</em><br />
				describes the <em>sheep</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The safest position to take is probably to say that partitives 
			usually abide by the right-headed rule and assemblage and collective 
			nouns often appear to break it.&nbsp; This is not a topic to which 
			much classroom time needs to be devoted providing the meaning is clear 
			and represents the mental picture a learner has or needs to have of something.</p>

			<p>If you have followed the guide to either adjectives or 
			pre-modification of noun phrases, you have encountered the 
			distinction between an adjective proper (an epithet) and a 
			classifying pre-modifier.<br />
			An adjective, whether gradable or not, <strong>describes</strong> 
			the noun; a classifier <strong>categorises</strong> it.<br />
			Classifiers which are often nouns are also known as noun adjuncts, incidentally.<br />
			This use of the term classifier is different from the use above of a 
			counter token (as exemplified by Japanese) and does refer to English 
			and other European languages.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>a <span class="style_black">solitary</span> tree</em> 
				<strong>describes</strong> the tree, not its type so it is an 
				epithet</li>
				<li><em>an <span class="style_black">oak</span> tree</em> 
				<strong>categorises</strong> the tree and distinguishes it from other types of 
				tree so it is a classifier</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Classifiers are, therefore, indications of a subclass of the 
			thing in question.&nbsp; If you are familiar with the term hyponymy, 
			this is superficially straightforward.&nbsp; For example, there are 
			no prizes for spotting the odd one out in this diagram:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="cars" height="124" src="../../imagesgraphics/cars.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>It is simple to tell that <em>fast car</em> is not a type of car; it 
			is a description of a car.&nbsp; <em>Fast</em> is an adjective, the 
			others are classifiers.&nbsp; The simple test is to try to modify 
			the word with an adverb or make a comparative form.&nbsp; If that 
			can be done, we are dealing with an adjective and if it cannot, we 
			are dealing with a classifier.<br />
			We can have, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an amazingly fast car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sadly solitary tree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a more solitary tree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a very lonely man</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a very sports car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a slightly oak tree</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *an oaker tree</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Unfortunately, some adjectives also resist modification and here the 
			test loses its validity and we are left with a grey area.&nbsp; For 
			example, is the word <em>dead</em> in<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a dead tree</em><br />
			a classifier or an adjective?&nbsp; It is clear that we cannot have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a slightly dead tree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a deader tree</em><br />
			etc. because the adjective resists grading,
			but if we accept<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a very dead tree</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a completely dead tree</em><br />
			then we are dealing with an adjective proper.&nbsp; Similar 
			considerations apply to adjectives such as <em>unique</em>, and
			<em>more unique</em> is regularly heard.<br />
			A supplementary test is to use the word predicatively.&nbsp; We can 
			have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the tree was solitary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man appeared very lonely</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			but clearly not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the car was sports<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the tree seemed oak</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			Even this test is not completely secure because words like <em>
			flightless</em> and <em>waterproof</em> are used both ways with 
			subtle differences in meaning:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a flightless bird</em> (classifier)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bird is flightless</em> (adjective 
			describing this particular bird)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a waterproof coat</em> (classifying the type 
			of coat)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the coat was waterproof</em> (describing the 
			coat's quality)</p>

			<dl>
				<dt><strong>adjectives as classifiers</strong></dt>
				<dd>Some words can perform both the adjective and the 
				classifying functions depending on the 
				meaning intended.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				a <span class="style_black">senior</span> officer</em><br />has the word 
				<em>senior</em> acting as a simple adjective.&nbsp; We can 
				have<em> more senior, very senior, most senior</em> etc.<br />
				but in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				a <span class="style_black">senior</span> teacher</em><br />the word is a classifier, categorising the teacher by job title 
				and function and it makes no sense to refer to <em>a more senior 
				teacher</em>, unless we are referring to the teacher's age or 
				experience.<br />
				Equally, the word <em>rural</em> can perform both functions:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a very <span class="style_black">rural</span> 
				setting</em> (adjective)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <span class="style_black">rural</span> 
				issue</em> (classifier)</dd>
				<dt><strong>participles as classifiers</strong></dt>
				<dd>Many adjectives are actually verb participles in disguise and 
				act quite normally as adjectives.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a very <span class="style_black">boring</span> 
				landscape<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an extremely <span class="style_black">frightened</span> child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a well <span class="style_black">educated</span> teacher<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the most <span class="style_black">compelling</span> film</em><br />
				and in these cases we can modify them and produce comparative or 
				superlative forms so they are adjectives.<br />
				However, in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <span class="style_black">boring</span> 
				tool<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">printed</span> matter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">printing</span> ink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <span class="style_black">framed</span> picture</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;<span class="style_black">typing</span> paper</em><br />
				all the participles are classifiers.<br />
				Whether the participles are adjectives or classifiers, the meaning 
				distinction between the forms comes down to one of two factors:<ol class="auto-style93">
					<li> <em>-ing</em> participles refer to role of the noun in 
				effecting a process<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a boring speaker<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printing ink<br />
					</em>but<em> -ed</em> participles refer to the noun being affected by the

				issues:<ol class="auto-style93">
					<li>They are less predictable in meaning: <em>a spider web</em> 
				refers to something made by a spider but <em>a paper airplane</em> 
				refers to something consisting of paper.&nbsp; Some knowledge of 
				the world is required to understand what is meant in many cases.</li>
					<li>Noun classifier + Noun structures blur imperceptibly 
					into compound nouns:<br />
				It is clear that, e.g., <em>earthquake</em> is a true compound with the subject as its 
				head (it is the <em>earth</em> that quakes).&nbsp; Other 
				examples are less clear:<br />
				<em>town planner</em> is often seen as a compound but <em>garden 
				planner</em> seems more easily analysed as a Noun classifier + 
				Noun.&nbsp; In these cases, it is the object which forms the 
					head (the <em>town</em> is planned, the <em>garden</em> is 
					planned).<br />
				The fuzziness of the borderline between 
				Noun classifier + Noun 
				and true compounds causes problems of course, not least because 
				compound nouns are usually stressed on the first item and the 
				Noun classifier + Noun structure is variably stressed.&nbsp; 
				There is a guide to compounding 
				on this site, linked in the list of related guides, below.</li>
					<li>Noun classifiers are irregularly marked for number: we 
					have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <span class="style_black">saloon</span> car<br />
				</em>but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <span class="style_black">sport<span class="style_underline">s</span></span> car<br />

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <span class="style_black">camera</span> bag<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				a <span class="style_black">complaint</span> form<br />
				</em>but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <span class="style_black">complaint<span class="style_underline">s</span></span> department<br />
				</em>and so on.<br />
					The way to bet is that they are singular so we have<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model car collection</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>portrait gallery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; landscape photography</em><br />
					and so on.<br />
				Learners who do not have parallel structures in their first 
				languages will often be tempted to make all noun classifiers 
				plural.</li>

			<p>English is a <strong>
		right-headed</strong> language in the formation of noun phrases.&nbsp; The headword in the compound lies to the 
		right as in, e.g., <em>taxi driver</em> where <em>taxi</em> classifies 
		the type of <em>driver</em>.&nbsp; In that phrase, <em>driver</em> is 
		the Head.&nbsp; Many related, especially Germanic, languages follow the 
		same pattern of right-headedness as does, e.g., Basque (<em>taxi gidaria</em>), Turkish 
		(<em>taksi sürücüsü</em>), Dutch (<em>taxi chauffeur</em>), Danish (<em>taxachauffør</em>), 
		Swedish (<em>taxichaufför</em>) and many other languages.<br />
		Some right-headed languages also agglutinate, forming words by 
		affixation, so in Finnish, a <em>taxi driver</em> is a <em>taksikuski</em> 
		and in German, a <em>Taxifahrer.</em></p>
		<p>Other languages do things differently.<br />
		In left-headed languages someone who drives a taxi is not a <em>taxi 
		chauffeur</em> but a <em>chauffeur de taxi </em>(French) or a <em>shofer 
		taksie </em>(Albanian), <em>řidič taxíku</em> (Czech), водитель такси<em>
		</em>(Russian), <em>sewwieq tat-taxi</em> (Maltese, a Semitic language),
		<em>sofer de taxi</em> (Romanian) etc.&nbsp; In 
		French, a <em>postage stamp</em> is a <em>timbre-poste, </em>in Polish a
		<em>znaczek Pocztowy</em> and in Romanian a <em>timbru poștal</em> (<em>stamp 
		postage</em> in all cases).&nbsp; Other left-headed languages include 
		Vietnamese, Thai and Welsh, in which <em>taxi driver</em> translates as <em>
		gyrrwr tacsi</em>, and <em>postage stamp</em> as <em>stamp post</em>, 
		incidentally.<br />
		To complicate matters, some languages, particularly Slavic ones such as 
		Polish and Russian, will place the adjective before the noun but choose 
		to place a classifier after the noun.&nbsp; So we have, e.g., <em>big 
		house</em> but <em>old player record</em>.&nbsp; In Polish, for example,
		<em>large postage stamp</em> translates as <em>duża znaczka pocztowa</em> 
		(literally <em>large stamp postage</em>).</p>
		<p>Many languages avoid classifiers and will use a kind of genitive 
		structure (<em>a driver of buses, a stamp of postage</em> etc.) or 
		simply supply a different ending for someone who does something (as 
		English can with <em>gardener, teacher </em>etc.) but, instead of 
		deriving the person from the verb (as English does with <em>taxi driver</em>, 
		classifying the noun driver and adding -<em>r</em> to the verb to make 
		the doer of the action), they will derive the person from the 
		noun and have <em>taxista </em>(Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, Galician 
		etc.) or <em>tassista</em> (Italian).</p>

		<h2>Problems for learners</h2>
				</td>

		</table>
			<p>All of the above should have convinced you that this is not at 
			all an easy area for learners.<br />
			Using the wrong partitive, group noun or classifier or failing to recognise 
			right-headedness will rarely result in communicative breakdown 
			because a sympathetic native speaker will be able mentally to 
			correct the utterance but learners who cannot handle partitives, 
			group nouns and 
			classifiers will often sound unnatural and what they say will be 
			recognisably non-English.<br />
			For example, the following, while not all grammatically wrong or 
			overtly flawed are unnatural to most people's ears:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a lump of information<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sliver of bacon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a chair of the office<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the airport of the city<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a block of coal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pane of plastic</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a herd of sheep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a group of birds</em><br />
			If natural production is the aim, especially above early levels, 
			this area needs attention.<br />
			Here are some more ideas of what the 
			problems might stem from and some simple ways to deal with them:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Confusions caused by poor analysis or incomplete teaching<br />
				<img alt="lost" src="../../images/women_lost200.jpg" /><ol class="redbullet">
					<li>Collective <em>vs</em>. partitive nouns<br />
					There are some websites, purportedly helping people to learn 
					English or about English, which will suggest that something 
					like<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <span class="style_underline">
					<strong>box</strong></span> of chocolates</em><br />
					is a collective noun.<br />
					In the sense that <em>box of </em>refers to a collection of
					<em>chocolates</em>, they are right, of course, but a 
					moment's thought will reveal that we are referring here to a 
					limited number of items from an almost limitless potential 
					supply.&nbsp; The term is, therefore, a partitive, not a 
					collective noun.<br />
					We need to get a semantic issue right from the 
					beginning because without it, confusion will be caused:<ol class="greybullet">
						<li>a partitive is a noun representing a smaller unit of 
						a larger unit</li>
						<li>a collective noun is a noun representing a larger 
						unit made up of smaller units</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Collective <em>vs</em>. assemblage nouns<br />
					If learners are not made aware of this difference, some of 
					what they say will, at the least, be unnatural.<ol class="greybullet">
						<li>Collective nouns do not usually need the units to be 
						expressed so terms such as <em>army, jury, government, 
						board, committee</em> and so on are rarely used (if the 
						use is literal) with the <em>xxxx of</em> structure.<br />
						Including the units produces unnatural and sometimes 
						tautological language such as:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a committee of people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an army of soldiers<br />
						</em>etc.</li>
						<li>Assemblage nouns usually need the units to be 
						explicit so we get <em>a pride of lions, pod of whales, 
						flock of starlings, clump of trees </em>
						and so on.<br />
						Leaving out the units causes comprehension failure 
						sometimes and almost always sounds unnatural.&nbsp; For 
						example:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Can we see a pod?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Look at that huge flock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?He has a clump at the end of his garden<br />
						</em>etc.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Partitives:<br />
				<img alt="cake" height="120" src="../../images/cake_slice200.jpg" width="200" /><ol class="redbullet">
					<li>Learners from certain language backgrounds may expect to be 
				able to translate the counter classifiers from their first 
				languages and be confused that English does not have separate 
				classifiers for the same categories (<em>animals, people, flat 
				things</em> etc.) that their first language uses.<br />Simply making them aware of this with a little comparative 
				language work can usually solve the problem and these learners 
				will, of course, not be strangers to the idea of typical 
				partitives.</li>
					<li>Learners with a European first language may 
				have difficulty applying the right partitives because languages 
				differ in the categories which are applied.&nbsp; Many languages 
				have far fewer of these and rely on general partitives such as 
					<em>piece, item</em> or <em>bit</em>.&nbsp; Learners from these language 
					backgrounds may well 
				over-generalise and apply the wrong partitives, producing, 
				for example, <em>*a lump of paint</em> when <em>speck</em> or
					<em>dab</em> is meant.</li>
					<li>Teaching the general partitives will help, especially at the 
				beginning but as they progress learners will need to apply the 
				typical partitives for substances they know or they might not 
				realise that there is a difference between <em>a bit of glass</em> 
				and <em>a pane of glass</em>.</li>
					<li>Teaching the restricted items as lexical chunks helps (because there are no 
				easily acquired rules) and, when introducing the terms for 
				substances or dealing with mass nouns, providing the collocating 
				partitive then and there will be useful because it is more 
				difficult to apply the categories later.</li>
					<li>Problematizing the issue helps because learners may not 
					be aware that there is something worth learning in this 
					respect.&nbsp; For example, getting learners to make a 
					sketch of<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bit of glass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pane of glass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a lump of cake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a slice of cake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bit of string<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a ball of string</em><br />
					etc. may alert them to the need to notice the language and 
					the notions it encodes.<br />
					Abstract ideas are trickier to deal with but providing or 
					eliciting examples of the differences between, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bit of kindness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an act of kindness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a stroke of genius<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a work of genius<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a case of dishonesty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bit of dishonesty</em><br />
					etc. will pay dividends in alerting the learners to the 
					shades of meaning.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Assemblage and collective nouns:<br />
				<img alt="deer" height="133" src="../../images/animals_deer_forest200.jpg" width="200" /><ol class="redbullet">
					<li>As we saw, collective nouns proper do not usually 
					require the <em>of-</em>phrase so it is a mistake to speak 
					of<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a family of relations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a jury of people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a committee of members</em><br />
					and so on.<br />
					This is not always mirrored in other languages and that may 
					lead to the unnecessary inclusion of the <em>of-</em>phrase.<br />
					In other cases, a collective noun will have added meanings 
					in other languages, so, for example, <em>congregation</em> 
					in German translates by a term which can also mean <em>
					community</em> or <em>municipality</em> and in French by a 
					word which can also mean <em>religion</em>.</li>
					<li>Assemblage nouns are almost wholly unpredictable and 
					rarely translate across languages.<br />
					In French, for example, <em>a herd of cows </em>and <em>a 
					flock of sheep</em> will both take the assemblage noun <em>
					troupeau</em> whereas <em>flock of birds</em> will translate 
					as <em>vol d'oiseaux</em>.<br />
					In German, the same word is also used for flock and herds 
					but <em>a flock of birds </em>uses <em>schwarm</em> which is 
					cognate with the English word reserved for insects (<em>swarm</em>).<br />
					Similar considerations apply to Spanish, Italian and other 
					Romance languages.<br />
					Greek distinguishes <em>herd</em> from <em>flock</em> with 
					different words but has a separate word when <em>flock</em> 
					is applied to birds.<br />
					Many language may have a single collective noun to translate 
					the English assemblage expression and some will simply 
					compound the animal with a generalised word for <em>group</em>.<br />
					Words such as <em>batch</em> are equally obscure and, for 
					example, a different word would be applied in German for <em>
					students, papers</em> and <em>applicants</em> although 
					French has an equally generalisable expression (<em>lot</em>).<br />
					In sum, it is very unlikely indeed that languages other than 
					English use assemblage nouns in anything like parallel ways.&nbsp; 
					Some assemblage terms in English will simply not have any 
					equivalents in other languages and their speakers will rely 
					on generalised words such as <em>group</em> or <em>
					collection</em>.&nbsp; The reverse may also apply.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Classifiers <em>vs</em>. epithets:<br />
				<img alt="classify" height="133" src="../../images/classify_filing200.jpg" width="200" /><ol class="redbullet">
					<li>Again, languages differ and many will avoid the use of a 
				pre-modifying classifier and use a genitive structure instead as 
					we saw above.&nbsp; Speakers of Greek or French, for 
					example, may be tempted to say <em>the driver of the bus</em> 
					or <em>the bus's driver</em> which, while not obviously 
					wrong, are much less natural than <em>the bus driver</em>.&nbsp; 
					Because such expressions are unnatural rather than patently 
					wrong, there is a temptation to ignore them.&nbsp; That's a 
					mistake.<br />
					This needs careful handling and some comparative language 
					work can pay dividends in getting learners to notice the 
					differences between their language(s) and English.</li>
					<li>Headedness is another issue which can be handled with 
					comparative language work but to be able to do that well, 
					you need to be aware of the characteristic(s) of your 
					learners' language(s).&nbsp; Headedness applies to more than 
					classifiers and adjectives of course but the forms are 
					parallel.<br />

					</li>
					<li>Selecting an adjective or a noun classifier is almost 
					wholly idiomatic in English and, like other idioms, they are 
					best treated as chunks.&nbsp; There are no overt rules to 
					follow.&nbsp; For example, we can have:<ol class="greybullet">
						<li><em>urban expansion</em> but not <em>*town expansion</em></li>
						<li><em>the art exhibition </em>but not <em>*the artistic 
					exhibition, artistic talent </em>but not<em> *art talent</em></li>
						<li><em>a grammatical mistake</em> and <em>a grammar mistake, 
						a grammar book</em> but not <em>*a grammatical book</em></li>
						<li><em>a science journal, a scientific journal</em> but not 
						<em>*a science conference, a science teacher </em>but 
						not<em> *a scientific teacher</em> (unless a very 
						different meaning is intended)</li>
						<li><em>economic growth</em> and <em>political crisis</em> but 
					not <em>*economy growth</em> or <em>*politics crisis</em></li>
						<li><em>country dancing</em> but <em>countryside management</em> 
						but not <em>*country management </em>or <em>*countryside 
						dancing</em></li>
