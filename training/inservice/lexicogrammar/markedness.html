			not for any other candidate.&nbsp; The other candidates remain 
			unmarked by general consensus.&nbsp; That is one way the world

			By the same token, you will assume that driving straight ahead on a

			<p>Markedness in linguistic terms is a slightly more difficult 
			concept and one surprisingly absent from teacher handbooks and 
			pedagogical grammars, despite its importance.&nbsp; The phenomenon 
			of markedness crops up in many areas of language analysis as the 
			longish list of related guides at the end shows.<br />
			In languages, the theory is that some features are simple and 
			prototypical so they are referred to as unmarked but others are 
			distinguished or marked in some way.&nbsp; For example, we do not 
			usually suggest that <em>house</em> is the singular of <em>houses</em> 
			but rather that <em>houses</em> is the plural of <em>house</em>.&nbsp; 
			The plural form is marked (in this case by the '<em>-s</em>' suffix) 
			but the singular is unmarked.&nbsp; That is the normal way plurals 
			are formed in English.</p>

					<img alt="flags" height="100" src="../../images/flags_world100.jpg" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					Other languages do things differently and may mark a dual 
					form as well as singular and plural forms (e.g., some 
					varieties of Arabic).&nbsp; 
					Vestiges of the Old English dual form can still be seen in 
					the Modern English use of <em>both</em> and <em>neither</em> 
					to designate two and only two entities.&nbsp; In this sense, 
					the terms are marked for duality.<br />
			Languages will, also, differ in the way the marked form is 
			distinguished (or not) from the unmarked form and in what is considered marked and what is 
			unmarked as we shall see.</td>

			<ol  id="implications" style="visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">
				<li>Markedness (or its lack) has been cited as a predictor of 
				the difficulty that is inherent in learning a language.<br />
				Unmarked items are, in this analysis, easier to acquire than 
				marked forms specifically because of their prototypical nature.<br />
				A simple example:<br />
				The word <em>lion</em> in English is unmarked so can apply to 
				either a male or female animal so, when someone says:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a lion behind you</em><br />
				we will not normally be concerned to worry about the animals 
				sex.<br />
				On the other hand, the word <em>lioness</em> is marked for sex 
				and we are unlikely to hear:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a lioness behind you</em><br />
				Many learners of English will find it simple to learn the word
				<em>lion</em> but may never learn (or instantly forget) the 
				marked form <em>lioness</em>.</li>
				<li>The notion of markedness has also been invoked to explain the 
				order in which language items (whether in first or second 
				language(s)) are acquired, with marked items acquired (or 
				learned) later 
				than unmarked ones.&nbsp; In other words, unmarked items are 
				simply easier to learn (and often simpler).<br />
				A simple example:<br />
				In English, the present tense of a verb is often 
				indistinguishable from its base or stem so, for example, most 
				learners find it easy to say something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I work in London</em><br />
				because the verb is not marked for tense or person and is the 
				same as the stem.&nbsp; However, most teachers will tell you 
				that the marked form:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She works in London</em><br />
				is often not consistently produced by many learners up to C1 
				level.</li>
				<li>If a language item or structure is unmarked in a learner's 
				first language, it will be the first-choice form for that 
				learner in a second or subsequently acquired language.&nbsp; 
				Examples will follow in due course.</li>
				<li>If we understand how our learners' first language(s) handle 
				markedness, we are in a good position to predict what will cause 
				the greatest difficulty and design or amend our teaching 
				programme accordingly.</li>
				<li>If we consider some errors produced by our learners in the 
				light of the variation in markedness conventions across 
				languages, we will be better able to explain them and better 
				able to deal with them constructively.&nbsp; Some of these 
				errors in markedness may not be immediately apparent, because 
				the learners' production is grammatically accurate but 
				pragmatically and semantically skewed.</li>

			<h4>Number</h4>
			<p>We have seen that the plural forms of nouns in English are usually 
			marked with -<em>s</em> or -<em>es</em> (with often a small spelling adjustment) as 
			in, e.g.,<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>class &rarr; class<strong>es</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bag → bag<strong>s</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pony → pon<strong>ies</strong></em><br />
			etc.<br />
			or they are irregular and make internal changes as in, e.g.,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;foot → f<strong>ee</strong>t<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mouse → m<strong>i</strong>ce</em><br />
			or both as in, e.g.,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>wolf → wol<strong>ves</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calf → cal<strong>ves</strong></em><br />
			etc.<br />
			(This, by the way, is an example of something called apophony and it 
			occurs much more routinely in other languages, such as German.&nbsp; 
			You may see it called ablaut, vowel mutation, internal modification, 
			stem modification or mutation, internal inflexion and a range of 
			other more or less hideous names.&nbsp; Simply, it means an internal 
			alteration to a word to show number, case, person or tense.&nbsp; 
			Modern English makes more use of external alteration in the form of 
			prefixes and suffixes but many irregular verbs, pronouns, 
			determiners and plural forms are still modified for tense, case and 
			number through internal changes.)<br />
			<br />
			In all cases, the marked form is the plural.<br />
			A few nouns, usually referring to animals, are unmarked in the 
			plural form:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; sheep → sheep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deer → deer</em><br />
			etc. but that does not mean they don't have a plural, of course.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td valign="top">
					<img alt="flags" height="100" src="../../images/flags_world100.jpg" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					Some languages, such as Japanese and Malay, for example, 
					have a tendency not to mark number at all.&nbsp; In these 
					languages, no marking on the noun does not indicate 
					singularity or plurality but is indeterminate regarding 
					number.&nbsp; Hungarian, too, will not mark plurality if it 
					is clear that a plural is meant, e.g., by a numeral.&nbsp; 
					Czech, too, does not usually mark plurality for quantities 
					above five.<br />
					Slightly more rarely, some languages will not mark the plural on certain 
					classes of noun which are seen as inherently plural and will 
					reserve marking for the singular form of these nouns.&nbsp; 
					In Welsh, for example, the unmarked form for feathered 
					flyers is <em>adar</em> which refers to a flock of birds.&nbsp; 
					The singular is in this case marked as <em>aderyn</em>, a 
					bird.&nbsp; In Slavic languages plurals may be unmarked 
					because some items are considered always in the mass.&nbsp; 
					In Russian, for example, <em>gorokh</em> [горох] refers to 
					the vegetable <em>peas</em> in a mass whereas <em>goroshina</em> 
					[гороховый] refers to a single <em>pea</em> and is marked 
					for the singular.<br />
					Some languages, notably Ancient Greek, Old English and 
					Sanskrit, marked dual number as well as singular and plural 
					and the tendency survives in some modern languages, 
					Slovenian, Sorbian and Scottish Gaelic, for example.&nbsp; 
					Vestiges of the Old English dual marker can be seen in words 
					such as <em>both</em> which can only apply to two items and 
					parallel relics of the dual forms may be seen in many other 
					languages.<br />
					The general rule is still that the marked form will not be 
					the singular but that is not completely universal and the 
					range of ways in which non-singularity is marked (if at all) 
					is quite wide.&nbsp; Affixation, as in English usually, is 
					just one of them.</td>

			</table>
			<h4>Gender</h4>
			<p>Some nouns in English are marked for gender, usually but not 
			invariable for the feminine with <em>-ess</em>, so while it is 
			perfectly possible to have, e.g.,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a female lion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a male lion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a female tiger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a male tiger</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			it is not possible to have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a male lioness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a male tigress</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			In a few cases, the female form is still marked but not obviously so 
			from the morphology so<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; a female dog</em><br />
			is acceptable but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a male bitch</em><br />
			is not.<br />
			Some nouns are marked morphologically for the male gender but these are rarer, 
			e.g.,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>bride</em> (unmarked) – <em>bride<strong>groom</strong></em> (marked for 
			male)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>widow</em> (unmarked) – <em>widow<strong>er</strong></em> (marked for 
			male)<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; nurse </em>(unmarked) – <em><strong>male</strong> nurse</em> (marked for 
			male)</p>
			<p>Some nouns are unmarked in form (but marked in meaning) so we cannot look at the word and decide 
			on its gender from the morphology so noun pairs such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brother – sister<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; niece – nephew</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>nun – monk</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			are not morphologically marked for gender; they are simply different words 
			with different meanings.<br />
			The marked form for many nouns is falling out of favour as the 
			perception of gender inequality grows so terms such as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; actress<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hostess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stewardess</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			are becoming ever rarer.&nbsp; Certain forms are, nevertheless, resistant to 
			fashion and it seems likely that, e.g., the distinctions between:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>duke – duchess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; count – countess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; emperor – empress<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; king – queen<br />
			</em>etc. will be retained in the language.</p>
			<p>Many nouns, previously marked for male and ending in <em>-man / 
			-men</em> or a female ending with -<em>woman / women </em>are giving 
			way to unmarked forms so words like<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; policeman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fireman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; airman</em><br />
			are now more conventionally rendered as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; police officer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire officer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pilot</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			However, some <em>-man / -men</em> endings are still retained in the 
			language because no obvious replacement marked for female or 
			unmarked is available so we still see, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; highwayman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infantryman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; midshipman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; middleman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ombudsman</em><br />
			although in some cases, a feminine marked ending may be substituted 
			so we see, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; fisherwoman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yachtswoman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; helmswoman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jurywoman</em><br />
			In other cases, this is not fully possible and sometimes dubiously 
			acceptable so, although we do see, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; spacewoman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; huntswoman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; camerawoman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; backwoodswoman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; workwoman</em><br />
			and so on, not everyone, or all spell-check programs, will accept 
			all of these.<br />
			(Gender marking in English is unpredictably inconsistent (as it is 
			in many languages but not all by any means).&nbsp; There is, for 
			example, no obvious reason for the non-occurrence of nouns such as
			<em>guestess, criminaless, buildess </em>and so on.)</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td valign="top">
					<img alt="flags" height="100" src="../../images/flags_world100.jpg" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					Other languages work differently so, for example, while the word
			<em>cousin</em> is unmarked for gender in English, there are 
			separate terms in many languages for female and male cousins.&nbsp; 
			Equally, terms such as <em>grandfather</em> in English are not 
			marked for whether the reference is to one's mother's father or 
			father's father (although it is marked for gender) but in other 
			languages separate terms exist for the relationships.&nbsp; The same 
					considerations apply to many other kinship terms.<br />
					In 
			some languages, the first-person pronoun is marked for gender so 
			will vary depending on the gender of the person speaking / writing.</td>

			<h4>Size</h4>
			<p>English frequently marks nouns for size (as do many languages, but 
			differently, of course and in some cases [e.g. Modern Greek and 
			German] much 
			more frequently).&nbsp; There are two ways to do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Smallness: marking with a diminutive<br />
				So we have the unmarked:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; kitchen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cigar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; book</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>chip</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>hill</em><br />
			and the diminutively marked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;kitchen<strong>ette</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cigar<strong>ette</strong><br />
			</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>book</em><strong><em>let</em></strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>micro</strong>chip</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>hill<strong>ock</strong></em><br />
			etc.</li>
				<li>Largeness: marking with an augmentative<br />
				English has, for example, the unmarked:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; byte<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; market<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inflation</em><br />
				and the marked forms:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>mega</strong>byte<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>super</strong>market<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>hyper</strong>inflation</em></li>
			</ol>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td valign="middle">
					<img alt="flags" height="100" src="../../images/flags_world100.jpg" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					Most other languages have parallel forms but the details 
					vary.&nbsp; Germanic languages deploy suffixes for 
					diminutives and prefixes for augmentatives for the most part 
					but Romance and Slavic languages rely heavily on suffixes for 
					both markers.</td>

			<p>Pronouns, in English, are marked in four ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>For number, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I </em>vs. <em>we</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>he</em> vs. <em>they</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>For gender, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>she</em> vs. <em>he</em></li>
				<li>For person, e.g.:<br /><em>me </em>vs. <em>your </em>vs<em>. their<br />
				</em>etc<em>.</em></li>
				<li>For case, e.g.:<br />
				<em>I</em> vs. <em>me</em> vs. <em>my</em> vs. <em>mine</em><br />
				<em>you</em> vs. <em>your</em> vs. <em>yours</em><br />
				etc.</li>

			determiners is notably defective however, having no plural form for 
			the third person <em>you</em> or any distinction for gender with <em>
			they</em> and so on.</p>

					Other languages have much more complete and complex systems and may also include 
			markers for polite forms (with the familiar being the unmarked) and 
			may distinguish gender in the first person.&nbsp; Japanese, 
					famously, has a fiendishly complicated pronoun system in 
					which formality and number along with gender (but not case) 
					are marked in various ways.<br />
					Many languages, including Cantonese, French, Bulgarian, 
					Italian, German and a host of others, distinguish between <em>
					you</em> plural and <em>you</em> singular.&nbsp; English is, 
					in fact, unusual in not doing so.&nbsp; Many of these 
					languages will also distinguish between <em>you</em> as a 
					plural denoting females and <em>you</em> denoting more than 
					one male.&nbsp; Mixed-gender groups, as is the way of 
					things, are usually, not invariably, denoted by the plural for males.<br />
					Other languages, such as Korean, have a very reduced pronoun 
					system with Korean, in particular, having no pronoun for 
					third-person entities so the repetition of names or titles 
					is commonplace where it would be stylistically unacceptable 
					in most languages.<br />
					To add complications, some languages, such as Vietnamese and 
					other East-Asian languages, have different plural forms of 
					the first person to indicated whether the addressee is 
					included or not (i.e., a different form for <em>we excluding 
					you</em> and <em>we including you</em>) and also to indicate 
					assumed or real social status.</td>

			<h4>Sexist marking<br />
			<img alt="blue pink" height="133" src="../../images/blue_pink_sexism200.jpg" width="200" /></h4>
			<p>It is increasingly difficult in English to get away with using a 
			third-person pronoun which is not marked.&nbsp; In less sensitive 
			times, the unmarked form of the singular, third-person pronoun was 
			almost invariably <em>he, him, his</em> with <em>she, her, hers</em> only used to mark 
			gender.&nbsp; So sentences such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When a new student arrives, he may feel a bit lost</em><br />
			were common enough and understood to be unmarked for gender but are now superseded by, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When new students arrive, they may feel a bit 
			lost</em><br />
			(because English conveniently does not mark the plural form for 
			gender as many languages do)<br />
			or even the grammatically challenged:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a new student arrives, they may feel a 
			bit lost.</em></p>
			<p>The lack of an unmarked pronoun form in English has led to a good 
			deal of heart searching and avoidance strategies by authors who do 
			not wish to offend the grammatically or culturally sensitive.<br />
			It has also led, for example, to the use of morphologically 
			questionable substitutes such as <em>themself</em> as an unmarked 
			reflexive pronoun.<br />
			For more, see 
			the guide to personal pronouns or the guide to gender linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
			This is a complex and controversial area.</p>

			<p>Although English does not mark adjectives or adverbs for number, 
			case or gender (as very many languages do), the language does have 
			marked and unmarked forms of adjectives and adverbs.</p>
			<p>So the natural unmarked forms are as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How <strong>often</strong> do you come?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How <strong>old</strong> is your brother?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the food <strong>good</strong> here?</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How <strong>long</strong> is the journey?</em><br />
			rather than the marked forms as in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How <strong>seldom</strong> do you come?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How <strong>young</strong> is your brother?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the food <strong>bad</strong> here?</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How <strong>short</strong> is the journey?</em><br />
			which are all premised on the speaker's <em>a priori </em>assumptions about frequency, age, quality 
			and length, respectively.</p>
			<p>Any adjective or adverb which has a negating affix will, usually, 
			be the marked form.&nbsp; So, e.g.,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>imperfect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unreliable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unfashionable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hopeless</em><br />
			are all marked forms and asking<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; How imperfect / unreliable / unfashionable / hopeless is 
			it?</em><br />
			presupposes that something or someone is not <em>perfect</em>, <em>reliable</em>, 
			<em>fashionable</em> or <em>hopeful</em>.</p>
			<p>Adjectives are, also, marked morphologically or by the use of 
			periphrastic constructions for degree so we have the base form (or 
			positive) unmarked and the comparative and superlative forms marked 
			for degree.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; big-bigger-biggest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; far-further-furthest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enjoyable-more enjoyable-most enjoyable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comfortable-more comfortable-most comfortable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting-more interesting-most interesting</em><br />
			etc.</p>

					<h2>Verbs</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>English is again somewhat unusual in the ways verbs are marked.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>For person and number:<br />
				Apart from the deeply irregular verb <em>be</em> (which is 
				inconsistently marked for person and number in both the present and the past), and the 
				verb <em>have</em> (which is marked in the present only for number and person), English only 
				marks the third person singular (with -<em>s</em>) in the 
				present:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; we drive → he drive<strong>s</strong><br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				In the past tenses, there is no distinction for person or number 
				so all forms (bar the past of be, which is marked, albeit 
				inconsistently for number) appear unmarked:<br />
				<em>I / you / he / she / it / we / you / they / <strong>drove</strong>.</em><br />
				The lack of inflexion for person and number results in some 
				circumlocution in English with expressions such as:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Both of you left too early</em><br />
				which, in other languages, are unnecessary because the pronoun 
				is marked for number.</li>
				<li>For tense:<br />
				The marked form for the past tense is, regularly, the -<em>ed</em> 
				or -<em>d</em> 
				suffix, of course, but there are some 650 irregular verbs which 
				are marked (or not) in different ways (often with a vowel 
				alteration (apophony) or a consonant change / addition).<br />
				Unusually, English does not mark a verb for other tenses 
				although there are changes to form past participles.</li>
				<li>For aspect:<br />
				English uses a periphrastic form to make perfect aspects, leaving the 
				verb only marked for past participle as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has finished</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They have fallen</em><br />
				Confusingly for many, English marks a range of aspects 
				with a single form, the -<em>ing</em> ending.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's been talking for ages</em> (durative aspect)<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was calling on and off all morning</em> (iterative aspect)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's writing a new play</em> (progressive aspect)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather is getting cold</em> (continuous aspect)<br />
				and marks the verbal noun or gerund in the same way:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; His writing is appalling</em></li>
				<li>For interrogatives, emphasis and negatives:<br />
				English is again unusual in using an operator to mark past 
				simple and present simple questions and negatives with <em>do</em> 
				as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know the time?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have a watch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you see that?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't believe it</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				The operator is also available in English to make a statement 
				emphatic as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do think that's true<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did want to come</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				and that sort of emphatic form is not available in other 
				languages, either, being replaced by intonation or punctuation 
				markers.&nbsp; At lower levels in particular, learners may miss 
				the emphatic intention of the speak altogether.</li>

					<strong>Person and number</strong>:<br />
				Inflecting languages, such as French, German, Italian etc. will, 
				to greater or lesser degrees, mark person and number in the 
					present, past 
				and future forms.&nbsp; They may also mark formality.<br />
					<strong>Aspect</strong>:<br />
					Languages often reserve distinct markers for the 
				aspects discussed above (and others) so the verb forms for 
					continuous, iterative, durative and so on aspects will vary 
					accordingly.&nbsp; Learners may well be confused by the fact that the 
				English -<em>ing</em> form represents a range of aspects and, 
				incidentally, the verbal noun or gerund.<br />
					<strong>Tense</strong>:<br />
					Learners whose languages routinely 
				distinguish between a tense marker and a participle marker may 
					be confused by the fact that the participle and the past 
					tense share a form in regular verbs (and many irregular 
					ones) in English.<br />
					<strong>Interrogatives and negatives</strong>:<br />
					Many languages rely on word order or only on intonation 
				and punctuation to form questions and will often form negatives 
				with a single, simple particle of some kind, such as <em>nicht</em> 
				in German or <em>then</em> in Greek.&nbsp; French is unusual in 
				using a double marker (<em>ne ... pas</em>) for the negative.</td>

			<p>There are quite rigid rules for ordering items in English which, 
			when broken, may signal a marked proposition.</p>
			<h4>Theme and rheme</h4>
			<p>In many cases, the examples which follow have to do with raising 
			an element of a proposition to the theme position in English.&nbsp; 
			There is a separate guide to theme and rheme on this site, linked 
			below, so brief definitions and a single example will serve here.<br />
			The theme of any clause or sentence is the jumping off point and 
			what follows is the rheme which expresses what happened to the theme 
			or what the theme did.<br />
			If we take a usual active sentence such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harriet fixed my computer<br />
			</em>we have the theme, <em>Harriet</em>, followed by the rheme, <em>
			repaired my computer</em>.<br />
			The theme is the point of departure for the rest of the sentence.&nbsp; 
			In texts, the rheme will often form the theme of the next clause 
			which might be:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it works much faster now<br />
			</em>in which<em> it</em> (<em>my computer</em>) is the new theme.<br />
			However, if we form the passive-voice sentence:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My computer was fixed by Harriet<br />
			</em>we have raised <em>My computer</em> to the theme position and 
			what follows, <em>was fixed by Harriet</em>, is the rheme.&nbsp; The 
			next theme is more likely to concern <em>Harriet</em> than <em>my 
			computer</em>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who has a shop in the High Street<br />
			</em>In other words, by choosing an active or passive voice 
			formulation, we have marked either <em>Harriet</em> or <em>my 
			computer</em> as the point of departure for what follows in the 
			text.<br />
			Usually, in English and most other languages, the active sentence is 
			the most frequent form and is considered unmarked.&nbsp; The passive 
			is a marked form.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>English differs from many languages in not having markers 
				for case so the ordering of constituents of clauses is marked 
				instead.&nbsp; 
				It has this in common with other languages which also have 
				isolating tendencies, such as the Chinese languages.<br />
				In 
				English, the distinction between:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem caused the long delay</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long delay caused the problem</em><br />
				is only made clear by the ordering of Subject, Verb and Object.&nbsp; This is because the canonical, i.e., expected 
				and usual, ordering is Subject – Verb – Object (if any).<br />
				Other, more obviously inflecting languages, will signal the relationship between the noun 
				phrases by alterations to the determiners or other changes.&nbsp; 
				The unmarked form in each case, whether signalled by morphology 
				or word ordering is the nominative or subject case.<br />
				Departures from canonical word order are always marked so the 
				distinction in emphasis between, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book I want to read</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to read this book</em><br />
				is marked by the unusual word ordering in the first case.<br />
				Another way of seeing this is to note that the object in the 
				first example has been raised to the topical theme position and 
				that, in English, often marks it.</li>
				<li>Other items can also be moved in English to express markedness of some 
				form.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seldom go to London</em><br />
				is an unmarked utterance, but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seldom do I go to London</em><br />
				is marked for emphasis by both the ordering of items and 
				structural changes.<br />
				Cleft sentences such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>What she liked most was the hotel</em><br />
				also signal markedness and emphasis.<br />
				Fronting of adverbials such as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; On your desk you will find the book you need</em><br />
				also signal markedness of some form.<br />
				For more, see the guides to
				cleft 
				sentences and
				fronting, both linked in the list of related guides at the end.</li>
				<li>End weighting:<br />
				The general rule in English is that more complex and longer 
				phrases are placed towards the end of the sentence so we prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was delayed by the heavy and 
				persistent snow which fell overnight and froze the tracks</em><br />
				to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heavy and persistent snow which fell 
				overnight and froze the tracks delayed the train<br />
				</em>which sounds odd to a native-speaker's ear although it is 
				grammatically faultless.<br />
				If a speaker, however, deliberately chooses to break the 
				end-weighting rule, the utterance becomes more marked.&nbsp; In 
				the second case above, the speaker has <strong>chosen</strong> 
				to mark, i.e., emphasise, the weather rather than the train's 
				delay.</li>
				<li>End focus:<br />
				Another general tendency, in English, is to place new or 
				important 
				information at the end of an utterance so we have exchanges such 
				as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always walk my dog in the park near the 
				river<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that the park with the beautiful cherry trees?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, they are lovely in the spring when the blossom is out, 
				aren't they?</em><br />
				in which the information at the end of each turn is picked up by 
				the next speaker.<br />
				If, in this case, either speaker departs from the end-focus 
				principle, the result is to lay special emphasis, i.e., to mark 
				the utterance.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The park near the river is where I always 
				walk my dog<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does she go in the water much?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, swimming is something she loves</em><br />
				in which the speakers are responding to each other's marking of 
				utterances and, thereby, producing a very different sort of 
				exchange because the first speaker sets the tone by marking <em>
				the dog</em> rather than <em>the park</em> and the second 
				speaker marks <em>the water </em>as more salient than <em>the 
				dog</em>, simply by placing the data at the end of the 
				utterance.<br />
				End focus is also at work with the dative shift (or dative 
				alternation) observable with ditransitive verbs.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sent me a letter ...</em><br />
				focuses on the direct object (<em>a letter</em>) and will 
				naturally be followed by something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and it explained the issue</em><br />
				whereas:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sent a letter to me ...</em><br />
				focuses on the indirect object (<em>me</em>) and will more 
				naturally be followed by:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and I'll write back as soon as I can.</em></li>
				<li>Anticipatory <em>it-</em> and <em>there-</em>clauses:<br />
				These are also called existential clauses in that they focus the 
				hearer / reader on the existence of something important, i.e., 
				they mark it.&nbsp; There is a separate guide to these linked in the list of related guides at the end so here a couple of examples of how English users choose 
				to shift the important information to the end of a clause will 
				be enough.<br />
				Instead of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fire in is the building</em><br />
				most native speakers would prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a fire in the building</em><br />
				because where the fire is is more important than its simple 
				existence.&nbsp; It is marked by end focus, in other words.<br />
				Similarly, instead of:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; That John can't come is a shame</em><br />
				most speakers would prefer:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a shame that John can't come</em><br />
				The act of <strong>not</strong> shifting the phrase or clause to 
				the end, of course, also constitutes a form of marking.</li>
				<li>Passive voice:<br />
				We saw above with the example of <em>Harriet</em> and <em>my 
				computer </em>that raising the object of a sentence to the 
				patient position in a passive voice structure is a way to mark 
				its importance by making it the theme of the clause.<br />
				It is not the case, therefore, that:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boys told lies<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies were told by the boys<br />
				</em>are simply alternatives with the same meaning.<br />
				In the second, passive, clause, the speaker / writer is marking 
				not <em>the boys</em> but the importance of the <em>lies</em>.&nbsp; 
				This is even more obvious when, as is often the case, we omit 
				the agent altogether and simply have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies were told.</em></li>
				<li>Cleft sentences:<br />
				Cleft sentences are another familiar way in which markedness is 
				achieved.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John brought Mary a book yesterday</em><br />
				is a simple unmarked form which can be marked for emphasis in a 
				number of ways:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was John who brought Mary a book 
				yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Mary whom John brought a book yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a book that John brought Mary yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was yesterday that John brought Mary a book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What John brought Mary yesterday was a book</em><br />
				For more on the usually recognised seven forms of cleft 
				sentences in English, see the guide linked at the end.</li>
				<li>Non-finite subject clauses<br />
				Non-finite forms such as the gerund (<em>-ing</em> form) and the
				<em>to-</em>infinitive can be raised to the subject position of 
				a clause and mark the item for special emphasis. For example:<br />
				Instead of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John is the right man to ask about this</em><br />
				we may have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right man to ask about this is John</em><br />
				and, instead of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be a shame to miss the party</em><br />
				we may have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To miss the party would be a shame</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Missing the party would be a shame</em><br />
				and instead of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy doing crosswords</em><br />
				we may have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing crosswords is something I enjoy</em></li>
				<li>Adverb ordering:<br />
				A number of adverb classes in English customarily appear in medial 
				position in clauses (which often means between the auxiliary and 
				main verbs):<br />
				Time (frequency):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have frequently questioned the 
				wisdom of that</em><br />
				Degree:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have really enjoyed meeting you</em><br />
				Certainty:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I definitely won't speak to her</em><br />
				Manner:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She carefully drove the car into the garage.</em><br />
				Shifting these adverbs either to the front for emphasis or to 
				the end, giving them more weight, produces marked utterances 
				such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequently, they have questioned the 
				wisdom of that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have questioned the wisdom of that frequently<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really, I have enjoyed meeting you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitely, I won't speak to her</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carefully, she drove the car into the 
				garage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove the car into the garage carefully</em><br />
				So, just telling learners that certain adverbs can be placed in 
				alternate positions is not doing them a service unless the 
				markedness result is made clear.</li>
				<li>
				Prepositional phrases:<br />
				Where prepositional phrases are normally placed syntactically is not a 
				simple matter as
				the guide to prepositional phrases linked in the list of related guides at the end, makes clear.&nbsp; Their 
				normal, i.e., unmarked, position depends on the function they 
				are performing.<br />
				However, when such phrases are marked, it is frequently in the 
				interests of avoiding ambiguity.<br />
				For example, in the sentence:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I spoke to the man behind the bar</em><br />
				we can understand the phrase <em>behind the bar</em> in two 
				ways:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>behind the bar</em> was where I spoke to him<br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>behind the bar</em> identifies the man I am speaking 
				about<br />
				In the first case, the phrase is prepositional and tells us
				<strong>where</strong> I spoke to the man but in the second 
				case, the phrase is post-modifying the noun <em>man</em> and 
				tells us which man is in question.&nbsp; It could be  rephrased as <em>who was behind the bar</em>.&nbsp; The object in the first 
				case is <em>the man</em> and in the second case the object is
				<em>the man behind the bar</em>.<br />
				To avoid any misunderstanding, especially in writing because 
				neither the 
				insertion of a pause nor the placement of sentence stress which can 
				help comprehension is available, users of English will often 
				move the prepositional phrase so that we get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Behind the bar, I spoke to the man</em><br />
				in which no ambiguity is evident but the prepositional phrase is 
				marked by being fronted.<br />
				When the prepositional phrase is an adjunct very closely 
				connected to the verb as in, e.g., a verb of movement and its 
				destination or a prepositional verb, the prepositional phrase is 
				rarely moved to the initial position unless some heavily marked 
				meaning is intended:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Mary marked the house on the map</em><br />
				vs.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the map Mary marked the house</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They jumped over the wall</em><br />
				vs.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the wall they jumped<br />
				</em>Finally, when a clause contains more than one adverbial 
				adjunct prepositional phrase, they are usually ordered in 
				relation to how closely connected they are to the verb phrase 
				and its object, if any.&nbsp; 
				So, for example, we get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She spoke to him in French after dinner</em><br />
				rather than<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She spoke to him after dinner in French</em><br />
				because the language she spoke in is more closely connected to 
				the verb than the time she did the speaking.<br />
				Moving the prepositional phrase to any other position marks it 
				in some way.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He walked across the park in the rain</em><br />
				which is not marked because where he walked is more closely 
				connected to the verb than the weather conditions, with<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked in the rain across the park</em><br />
				in which <em>the rain</em> has become marked for special emphasis.<br />
				It goes, almost, without saying that moving the prepositional 
				phrase rarely results in something unacceptable but learners 
				whose first languages routinely place prepositional phrases in 
				positions which are, in English, more marked, may inadvertently 
				send a signal they do not intend.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These changes to canonical word ordering, weight and focus signal markedness 
			and, almost by definition, cause problems for learners whose first 
			languages operate differently (i.e., most of them).<br />

					<strong>Case</strong>:<br />
					Languages such as German, most Slavic languages and others 
					which have case structures on nouns and determiners may 
					exhibit freer word order because the subject and object (as 
					well, often, as other relationships such as movement to or 
					away and position) are indicated by the form of the lexemes 
					and, whatever the ordering, it is always clear who did what 
					to whom (and often where and in what direction).<br />
					For example, in German the prepositional phrase <em>on the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>auf den Tisch</em><br />
					with the determiner <em>den</em> signalling movement towards 
					the table or as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>auf dem Tisch</em><br />
					with the determiner <em>dem</em> signalling static position.<br />
					For 
					more, see the guide to case linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
					<strong>End weighting and end focus</strong>:<br />
					These are not universals and many languages will not follow the principles.<br />
					This often results in some quite unnatural production from 
					learners who expect, for example, the topic to be fronted or 
					the adverb to come initially in a clause.<br />
				Learners whose first languages show topicalising tendencies 
				(such as the Chinese languages, German and Spanish) may often 
				produce language which, to a native English-speaker's ear appears 
				marked when that may not be the speaker's intention so, for 
				example, we get stylistic errors such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, I went to London</em><br />
				which is marked for specific and important time, or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restaurants? I like Italian ones best</em><br />
				which carries the marked topic.<br />
					By the same token, the non-use of <em>it</em>- and <em>there</em>-clauses 
					can also result in unnatural constructions which are 
					grammatically accurate but unusual so native-speaker hearers 
					may misinterpret the speaker's intentions, looking for why 
					something appears to be marked.&nbsp; Many languages do not 
					use parallel formulations and, even if they do, use them 
					differently.&nbsp; For example, producing:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the train is late is a shame</em><br />
					instead of<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a shame that the train is late</em><br />
					or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A party was in the hall</em><br />
					instead of<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a party in the hall</em><br />
					sends a different message concerning how the speaker intends 
					to be understood.<br />
					<strong>Adverbs</strong>:<br />
					Adverb positioning is variable across languages so learners 
					who choose to place the adverb where it would normally be in 
					an unmarked clause in their first languages may unwittingly 
					produce something clearly marked in English where no marking 
					was intended.</td>

					English, as we have seen, does not have an available pronoun

					Many European languages do have such pronouns as, for

			<p>No such resource is available to (Modern) English users so 
			politeness is routinely expressed by making words into phrases and 
			phrases into clauses.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please open the door</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks</em><br />
			are unmarked for any special deference but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you open the door for me, please?</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm really very grateful for your help</em><br />
			are both marked in this way.<br />
			It has been suggested and it seems intuitively reasonable, that the 
			lack of a T-V distinction in English has led to the development of a 
			very wide range of politeness-marked expressions whose use is subtle 
			and requires sensitivity if offence is to be avoided.&nbsp; 
			Over-polite expressions may be perceived as sarcastic or ironically 
			intended, for example.<br />
			In particular, naturally, many of these marked expressions are 
			commonplace in requests, offers and expressions of thanks or 
			acceptance.</p>

			<h4>Stress:</h4>
			<p>We can add markedness to almost any utterance by 
			speaking more loudly or laying special emphasis on words or parts of 
			sentences.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to London with my brother</em><br />
			would normally be spoken with the main stress on <em>London</em> as 
			this forms the core of the information and there may be another or secondary 
			stress on <em>brother</em> because that, too, may be heard as new information 
			because of its end position.&nbsp; However, if the 
			speaker lays special stress as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went <strong>TO</strong> London with my brother</em> 
			(i.e., not <em>from</em> London)<br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to London with <strong>MY</strong> 
			brother </em>(i.e., not <em>someone else's</em> brother)<br />
			then the sentences are being phonologically marked to signal the way 
			the speaker wishes to be understood.</p>
			<p>Word stress, rather than sentence stress, can also be used to 
			mark items.&nbsp; For example, the verb <em>export</em> is stressed 
			on the second syllable but the noun is stressed on the first 
			syllable [/ˈɪk.spɔːt/ vs. /ɪk.ˈspɔːt/].&nbsp; Additionally, the 
			vowel may be weakened when the stress falls on the second syllable 
			so we get, e.g., the word <em>compound</em> pronounced as /kəm.ˈpaʊnd/ as a 
			verb but as /ˈkɒm.paʊnd/ as a noun.&nbsp; There are around 150 more 
			pairs of this sort.&nbsp; (There's a list in the guide to word stress linked in the list of related guides at the end.)<br />
			Which form represents the marked one is less obvious but the usual 
			assumption is that the noun/adjective form is unmarked and the verb 
			is marked.</p>
			<h4>Consonants and vowels</h4>
			<p>There is, however, even more to it than that.&nbsp; Some 
			linguists have proposed, for example, that voicing of consonants is 
			a form of marking so, for example, /v/ is more marked than /f/, /b/ 
			more than /p/ and so on.<br />
			For example, in English, the word <em>wife</em> is pronounced with 
			an unvoiced consonant [as /waɪf/] but the plural carries two voiced 
			consonants, /v/ and /z/ [as /waɪvz/], hence marking the plural.<br />
			If, indeed, marked forms are more difficult to acquire in a foreign 
			language, then we would expect some learners to produce the plural 
			as /waɪfs/ and that is, in fact what we often find.&nbsp; Even after 
			the /v/ sound has been acquired here, the result is often /waɪvs/.<br />
			The same considerations are said to apply to vowel sounds with, 
			e.g., a high, back vowel such as /u:/ being unmarked and a vowel such 
			as /ʌ/ (which is a low, central vowel) being more highly marked.<br />
			The implication is clear: we need to focus our teaching more on the 
			most marked sounds and can more safely assume that unmarked ones, 
			such as /p/, /t/, /k/, /s/ and /n/ will be less troublesome, because 
			they are common to most languages, than the 
			marked sounds /b/, /d/, /ɡ/, /z/ and /ŋ/, which occur less 
			frequently and are wholly missing from many languages.<br />
			Equally, the vowel sounds /æ/, /ʌ/ and /ɜː/ require more attention than /ʊ/, /ɒ/ 
			and /iː/ as teachers of learners whose first languages do not have 
			the sounds can attest.<br />
			This is a somewhat speculative conclusion, in all honesty, but does 
			agree with some, albeit anecdotal, evidence.</p>
			<h4>Intonation</h4>
			<p>It has been asserted that falling intonation across an utterance 
			in English is more common than any other contour and it is certainly 
			true that simple declarative statements show this characteristic.&nbsp; 
			For example, the intonation contour on:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He went to the cinema in the evening</em><br />
			can be described as starting at a mid tone, rising slightly on the 
			key information (<em>cinema</em>) and then falling quite sharply, thus:<br />
			<img alt="normal" height="61" src="../../imagesgraphics/marked_intonation_normal.png" width="310" /><br />
			However, if the intonation changes to:<br />
			<img alt="surprise" height="86" src="../../imagesgraphics/marked_intonation_surprise.png" width="310" /><br />
			then the sentence sounds like an astonished, unbelieving question 
			and might have ??!! at the end and <strong>HE</strong> in bold 
			capital letters in writing.<br />
			Any deviation from the falling contour in English would, in this 
			analysis, constitute markedness.<br />
			It need not be so extreme as the example illustrated here, of course, as a simple rise at the end 
			denoting doubt or the emphasising of the word <em>cinema</em> would constitute a form of markedness of an interrogative or 
			special stress realised through intonation.<br />
			Even something as simple as keeping a level tone rather than falling 
			towards the end of a sentence is marked for the speaker's intention 
			not to be interrupted.</p>

			<p>The discussion of markedness would not be complete without 
			reference to a singular peculiarity of English: transferred 
			negation.&nbsp; For more on this, see the 
			guide to negation in English linked in the list of related guides at the end.&nbsp; Here, a few examples will 
			suffice.</p>
			<p>In English, the following are <strong>unmarked</strong> in terms 
			of the assumptions made by the speaker and expectations aroused in 
			the hearer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think he's coming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't believe he would agree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't expect he would arrive early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't suppose you can help, can you?</em></p>
			<p>In these cases, there is a logical problem: the wrong part of 
			the sentence is being negated.&nbsp; In other words, the negation is 
			transferred from the subordinate clause, where it logically belongs, 
			to the main clause.&nbsp; In the last example, the question-tag form 
			gives this away because a positive tag like <em>can you?</em> 
			should, normally, follow a negative clause so the speaker sees the 
			clause <em>you can help</em> as negative rather than positive.&nbsp; 
			That is deeply non-intuitive for many.<br />
			Some learners may even try to make the tag as <em>do I?</em> because 
			that would be the natural one to follow the negative main clause.</p>

					<img alt="flags" height="100" src="../../images/flags_world100.jpg" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					In other languages, no such transfer is possible or, when it is, 
			denotes some special markedness of the clause.&nbsp; Speakers of 
			these languages will naturally produce, then:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he isn't coming<br />
			</em>which <strong>in English </strong>implies that it's only my opinion and others may differ<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believed he wouldn't agree<br />
			</em>which <strong>in English </strong>implies that I was proved right<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She expected he wouldn't arrive early<br />
			</em>which <strong>in English </strong>implies that her expectation was fulfilled<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose you can't help, can you?<br />
			</em>which suggests <strong>in English </strong>the speaker is expecting a negative response<br />and in all these cases, in English, these are <strong>marked</strong> 
			forms.&nbsp; The hearer is attuned to some form of markedness 
					concerning the speaker's view of events in 
			each case.<br />
			These forms in some other languages are <strong>unmarked</strong> so a speaker of English 
			as a Second Language may well send the wrong signals by not using 
			transferred negation in English and raising unwarranted expectations 
					in the hearer concerning the speaker's view of an event or 
					situation.<br />
