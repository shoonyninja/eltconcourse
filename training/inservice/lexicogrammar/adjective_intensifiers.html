	<h1>Intensifying adjectives: emphasisers, amplifiers, downtoners (and

		<p>Intensifying adjectives 
		have some unique characteristics, as we shall see, so deserve special 
		attention.&nbsp; They are also extremely common, especially in spoken 
		language, and their mastery can significantly enhance our learners' 
		communicative powers.</p>

		<p>Any search of the web for intensifying adjectives will 
		produce some pretty odd results.</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>In many cases, they will be 
		wrongly (or even not) classified, wrongly described or not intensifying 
		adjectives at all.</li>
			<li>One site has a long list of adjectives falsely 
		classified as intensifiers which includes, for example, <em>delicious, 
		enjoyable, wicked </em>etc. (which are all perfectly normal adjectives) 
		mixed in with some true intensifiers such as <em>utter</em> and <em>sheer</em>.</li>
			<li>Many will also assert that intensifying 
		adjectives can <strong>only</strong> be used with abstract nouns.&nbsp; 
		It is certainly true that they are often used this way, but that 
		assertion would make <em>he's a real hero </em>wrong, and it isn't, of 
		course.</li>
			<li>Some sites seem to equate intensifying adjectives with 
			ungradable or extreme adjectives and include, therefore, adjectives like 
			<em>fascinating</em>, <em>hilarious</em> and so on.&nbsp; That is 
			wrong and deeply unhelpful.</li>
			<li>Many of the above and some others for good measure assume 
			naïvely that intensifying must mean something like 'making 
			stronger'.&nbsp; In non-technical uses of the word that's quite 
			right but this is not a non-technical area.&nbsp; In our sense, the 
			word intensifying applies to changing the intensity of something and 
			that can mean strengthening it, weakening it or limiting it.<br />
			This is not a universally accepted definition of the term 
			intensifying adjective because some stick to the idea that by 
			definition an intensifier must make the modified element stronger or 
			more intense.&nbsp; Here, we don't.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The following attempts to avoid these pitfalls.&nbsp; It covers those 
		adjectives which are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Emphasisers</strong> which enhance the quality of 
				the noun, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was <span class="style_black"><strong>
				plain</strong></span> stupidity</em></li>
				<li><strong>Amplifiers</strong> which scale the quality of the 
				noun upwards, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a <span class="style_black">
				<strong>great</strong></span> fan of hers.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Downtoners</strong> which reduce the strength of the 
				noun's quality, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told a <span class="style_black">
				<strong>feeble</strong></span> joke</em></li>
				<li><strong>Limiters</strong> which restrict the sense of the 
				noun, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span class="style_black"><strong>
				main</strong></span> reason I went to London was to see her</em></li>
			</ol>
		<p>An allied area is the discussion of adverb intensifiers such as <em>
		very, extremely, slightly, rather</em> etc. to which there is
		another guide on this site, linked below.</p>

		<p>Before we get to intensifying adjectives themselves, we need to make 
		two distinctions concerning types of adjectives.</p>

		<p>If you have followed the 
		guide to adjectives, linked below, on this site, you may be familiar with 
		these terms.&nbsp; However, here's a reminder.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>epithets</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>are what we understand generally when we use the term 
			'adjective'.&nbsp; They serve to modify the noun, rather than classify 
			it.&nbsp; For example, we can say <em>it's a fast car, 
			it's an expensive car, it's the slowest car, it's a beautiful 
			flower, it's a blue flower</em> and so on.&nbsp; We can also use adjectives predicatively in, e.g., <em>the car is expensive, 
			the flower is blue</em> etc.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>classifiers</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>don't work like this.&nbsp; We can, for example, have <em>a 
			saloon car, a racing car, a rent car</em> and so on.&nbsp; 
			It is, however, not possible to have <em>*the most saloon car, *the 
			very racing car, *the rentest car, *the car is rent</em> and so 
			on.&nbsp; These modifiers (which are often nouns) classify rather 
			than describe.&nbsp; Classifiers are only used attributively.&nbsp; 
			We cannot have, for example, <em>*the car is saloon</em>.<br />
			Classifiers are often called noun adjuncts but on this site, they 
			usually aren't.</dd>

				<h3>inherent and non-inherent adjectives</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>If you have followed the 
		guide to adjectives on this site, you may also be familiar 
		with these terms.&nbsp; However, here's another reminder.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>inherent adjectives</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>refer directly to the noun.&nbsp; For example, in the phrase <em>
			an old woman</em>, the adjective is inherent in the noun <em>woman</em>.&nbsp; 
			We can have, therefore, <em>an old </em>woman and <em>the woman is 
			old</em>.&nbsp; In other words, the adjective can be used 
			attributively (in the first case) or predicatively (in the second 
			case).<br />
			This is important when we are considering intensifying adjectives 
			because, as we shall see, some adjectives function as amplifiers to 
			refer to an inherent quality and in these cases, may be used both 
			attributively and predicatively.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>non-inherent adjectives</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>refer to something connected to the noun but not a 
			characteristic of it <em>per se</em>.&nbsp; For example, we can have
			<em>the wrong candidate </em>and <em>the candidate is wrong</em> but 
			these have a different meanings.<br />
			The first means<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the candidate is the wrong person for the position<br />
			</em>the 
			second means<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the candidate is mistaken / has made an error</em>.<br />
			Similarly, you can have <em>an old friend</em> but that can mean two 
			things:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the friend is old<br />
			</em>which is an inherent characteristic of 
			the person, and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the friendship is long standing<br />
			</em>which is a 
			non-inherent characteristic referring to the friendship, not the 
			person.<br />
			Conventionally, non-inherent adjectives cannot be used predicatively 
			and retain the same meaning but there are exceptions to this, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a new member of the club<br />
			</em>can also be expressed as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the member is new<br />
			</em>and that is a predicative use of a non-inherent adjective.</dd>

				make sure you've got them clear</a>.</p>

		<h2>Intensifying adjectives type 1: emphasisers</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Emphasisers are quite easy to master because they only have a 
		reinforcing or heightening effect on the noun.&nbsp; This can mean 
		making a positive sense stronger as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a great hit</em><br />
		or we can make a negative aspect weaker as in, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a mere triviality<br />
		</em>This second example is not a sense of downtoning 
		because the effect is to emphasise a negative quality.&nbsp; In other 
		words, it makes whatever is the subject <strong>more</strong> trivial 
		not less so.</p>
		<p>There are three 
		characteristics to note:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>They are almost always used attributively: we can have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the 
			outright loss<br />
			</em>but not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the loss is outright</em></li>
			<li>They have homonyms which can confuse our learners: we can have<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pure lie<br />
			</em>in the sense of <em>complete</em> but not:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*the lie was pure<br />
			</em>However, we
			<span class="style_underline">can</span> have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pure water<br />
			</em>in the sense of <em>unpolluted</em> and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the water was pure<br />
			</em>in the same sense.<br />
			We can also have, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a certain loser<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sure loser<br />
			</em>which are both attributive uses as emphasisers.<br />
			However, when we use the adjectives predicatively, the sense 
			changes.&nbsp; In:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man is certain / sure<br />
			</em>the adjectives 
			cannot be used attributively and retain the same sense at 
			all.</li>
			<li>many are usually ungradable.&nbsp; We cannot have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a merer quibble<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a more utter idiot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a realer problem</em><br />
			but some are routinely gradable so we do allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a surer bet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a more definite objection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a truer distinction</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			More on this follows.</li>

			<p>† As was noted above, the adjective <em>real</em> is polysemous 
			in that it can act as an emphasiser in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a real help.&nbsp; Thanks.</em><br />
			and it acts to signal that something is factual as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a real antique, not a copy.<br />
			</em>The adverb has a similar dual nature, incidentally.</p>
			<p>The word <em>incredible</em> is not in the list above although in 
			casual (and not so casual) speech, it has lately come to mean 
			something like <em>sheer, true</em> or <em>utter</em>.<br />
			It really means <em>unbelievable</em>, of course, and is used as a 
			simple adjective in, e.g., <em>an incredible excuse.</em>&nbsp; 
			Partly, the use of emphasisers such as this is a matter of fashion 
			and some words, such as <em>terrible, spiffing</em> and so on fall 
			in and out of fashion over time.&nbsp; This one will eventually go 
			that way, too.<br />
			In advertising speak, the word means something like <em>arguably 
			quite good but probably not</em>.</p>

			<p>It is probably safest, in the classroom, to prefer the 
			attributive use, as you can see.</p>
			<p>We need to be slightly careful when calling an item a downtoner 
			because when the noun itself carries a negative meaning, some of 
			these words act to amplify the sense rather than tone it down.&nbsp; 
			For example in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a trifling insignificance</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a petty inconsequentiality</em><br />
			the adjectives increase the sense of the nouns and are, therefore, 
			amplifiers.</p>
			<p>Unlike emphasisers and amplifiers, few of these adjectives have 
			derived adverb forms which can function in the same way.<br />
			One may be able to talk of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a feebly convincing excuse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a poorly argued point<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a slightly unpleasant experience</em><br />
			but <em>tiny, minor, slender</em> and <em>small</em> do not have 
			derived adverbs functioning as downtoners.&nbsp; For words which 
			perform that function as adverbs, see the guide to intensifying 
			adverbs linked below.</p>

			<p>All modification is, to some extent, constrained by semantic

			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Emphasisers<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>certain</em> and <em>sure</em> refer frequently to 
					possible results (<em>sure outcome, certain winner </em>
					etc.)</li>
					<li><em>definite, clear </em>and <em>real</em> often refer 
					to identifying issues (<em>definite problem, real 
					complication, clear mistake</em> etc.)</li>
					<li><em>true</em> and <em>pure</em> are often positive 
					expressions (<em>true love, pure kindness</em>) but can be 
					used ironically (<em>true idiocy, pure foolishness</em>)</li>
					<li><em>mere</em> always collocates with small items (<em>mere 
					slip, mere quibble </em>etc.)</li>
					<li><em>sheer</em> and <em>utter</em> are often used with 
					negative ideas (<em>sheer madness, utter lunacy</em> etc.) 
					but are used positively, too (<em>sheer brilliance, utter 
					mastery </em>etc.)</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Amplifiers<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li><em>absolute</em> collocates with notions such as <em>
					power, authority, control </em>etc. and can be used to mean
					<em>sheer</em> or <em>utter</em> (<em>absolute madness</em> 
					etc.)</li>
					<li><em>close</em> is generally used to describe decisions (<em>close 
					call, close verdict, close election </em>etc.)</li>
					<li><em>great</em> collocates quite widely (<em>power, 
					mistake, help </em>etc.)</li>
					<li><em>perfect</em> and <em>complete</em> generally 
					collocate with positive ideas (<em>success, triumph, skill, 
					achievement </em>etc.) but are also used ironically with 
					negative notions (<em>perfect stupidity, complete failure
					</em>etc.)</li>
					<li><em>firm</em> only collocates with nouns applicable to 
					people (<em>firm supporter, firm believer</em> etc.)</li>
				</ul>

					<li><em>feeble </em>and<em> poor </em>are always negative (<em>feeble

					<li><em>only</em> and <em>sole</em> are quite extreme 
					limiters for feelings and mental constructs (<em>only

		<p>Whether we trouble learners with terms such as inherent and 
		non-inherent, classifier and epithet, the concepts behind these terms 
		are important or we will encourage errors like:</p>
		<p class="auto-style31"><em>*that supporter is firm<br />
		*the problem was definite<br />
		*his stupidity was pure<br />
		*the relative was close</em></p>
		<h3>Classifier or Epithet?</h3>
		<p>Getting the distinction clear between classifiers (also known as a 
		noun adjuncts) and epithets is often 
		one of raising awareness.&nbsp; Many students, and teachers regrettably, 
		have never thought about the area at all and assume that all noun 
		pre-modifiers are adjectives of some sort.</p>
		<p>A good beginning is to discuss with learners which of the following 
		are acceptable and which are wrong and then go on to see why this is the 
		case.</p>
		<table cellspacing="0" class="auto-style25">
			<tr class="style_black">
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>Example</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>Right or Wrong?</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 236px"><em>Why?</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>his is a fast horse but mine is 
				faster</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24">&nbsp;</td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 236px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>he has a race horse but mine is 
				more race</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24">&nbsp;</td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 236px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>I have a woollen jacket but hers is 
				more woollen</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24">&nbsp;</td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 236px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>it was a brick wall</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24">&nbsp;</td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 236px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>the wall was brick</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24">&nbsp;</td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 236px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>and so on.&nbsp; Most languages exhibit the distinction between 
		epithets and classifiers so conceptually this is not hard to handle.</p>
		<h3>Inherent or Non-inherent?</h3>
		<p>Distinguishing between inherent and non-inherent uses of adjectives 
		is more difficult because it is the meaning which changes rather than 
		the form being always noticeably inaccurate.<br />
		One approach is to get learners to spot the difference between two 
		phrases such as:</p>
		<table cellspacing="0" class="auto-style25">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style26" colspan="3"><em>Are these all correct?&nbsp; 
				What's the difference in meaning?</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24">Example 1</td>
				<td class="auto-style24">Example 2</td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 286px">What's the 
				difference in meaning?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>he's an old school friend</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>my school friend is old</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 286px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>he is the wrong teacher</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>the teacher is wrong</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 286px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>that was a perfect lie</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>the lie was perfect</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 286px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>a certain man was here</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>the man was certain</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 286px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>my old teacher</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>my teacher is old</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 286px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>a definite achievement</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>the achievement was definite</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 286px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>that was complete rudeness</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>that rudeness was complete</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 286px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>that's total stupidity</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>that stupidity is total</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 286px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>he's the right person</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>that person is right</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 286px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>it was sheer nonsense</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24"><em>the nonsense was sheer</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style24" style="width: 286px">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>and so on.&nbsp; The issue here is that languages do not handle 
		distinctions between inherent and non-inherent use in similar ways, and 
		some do not distinguish at all, so a discussion on the differences in 
		meaning can be very fruitful.</p>
