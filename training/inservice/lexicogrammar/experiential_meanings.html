			<h1>Functional grammar: experiential meanings</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="mammoth" height="207" src="../../images/animals_mammouth_man310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>One central function of language is to picture reality to others.<br />
			Things, events and circumstances are encoded into language through 
			three types of constituents of clauses:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Who or what?</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are called the <strong>participants</strong> in a 
				clause</dd>
				<dt><strong>Did what?</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is the pivot of the clause: the <strong>verbal process</strong></dd>
				<dt><strong>When, where, to what extent, as what? etc.</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are the <strong>circumstances</strong>.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>These three constituents of a clause are, naturally, intimately 
			connected but the core remains the Process: what happened, who did 
			what, who felt what? and so on.<br />
			One way to picture the relationship is:<br />
			<img alt="experiential" height="223" src="../../imagesgraphics/experiential.png" width="310" /><br />
			At the core lie the Processes without which nothing else can be 
			said.</p>
			<p>There are four main ways that these constituents can co-occur:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We can have the simple Participant-Process clause such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog barked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house will be redecorated<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I drank</em><br />
				etc. in which the only participant is what would be called the 
				subject in other analyses.</li>
				<li>We can combine that with a second Participant so we get, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog bit me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house pleased her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I drank the beer<br />
				</em>in which there are two participants, the subject and the 
				direct object.</li>
				<li>We can add a Circumstance to the first pattern and get, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog barked all night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house will be redecorated by George<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I drank in the garden</em></li>
				<li>We can combine the Process with two Participants and a 
				Circumstance<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog bit me in the arm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house pleased her immensely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I drank the beer in the garden</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is possible for some verbs to take three processes in all so 
			we might have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave the man the money on Thursday</em></p>
			<p>It is also possible to for some clauses to project another clause 
			so we may encounter:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me that she loved the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary said the dog was hungry</em></p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There is a much fuller guide to verbal processes linked at the 
			end of this page.&nbsp; For now, it will be enough to exemplify the 
			three major types and the two sub-categories in each:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Doing processes<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>Material:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;The house caught fire</em></li>
					<li>Behavioural:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary coughed</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Projecting processes<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>Mental:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;She enjoyed the concert</em></li>
					<li>Verbal:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; She told me that she enjoyed the concert</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Being processes<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>Existential:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a man at the door</em></li>
					<li>Relational:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The house belongs to Mary</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="3" height="166" src="../../images/three_women_pose250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Participants</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>With each Process type come specific participant roles and we now 
			turn to these.</p>
			<p>With most Material processes we have Actors, Goals and 
			Beneficiaries.&nbsp; Here are some examples of how they take on the 
			roles of Participants with Material processes:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Actors:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary left</em><br />
				Here, <em>Mary</em> is the sole Participant and she is the Actor but the 
				Actor need not be a person so we can also have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house collapsed</em><br />
				and <em>The house</em> is the sole actor in this case.</li>
				<li>Actors with Goals:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The child cooked the dinner</em><br />
				Here, <em>the child </em>is the Actor and <em>the dinner </em>is the Goal of the 
				Process.</li>
				<li>Goals with Actors<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dinner was cooked by the child</em><br />
				Here, the roles are reversed structurally but not functionally.&nbsp; 
				<em>The child</em> is still the Actor and the Goal is still <em>the dinner</em>.</li>
				<li>Goals without Actors<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dinner was cooked</em><br />
				Here, there is no actor (and it's worth asking why) but <em>the 
				dinner </em>remains the Goal of the Process.</li>
				<li>Actors with Beneficiaries<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cooked dinner for my sister</em><br />
				Here, we have an Actor (<em>I</em>), a Beneficiary (<em>my sister</em>) and a Goal 
				(<em>dinner</em>).</li>
				<li>Actors with Range<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fred climbed the tree</em><br />
				In which <em>the tree</em> is the Range, not a Goal or 
				Beneficiary because it is unaffected by the process.&nbsp; 
				Compare:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fred pruned the tree</em><br />
				in which <em>the tree</em> is the Goal, not the Range because it 
				is changed by the process.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With Behavioural Processes we have, unsurprisingly, a Behaver and 
			something which is generally called the Range which is separate from 
			the Behaver.&nbsp; Behavers are either conscious entities or a 
			personification of something unconscious that is perceived as 
			conscious metaphorically.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Behaver alone:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wept</em><br />
				Only <em>She</em> is the Behaver here.</li>
				<li>Behaver plus Circumstance:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>My dog sleeps in his kennel</em><br />
				Here, <em>My dog </em>is the Behaver and <em>in the kennel</em> is a Circumstance</li>
				<li>Behaver plus Range:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John criticised the film</em><br />
				in which the Behaver is <em>John</em> and<em> the film </em>is 
				the Range.&nbsp; In some analyses, the Range may be called the 
				Phenomenon.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With Mental Processes&nbsp;we also have an aptly named main 
			Participant, the Senser.&nbsp; The other Participants of Mental 
			processes are either Phenomena or Projected clauses.&nbsp; For 
			example:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Senser plus Phenomenon:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary understands the problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane heard the man knocking at the door</em></li>
				<li>Senser plus Projected clause:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter wondered why I was late</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With Verbal Processes we have Sayers, Receivers, Projected 
			clauses and Verbiage (what is said).&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Sayer plus Verbiage:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary said her prayers</em></li>
				<li>Sayer plus Projected clause:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They asked where I was going</em></li>
				<li>Sayer plus Verbiage plus Receiver<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told the children a story</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With Existential Processes, there is only one Participant: the 
			Existent.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a shop on the corner</em><br />
			in which <em>a shop</em> is the Existent and <em>on the corner </em>
			is a Circumstance.</p>
			<p>Relational Processes are more complicated but usually, the main 
			Participant is the Carrier and the Attribute.&nbsp; There is also a 
			distinction between the Identifier and the Identified.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Carrier plus attribute<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a new problem</em><br />in which 
				<em>That</em> is the Carrier and <em>a new problem</em> is the Attribute.</li>
				<li>Identified and 
			Identifiers.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My bedroom is the first door on the left</em><br />in which 
				<em>My bedroom</em> is the Identified and <em>the first door on the left</em> 
			is the Identifier.</li>
				<li>We can reverse the process and have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first door on the left is my bedroom</em><br />in which the Identifier comes first and the Identified comes second.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>There is, linked below, a separate guide to the area of 
			Circumstances.&nbsp; Here, therefore, we'll just summarise the area 
			briefly.<br />
			The usual way in which Circumstances are encoded in the language is 
			via a prepositional phrase or another kind of adverbial (including 
			simple adverbs).<br />
			Circumstances set the process in a context.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>How long, far, many times?</dt>
				<dd><em>for a year<br />
				to the end of the road<br />
				in two kilometres</em></dd>
				<dt>Where and when?</dt>
				<dd><em>in the bathroom<br />
				before dinner<br />
				at 6 o'clock</em></dd>
				<dt>If what?</dt>
				<dd><em>if it rained<br />
				without good luck<br />
				in case she called</em></dd>
				<dt>Why?</dt>
				<dd><em>to get better<br />
				since that was how it was<br />
				so it would be easier</em></dd>
				<dt>With whom?</dt>
				<dd><em>alone<br />
				with his sister<br />
				without a friend</em></dd>
				<dt>What about?</dt>
				<dd><em>about the war<br />
				on the meaning of life<br />
				concerning the letter</em></dd>
				<dt>As what?</dt>
				<dd><em>as the captain<br />
				in the role of a colleague<br />
				being a friend</em></dd>
				<dt>How?</dt>
				<dd><em>by bus<br />
				loudly<br />
				by post</em></dd>
				<dt>What with?</dt>
				<dd><em>with a hammer<br />
				using a chair<br />
				with my help</em></dd>
				<dt>What like?</dt>
				<dd><em>like a maniac<br />
				as if he were angry<br />
				as quick as a flash</em></dd>
				<dt>According to whom?</dt>
				<dd><em>for John<br />
				according to her<br />
				to me</em></dd>

					<h2>Implications for learners and learning</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>One of the problems with using a traditional grammar in 
			classrooms is that the learners have no way of knowing what sorts of 
			verbs go with which sorts of participants.&nbsp; You may explain to 
			learners, for example, that a verb such as <em>arrive</em> is 
			intransitive and one like <em>tell</em> is transitive but that does 
			not help people to form acceptable sentences in terms of the 
			communication of ideas.<br />
			Analysing experiential meanings in terms of the type of verbal 
			process allows a bit more precision because we can then see what 
			sorts of participants are involved.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Material processes can have a simple Actor and neither Goal 
				nor Range (i.e., they are functioning intransitively) and form 
				an easily learned and duplicated set of simple sentences which 
				even beginner learners can handle with confidence.<br />
				They can have Goals and Goals can be raised to the Subject 
				position with the Actor dispensed with.&nbsp; In other words, a 
				Passive can be formed with a Goal but with a Range as a 
				participant, the passive is far less likely and even wrong.&nbsp; 
				Compare, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window was broken by the stone</em><br />
				in which we have the Goal raised to Subject position<br />
				with the very doubtful:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The wall was climbed by Mary</em><br />
				A traditional grammar which sees <em>The wall </em>as the object 
				of the verb and does not distinguish between Range and Goal is 
				unable to distinguish between these events.</li>
				<li>Behavioural processes usually have animate Actors.&nbsp; If 
				they are used with inanimate Actors, the meaning is frequently 
				metaphorical so we may have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The engine coughed and spluttered</em><br />
				Seeing the verb as behavioural allows the learner to unpack the 
				meaning of this kind of sentence.</li>
				<li>Projecting processes, whether Mental or Verbal also usually 
				take animate, sentient Actors in Sayers and Sensers and these 
				are almost invariably human.&nbsp; Knowing this simple fact 
				allows learners to avoid simple errors and also allows them to 
				unpack the meaning of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sign told us to keep out</em><br />
				which might otherwise be obscure.</li>
				<li>The distinction between Existential and Relational processes 
				also helps learners to distinguish between the identified and 
				the identifier and that enhances comprehension.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The choice of Participants is determined by Register in many 
			cases so, for example, learners who need to operate with technical 
			or scientific texts can be trained to use the appropriate actors in 
			material processes, avoiding the human and selecting ideas, 
			phenomena and concepts to form appropriate language.</p>
			<p>Recognising that words have functions and class is a first step 
			in recognising that how we teach grammar must take into account 
			meaning as well as the formal characteristics of items in the 
			language.<br />
			This does not mean abandoning tradition concepts but it does mean 
			refining them in terms of meaning.<br />
			The ability to identify, describe and categorise requires the 
			competent use of relational process verbs and the ability to handle 
			them can be taught providing the analysis of a model text focuses on 
			the ways the processes are realised.</p>
			<p>When it comes to genres such as Narrative and Recount, learners 
			need to be able to handle:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>existential and relational processes to introduce people, 
				scenes and things:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was once a man who ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The village lay in the valley<br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>participant roles will normally be animate, people for the 
				most part and the processes will be both behavioural and 
				material to say what happened but also mental and verbal to say 
				how they reacted and what they said.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All genres will have their particular characteristics in terms of 
			the appropriate circumstances to select.&nbsp; Recounts need to set 
			events in place and time, procedures need to include the means of 
			doing something, discussions and expositions often need 
			circumstances relating to cause and effect and conditionality and so 
			on.&nbsp; For a little more, see the guide to Circumstances.</p>
			<p>The overall take-away point of this kind of functional analysis 
			is that it enables teachers to help learners build a vocabulary and 
			set of structural tools which are relevant to their needs and their 
			learning aims.</p>
