			<p>All the citations above are examples of a literary device called 
			zeugma (/ˈzjuːɡ.mə/).&nbsp; Their effect lies in the fact that a single verb 
			or adjective is 
			applied to two objects, one of which is appropriate, the other not.</p>
			<p>There are six verbs above which operate like this in these 
			examples (<em>take, carry, execute,</em> <em>grow, move </em>and<em> 
			wear out</em>) and they 
			all exhibit <strong>polysemy</strong>: they have more than one 
			meaning in English.&nbsp; If it weren't for polysemy, zeugma 
			creation would not be possible.<br />
			By some estimates, 40% of all words in English are polysemous with 
			more, sometimes many more, than one meaning.<br />
			What is important here, as we shall see, is that the various 
			meanings of polysemous words are connected in some way (if 
			obscurely) and in this polysemy differs from homonymy.&nbsp; 
			Homonymy also refers to words having more than one meaning but in 
			this case the meanings are wholly unconnected.</p>
			<p>Zeugma is sometimes referred to as <strong>syllepsis</strong> but 
			on this site the latter term is reserved for concord problems in 
			which one element can only agree with some of another element in a 
			sentence as in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John and Mary will each bring his / her / 
			their favourite dessert</em><br />
			in which it is unclear which possessive determiner should be applied.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Homonymy</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to words which look and sound the same but are
				<strong>unrelated</strong> and have different, <strong>unrelated</strong> meanings.&nbsp; 
				They are usually distinguished from homographs (words which look 
				the same but are differently pronounced, e.g., <em>lead</em> 
				[the metal] and <em>lead</em> [the verb]) and homophones (words 
				which look different but are pronounced the same, e.g., <em>
				rights, rites, writes, no, know</em> etc.).&nbsp; Homonyms are 
				usually derived differently, i.e., they have different 
				etymologies, but that is not always the case.<br />
				Other examples are:<br />
				<em>bank</em> (a commercial enterprise concerned with money) and
				<em>bank</em> (the side of a river)<br />
				<em>May</em> (the fifth month of the year) and <em>may</em> (a 
				modal auxiliary verb)<br />
				<em>peep</em> (make a bird-like noise) and <em>peep</em> (look 
				cautiously)<br />
				<em>air</em> (atmosphere) and <em>air</em> (a tune)<br />
				<em>rose</em> (the past form of rise) and <em>rose</em> (a 
				flower)<br />
				<em>mean</em> (signify) and <em>mean</em> (unpleasant) and <em>
				mean</em> (primitive) and <em>mean</em> (average)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Polysemy</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to the fact that a word or phrase can have a variety of
				<strong>related</strong> meanings.&nbsp; For example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was 
				booked into the hotel<br />
				</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was booked by the referee</em>.<br />
				Both these meanings of <em>book</em> imply some kind of 
				registration (in a book of some kind) so they are clearly 
				related but have different definitions.&nbsp; A phrase such as
				<em>on the rocks</em> exhibits the same phenomenon, referring to 
				a drink with ice cubes or to a shipwreck.<br />
				Polysemes are often formed by conversion in which the form of a 
				word remains unchanged but its word class alters.<br />
				Other examples are:<br />
				<em>pen</em> (a writing implement) and <em>pen</em> (the action 
				of writing)<br />
				<em>dish</em> (a kind of plate) and <em>dish</em> (a meal)<br />
				<em>frame</em> (a surrounding for a picture) and <em>frame</em> 
				(falsely incriminate)<br />
				<em>cap</em> (the top of a pen or bottle) and <em>cap</em> (a 
				type of headgear)<br />
				<em>drive</em> (control a vehicle) and <em>drive</em> (a short 
				private roadway)<br />
				<em>satellite</em> (an orbiting space craft) and <em>satellite</em> 
				(a country or state dependent on a more powerful one)<br />
				Polysemy is 
				pronounced /pɒ.ˈlɪ.siː.mɪ/, incidentally, and the adjective is 
				polysemous, pronounced /pɒ.ˈlɪ.siː.məs/.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Monosemy</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to a word having only one possible meaning in a 
				language and which cannot lead to ambiguity.&nbsp; For example, 
				the word <em>orrery</em> has no meaning in English 
				other than <em>a clockwork model of the solar system</em> 
				(Riemer, 2010:161).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Word family</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to a single word (or lemma) which takes different 
				grammatical forms while retaining its core meaning.<br />
				Examples are:<br />
				<em>nation, nations, national, nationalise</em> etc.<br />
				s<em>moke, smoked, smoking, smokes, smoker, smoky </em>etc<em>.<br />
				</em>(An alternative definition of word families is one used by 
				teachers of children and refers to words which contain similar 
				constituents so, for example:<br /><em>nest, best, lest, chest, crest</em> etc.<br />would qualify as a word family.&nbsp; That is not a useful 
				definition of the term for our purposes.)</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Homonymy and polysemy occur in all natural 
			languages.&nbsp; Artificial languages avoid both on the principle 
			that, in an ideal world, any word should have a single unambiguous 
			meaning.&nbsp; You may have noticed that the world is not ideal.</p>
			<p>And here's the snag:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">
			<em>the problem of distinguishing between 
			homonymy and polysemy is, in principle, insoluble.</em><br />
			<span class="auto-style56">Lyons, cited in Laufer, in Schmitt and 
			McCarthy (1997:152)</span></p>
			<p>This is why we are dealing with homonymy and polysemy in the same

			<p>Over time, in all languages, words change their meanings.&nbsp; 
			Sometimes a word's meaning is extended to other meanings and 
			sometimes it is altered completely.<br />
			In the first case, we arrive at a word which is polysemous: the 
			primary meaning is retained but other related meanings are grafted 
			on to the word.<br />
			In the second case, we have what is called polysemy splitting in 
			which the word may retain its primary meaning but a secondary 
			meaning is now so different that we are justified in calling the 
			resulting word a homonym, having the same form as another word but a 
			wholly different meaning.</p>
			<p>There are two processes at work:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Radiation</strong><br />
				In this process, a word retains its primary meaning but other 
				meanings are developed from it by analogy or metaphor.<br />
				Our example is the word <em>head</em>.<br />
				The primary meaning of the word is <em>the uppermost or foremost 
				part of an animal's body</em> and that meaning is retained in 
				the language, of course.&nbsp; However, radiating from the 
				primary meaning are all sorts of other meanings, all of which 
				are related to the primary meaning, like this:<br />
				<img alt="head" height="245" src="../../imagesgraphics/head_polysemes.png" width="250" /><br />
				With a little effort, the derived, radiating meanings can be 
				inferred from the primary meaning even when word class changes 
				by conversion from the noun to a verb.<br />
				When radiation occurs, the meanings (in the outer circle) 
				derived from the primary one (in the centre) are not related to 
				each other but retain a relationship only to the central word.</li>
				<li><strong>Concatenation</strong><br />
				In this process, there is a chain of meanings, each related to 
				the one before it but developing until the original meaning and 
				the derived meanings are so different that they qualify as 
				homonyms rather than related meanings of the same word.<br />
				Our example is <em>stew</em>.<br />
				The oldest meaning referred to a hot room or steam bath, from 
				which the idea of slowly cooking developed and from there, the 
				idea of a meal so cooked of a mix of vegetables and / or meat is 
				a natural step.&nbsp; Metaphorically, the verb can be used to 
				mean leave people without help to face the consequences of their 
				actions, like this:<br />
				<img alt="stew" height="100" src="../../imagesgraphics/stew_polysemy.png" width="465" /><br />
				We cannot infer the meaning of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't bother to help.&nbsp; Let him stew.<br />
				</em>without making a real leap of imagination and the meaning 
				of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a nice, warming vegetable stew<br />
				</em>is not derivable from a <em>hot room</em> without a good 
				deal of inspired guesswork, if it is derivable at all.<br />
				The polysemes have split into two or more derivationally related 
				terms which are no longer semantically related so they are 
				homonyms.<br />
				The primary meaning of <em>hot room</em> is now lost to Modern 
				English but in some cases of concatenation, may be retained.<br />
				A modern example is the word <em>mouse</em> which originally, of course, 
				applied to a small furry rodent but whose meaning has now been 
				extended to refer to the computer peripheral because of a 
				presumed similarity of appearance.<br />
				Concatenation often works in two ways:<ol class="auto-style18">
					<li>narrowing: a word may have its meaning narrowed so, for 
					example, the word <em>book</em> originally meant any piece 
					of written material inscribed on any material but the 
					meaning was narrowed to only a certain type of bound paper 
					pages.</li>
					<li>broadening: a word may have its meaning extended so, for 
					example, the word <em>bird</em> was originally used only to 
					apply to young birds but has now been broadened to include 
					all avians.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is often possible, with a good etymological dictionary, to 
			trace a word's meaning back to its primary source.&nbsp; However, as 
			we explain below, etymology is not a good guide to meaning.</p>

			<p>Primarily it is Lyons' problem, cited above, that it is <em>
			<strong>in 
			principle</strong></em> impossible to distinguish between homonymy 
			and polysemy.<br />
			A good example is the word <em>horn</em>.&nbsp; The word derives 
			from Proto-Indo-European and there are cognate words in other 
			Germanic languages (the word is the same in German, Swedish, Danish, 
			Norwegian and Old Frisian and almost the same in Modern Frisian, 
			Dutch and the extinct Gothic).<br />
			The musical instrument was originally made from the horns of animals 
			and the modern meaning is derived from that.&nbsp; Arguably, 
			therefore, the word meaning the outgrowth on the heads of some 
			animals and a musical instrument usually made of brass is an example 
			of monosemy but many would happily suggest that the meanings have 
			diverged to the extent that they are now homonyms and not even 
			polysemes.&nbsp; Almost everyone would consider that the uses of the 
			word to mean <em>telephone</em> or the way vehicles have of warning 
			others are so far removed from the original meaning as to constitute 
			separate lexemes.&nbsp; Most dictionaries will see them that way.</p>

				<li><span class="style_black"><em>keep</em></span><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>I keep the car in the garage vs. I 
				keep a dog and two cats</em></span><br />
				There are authorities who would argue strongly that <em>keep</em> 
				is monosemous and that all the senses can be derived from 
				looking at its fundamental meaning.&nbsp; Others would argue 
				that in order to define the word <em>keep</em> in these 
				examples, we need different definitions for each.<br />
				In the 
				first, we have a word meaning something like <em>store</em> but 
				in the second, the sense is of <em>look after / have at home</em>.<br />
				If you agree with that, for you the word is polysemous because the two 
				senses are distinct but related to each other.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>keep<br />
				I kept the change vs. I kept him waiting<br />
				</em></span>In these examples, the situation is slightly different 
				because the verb appears alone in the first and in the phrase
				<em>keep </em>[someone]<em> waiting </em>in the second.&nbsp; 
				Some would argue that the meanings are not related because in 
				the first, the verb means <em>retain</em> and in the second it 
				means something like <em>had</em> in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I had him wait<br />
				</em>or <em>oblige </em>as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I obliged him to wait<br />
				</em>so we have an 
				example of homonymy.<br />
				In fact, the verb in English is 
				derived obscurely but may come from Old English&nbsp;<em>cepan</em>&nbsp;[<em>seize</em> 
				or <em>hold</em> and <em>observe</em>].&nbsp; The supporters of 
				the homonymy position would argue that in the 1000 or so years 
				the word has been around, its meanings have diverged and are now 
				not related.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>grandmother<br />
				My only grandmother is my father's mother vs. My only 
				grandmother is my mother's mother<br />
				</em></span>Most people would aver that this is an example of monosemy 
				because a single definition (<em>parent's parent [female]</em>) 
				would suffice in both cases.&nbsp; Strictly, this is 
				polysemy because the family relationship is different.&nbsp; In 
				some languages, there are different words for the different types of 
				relationship.<br />
				Another example is the word <em>cousin</em> in 
				English which can apply to a male or female relation and to the 
				children of an aunt or an uncle.&nbsp; Some languages have 
				different forms for each kind of relationship and many distinguish 
				between male and female cousins.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>take off<br />
				The car took off down the street vs. The plane took off on time<br />
				</em></span>This is a similar case to the examples in 2.&nbsp; Some 
				would argue that the terms are the same in both cases, meaning
				<em>leave quickly from or on a surface</em> and that we can 
				derive the meaning of either from understanding the meaning of 
				the other.&nbsp; Others would argue, probably unsuccessfully, 
				that the terms are homonyms (and not related in meaning).&nbsp; 
				We can argue, probably more successfully, that we have an 
				example of polysemy because the meanings clearly <strong>are</strong> 
				related but slightly different.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>fag<br />
				I've smoked too many fags today vs. This work is a real fag<br />
				</em></span>This is a clearer case of homonymy.&nbsp; The words are 
				unrelated.&nbsp; The word means (in BrE slang) <em>a cigarette</em> and 
				is first attested in 1888.&nbsp; The sense of <em>hard and boring 
				work</em> (never plural) comes from BrE public school slang for a 
				younger pupil forced to work for older boys.&nbsp; In AmE, the word has been used since 1922 to mean a homosexual 
				man.&nbsp; That's a third example of homonymy.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>quarry<br />
				The chalk quarry is now disused vs. They chased their quarry for 
				miles<br />
				</em></span>This is an example of two different words which look and 
				sound the same but have unrelated meanings: they are homonyms.&nbsp; 
				The words derive from different roots: 14th century French and 
				Latin respectively.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>get<br />
				I got the bus to work vs. I got $10 for the work<br />
				</em></span>The verb <em>get</em> is notoriously polysemous and most 
				dictionaries will list around 30 different meanings (without 
				adding in particles, prepositions or adverbs).&nbsp; It's also a 
				very good example of the blurred lines between the three 
				phenomena.&nbsp; For example, is the word <em>get</em> the same 
				in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black">get</span> the idea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
				<span class="style_black">get</span> the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
				<span class="style_black">get</span> wet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
				<span class="style_black">get</span> letters<br />
				</em>etc.?&nbsp; Do 
				we have real homonyms in the case of<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's
				<span class="style_black">getting</span> dark<br />
				</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm
				<span class="style_black">getting</span> a cold</em>?</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>grave<br />
				His grave is in the churchyard vs. That was a grave mistake<br />
				</em></span>There are many who see a semantic connection between <em>grave</em> 
				meaning serious or important and <em>grave</em> meaning a hole 
				in the ground to receive a corpse.&nbsp; That would make this a case 
				of polysemy.&nbsp; However, the examples are, in fact, arguably homonyms 
				because the derivations are quite different.&nbsp; We have 
				'arguably' in that sentence because etymology is a poor guide to 
				a word's meaning.&nbsp; Much may change over time.<br />
				The adjective <em>grave</em> derives ultimately from the Latin 
				<em>gravis</em>, 
				meaning <em>heavy</em>&nbsp;and that meaning is extended to mean <em>
				serious</em> in Modern English.&nbsp; Hence. we have <em>a grave 
				expression, a grave problem </em>etc.<br />
				The noun <em>grave</em> derives from the Old English 
				<em>gr&aelig;f</em> meaning a <em>ditch</em> and the word has 
				been reduced to the meaning of <em>a hole in the ground to 
				receive a dead body</em>.&nbsp; There is also a verb in Old 
				English, <em>grafen</em> which meant <em>dig</em> and from that 
				the verb also came to mean <em>carve</em> or <em>chisel</em>.&nbsp; 
				In Modern English this only survives in the adjective <em>graven</em> 
				for an image or the verb <em>engrave</em>.<br />
				The words look and sound the same but have unconnected meanings 
				and sources.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>take<br />
				I took a short holiday vs. I took a shower<br />
				</em></span>This is not so clear because the two shades of meaning of
				<em>take</em> here are so closely related as to mean the same 
				thing.&nbsp; We can substitute <em>have</em> in both cases so we 
				could argue that there is no suggestion of either homonymy or 
				polysemy.&nbsp; Others might disagree.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>punch<br />
				The fruit punch was delicious vs. The boxer's punch was vicious<br />
				</em></span>Clear homonymy.&nbsp; The first word probably derives from 
				Hindi, the second from Old French.&nbsp; They are wholly 
				unrelated and the similarity is coincidental.&nbsp; People without real-time access to the etymology of the 
				language may, of course, see some kind of connection between 
				the alcohol content of a punch and the effects of a punch in the 
				head.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>vital<br />
				That's a vital difference vs. He has no vital signs<br />
				</em></span>Most people will classify this as an example of monosemy.&nbsp; 
				In both cases the word refers to life (or its absence) but the 
				first meaning is metaphorically derived from the second and can 
				be understood with little difficulty once one is aware of the 
				meaning of <em>vital</em> as <em>manifesting life</em> and can 
				then extend it to mean <em>essential to life</em> or just plain
				<em>essential</em>.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>why<br />
				Why was he tired? vs. Why did he leave?<br />
				</em></span>Most people would consider a simply question word like <em>why</em> 
				can only have one meaning but a moment's thought reveals a 
				problem.&nbsp; The problem lies with another polysemous word:
				<em>reason</em>.&nbsp; That word can refer to <em>purpose</em> 
				(future) 
				or to <em>cause</em> (past).&nbsp; So we can distinguish:<ol class="auto-style18">
					<li><em><span class="style_black">Why</span> was he tired?<br />
					</em>as an enquiry concerning the <strong>cause</strong> 
					for a condition and means <em>How come?<br /></em>It can be rephrased as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What previous action or event caused his tiredness?<br />
					</em>This is clearer with an example such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is the girl crying?</em><br />which clearly enquires about the cause of an action.</li>
					<li><em><span class="style_black">Why</span> did he go to 
					London?<br /></em>which concerns the <strong>purpose</strong> of an action 
					looking forward and means <em>What for?<br /></em>It cannot be rephrased as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What previous action or event caused him to go to London?</em><br />because that implies looking back.&nbsp; It can, however, be 
					rephrased as<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>What was his future purpose in going to London?<br />
					</em>Again, this is made clearer by an example such as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is the girl opening the box?</em><br />because that is an enquiry concerning the girl's purpose, 
					not the cause of her action.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>how<br />
				How did she seem? vs. How did you find out?</em></span><br />The situation is slightly less clear with the word 
				<em>how</em>.&nbsp; It 
				usually refers to manner in some way (so, in that sense is not 
				polysemous) but it evinces four sorts of answers (and that 
				implies four sorts of meaning):<ol class="auto-style18">
					<li>an adjectival modifier such as <em>quite excited, a bit 
					down, unhappy etc. </em>in answer to, e.g.:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; How did she appear?</em></li>
					<li>an adverbial modifier such as <em>hurriedly, with great care, in 
				a rush </em>etc. in answer to, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did she drive?</em></li>
					<li>a clausal response, such as <em>she heard from Mary, John explained it</em> 
				etc. in answer to, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did she find out?</em></li>
					<li>an adverbial measure of extent, such as <em>a lot, very, not 
				much, hours and hours, somewhat </em>etc. in answer to, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How unhappy was she?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long was the journey</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>current<br />
				It's a current affairs programme vs. The current runs quickly 
				under the bridge<br />
				</em></span>This example should be compared to the example of <em>grave</em>, 
				above.<br />The assumption might be that these are homonyms because the 
				two meanings of the adjective and the noun do not seem to be 
				connected.&nbsp; However, this is probably better seen as a case 
				of polysemy.<br />
				Both meanings ultimately derive from the Old French <em>corant</em> 
				(Modern French <em>courant</em>) meaning <em>running</em> or <em>
				flowing</em>.&nbsp; In the second example, then, the meaning of
				<em>a moving body of water</em> is clear.<br />
				In the first example, the derivation is identical but by the 
				middle of the 15th century, the word had acquired its meaning of
				<em>present</em>, <em>up to date</em> or <em>in progress</em>.&nbsp; 
				So, we get, e.g., <em>the current situation, the current 
				argument </em>etc.&nbsp; It is also, incidentally, the root of 
				the noun <em>currency</em> meaning money used in the country.<br />
				The modern meaning with reference to affairs of politics and the 
				state is from the 17th century and arrived at by extension.<br />
				The word is polysemous but some might argue that the meanings 
				have diverged sufficiently to treat them as homonyms.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>fair<br />
				She has fair hair vs. The referee wasn't fair<br />
				</em></span>This example, too, should be compared the last one and to 
				the example of <em>grave</em>.<br />
				A modern assumption would be that <em>fair</em> meaning <em>
				light coloured</em> and <em>fair</em> meaning <em>just</em> or
				<em>equitable</em> (with its antonym <em>unfair</em>) are 
				clearly so far apart in meaning that the words are homonyms.<br />
				Not so, in truth, because the word has only one derivation from 
				the Old English <em>fæger</em> which meant <em>pleasing, 
				beautiful, clear</em> and even <em>morally good</em>.<br />
				All the modern meanings of the word in English are extensions of 
				the original meaning:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it means <em>light coloured </em>and applied to hair or 
				eyes, the meaning reflects 13th century notions of what is 
				beautiful.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it means <em>according to justice</em>, the word also 
				means <em>pleasing</em> and is of 14th century origin.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it means <em>reasonable</em> as in, for example, <em>a 
				fair chance</em>, the meaning is an extension of the idea of <em>
				just</em> or <em>unbiased</em>.<br />
				(The word's use to mean a <em>market</em> or <em>celebration day</em> 
				is, however, a real homonym example because that meaning comes 
				from the Latin <em>feriae</em> meaning religious holidays.)</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>fence<br />
				Will he fence in the Olympics next year? vs. I fenced in the 
				garden</em></span><br />
				In modern English <em>fence</em> (verb: <em>fight with swords</em>) 
				and <em>fence</em> (verb: <em>make a barrier</em> or noun: <em>
				barrier</em>) may be considered homonyms because the meanings 
				are no longer connected.&nbsp; Both words, however, derive 
				ultimately from the same source (the Latin <em>defensus</em> 
				meaning <em>defend</em>).</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>while<br />
				I read while he watched television vs. While this is 
				interesting, it doesn't help much</em></span><br />
				In both the examples, the word is a subordinating conjunction 
				but in the first case it is temporal (meaning, roughly, <em>
				during the time that</em> or <em>when</em>) and in the second it 
				is concessive (meaning <em>although</em>).<br />
				The connection can be seen because they both carry the meaning 
				of states or events occurring simultaneously but for teaching 
				purposes, they are better treated as homonyms although they are 
				more like polysemes.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			Occasionally, a lexeme will betray whether it is polysemous of 
			homonymous in its grammar, word class and colligational 
			characteristics.<br />
			For example, in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tree has blown down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept is not yet full blown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He received a nasty blow on the head</em><br />
			are all, on the face of things, varieties of the word <em>blow</em> 
			but the words merely look similar and it's easy to see that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>blow</em> is a verb (and irregular) concerned with moving 
			air.&nbsp; It is cognate with the German word <em>blähen</em>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>blown</em> is an adjective related to being in full bloom 
			(as of a flower),&nbsp; The verb <em>bloom</em> from which it 
			originates is cognate with the German verb <em>blühen</em>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>blow</em> is a noun meaning a strike and may be cognate 
			with the Middle Dutch <em>blouwen</em>, <em>beat</em>, but its 
			origin is obscure.</p>

			<p>
			In this section we have occasionally and with some reluctance 
			appealed to words' etymologies to decide if they are examples of 
			homonymy or polysemy.<br />
			This is an area beloved of the language 
			pedant, almost always the ignorant language pedant, who sees a 
			word's historical meaning as somehow its 'real' meaning.&nbsp; A 
			word's real meaning is the way in which it is used now by native 
			speakers of the language.&nbsp; It may be the case, for example, 
			that the word <em>toilet</em>, originally spelled <em>toylet</em>, meant when 
			it was imported from French, a cloth that tailors used to bundle up 
			other pieces of cloth.&nbsp; It then moved its meaning by the 
			process of concatenation explained above, to a cloth 
			spread on a dressing table and over the centuries has shifted its 
			meaning again to a porcelain bowl with a flush or the room in 
			which you will find one.<br />
			Those who insist that a word's 
			original meaning is a guide to how it should be used need to tell us 
			at which point in history we should freeze a word's meaning to stop 
			the decline of the language (something, incidentally, which is not 
			happening).</p>
			<p>
			Another good example is the word <em>egregious</em>, an adjective 
			imported in the 1530s.&nbsp; It comes from a Latin phrase <em>ex 
			grege</em> which means separated from or rising above the flock and 
			originally meant <em>distinguished</em> or <em>excellent</em>.<br />
			However, by the late 16th century the word came to mean its opposite 
			in the modern sense of <em>notably bad</em>, even <em>evil</em>.<br />
			This was, it has been speculated, because the word was used 
			ironically so frequently that people came to believe it meant the 
			opposite of what was intended.&nbsp; It is a neat example of how 
			language changes over time (and not much time in this case) and of 
			how etymology is not a good guide to meaning.</p>
			<p>
			The etymology of words is, indeed, an interesting (for some) window 
			into the past and also tells the serious linguist something about 
			how language changes under cultural pressures.&nbsp; That a word's 
			etymology is a guide to its current meaning or how it should be used 
			is arrant nonsense.<br />
			That is the etymological fallacy.</p>

			There is a full guide on this site to this area, linked below, so 
			only a few examples of this phenomenon will be given here to get the 
			flavour.<br />
			The expression refers to the fact that many function words can 
			perform different, but often semantically related, grammatical 
			functions.<br />
			The same considerations concerning whether the use of a function 
			word in a different word class or with a different meaning is 
			homonymy or polysemy apply here, too.<br />
			Here are some examples:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>since</em><br />
				This troublesome word has a number of related meanings (and some 
				distinctly different ones) so may be used as an example of both 
				polysemy and homonymy but syntactically rather than semantically 
				based.<ol class="auto-style18">
					<li>It functions as a temporal preposition and refers to the 
					following time span up until another event intervenes or 
					until the present.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has worked here since October<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had been in their jobs since the beginning of the year 
					but left in October<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have waited since the first meeting for an answer</em></li>
					<li>The word is also a good example of syntactical homonymy 
					because it can also function as:<ol class="auto-style75">
						<li>an adverb<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw her when she came to visit her 
					mother, but not since<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He started on a low salary but has since been promoted and 
					now earns well</em></li>
						<li>a temporal subordinating conjunction:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had lived there since he came to 
					London but moved when he retired<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been at university since I was 18</em></li>
						<li>a causal resultative subordinating conjunction<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a drink in the bar, since I had 
					an hour to kill before my train<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it was Sunday, I stayed in bed till noon</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>yet</em><br />
				Take these two examples:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is tired and getting old.&nbsp; Yet he 
				works a six-day week.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was tired yet happy with my efforts</em><br />
				In the first case, <em>yet</em> is an adverbial acting as a 
				conjunct referring anaphorically to the first sentence.&nbsp; It 
				could be replaced with a more familiar conjunct performing the 
				same function, such as <em>however</em>.<br />
				In the second case, it is a conjunction meaning something like
				<em>but</em>.<br />
				Whether you consider that the two meanings are close enough to 
				be an example of polysemy is moot but, because the word occupies 
				two separate word classes, this is better described as an 
				example of syntactical homonymy.</li>
				<li><em>for</em><br />
				Is a good example of syntactical homonymy but also of plain 
				polysemy.<ol class="auto-style18">
					<li>In the first case, we can see that it can be both a 
					preposition and a conjunction.&nbsp; As a preposition 
					in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did the work for the money</em><br />
					and as a coordinating conjunction (albeit slightly old-fashioned and 
					formal) in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said nothing for I knew they wouldn't listen to me</em></li>
					<li>In terms of polysemy, the preposition <em>for</em> has at least 
					14 different but variously related meanings.&nbsp; The full 
					list of 14 is available 
					<a href="gradience.html#for" target="_blank">here</a> 
					(new tab).<br />
					Again, how closely you feel the meanings are related will 
					determine whether you teach the area as an example of 
					polysemy or separate the meanings and teach it as homonymy.&nbsp; 
					The meanings include these five :<ul class="greenbullet">
						<li>Intended to be given:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a letter for you</em></li>
						<li>Having the purpose:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is not for sale</em></li>
						<li>Amount of time or distance:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke for hours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We drove for miles</em></li>
						<li>On the occasion of:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought it him for his birthday</em></li>
						<li>In support of:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't vote for the President 
						again</em></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

			concept, see the guide.</p>

					<h2>Metaphor: obscure and transparent meaning</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Obscure and transparent meanings are relative terms not absolute 
			categories.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>To derive the meaning of <em>coin a new word </em>from the 
				central meaning of <em>coin [metal currency]</em> is quite 
				difficult but the relationship exists, albeit obscurely.&nbsp; 
				The two meanings of <em>coin</em> are actually an example of 
				polysemy but, for teaching purposes, probably best considered 
				and taught as homonyms of <em>coin</em>.</li>
				<li>On the other hand, to derive the meaning of <em>I banked the 
				money</em> from knowledge of the noun <em>bank</em> (the 
				business) is a 
				relatively easy thing to do because the relationship is much 
				more transparent.<br />
				Providing one is given a bit of 
				pictorial help, it is not too hard to figure out the alternative 
				meaning of <em>carrot</em> as <em>allurement</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is an argument that alternative meanings of a word which 
			are easily and obviously just a metaphorical extension of the base 
			meaning do not constitute examples of polysemy.<br />
			Prepositions 
			are good examples of simple metaphorical extensions of meaning which 
			are not too difficult to work out providing one knows the usual, 
			locative meaning of the preposition.&nbsp; Examples are:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to 
			agree among ourselves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to have people working under you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to meet at six<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be in 
			danger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be beyond help<br />
			</em>and so on.&nbsp; All these 
			prepositional uses are metaphorical extensions of the locative 
			(place) meaning of the 
			preposition, and therefore examples of polysemy, but the meaning is 
			usually transparent.<br />
			It is often observed that prepositions of time closely parallel 
			prepositions of place so, for example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; We met in the summer</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;We met in the theatre</em><br />
			both refer to longer times and larger places than:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We met at six o'clock</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We met at the ticket office</em><br />
			(However, the system is by no means consistent because words such 
			as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; since, during, till</em><br />
			are only used (as prepositions) for time, and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; beneath, behind, out of</em><br />
			are reserved (as prepositions) for spatial relations.)</p>

			</table>
			<p>The term compositionality is usually attributed to Gottlieb Frege 
			who asserted that the meaning of a phrase or clause may be inferred 
			from its constituents so, for example, we can disambiguate the 
			homonym word <em>bear</em> in these phrases:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the fat bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bear a hand</em><br />
			by looking for the connections between phrase, word class and word meaning.</p>
			<p>It is, however, not always so easy when fixed phrases are 
			concerned and it is clear that the expression <em>let the cat out of 
			the bag</em> cannot be unpacked by knowing the meaning of all the 
			words which make up the idiom.</p>
			<p>Polysemous words in compounds present some difficulties.&nbsp; 
			For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doorman</em><br />
			the use of <em>door</em> is not to mean an object but an entrance to 
			something (and may not be a door at all).<br />
			In:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hot potato</em><br />
			we may not be referring to a potato at all but to a situation which 
			needs careful handling.</p>
			<p>Affixes may also be polysemous so, for example, in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The situation is hopeless</em><br />
			the suffix, -<em>less</em>, clearly means <em>without</em> but in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She's a hopeless golfer</em><br />
			the suffix does not carry the meaning of <em>without</em> and the 
			word means something like <em>very poor</em>.<br />
			In:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unfortunate</em><br />
			the prefix, <em>un</em>-, means <em>not</em> but in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>untie</em><br />
			the prefix implies reversing an action.<br />
			In:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>hopeful<br />
			</em>the suffix means&nbsp; showing the characteristics of the stem 
			noun, <em>hope,</em> but in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spoonful</em><br />
			it means the amount contained by the stem noun.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Homonymy is common to all languages but, of course, is also 
				different in all languages.&nbsp; For example, in English, the 
				word <em>bank</em> may refer to a place to keep money or the 
				side of a river or take the meaning of the verb <em>rely</em>.&nbsp; 
				Similarly, in German, <em>arm</em> may mean <em>poor</em> or <em>
				an upper limb</em>, in French, <em>pic</em> may mean <em>peak</em> 
				or <em>woodpecker </em>and<em> louer</em> means both <em>hire
				</em>and<em> praise </em>although the words are unrelated, 
				having different origins (Riemer, 2010:162).<br />
				There are no 
				predictable cross-language patterns so we have to be alert to 
				the fact that, e.g., <em>since</em> will only be recognised as a 
				time preposition (<em>since last weekend</em>) and not as a 
				subordinating conjunction (<em>He paid since he had the money</em>).</li>
				<li>Polysemy is likewise not a predictable pattern.&nbsp; The 
				word <em>head</em> in English may mean <em>boss, lead, foam on 
				beer, tip, top</em> etc. but each of these meanings (all of 
				which are related and so polysemous) would require a different 
				word altogether in most languages.&nbsp; In German, the word
				<em>Leiter </em>is polysemous and has the meaning of <em>leader</em> 
				but also, by metaphorical extension, <em>ladder</em>.&nbsp; 
				Translation is perilous.</li>
				<li>Verbs present particular difficulties:<ol class="auto-style18">
					<li>Those sometimes 
				described as delexicalised, such as <em>make, do, pay, get</em> 
				etc., are unpredictable because patterns of meaning and 
				their concepts will not translate, with the meaning often reliant 
				on the noun with which they collocate.&nbsp; Most such verbs are 
				polysemous insofar as they take their meaning from the noun with 
				which they appear.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They made friends</em><br />and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They made the beds</em><br />are clearly different but related meanings of the verb 
					<em>make</em> and, for teaching purposes, it is often wise to 
					treat them as homonyms rather than polysemes.<br />
					A wiser approach is not to treat them separately at all but 
					to teach the lexical chunk in which they appear.</li>
					<li>A verb like <em>paint, </em>in the sense of <em>apply liquid 
				colour to a surface</em>, is, on the face of it, uncomplicated and 
				monosemous.&nbsp; However, there is clearly a cline from the 
				uncomplicated sense to the polysemous uses in the 
				distinction between<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paint the house<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paint a picture of the 
				house<br /></em>and the metaphorical extension of, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he painted a depressing picture of the future of the country.<br />
					</em>Armed only with the base meaning, a learner may be excused 
				for being confused by the existence of the polysemes.</li>
					<li>Transitivity also presents difficulties and verbs may 
					alter in meaning depending on whether they are used with or 
					without an object.<br />For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left at 6<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left him her house<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They managed without much money<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They managed the compan</em>y<br />In addition, when used transitively or intransitively, the 
					nature of the subject will often alter, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I broke the glass<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glass broke<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ended the activity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The activity ended</em><br />and so on.</li>
					<li>Even verbs which are used transitively may alter meaning 
					in quite subtle ways.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police dusted the window for 
					fingerprints</em><br />i.e., added dust<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dusted the room</em><br />i.e., removed dust<br />Additionally,<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She smoked a cigarette</em><br />and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smoked the cheese</em><br />are clearly different but related meanings of the verb 
					<em>smoke</em>.<br />And<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ate dinner<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The acid ate the metal<br />
					</em>are different but connected meanings of the verb <em>
					eat</em>.</li>
					<li>The verb <em>mean</em> itself is notorious in this 
					respect.&nbsp; Jackendoff (2012:33 <em>et seq</em>.) 
					identifies that the verb is used at least seven different 
					ways:<ol class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>can be translated as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						</em>Fisch<em> in German means
						</em>fish<em> in English</em></li>
						<li>is defined as:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smog <em>means</em> fog 
						<em>and</em> smoke <em>combined</em></li>
						<li>is explained as:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The flashing light means the hard drive is working</em></li>
						<li>is causally linked to:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Catching that train means getting up very early</em></li>
						<li>intend:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I mean to finish this today</em></li>
						<li>impact:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The fall in the value of the pound means that imports 
						will be more expensive</em></li>
						<li>emotional impact:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Your help meant a great deal to us</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Connotation (i.e., the emotional meaning we attach to words) 
				is also unpredictable.&nbsp; For example, <em>pig</em> may have 
				an alternative meaning in English of <em>glutton</em> but that 
				is more to do with cultural and historical issues than with the 
				polysemous nature of the word.</li>

				</table>
			<p>Whether we consider that words have a single meaning, two (or 
			more) related meanings or two (or more) wholly unrelated meanings 
			matters.&nbsp; Many very common words in English are polysemous and 
			to deny our learners the data they need to be able to deploy the 
			words accurately would seem perverse.<br />
			Consider the word <em>
			play</em> as an example in these sentences:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Arsenal are playing tonight.</em></li>
				<li><em>I'm playing football tomorrow.</em></li>
				<li><em>I'm playing John in the final.</em></li>
				<li><em>Who plays the hero?</em></li>
				<li><em>She plays the piano beautifully.</em></li>
				<li><em>Which orchestra is playing?</em></li>
				<li><em>He's playing you for a fool.</em></li>
				<li><em>Which play are you going to see?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you have doubts about the polysemous nature of the word, try 
			the so-called '<em>and / and-so</em>' test, constructing sentences such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am playing darts and John<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moscow Dynamo are playing tonight 
			and so is the Royal Philharmonic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He played chess and the violin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
			played a trick on me and a waiter on stage<br />
			</em>If you create a zeugma, 
			that's evidence of polysemy.</p>
			<p>How would you present this data to learners?&nbsp; Think for a 
			moment and then click here
			<img alt="eye" class="auto-style12" height="16" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'play',0,'style.visibility','visible'); FP_changeProp(/*id*/'table',0,'style.visibility','visible')" src="../../../gfx/eyeopen.gif" width="16" /> 
			to reveal an idea.</p>
			<p>
			<img id="play" alt="play" height="483" src="../../imagesgraphics/play_circle.png" style="visibility: hidden" width="465" /></p>
			<p>Learners, given the example sentences (i.e., the data) can be 
			encouraged to work out the polysemes for themselves and produce a 
			chart like this if they find it helpful.&nbsp; This is a 
			fairly simple example but you can do this at many levels with many 
			lexemes.&nbsp; Try it with, e.g., <em>office
			</em>or<em> reserve
			</em>etc. to see what's meant.<br />
			You may end up with diagrams such as:</p>
			<table id="table" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden"cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style3">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="office" height="300" src="../../imagesgraphics/office_circle.png" width="310" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="reserve" height="341" src="../../imagesgraphics/reserve_circle.png" width="310" />&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			
			<p>If you are feeling strong, you can try this 
					with extremely polysemous words in English such as <em>get, 
					set, make, do, </em>but you would be well advised to break 
					the area down into sense units.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="text" height="133" src="../../images/text200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style6">
					<h3>Context and co-text</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
					<p>The fact that polysemy is so common, underlines the need to make 
			sure our learners have the data they need to understand lexis.<br />
			For example, one could present the meaning of <em>wake up </em>as:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style58">
					<img alt="wake" height="133" src="../../images/wake200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style17">=&nbsp;to stop sleeping: <em>she woke up at 8 o'clock feeling 
					good</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>That would effectively provide your learners with the base 
			meaning but provide none of the sense of any polysemes.&nbsp; 
			Alternatively, you could use the idea above but extend it with:</p>
			<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style59">
					<img height="115" src="../../images/sport_goal200.jpg" width="200" alt="goal" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style13">=&nbsp;to become more active: <em>their first goal made us wake up 
					and play better</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style61">
					<img alt="wake up" height="230" src="../../images/wakeup.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style62">= become aware of problems:
					<em>The President told the people it 
					was time to wake up to the danger</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This doesn't have to be done graphically, of course.&nbsp; It is 
			often just as effective to present alternative meanings (dealing 
			with homonymy or polysemy) in words.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<p>Task: Match the meaning of <em>set </em>to the example by drawing 
			a line to connect them.</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style68">to fix at a place or time (transitive verb)&nbsp;</td>
					<td class="auto-style63" rowspan="7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
					<td class="auto-style69"><em>Are we all set?&nbsp; Can we go 
					now?</em></td>

				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style64">to go down&nbsp;(intransitive verb)</td>
					<td class="auto-style66"><em>he has a full set of Dickens' 
					novels</em></td>

				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style64">to put&nbsp;(transitive verb)</td>
					<td class="auto-style66"><em>set the clock for 6: we have to 
					leave early</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style64">to become solid (intransitive verb)</td>
					<td class="auto-style66"><em>there's only a set number of 
					hours we can work without a break</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style64">a collection&nbsp;(count noun)</td>
					<td class="auto-style66"><em>set it on the table by the 
					door</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style64">ready&nbsp;(as an ungradable adjective)</td>
					<td class="auto-style66"><em>the sun set slowly into the 
					sea</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style14">fixed (as an ungradable adjective)</td>
					<td class="auto-style67"><em>the glue has set now so it's 
					safe to move it</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Focusing learners on word class is helpful.<br />
			Arguably, by the way, only the notion of <em>set</em> as a 
			<em>collection</em> and <em>set </em>meaning <em>go down</em> are 
			true homonyms of <em>set</em>.&nbsp; 
			The others are polysemes.&nbsp; Some would even see the sense of a 
			collection as derivable from the idea of a fixed number (so 
			polysemy) but it is unlikely that most learners would draw that out 
			for themselves.&nbsp; Whether most learners would make the 
			connection between<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a set number<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the glue has set<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			set an alarm clock<br />
			</em>which are all linked to a meaning of <em>fix</em>, 
			without help is also open to question but they can be led there.<br />
			Noticing metaphorical extensions of meaning or similarities of 
			meaning is an important skill to foster.<br />
			Unless we understand the nature of homonymy and polysemy, of course, 
			we can't do that.</p>
