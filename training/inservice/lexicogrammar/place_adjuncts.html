			<h1>Place adjunct adverbials</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="place" height="207" src="../../images/buildings_sky_upwards310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Here, we are considering how English refers to <em>where</em> or
			<em>to where</em>.<br />
			In many grammars (especially those written for learners) a 
			distinction is made, rightly, between adverbs and prepositional 
			phrases.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>He looked <span class="style_black">upwards</span></em></li>
				<li><em>He looked <span class="style_black">to the sky</span></em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the first sentence, we have a place adverb, <em>upwards</em>, 
			and in the second we have a prepositional phrase of place, <em>to 
			the sky</em>.&nbsp; However, both the prepositional phrase and the adverb 
			modify how we see the verb <em>look</em> so they both function as 
			adverbials and, to be more precise, as adjuncts, integral to the 
			clause but omissible because they add extra information.<br />
			For this reason, this guide will cover all place adverbials, and not 
			distinguish except in passing between adverbs proper, such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>here, there, northwards, aboard</em> etc.<br />
			and prepositional phrases such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>in my house, at my desk, to the office, to the south, on 
			the boat</em> etc.<br />
			Hence the title.</p>
		<p>We are only considering 
		adverbial adjuncts in what follows, i.e., adjuncts which modify verb 
		phrases.&nbsp; Adjuncts can also modify, for 
		example, noun phrases as in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument after dinner was soon settled</em><br />
		in which the adjunct, <em>after dinner, </em>modifies the noun phrase
		<em>the argument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was very happy</em><br />
		in which the adjunct <em>very</em> modifies the adjective <em>happy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove too quickly</em><br />
		in which the adjunct <em>too</em> modifies the adverb <em>quickly</em>.<br />
		The technical terms for these sorts of adjuncts are, respectively, 
		adnomial, adadjectival and adadverbial but those are not terms which 
		should delay you or your learners.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Prepositions are traditionally referred to as members of a closed class of 
			words because it is, in theory, possible to make a complete and 
			exhaustive list of all the prepositions in a language.&nbsp; In 
			English, a full list would be over 200 items long.&nbsp; If you 
			would like a list of 200-odd prepositions, there is one
			<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_Prepositions.pdf" target="_blank">
			here</a>.<br />
			Adverbs on the other hand, are an open class of words because it is 
			possible, in theory, to create an unlimited number of new ones.&nbsp; 
			These may not appear in a dictionary (by definition) but few people 
			would have a problem identifying the new adverb in<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He staggered home unsoberly.</em><br />
			Any attempt to provide an exhaustive list of adverbs is, therefore, 
			doomed.</p>
			<p>However, when we consider adjuncts of place, the situation is 
			reversed.&nbsp; Prepositional phrases, rather than prepositions, because they consist of the 
			preposition plus its complement (usually a noun) form an open class because the number of nouns which can act as complements of 
			prepositions is, in theory at least, unlimited.&nbsp; Nouns are 
			members of an open class and new ones are continually created.<br />
			Prepositions which function within place adjuncts form, however, a closed class so in theory again, 
			they can be listed and the list may be exhaustive.<br />
			Here's a short list of 90-odd of the most common, and probably the 
			only ones you might consider teaching:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">aboard, about, above, abroad, across, after, 
			ahead, along, alongside, anywhere, around, ashore, aside, astern, 
			away, back, before, behind, below, beneath, between, beyond, by, 
			down, downhill, downriver, downstairs, downstream, downward(s), 
			east, eastwards, elsewhere, everywhere, far, forward, here, 
			hereabouts, home, in, indoors, inland, inshore, inside, inward(s), 
			left, locally, near, nearby, north, northwards, nowhere, off, 
			offshore, on, opposite, out, outdoors, outside, outward(s), over, 
			overboard, overhead, overland, overseas, past, right, round, 
			sideways, skyward, somewhere, south, southwards, there, through, 
			throughout, under, underfoot, underground, underneath, up, uphill, 
			upriver, upstairs, upstream, upward(s), west, west, westwards, 
			within</p>
			<p>If you would like that list as a PDF document,
			<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_Place_Adverbs.pdf" target="_blank">
			click here</a>.&nbsp; That list is long enough but doesn't include 
			some specialised nautical terms such as <em>starboard, larboard</em> 
			and <em>aft </em>or some uncommon adverbs such as
			<em>moonwards, sunwards</em> and so on.&nbsp; The suffix <em>-wards</em> 
			can be used with almost any noun representing a place or destination 
			so new formulations such as <em>Londonwards</em>, are always possible.&nbsp; 
			There are probably other omissions, too.<br />
			(One other small note is that American English usage generally 
			favours <em>-ward</em> rather than the British English <em>-wards</em>.)</p>
			<p>Here, we are discussing these words in their costume of adverbials.&nbsp; 
			Many of them can slide across word classes so, for example, we can 
			have<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; An <span class="style_black">upstairs</span> room </em>
			(adjective)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A voice from the <span class="style_black">
			beyond</span></em> (noun)<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Home</span> is where the heart 
			is</em> (noun)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <span class="style_black">north</span> wind</em> 
			(adjective)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Somewhere</span> 
			interesting</em> (determiner)<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; An <span class="style_black">offshore</span> breeze</em> 
			(adjective)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It's cold in the <span class="style_black">north</span></em> 
			(noun)<br />
			and so on.</p>
			<p>The most important word-class change for our purposes is that 
			many of these adverbs are also prepositions in other circumstances.&nbsp; 
			Common ones are: <em>around, behind, down, in, off, on, over</em>, 
			so we can have the words used in both ways:</p>

			<p>It will not have escaped everyone's notice that the fact that 
			some prepositions also function as adverbs explains much about 
			phrasal verb use.&nbsp; For example, using <em>up</em> as a 
			preposition in something straightforward such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I passed the book up to him</em><br />
			leads quite naturally to unpacking the meaning of the adverb 
			particle in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I brought the subject of money up</em><br />
			Many other ostensibly opaque meanings of particles in phrasal verbs 
			can be explained by reference to what the word means when it is used 
			as a preposition and employing a little imagination to see how the 
			meaning is extended, but not fundamentally altered, when it is an 
			adverb.</p>

			<p>We should pause for a moment to consider another slightly 
			technical distinction: the difference between an obligatory adverbial and an adverbial adjunct.&nbsp; Both are adverbials but they differ 
			in how they are used.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>By definition (<em>adjunct</em>
				<span class="style_underline">means</span> <em>a non-essential 
				extra</em>), adjuncts provide optional data and removing them 
				does not affect the central meaning of the clause.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran to the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran off<br />
				</em>contain the prepositional phrase adjunct, <em>to the door </em>
				or the adverb adjunct <em>off, </em>but the clause can stand alone and still maintain its meaning as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran</em></li>
				<li>However, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put my laptop on my desk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put my laptop away<br />
				</em>we have a non-adjunct adverbial phrase, <em>on my desk</em> 
				and the non-adjunct adverb <em>away, </em>and we cannot omit 
				either and leave a comprehensible clause:<br /> 
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I put my laptop</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>What we are dealing with here is a semantic rather than 
			grammatical distinction because some verbs in some of their senses 
			<strong>require</strong> adverbial 
			complementation.&nbsp; These verbs are often called <strong>PP 
			complement transitive verbs </strong>because they are always transitive and 
			require a prepositional phrase or other adverbial complement.&nbsp; The verbs are usually those referring to 
			causing something to be somewhere and they include:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep, lay, place, plonk, position, 
			put, rest, set, site, situate, stick, stuff</em></span>.<br />
			There is also one verb, <span class="style_black"><em>venture</em></span>, 
			which requires an adverbial complement so we allow, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ventured into the cave</em><br />
			but not:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*She ventured.<br />
			</em>In none of these cases can we have a well-formed sentence which lacks 
			a place adverbial although the polysemous nature of some of them 
			makes it possible in certain senses.&nbsp; For example, we cannot 
			have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *John laid the book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I placed the vase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I stuck the suitcase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She put the car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She plonked herself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The woman rested her head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They set the chair</em><br />
			and so on although, of course, the following with other senses of 
			the verb are possible:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chicken laid an egg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I placed my bet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rested my case<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary set the clock</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ventured a question</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			The verb <em>stay</em> can be included when it means <em>live 
			temporarily </em>so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed in a hotel<br />
			</em>is possible but, in the same sense of the verb,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I stayed<br />
			</em>is not.<br />
			When <em>stay</em> simply means <em>remain</em>, it requires no 
			complementing adverbial so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John left but I stayed<br />
			</em>is acceptable.</p>

			</table>
			<p>If you have followed the guide to prepositional phrases, linked in the list of related guides at the end, you 
			will know that one essential distinction is between those that refer 
			to direction and those that refer to place.&nbsp; For example, the 
			prepositions <em>into, onto, past </em>can only refer to movement to 
			a destination.&nbsp; We allow, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put it into the box<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nailed it onto the wall <br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I ran past the shop<br />
			</em>but not:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is into the box<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It's onto the wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I stood past the shop<br />
			</em>(There are times when <em>past</em> refers to a place as in, 
			e.g.:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; The bank is past the next junction</em><br />
			but, even here, there is a sense of direction because it is 
			implicitly necessary to <span class="style_underline">go</span> past 
			the junction to <span class="style_underline">arrive at</span> the 
			bank.)<br />
			In one of these cases, we are dealing with an adverbial which is not 
			an adjunct because omitting it leaves a malformed clause as we saw 
			above.<br />
			We can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nailed it<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran<br />
			</em>but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I put.</em></p>
			<p>So it is with omissible adverb adjuncts:<br />
			<em>after, along, aside, before, by, downward(s), forward, 
			inward(s), left, outward(s), over, past, right, round, sideways, 
			skyward, upward(s)</em> refer solely to direction and not to place 
			so we can allow, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I stood aside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car slid sideways<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sauntered past<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			but not:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I remained aside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was sideways<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I stayed past</em></p>
			<p>The first major distinction is, then, between place adjuncts of 
			position and place adjuncts of destination.<br />
			Because these distinctions are specific to English in terms of which 
			words act in which ways, much error can arise unless the teaching 
			focuses on this fundamental use distinction.&nbsp; If your learners 
			are making mistakes such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was sideways<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The house lay past<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He sat left</em><br />
			then a failure to distinguish in teaching and presenting the forms 
			is probably the cause.</p>

					<li>but we do not, of course, allow progressive forms with 
					copular verbs:<ol class="smallgreybullet">
						<li><em>*The party is being upstairs</em></li>
						<li><em>*It is appearing colder in the north</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Exceptionally, some adjuncts which are only directional can be 
			used with a copular verb but the meaning is that the state or 
			direction of movement has been or will be achieved so they are 
			really stative uses.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deadline will be past by the time you 
			finish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will be along in a minute</em></p>
			<hr />
			<p>The story so far.<br />
			Here's a summary of the distinctions we have made with some simple 
			examples.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="summary" height="426" src="../../imagesgraphics/place_adjuncts.png" width="620" /></p>

			</table>
			<p>Here, again, there are two rules (of thumb):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Put the reference to smaller places first, so prefer:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He works in a restaurant in London</em><br />
				to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;He works in London in a restaurant</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She went to a party in a house in Margate</em><br />
				to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;She went to a party in Margate in a house</em></li>
				<li>Direction adjuncts are conceptually closer to the verb than 
				position adjuncts.&nbsp; So, put the direction adjunct first and 
				the position adjunct second, and prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went upstairs to his room</em><br />
				to<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He went to his room upstairs </em>(where <em>upstairs</em> 
				can be interpreted as a postpositioned adjective)<br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They dropped me off near my office</em><br />
				to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They dropped me near my office off</em></li>
				<li>Additionally, prepositional phrase adjuncts usually come 
				after adverb adjuncts so we get, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They walked down to the pub<br />
				</em>not <em>*They walked to the pub down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove westwards to the mountains<br />
				</em>not <em>*She drove to the mountains westwards<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students can eat here in the canteen<br />
				</em>not <em>Students can eat in the canteen here </em>(in which 
				the word <em>here</em> modifies the canteen, not the verb)<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went home to her father's house<br />
				</em>not <em>*She went to her father's house home</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>To avoid the consequences of emphasising the position adjunct by 
			placing it near the end of the clause (a phenomenon known as end 
			focus), it can be placed in the initial position, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Britain, people change to a new job every 
			8 years on average</em><br />
			rather than<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; People change to a new job every 8 years on average in 
			Britain</em> (which over-emphasises the position adjunct).</p>
			<p>Place prepositional phrases are routinely put in the initial 
			position so we can have either<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the drawer I found my new socks</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I found my new socks in the drawer</em><br />
			with very little change in meaning although fronting the 
			prepositional phrase lends it a degree of markedness.<br />
			There are discourse constraints operating however in longer texts 
			because the fronted position for the adjunct implies that it is 
			marked in some way.&nbsp; So, for example, we would normally prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I looked everywhere for my car keys, even in the fridge, 
			and in the fridge I found them.</em><br />
			to<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked everywhere for my car keys, even in the fridge, 
			and I found them in the fridge.</em></p>
			<p>Place adjuncts appear in the initial position frequently, but there 
			are restrictions:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style20">
				<li>Both position and direction adjuncts prefer the final 
				position so the more natural form is:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was raining hard outside</em><br />
				rather than<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside it was raining hard</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was sitting quietly in the garden</em><br />
				rather than<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the garden he was sitting quietly</em><br />
				because the fronted position emphasises (marks) the adjunct.</li>
				<li>The adverbs <em>here</em> and <em>there</em> are, however, often 
				fronted, even in informal speech and especially with pronouns:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here she is at last</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There he goes<br />
				</em>with nouns, too, the initial position is common but the 
				subject and verb must be reversed:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here comes Mary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is your newspaper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There goes the neighbourhood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's his sister<br />
				</em>This inversion does <span class="style_underline"><strong>
				not</strong></span> happen when the subject is a pronoun:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here he is</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Here is he<br />
				</em>(Inversion also does <span class="style_underline"><strong>
				not</strong></span> happen with time adjuncts<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then John arrived</em><br />
				not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *Then arrived John</em>)</li>
				<li>When the subject of the verb is a noun (rather than a 
				pronoun), the subject and verb are reversed,
				<span class="style_underline">without</span>, as is often the 
				case with inversion, employing the <em>do</em> operator.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the house marched the police<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the kitchen stood her sister<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out went the lights<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over went all the glasses</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Below the village lies a wonderful restaurant</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Often, with this kind of inversion, we need the <em>do</em> or
				<em>did</em> operator with present simple and past simple forms 
				so we get, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Never did I hear of such stupidity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rarely do we meet nowadays</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				However, with these place adverbials no such use is required, 
				so:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Into the house did the police march<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Below the village does lie a wonderful restaurant<br />
				</em>are disallowed.<br />
				Fronting adverbials like this is often done for literary effect and 
				the final position is by far the safest place for learners to 
				place the adjunct.<br />
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The kind of fronting mentioned in b. and c. above with the 
			inversion of subject and object is limited to a few verbs expressing 
			relational processes such as <em>stand, lie</em>, and <em>be</em> 
			and to an equally limited number of dynamic behavioural processes 
			such as <em>come, march, walk, go, fall</em> etc.</p>
			<p>Positional adjuncts can occupy a middle position in a clause but 
			it is somewhat rarer.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is here enjoying the sunshine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather is everywhere in the country awful this week<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is in the garden pulling up weeds</em><br />
			Directional adjuncts can't take this position at all so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is upstairs moving it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is into the garden taking it</em><br />
			are not possible and the preferred form is to place the adjunct 
			after the object:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is moving it upstairs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is taking it into the garden</em></p>

			<h4>Directional adjuncts</h4>
			<p>We can front direction adjuncts in declarative clauses so we can 
			have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the village and across the churchyard 
			he came to my house</em><br />
			and that can also be:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came to my house through the village and 
			across the churchyard </em><br />
			However, if we try to negate the first sentence we get the 
			unacceptable<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *Through the village and across the churchyard he didn't 
			come to my house</em><br />
			but the second produces<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't come to my house through the 
			village and across the churchyard</em><br />
			which is fine.</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>Fronted adjuncts cannot generally occur in negated clauses.</strong></p>
			<h4><strong>Position</strong> adjuncts</h4>
			<p>Position adjuncts are much more obliging and can be fronted in 
			declarative and negated clauses so both these are acceptable:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; In this town there aren't any good pubs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside nobody is smoking</em><br />
			but with these, too, the final position is more natural:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There aren't any good pubs in this town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody is smoking outside</em><br />
			unless the speaker wishes to emphasise the location.</p>

			</table>
			<p>We can heighten the effect of both adverb and 
			prepositional-phrase place adjuncts but the range of intensifiers is quite 
			limited (and easy to teach).&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are going <span class="style_black">
			further</span> inland<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It lies <span class="style_black">far</span> beyond the city<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sailed <span class="style_black">due</span> west,
			<span class="style_black">directly</span> into the sunset<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He kicked it <span class="style_black">clean</span> over the 
			wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went <span class="style_black">a good deal further</span> 
			up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned <span class="style_black">sharp</span> left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went <span class="style_black">right</span> over the fence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He fell <span class="style_black">a long way </span>down</em><br />
			As you can see, the intensifiers are pretty much limited to <em>far 
			/ further, clean, right, due, directly, sharp, a long way</em>.<br />
			That's teachable in a single lesson and provides learners with a 
			natural and useful set of intensified chunks of language.</p>

			<p>In children's stories and, sometimes for comic effect, direction 
			adjuncts are often placed in the initial position, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the woods they tramped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the hill they scrambled</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Outside of children's stories, and in informal speech, the verbs <em>
			come, go </em>and <em>get</em> are sometimes used in imperatives in 
			the same way, usually with adverbs rather than prepositional 
			phrases.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Out you go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On you get<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Off you go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over you come</em></p>
			<p>Again informally, some directional adverbs can be used as 
			imperatives with no 
			verb at all.&nbsp; They include:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Out!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down!</em><br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Off!</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p>Good dog.</p>

					<td class="auto-style16">

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Frequently, time adjuncts and place adjuncts co-occur in the same 
			clause.<br />
			In English, there are no absolute rules for ordering time and place 
			(as there are in many languages).&nbsp; There are, however, rules of 
			thumb:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We place longer adjuncts after shorter ones so we prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was working here for many years</em><br />
				rather than<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was working for many years here<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was working in 1990 at a prestigious and expensive Chinese 
				restaurant in New York<br />
				</em>rather than<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was working at a prestigious and expensive Chinese 
				restaurant in New York in 1990</em></li>
				<li>When all the adjuncts come at the end of the clause, as is 
				frequently the case, the usual order is place then time, because 
				place is usually more closely linked to the verb than the time.&nbsp; 
				So, we 
				prefer:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked at a restaurant in London for three years in 
				the mid-70s</em><br />
				rather than<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked for three years in London, in 
				the mid-70s at a restaurant</em><br />
				or any other possible combination of the four adjuncts.</li>
				<li>When the first two rules conflict and to avoid stylistic 
				problems, the time adjunct is often placed in initial position 
				so the last example might be better as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mid-70s, he worked at a restaurant in London for 
				three years</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For three years in the mid-70s, he worked 
				at a restaurant in London</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>For special emphasis or to give one adjunct or another extra 
			weight, speakers will flout these rules so we might get:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; At </em><strong><em>that</em></strong><em> time, of course, in 
			London it was difficult to get a decent cup of coffee anywhere.</em></p>
