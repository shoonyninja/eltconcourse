		<p>For many people, especially those who don't speak any other 
		languages, the ordering of words in sentences seems too obvious to waste time 
		worrying about.&nbsp; That's a mistake.<br />
		Look at the graphic above.&nbsp; How many correct sentences can you make 
		by combining phrases from the first area with those in the other two 
		areas?<br />
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'wo1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have an answer</a>.</p>
		<div id="wo1" style="visibility:hidden">
		
		<p><span class="style_brown">There are eight:</span></p>
		<ol class="style_brown">
			<li><em>John took the money</em></li>
			<li><em>The unicorn took the money</em></li>
			<li><em>John took a fat cigar</em></li>
			<li><em>The unicorn took a fat cigar</em></li>
			<li><em>John borrowed the money</em></li>
			<li><em>The unicorn borrowed the money</em></li>
			<li><em>John borrowed a fat cigar</em></li>
			<li><em>The unicorn borrowed a fat cigar</em></li>
		</ol>
			</div><p><a name="2"></a>That all seems very straightforward and an English speaker 
			will have no difficulty deciding that John (or the unicorn) did the 
			taking and borrowing and the money and the cigar was what they acted 
			on.&nbsp; In sentence 3, for example, answer the following 
			questions:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li>Who did the taking?</li>
				<li>What did John do?</li>
				<li>What was taken?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Three easy answers are a) John, b) took and c) a fat cigar.</p>
			<p>Now ask yourself <strong>how</strong> you knew that.&nbsp; 
			<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'wo2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here 
			when you have an answer</a>.</p>
			<div id="wo2" style="visibility:hidden">
			
			<p><span class="style_brown">You knew the answer because you are 
			aware that in English, the most usual word order is to put the 
			subject of the verb first, then add the verb and then add the object 
			(if there is one).<br />
			The fact that English has this word order (Subject–Verb–Object) is 
			the product of its history and origins.&nbsp; Other languages do 
			things differently.</span></p>
			</div><p><a name="3"></a>There are three components to the simple 
		sentences we have created: S, V and O.&nbsp; How many other possible 
		ways of arranging these, apart from SVO, are there?<br />
		<a href="#3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'wo3',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click when you have an 
			answer</a>.</p>
			<div id="wo3"style ="visibility:hidden">
			
			<p><span class="style_brown">Answer: 5 other possibilities: SOV, 
			OVS, OSV, VSO and VOS so we can have:</span></p>
				<ol class="style_brown">
					<li><em>John a fat cigar took</em></li>
					<li><em>A fat cigar took John</em></li>
					<li><em>A fat cigar John took</em></li>
					<li><em>Took John a fat cigar</em></li>
					<li><em>Took a fat cigar John</em></li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p>And that is exactly what other people's languages do, in fact.&nbsp; 
			However, 75% of languages in the world are either SVO (like English) 
			or SOV (like Japanese, Tamil, Dutch, Maltese, Pashto and a hundred 
			or so others).&nbsp; VSO is rare (but included in that group are 
			Celtic languages) and VOS, OVS and OSV are very rare indeed with only 
			one or two attested examples (Mallinson and Blake, 1981).&nbsp; For 
			most of our learners, then, the natural word order will be<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">John took a fat cigar</span></em><br />
			or<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John a fat cigar took</em></span></p>

			</table>
			<p>It is, of course, possible in all languages, to vary the word 
			order for effect so we can, theoretically, have all kinds of word 
			orders in English.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style48"><span class="style_brown"><em>With this ring I thee wed </em>
			</span>(SOV)<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>John? Now him I know </em></span>(OSV)<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>Eat the food, you</em></span> (VOS)<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>The dragon slew he</em></span> (OVS)<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>Eat you that food now </em></span>
			(VSO)</p>
			<p>Poets and song writers will often vary the word order for effect 
			or to make the rhyme and scan work.&nbsp; And, of course, we vary 
			the word order in things like questions and to make passive 
			sentences (as do many languages).<br />
			English can also have changes to basic word order in other types of 
			sentence.&nbsp; For more, see 
			the guide to cleft sentences and/or
			the guide to fronting on 
			this site, both linked in the list at the end.</p>
			<p>However, what we are talking about here is known as <strong>
			canonical word order</strong>, i.e., the normal, unmarked word order 
			of simple positive (declarative) sentences.<br />
			<strong>Any other word ordering will be considered as a token of 
			markedness.</strong></p>

		<h2>Free word order</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are some languages in which the speaker is far freer to 
			vary the word order as he/she pleases.&nbsp; Examples of these 
			languages are Latin, Modern Greek, Turkish and Finnish.&nbsp; Most 
			languages with freer word order have a way or ways of marking the nouns to 
			make it clear which is the object and which the subject.&nbsp; They 
			also usually inflect the verb so its subject is clear.&nbsp; A good 
			example is Greek in which the verb changes for number and person and 
			the noun along with any determiner or adjective is changed to indicate its status in the sentence.&nbsp; 
			For more on this, see
			the guide to case on this site, linked in the list at the end.<br />
			No language, incidentally, has entirely free word ordering; there 
			are always tendencies, sometimes quite strong ones.</p>
			<p>English does not have free word order and is, in fact, very 
			strict normally.&nbsp; This is because the language has no way of 
			marking what the subject is and what the object is.&nbsp; <em>John 
			loved Mary</em> and <em>Mary loved John</em> are <strong>only</strong> 
			distinguished by the ordering of the sentence.</p>

				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Some languages show more complex patterns.&nbsp; German, for 
			example, has the usual order of SVO (<em>ich sah ihn [I saw him]</em>) 
			but in subordinate clauses it becomes SOV (<em>weil ich ihn sehen 
			will [because I him see want]</em>).&nbsp; French, too, inserts the 
			pronoun object after the subject (<em>je le vois [I him see]</em>) 
			so it partly shows SOV word order in these cases although it is 
			canonically SVO (<em>je vois Marie [I see Marie]</em>) when no 
			pronoun is used.</p>

			<p>Languages will differ and put all of the above in different

			<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>numerals</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>all European languages prefer Numeral–Noun but many 
				South-East Asian and African languages reverse the order.&nbsp; 
				Some languages allow both and some, such as Egyptian Arabic, 
				prefer Noun-Numeral for 1 and 2 and then reverse the order for 
				other numbers.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>adjectives</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>French prefers the Noun-Adjective pattern in, e.g., <em>un 
				vase fabuleuse</em> (although some common adjectives precede the 
				noun (<em>un beau vase</em>).&nbsp; Greek and most Germanic 
				languages (German, Dutch etc.) and the Scandinavian languages 
				follow the Adjective–Noun pattern.<br />
				Slavonic languages such as Polish, Russian and Czech also 
				usually have Noun-Adjective as do Thai and the Italic languages 
				(Italian, Romanian, Portuguese, Spanish etc.)<br />
				All varieties of Arabic are Noun-Adjective, too.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>genitives</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>many languages have a single ordering (unlike English).<br />
				(Many languages put a possessive before a noun (as in
				<em>my life </em>[English]<em>, ma vie </em>[French]<em>, mein leben </em>[German]<em>, mit 
				liv</em> [Danish] but that is not the point here.&nbsp; English 
				has an <strong>inflected</strong> genitive (<em>Mary's book</em>, 
				for example) for which Italic languages do not have an 
				equivalent, always preferring a construction such as <em>the 
				book of Mary.</em>)<br />
				Italic languages generally prefer the Noun–Genitive pattern but 
				Scandinavian languages use Genitive–Noun.<br />
				All forms of Arabic are Noun–Genitive but Chinese languages, 
				Japanese and Thai are Genitive–Noun.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>prepositions</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>English has prepositions but other languages use 
				post-positions (<em>London in</em> not <em>in London</em>).&nbsp; 
				Among them are Turkish, Japanese, Korean and the Chinese 
				languages.<br />
				German also uses postposition as well as prepositions, depending 
				on the preposition.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>If the languages of your learners aren't mentioned here and you 
			don't already know how they work, why not ask them?&nbsp; A little

		<p>Headedness refers to what comes first.</p>
		<p>For example, in English a compound noun is usually formed with the 
		head to the right so we have, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a record player</em><br />
		is a type of player, not a type of record and<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; a walking stick</em><br />
		is a noun for a type of stick, not a verb form.<br />
		Other languages may be left headed in this respect so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>znaczek Pocztowy<br />
		and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; timbru poștal <br />
		</em>are the Polish and Romanian respectively for <em>postage stamp</em> 
		and nouns not adjectives so left-headed compounds.<br />
		For a little more, see the guide to compounding linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>
		<p>Headedness also affects other word ordering.<br />
		Every phrase in a language has a head so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>at the market<br />
		</em>is a prepositional phrase with the head <em>at</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>walk out the door</em><br />
		is a verb phrase with the head <em>walk</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>an old man</em><br />
		is a noun phrase with the head <em>man</em><br />
		In English, noun phrases are usually right-headed because the adjective 
		and determiner lie to the left of the head.<br />
		Prepositional phrases and verb phrases, on the other hand, are usually 
		left headed with the head of the phrase preceding the complement.<br />
		It is unlikely that any languages are wholly consistent in this respect 
		but English is predominately left headed with the head in the initial 
		position in the phrase.<br />
		The more complex a modifier is, however, the more likely it is, in 
		English, to follow the head.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an old man out there in his boat</em><br />
		contains two sorts of modification:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Light elements (an and the) which come to the left of the head</li>
			<li>Heavy elements (out there and in his boat) which follow the 
			tendency of the language to end-weight such elements and appear to 
			the right of the head.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Japanese is the usual example of a right headed language in which the 
		head follows the rest of the phrase so the normal ordering of the 
		elements.&nbsp; So for example, the object of the verb will precede the 
		verb and the prepositional complement will precede the preposition 
		(which is, in fact, a post-position).&nbsp; We get therefore e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He books bought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was home at</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		Languages will differ in this respect so, for example, in English it is 
		usual to have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>my book</em> (right headed)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>three books</em> (right headed)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>that book </em>(right headed)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>went crazy </em>(left headed)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>through the park</em> (left headed)<br />
		and so on, but other languages will do things differently and get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>book my</em> (e.g., Greek)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>books three</em> (e.g., Swahili and many other 
		Niger-Congo languages)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>book that</em> (e.g., Hebrew)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>crazy went</em> (e.g., Japanese)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the park through</em> (e.g., Turkish)</p>
		<p>The jury is still out concerning how fundamental the the right- vs. 
		left-headed nature of languages is and how sustainable it is as a way to 
		classify languages.</p>

		<h2>Topicalisation</h2>

			</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Some languages, for example, the Chinese languages, are known as 
		topicalising languages.<br />
		Simply put, this means that instead of having a subject or object as the 
		first item, these languages front the topic of the sentence regardless 
		of its grammatical function.<br />
		We get, therefore, something like:<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noodles I like spicy ones best</em></span> 
		(with a fronted object)<br />
		or<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marriage that is not yet for me</em></span> (with 
		a fronted subject)<br />
		or<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave, I'll go tomorrow</em></span> 
		(with a fronted verb)</p>
		<p>All languages are capable of this to some extent but it's quite rare 
		in English.<br />
		Some European languages, such as Spanish, employ the tactic frequently 
		and it is at least arguable that the habit in German and Dutch (as well 
		as some others) of putting the time adverbial at the front of the 
		sentence and altering the word order following it to Verb + Subject, 
		rather than the usual Subject + Verb, is also an example of 
		topicalisation.</p>
		<p>Learners with a topicalising language background will produce a range 
		of connected errors, often involving doubling the subject such as <em>
		*That factory, there is where my father works</em>.<br />
		Yes, that's why they do that.<br />
		There is a guide to how fronting 
		works on the site, linked in the list of related guides at the end.</p>

				<li>Because word order is English is often the only way of 
				knowing what's the object and what's the subject, getting it 
				wrong can have severe communicative implications.&nbsp; 
				Especially at lower levels, therefore, we need to focus on 
				canonical word order &ndash; most sentences in English follow 
				the SVO pattern.</li>
				<li>Models are important.&nbsp; As is mentioned above, poets and 
				song writers often corrupt the natural word order in English for 
				effect.&nbsp; Presenting songs and poems needs to be carefully 
				done and you need to inspect the content in order to alert your 
				learners to any unnatural ordering.</li>
				<li>Postpositional first languages will cause potential problems 
				when teaching prepositional structures and especially 
				prepositional phrases.&nbsp; Handle with care.</li>
				<li>Languages which are heavily inflected for case will often 
				have very flexible word order. That is definitely not the case 
				in English and learners need to have their attention drawn to 
				the fact.</li>
				<li>English, somewhat confusingly, requires a subject 
				for the verb <em>snow</em> although it's hard to see what it is.&nbsp; 
				The reason is to do with the tendency to states facts in the 
				language using an anticipatory or dummy <em>it </em>or <em>there</em> 
				as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an opener in the drawer</em><br />
				rather than, as is common in many languages:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An opener is in the drawer</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult to use the opener</em><br />
				rather than the more obvious:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the opener is difficult</em><br />
				For more, see the guide to the anticipatory it and there linked 
				in the list at the end.</li>
				<li>The genitive in English is unusual and needs careful 
				treatment if you are to avoid errors such as <em>*the car's cost
				</em>or <em>*the pencil of Mary</em>.&nbsp; More in 
				the guide to 
				case on this, linked in the list at the end.</li>
				<li>At lower levels in particular, it is necessary to be 
				explicit in exemplification of the Numeral–Noun, Adjective–Noun 
				and Demonstrative–Noun patterns.</li>
				<li>Topicalising is, as we noted, quite rare in English but 
				learners with a topicalising first language are likely to carry 
				over the structure into English with usually erroneous or odd 
				production as a result.&nbsp; They need guidance concerning how 
				English identifies the topic of sentences.</li>

			<p>As is mentioned above, much of this is involved with getting 
			models right and encouraging noticing.&nbsp; However, there are some 
			things to consider when you focus on this area.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Jumbled sentences to reorder are helpful but keep the focus 
				and don't jumble all the words or the learners will not see the 
				patterns.&nbsp; For example, presenting lower-level learners 
				with a task such as<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Put these words in the right order:</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38">lovely in vases of window for I my 
				two those collection pottery want the<br />
				</span>is too hard to do and doesn't provide any focus.<br />
				It would 
				be better as:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Put the words and phrases in the right place</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38">I want _______ _______ _______ vases 
				_______ the 
				window _______for _______ 
			collection _______.</span><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Choose from:</em></span><span class="auto-style38"><br />
				those | two | lovely | in | my 
				| of pottery</span><br />
				This exercise focuses the learners on noticing which things 
				precede or follow which.</li>
				<li>It's also a good idea to get the learners to try to insert 
				elements of the language into utterances for themselves so they 
				get a feel for what goes where.&nbsp; For example,<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>What words can go in the gaps in this?</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38">A: Come _______ the garden, I want to 
				show you something _______.<br />
				B: OK.&nbsp; What is this _______ thing you want _______ to show 
				_______?<br />
				A: _______ is ______ here, _______ the shed.</span><br />
				etc.<br />
				You can also focus the learners by giving them a list of words 
				to insert, some possible, some not.</li>
				<li>At lower levels, it's important to focus on elements 
				separately.&nbsp; For example,<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Fill the gaps with the words in the list.</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38">There is no reason to worry _______ 
				the _______ weather.&nbsp; I have brought _______ umbrellas and 
				_______ _______ coat for you.</span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38">two | warm| terrible | a | about</span><br />
				This focuses <strong>only</strong> on determiners and adjective 
				positions.</li>
				<li>Spot the mistake activities are useful, too, to get people 
				to notice the importance of word order in English.<br />
				Take a story you have presented in class and make up sentences 
				about it reversing the order of some elements and keeping others 
				intact.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Mark each sentence true or false:</em></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38">She kissed him </span>
				<span class="style_black">T / F</span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38">He gave her the flowers </span>
				<span class="style_black">T / F</span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38">They gave the flowers to him</span>
				<span class="style_black">T / F</span><br />
				<span class="auto-style38">She introduced him to the man </span>
				<span class="style_black">T / F</span><br />
				etc.&nbsp; Mixing direct and indirect objects is a good way to 
				alert people to the relationships indicated by English word 
				order.</li>
				<li>An awareness raising exercise involves taking these sorts of 
				elements and embedding them in sentences for the learners to 
				translate into their own language in order to compare the 
				ordering of items.&nbsp; For example, <br />
				<em><span class="auto-style38">I came today because I wanted to 
				buy some tickets</span></em><br />
				becomes, in German<br />
				<em><span class="auto-style38">Today, came I because I some 
				tickets (to) buy wanted</span><br />
				</em>In other languages, the differences will be more or less 
				extreme but they will almost certainly be different.&nbsp; It 
				can be both fruitful and fun to compare how things work, 
				especially in multi-lingual classes.&nbsp; In monolingual 
				classes, you have the advantage that you can focus on specific 
				differences, of course.</li>
