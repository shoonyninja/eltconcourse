			<p>English is no different from many languages in 
			having a number of ways to make negatives.&nbsp; <strong>How
			</strong>English does it is, however, not simple.&nbsp; Here are 
			some examples of negatives:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>John didn't eat any cake.</em></li>
				<li><em>Didn't John eat any chocolate?</em></li>
				<li><em>I reject the idea that John at any cake.</em></li>
				<li><em>John denied eating any chocolate.</em></li>
				<li><em>John hardly ate any cake.</em></li>
				<li><em>John can't have eaten any chocolate.</em></li>
				<li><em>Which cake didn't John eat?</em></li>
				<li><em>John wouldn't mind some chocolate.</em></li>
				<li><em>John never eats any cake.</em></li>
				<li><em>John may not eat any chocolate.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>One of the examples is not negative.&nbsp;
			<a href="#examples" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'para1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have spotted it</a>.</p>
			<p id="para1" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">Right.&nbsp; 
			Sentence 8 is the odd one.&nbsp; Although grammatically it looks 
			negative, it is functionally a positive statement (or even a 
			request).&nbsp; Note that it is the only sentence in which the 
			determiner is <em>some</em> rather than <em>any</em>.&nbsp; The 
			distinction between the two determiners is a good test of whether an 
			utterance is, in fact, negative or not in its function.&nbsp; 
			Compare, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't you want <span class="style_black">some</span> chocolate?<br />
			</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't you want <span class="style_black">any</span> 
			chocolate?<br />
			</em>The sentence with <em>some</em> can be construed as an offer, 
			not a question or a negative, but the sentence with <em>any</em> is 
			a real, negative question probably showing some surprise.<br />
			The <em>some- </em>series of determiners and pronouns are referred 
			to as assertive forms in contrast to the <em>any- </em>series which 
			are non-assertive.&nbsp; For more, see

			<p>It is not the verb which is being negated &ndash; it is the verb
			<strong>phrase</strong> plus its object and any adverbials.&nbsp; We are discussing what is known as 
			the scope of the negation.<br />
			Sentence a) states that the police left the road open.<br />
			Sentence b) states that the police closed part of the road.<br />
			The verb is 
			being negated in sentence a), the verb phrase including its object 
			and the adverbial in sentence b).<br />
			The tendency in English to apply negation to phrases rather than 
			words can lead to a considerable amount of ambiguity.&nbsp; What, 
			for example, do you understand by the following negative statements?</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>He didn't speak to the girl in the red dress at the party.</em></li>
				<li><em>She didn't meet the man who bought the house on Thursday.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'ambiguity',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have a response</a>.</p>
			<div id="ambiguity" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">
			<p>Both sentences are ambiguous and mean either:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>He didn't speak to the girl in the red dress</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>He spoke to the girl in the red dress but not at the party</em></li>
				<li><em>She didn't meet the man who bought the house</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>She met the man who bought the house but not on Thursday<br />
				</em>(In this case, too, incidentally, we do not know whether 
				the Thursday applies to when she didn't meet the man or whether 
				the man bought the house on Thursday.)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We can disambiguate these to some extent when speaking by stressing the element 
			we want to negate:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><em>He didn't speak to the girl in the red dress at the 
					<strong>party</strong>.</em></li>
					<li><em>She didn't meet the man who bought the house on 
					<strong>Thursday</strong>.</em></li>
				</ol>
				<p>In written language, we have to alter the 
			ordering of the elements to make meaning clearer.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>At the party, he didn't speak to the girl in the red 
				dress.</em></li>
				<li><em>On Thursday, she didn't meet the man who bought the 
				house.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Even then, some ambiguity might remain so to be 100% clear, we 
			need to  rephrase  entirely with something like:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>He didn't speak to the girl in the red dress until after 
				the party.</em></li>
				<li><em>She didn't meet the man who bought the house until the 
				following Friday.</em></li>
			</ol>
				<p><strong>A general, if sloppy, rule:</strong><br />If the negation is ambiguous, hearers will usually assume that 
				it is the final part of the sentence that is being negated.&nbsp; 
				So for example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He didn't drive<br />
				</em>means he travelled in a different way<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't drive my car<br />
				</em>implies he drove his own or someone else's car<br />
				and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't drive my car carefully</em><br />will normally be understood to mean:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<em>He drove my car carelessly</em><br />rather than<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<em>He didn't drive my car</em><br />In other words, <strong>if 
				there is a danger of some ambiguity</strong>, the scope of negation is confined to the final 
				element of a negative utterance.</p>
				<p>The fact that negation applies to the verb phrase overrules the 
				assumption that it is the final element that is being negated.&nbsp; 
				For example, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't always come by car</em><br />
				it is the verb phrase (and the adverbial), <em>(always) come</em>, that is being 
				negated, not the prepositional phrase, <em>by car</em>, so it is 
				understood to mean:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; He sometimes came by car</em><br />
				not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He never came by car</em></p>
				<p>See also below under ambiguous negation.</p>

				<p>The scope of negation can be signalled by the use (or not) of 
				assertive rather than non-assertive forms.<br />
				There is a separate guide to assertion and non-assertion on the 
				site, linked in the list of related guides at the end, because 
				more than negation is affected.&nbsp; Briefly, however, assertive forms are most commonly used in positive sentences and 
				non-assertive forms in negatives and interrogatives.&nbsp; So, 
				for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I don't have any money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We haven't started yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like anything else?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't needs anyone's help</em><br />
				all contain non-assertive forms: <em>any, yet, anything</em> and
				<em>anyone</em>.<br />
				On the other hand:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I have some news<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have already finished<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want something stronger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is someone at the door</em><br />
				all contain assertive forms: <em>some, already, something</em> 
				and <em>someone.</em></p>
			<p>There is, however, a rule functioning here to determine where in 
			the clause the negation stops (i.e., how it is limited).<br />
			For 
			example, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't hear any of the music</em><br />
			we have the non-assertive form and so the whole of the clause is 
			negated and means that no music was heard.<br />
			However, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't hear some of the music</em><br />
			the negation stops at the verb and the sentence implies that I did, 
			in fact, hear some of the music but not all of it.<br />
			The rule is that when a non-assertive form is used, it must lie
			<strong>outside</strong> the scope of negation.<br />
			As a final example, compare:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I didn't talk to any of the children</em><br />
			with<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I didn't talk to some of the children.<br />
			</em>In the first case, no children were spoken to by me and in the 
			second case some children only were not spoken to by me.</p>
			<p>The simple rule is that the assertive form stops the negation 
			in its tracks.</p>
			<p>Here's a diagrammatic way of understanding the scope of negation:</p>
			<table class="auto-style130">
				<tr>

				<p>Negation begins with the negator and continues to the end of the 
				clause so what comes before the negator is left in peace.<br />
				For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't still have your book = She had your book once but 
				no longer<br />
				</em>but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She still doesn't have your book = You have not yet given it 
				to her<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't frequently go = He went sometimes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't go frequently = He went seldom</em><br />
		but<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He frequently didn't go = He often failed to go</em><br />
		Where the adverbial is positioned in a negative sentence is, therefore, 
		critical to how it is understood.<br />
		The same consideration applies when the adverbial is modifying other 
		elements.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only Mary will be late = Other people will also be late</em><br />
		but<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary will not only be late = She will also do something else</em> 
		(such as complain about something)</p>
			<p>Other adverbials, such as prepositional phrases which come at the 
			end of clauses may fall within the scope of negation or outside it 
			as we saw above so, in spoken language, the preposition may be 
			stressed to signal the adverbial is part of the negation but lack of 
			stress and a falling intonation contour signals that the adverbial 
			lies outside the negation.&nbsp; For example, compare:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I didn't speak to her </em><span class="style_underline">
			<strong><em>AT</em></strong></span><em> the party</em><br />
			which signals that I spoke to her at some other time (probably 
			before or after the party)<br />
			with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I didn't speak to her at the party</em><br />
			which does not imply that I spoke to her at any other time, either (but I 
			may have).</p>
			<p>For adverbs which are themselves negative (<em>rarely, barely, 
				seldom</em> etc.), see below.</p>

					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>The focus of negation is closely related to its scope but is not 
			signalled in written English (except through
			<span class="style_underline">underlining</span>, <strong>bold</strong>  
			or <em>italic</em> type face etc.).<br />
			So, to signal where we feel the focus lies in spoken English, we 
			emphasise the element in question, a phenomenon known as special or 
			contrastive sentence stress.&nbsp; Compare, for example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><span class="style_underline"><strong><em>JOHN</em></strong></span><em> 
				didn't buy the book</em><ul class="greenbullet">
					<li class="smallgreybullet">but we know that someone bought the 
				book</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><em>John didn't buy the </em><span class="style_underline">
				<em><strong>BOOK</strong></em></span><ul class="greenbullet">
					<li class="smallgreybullet">but we know that John bought something</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><em>John didn't </em><span class="style_underline"><em>
				<strong>BUY</strong></em></span><em> the book</em><ul class="greenbullet">
					<li class="smallgreybullet">but we know that John now has the book</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In all these cases, the emphasis falls on the negated item only 
			and the rest of the clause is not negated at all.</p>
			<p>In written English, the same effect may be obtained by 
			 rephrasing the clause to make it clear what we mean and that often 
			involves the use of cleft or pseudo-cleft sentences such as:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>It wasn't John who bought the book</em><ul class="greenbullet">
					<li class="smallgreybullet">but we know that someone bought the 
				book</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><em>It wasn't the book that John bought</em><ul class="greenbullet">
					<li class="smallgreybullet">but we know that John bought something</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, no true cleft sentence can stress the verb because:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *It wasn't buy that John did to the book</em><br />
			is not available, so we substitute something unambiguous like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John didn't buy the book, he stole it.<br />
			</em>or a pseudo-cleft, and slightly ambiguous, sentence such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What John didn't do was buy the book</em></p>

			linked from the list of related guides at the end.</p>

			<p>English negates imperatives in two distinct ways (and other

			<ol>
				<li>With <em>No</em> followed by a noun phrase (often a gerund):<br />
				<img alt="no jumping" height="133" src="../../images/sign_no_jumping200.jpg" width="200" /></li>

			<p>There is a rather rare imperative form in English which retains

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go away!<br />
			</em>we can have the very insistent and rude:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You go away!<br />

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please go away<br />
			</em>we cannot have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Please you go away<br />
			</em>This form of the imperative can be negated and, when it is,

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *How beautiful it isn't!<br />
			</em>Some languages may allow this form.&nbsp; (Graham Taylor, an 
			erstwhile England football manager, was once nationally lampooned in 
			Britain for exclaiming <em>Do I not like that!</em>)</p>
			<p>There is a form of negative exclamation, however, which is seen 
			in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't that beautiful!<br />
			</em>which is not a real question at all but a simple exclamation.<br />
			We can also use a negator to perform a similar function as in, 
			e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never have I seen such a beautiful sight!<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Scarcely have I been so surprised!<br />
			</em>Note, by the way, the conventional inversion of subject and 
			verb in these.&nbsp; In fact, what English does is make a question 
			form rather than simply inverting the word order as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never did I see such idiocy!<br />

			all of which are commonplace in a number of languages (including,

			In those and other languages, the double negation often serves to 
			emphasise the sense of the negation.&nbsp; Double negation may also 
			simply be the grammatical form of negation as it is in modern Greek,

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want anything</em><br />
			is often translatable as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want nothing</em><br />
			Double negation can also have the effect of cancelling out the 
			negation and making the statement positive.<br />
			These sorts of double negation are also common in a variety of

				<dd>Other examples of weasel words include the use of a negative 
				plus a negative verb, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not deny that I took it</em><br />
				might mean:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I admit taking it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may have taken it by accident<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may have taken it and forgotten about it</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not disagree</em><br />
				may also mean:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I partially agree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully agree</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no view one way or the other</em><br />
				etc. and the hearer needs more data to be certain what is meant.<br />
				The structures can be disambiguated with the insertion of a 
				modifying adverbial as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not admit taking it under any 
				circumstances</em><br />
				which means<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I strongly deny taking it</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not fully disagree</em><br />
				which means:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I partially disagree</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>negation in both main and subordinate clauses</strong></dt>
				<dd>This kind of negation is not particularly common but occurs, 
				for example in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know whether he isn't right</em><br />
				which means:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he 
			may be right</em><br />
				or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't go because he wasn't going<br />
				</em>which means either:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His 
			decision influenced mine (so I didn't go)<br />
				</em>or, by stressing <em>
			because</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason I didn't go was not because he wasn't 
				going (but for another reason)</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>double negation with modal auxiliary verbs</strong></dt>
				<dd>With some modal auxiliary verbs, especially those referring to ability 
				or obligation, double negation has a useful communicative role.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't not go</em><br />
				implies either:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was forced to go</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt obliged to go</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't not hear him</em><br />
				which means:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't avoid hearing him</em><br />
				Other examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mustn't not ask her</em><br />
				meaning:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am obliged to ask her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have to not be late</em><br />
				meaning:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am allowed to be late</em><br />
				<em>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't think you don't have to be there<br />
				</em>meaning:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to be there<br />
				</em>and so on.<br />
				In these cases, the negator (<em>not, don't </em>etc.) is 
				usually stressed in spoken English and the forms are avoided in 
				writing.</dd>
				<dt><strong>double negation with determiners and pronouns</strong></dt>
				<dd>Some determiners and pronouns in English are negative in 
				meaning and they include <em>none, no, nothing, nobody </em>etc.&nbsp; 
				These sometimes appear in double negative clauses such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't expect none to arrive</em><br />
				meaning:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expected some people to arrive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He doesn't have no money</em><br />
				meaning:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has a little money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't pay nothing</em><br />
				meaning:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I paid a little<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't talk to nobody</em><br />
				meaning:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked to a few people</em><br />
				In all these cases, in spoken language, the pronoun or 
				determiner is usually emphasised to convey its special 
				markedness.&nbsp; In writing, where that is not an option, such 
				expressions are usually avoided.</dd>
				<dt><strong>double negation with negative adverbs</strong></dt>
				<dd>Similarly, some adverbs in English are negative in their 
				sense and they include <em>never, rarely, seldom, hardly ever
				</em>etc.&nbsp; These sometimes appear in double negatives such 
				as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't never go</em><br />
				meaning:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go infrequently<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They don't rarely make a noise</em><br />
				meaning:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They usually make a noise</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Again, in speech the adverb is usually emphasised to signal 
				markedness and in writing the forms are avoided.</dd>

			</table>
			<p>Notes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The structures in the left-hand column are often seen as 
				more colloquial than those in the right-hand column.&nbsp; In 
				many dialects of English, however, they are the preferred forms.</li>
				<li>Some abbreviated structures cannot exist in the first-person singular 
				as an alternative to, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not ready<br />
				</em>We do not 
				allow<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I amn't ready<br />
				</em>or even<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*I aren't ready<br />
				</em>The negative of <em>am</em> in interrogatives and questions 
				tags causes 
				problems all round because the form is usually:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I not coming, too?<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am coming too, aren't I?<br />
				</em>the first of which often seems too formal because <strong>no</strong> 
				abbreviated (enclitic) form of <em>not</em> is available:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Amn't I coming, too?</em><br />
				or we can have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aren't I coming, too?<br />
				</em>which often seems too informal because we can <strong>only</strong> 
				use the enclitic form and:<strong><br />
				</strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Are I not coming, too?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I am coming, too, are not I?<br />
				</em>are not available to us.</li>
				<li>If the more colloquial form of <em>have</em> is selected, the use of <em>got</em> is 
				obligatory.<br />
				We can have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They've not got the right answer</em><br />
				but not:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They've not the right answer<br />
				</em>although:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hasn't the money</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hasn't got the money</em><br />
				are both acceptable.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Type two</h3>
			<p>The second form of alternative negation involves negating a 
			different element of the clause, instead of the verb.<br />
			There are two types:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Sometimes, the sense (i.e., scope and focus) is not altered but the style is.<br />
				For example:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style91"><em>I didn't have any lunch</em></td>
						<td rowspan="4" class="auto-style124">or, more formally</td>
						<td class="auto-style103"><em>I had no lunch</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style95"><em>An old saw will not cut 
						properly</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style98"><em>No old saw will cut properly</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style95"><em>Computers aren't cheap</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style98"><em>No computer is cheap</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style93"><em>She didn't talk to anyone</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style101"><em>She talked to no-one</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				and so on.</li>
				<li>At other times, especially with certain determiners, the 
				scope of negation is altered in the alternative form.&nbsp; For 
				example:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style91"><em>Many people did not 
						congratulate her</em></td>
						<td rowspan="4" class="auto-style124">is <strong>not</strong> the same as</td>
						<td class="auto-style103"><em>Not many people 
						congratulated her</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style95"><em>All the children didn't 
						arrive on time</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style98"><em>Not all the children arrived 
						on time</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style95"><em>Half of the food has not 
						been eaten</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style98"><em>Not half of the food has 
						been eaten</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style93"><em>A few of us didn't notice 
						the difference</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style101"><em>Not a few of us noticed the 
						difference</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				and so on.<br />
				In the first column, the negation applies to the whole of the 
				clause but in the third column, the scope of negation is limited 
				to the 
				determiners.&nbsp; So,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the students didn't sit the 
				examination</em><br />
				means none sat the examination, but:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all the students sat the examination</em><br />
				means some did and some didn't.</li>

			<p>Occasionally, especially in writing where the use of emphasis,

			<p>In spoken language, the senses can be disambiguated by stressing 
			the determiners <em>any</em> and <em>a few</em>, stressing the 
			pre-determiners <em>half (of) </em>and<em> all (of)</em>, stressing the 
			subordinating conjunction <em>because</em> or the preposition <em>
			due to </em>and by placing a rising intonation 
			contour on <em>she would be here</em> and <em>his working style</em>.<br />
			In written English, that form of disambiguation is not available so 
			careful writers will  rephrase  to avoid the possible confusion.<br />

			* and other frequency adverbs such as <em>usually, always, frequently, often</em> 
			etc.<br />
			&dagger; and other downtoners such as <em>slightly, 
			marginally, a bit, a tad</em> etc.<br />
			‡ The fact that there is no negative word for <em>yet</em> causes 
			problems for learners from some language backgrounds.<br />
			<em>(r) </em>These are rarer and slightly more formal items.<br />
			It is worth noting that when referring to time, the non-assertive 
			word is <em>anymore</em> but when reference is to quantity, the term 
			is two words: <em>any more</em>.<p>A few notes on the above:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The table isn't complete because there are some less 
				frequent negations, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's happy, too </em>&rarr; <em>She's not happy either </em>
				[but not <em>*She's happy neither</em>]<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are, to some extent, contented</em> &rarr; <em>They 
				aren't at all contented </em>[but not <em>*They are none 
				contented</em>]</li>
				<li>Apart from the use of <em>never</em>, the structures in the 
				right-hand column are more formal than those in the middle 
				column.&nbsp; </li>
				<li>The pronouns in column 3 are singular although native 
				speakers often pluralise the verb to form, for example, the 
				questionable<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked them all but none are coming.<br />
				</em>Issues of proximity concord are in play here.&nbsp; For 
				more, see the guide to concord linked from the list of related 
				guides at the end.</li>
				<li>In the initial position, as the subject of the verb, only the forms in 
				the third column are possible:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody was late</em> [not <em>*Anybody wasn't late</em>]<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither was ready</em> [not <em>*Either wasn't ready</em>]<br />
				etc.<br />
				Many other languages <strong>do</strong> allow these forms of 
				negation.</li>
				<li>We can also, somewhat formally, front the adjunct as we saw 
				above but not without forming a question word order in the 
				sentence:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never would I have believed ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Not until then did I realise ...</em></li>
				<li>Once negated, the whole utterance and all following adverbs, 
				pronouns and determiners are usually negated in the same way so we get, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither of the children was looking very happy and none of 
				the adults was smiling either</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Neither of the children was looking happy and any of the 
				adults weren't smiling either</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't been anywhere yet</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I haven't been anywhere already</em></li>
				<li>If the usual rule of using the non-assertive <em>any</em>- 
				series in negations is not observed, there is a change to 
				the scope of negation.&nbsp; This is because non-assertive terms 
				are used within the negated clause and assertive terms outside 
				it.<br />
				Note the difference between:<ol class="auto-style14">
					<li><em>She didn't eat any of the cake</em></li>
					<li><em>She didn't eat some of the cake</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style13">In sentence A, the whole sentence is negated 
			(hence the use of <em>any</em>) and the meaning is<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ate no cake</em><br />
			In sentence B, however, only the verb is negated because the object 
			noun phrase includes the assertive <em>some</em> and the meaning is<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			There was some of the cake left which she did not eat<br />
			</em>Just possibly, in spoken English, with the emphasis heavily on
			<em>some</em>, the sentence could mean<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ate all the cake </em>(not just some of it)</p>

			<p>These five adverbs are sometimes known as negators because they

			Most analyses include the following points but this site has done 
			its own research, the outcomes of which throw a little doubt on the 
			consistency of these characteristics (see below for more on that).&nbsp;

					<li><em>She scarcely ever comes late</em></li>
					<li><em>They rarely come to anyone's party</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>In the initial position, somewhat formally, they require 
				inversion of the subject and verb (with the <em>do</em> operator in past 
				simple and present simple forms):<ol class="greybullet">
					<li><em>Seldom have I heard such nonsense</em></li>
					<li><em>Rarely does he believe me</em></li>
					<li><em>Hardly had I arrived when the phone range</em></li>
					<li><em>Barely audibly did she speak</em></li>
					<li><em>Scarcely credible was their explanation</em></li>
				</ol>There is more on this 
				below under fronted negative adverbials.</li>
				<li>Like the negator <em>never</em> these adverbs can, not must,

					<li class="greybullet"><em>You seldom agree, do you?</em></li>
					<li class="greybullet"><em>I hardly had time, did I?</em></li>
				</ol>But, unlike the true negator, <em>never</em>, they can take balanced tags 
				so we can also allow.<ol>
					<li class="greybullet"><em>You seldom agree, don't you?</em></li>
					<li class="greybullet"><em>I hardly had time, didn't I?</em></li>
					<li class="greybullet"><em>It was barely 
					audible, wasn't it?</em></li></ol>
					The true negator <em>never</em> can only take a positive tag as in:<ol>
					<li class="greybullet"><em>I never had much time, did I?<br />
					</em>and we do not allow:</li>
					<li class="greybullet"><em>*I never had much time, 
					didn't I?</em></li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p>All five of these take non-assertive forms, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They have scarcely <strong>anything</strong> to say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has hardly <strong>any</strong> money left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We <strong>barely ever</strong> go anywhere these days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have seldom done <strong>anything</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We never see <strong>anybody</strong></em><br />
			The assertive forms:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *They have scarcely something<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She has hardly some money left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We barely go somewhere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They have seldom done something<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We never see somebody</em><br />
			are usually disallowed.<br />
			(The scope of negation can, however, be restricted to exclude the 
			object so both:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She seldom said something nice</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She seldom said anything nice</em><br />
			are both possible although the first is rarer and excludes the object 
			from the negation.)</p>
			<p>Because these negating adverbs carry the negative sense, they are 
			not themselves negated because that would produce a double negation 
			not allowed in English.&nbsp; So:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't seldom go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She doesn't rarely come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They don't have hardly any<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He didn't barely understand<br />
			</em>etc. are all disallowed (but see above under double negation 
			for the rare times when they are possible).<br />
			All of the above may be allowed in other languages and that is a 
			source of error.</p>

			<h4>Conclusions</h4>
			<p>You can, of course, draw your own from the findings here but 
			here's what were felt to be the most important:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>These items are seen as generally 
				negative because:<br />
				People were able to accept as fully or marginally correct a 
				positive tag on<ol class="auto-style1">
					<li><em>never</em>: (Item 3) 97% (this is an indication, of 
					course, that the adverb is universally seen as negative)</li>
					<li><em>barely</em>: (Item 1) 90% of the time</li>
					<li><em>seldom</em>: (Item 5) 87% of the time</li>
					<li><em>hardly ever</em>: (Item 7) 93% of the time</li>
					<li><em>scarcely</em>: (Item 9) 83% of the time</li>
					<li><em>rarely</em>: (Item 11) 3% of the time</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>However, the adverbs may also be seen as less negative 
				because there is some acceptance that a negative tag question is 
				acceptable as follows:<ol class="auto-style1">
					<li><em>never</em>: (Item 4) 93% full rejection but 3% full 
					acceptance and 3% marginal acceptance</li>
					<li><em>barely</em>: (Item 2) 53% full rejection but 10% full acceptance 
					and 10% marginal acceptance</li>
					<li><em>seldom</em>: (Item 6) 63% full rejection but 10% full acceptance 
					and 13% marginal acceptance</li>
					<li><em>hardly ever</em>: (Item 8) 73% full rejection but 10% full 
					acceptance and 7% marginal acceptance</li>
					<li><em>scarcely</em>: (Item 10) 57% full rejection but 23% full acceptance 
					and 7% marginal acceptance</li>
					<li><em>rarely</em>: (Item 12) 63% full rejection but 27% full acceptance 
					and 3% marginal acceptance</li>
				</ol>So the items are only <strong>generally</strong> negatively perceived.&nbsp; 
				In fact, if we put these figures on an acceptability cline 
				(lumping fully and marginally (un)acceptable together) , we see 
				that some words are seen as a lot less negative than others.&nbsp; 
				Like this:<br />
				<img alt="cline" height="86" src="../../imagesgraphics/negator_cline.png" width="465" /><br />
				and the two items on the right of that cline were considered 
				marginally or wholly acceptable with negative tags by a third of 
				the respondents.</li>
				<li>With assertive determiners and pronouns we found that the 
				scope of negation can be limited with two of the items but that 
				is not universally recognised because:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Item 18:<em> She rarely says something<br />
			</em>was fully accepted by 20% and considered 
			marginally acceptable by 40% with only 20% finding it wholly 
			unacceptable (as we would not expect at all)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Item 19: <em>She seldom said something nice<br />
			</em>was fully accepted by 33% and considered 
			marginally acceptable by 43% with only 10% finding it wholly 
			unacceptable (as we would not expect at all)<br />
				This result partially parallels the cline we saw above because 
				rarely lies on the right and seldom in the middle.<br />
				The word <em>scarcely</em> is something of an oddity because 
				while it shares the same level of acceptability with <em>rarely</em> 
				concerning tag questions, Item 15 (<em>I scarcely saw someone</em>) 
				was rejected by 90% of respondents.<br />
				For the other negators, the assumption was that the whole of the 
				following text was negated and, therefore, the items were 
				understood as distinctly negative.<br />
				We may take it that the words <em>seldom</em> and <em>rarely</em> 
				are perceived as slightly less negative than the other four 
				adverbials.</li>
				<li>These adverbs may well be negative but they are not
				<span class="style_underline"><strong><em>as</em></strong></span> 
				negative as the true negator, <em>never</em>.</li>
				<li>Both <em>scarcely</em> and <em>hardly</em> are also followed 
				routinely by <em>ever</em> which would appear to enhance the 
				negativity with which it is seen.&nbsp; Deliberately, for this 
				little survey, only <em>hardly</em> was paired with <em>ever</em> 
				and that comes out as almost as negative as <em>never</em> but
				<em>scarcely</em> alone as we see from the cline is viewed 
				considerably more positively.</li>
				<li>It seems that with assertive or non-assertive pronouns and 
				determiners, that the situation is mixed because the scope of 
				negation can be called into play to make what would appear to be 
				malformed sentences acceptable so, arguably, we can accept, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hardly ever meet someone I know at his 
				parties<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She rarely says something stupid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We seldom listen to some kinds of music<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have scarcely spoken to some of the guests<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We barely know some of the people here</em><br />
				which all reduce the scope of negation to the verb phrase but 
				leave the object positive (or assertive).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The implications for teaching are not huge because the data show that treating the items as negative will rarely if ever result 
			in a malformed or unacceptable utterance but, on the other hand, 
			that treating them as potentially positive is also acceptable, 
			especially in the cases of inserting tag questions.<br />
			The scope of negation issue remains and it is non-intuitive for many 
			learners who may well not be aware of the difference between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She seldom talked to some of the children</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She seldom talked to any of the children</em><br />
			and at more advanced levels, this needs to be highlighted so that 
			learners can notice what is happening..</p>

			<p>We need to distinguish here between <em>a little</em> and <em>
			little</em> and between <em>a few</em> and <em>few</em> because, 
			with the article, these determiners mean an adequate amount and 
			operate perfectly normally, taking assertive forms so we get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few people had </em><strong><em>something</em></strong><em> 
			to say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little money has </em><strong><em>already</em></strong><em> 
			been made</em></p>
			<p>However, when they are used without the article, these 
			determiners signal an <span class="style_underline"><strong><em>in</em></strong></span>adequate 
			amount and are negative so we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few people had </em><strong><em>anything</em></strong><em> 
			to say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little money has </em><strong><em>ever</em></strong><em> been 
			made</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Few people had <strong>something</strong> to 
			say<br />
			</em>unless we are deliberately leaving the object out of the scope 
			of negation (see above)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Little money has <strong>already</strong> been made</em></p>
			<p>When <em>only</em> means <em>no more</em> or <em>other than</em> 
			it also functions as a negator so we encounter, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Mary knew <strong>anything</strong></em><br />
			and not, usually:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Mary knew <strong>something</strong></em><br />
			unless, again, we are deliberately leaving the object out of the scope of 
			negation (see above).</p>
			<p>Like other negators, these three words do not always take 
			positive question tags so the usual form is, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Mary knew anything, didn't she?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few people had anything to say, didn't they?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little change is necessary, isn't it?</em><br />
			although positive question tags may be used as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Mary knew anything, did she?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few people had anything to say, did they?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little change is necessary, is it?</em><br />
			but that is very much rarer.</p>
			<p>The adverb <em>little</em> works in a similar fashion to the <em>
			barely, scarcely, rarely</em> etc. group including obligatory 
			inversion when in initial position:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He little realised that any danger was involved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little did he realise the danger it involved</em></p>

			<p>These two adverbs are not, in themselves, negative but they imply 
			a negative outcome&nbsp;in a way that <em>barely, scarcely,
			hardly</em> etc. do not.&nbsp; Compare, for example, these pairs of 
			sentences:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They scarcely survived the accident</em><br />
			but they did<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They almost survived the accident</em><br />

			but I was home<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had nearly / almost got home when I started 
			to feel unwell</em><br />
			and I was not home.</p>
			<p>Additionally, these adverbs modify negative or non-assertive

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have almost nowhere to put it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have nearly nothing to say<br />

			<p>Fronting of adverbs occurs routinely in many, 
			especially Germanic, languages and is often followed by the 
			inversion of subject and verb.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday I went to London</em><br />
			translates in German as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Gestern ging ich nach London</em><br />
			in Dutch as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Gisteren ging ik naar Londen</em><br />
			and in Swedish as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Igår gick jag till London</em><br />
			all literally:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday <span class="style_brown">went I</span> to London.</em></p>
			<p>The peculiarity in English is twofold:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>inversion only occurs with fronted adverbials when they carry a 
				negative sense (although it can occur with place adverbials in, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here she comes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There it goes</em>)</li>
				<li>inversion in this case (but not with place adjuncts) requires the insertion of the
				<em>do</em>-operator with 
				simple present and past tense forms</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Here's how it works but some of the forms are very formal and

			<p>In all cases in English, fronting the element draws attention to

			English is <strong>marked</strong> for special attention.&nbsp; 
			Languages which routinely front adverbials have no such marking and 
			the fronted adverbial carries no special significance.<br />
			Learners who are unaware of this fact and told that fronting the

			<p>English has a peculiarity with negation which causes a good deal 
			of difficulty.<br />
			Most languages will put the negation where it 
			belongs, i.e., with the verb that is being negated.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that he hasn't done it yet<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I expect he won't come<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I imagine she has no money</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			In all these cases, we have a verb signalling belief followed by a 
			subordinate clause which is negated in some way.<br />
			English, bizarrely, often chooses to negate the main clause and 
			leave the subordinate clause positive.&nbsp; This is why it is 
			called transferred or raised negation.&nbsp; It only occurs with verbs 
			signalling belief or assumption such as:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>believe, suppose, fancy, 
			imagine, reckon, expect</em></span> etc.</p>
			For the three sentences above, for example, English speakers would 
			naturally select:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think he's done it yet<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I don't expect he will come<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I don't imagine she has any money</em><p>This is deeply illogical and confusing because the negation 
			really belongs with the subordinate, not the main, clause.&nbsp; The 
			proof of this is to consider the natural question tag because the 
			positive question tag reveals the negative meaning of the clause:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't suppose he is coming now, is he?</em> 
			(not <em>do I?</em> or <em>isn't he?</em>)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't reckon we'll be there before 8, will we? </em>
			(not<em> do I? </em>or <em>won't we?</em>)</p>
			<h4>Ambiguity</h4>
			<p>There is, in fact, a small danger of some ambiguity when negation 
			is transferred (or understood to be transferred).&nbsp; So, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John doesn't think his sister is happy</em><br />
			can be interpreted two ways:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John believes his sister is unhappy</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John does not think his sister is happy, he knows she is.</em><br />
			The second interpretation is rare and will be signalled as such, 
			either by the insertion of an additional clause as above or by heavy 
			emphasis being placed on the main verb.</p>

				</table>
			<p>... not all such verbs allow this transfer.<br />
			For example, <em>assume</em> and <em>presume</em> do not work this 
			way:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I assume you haven't paid</em> [assumption = <em>you haven't 
			paid</em>]<br />
			is not the same as <br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't assume you've paid</em> [no assumption made]<br />The verb <em>hope</em> is also odd because it will not allow 
			the transfer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't hope it rains</em> [= <em>I do not hope for rain but I may 
			expect rain</em>]<br />
			is not the equivalent of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope it doesn't rain</em> [= <em>I am hoping for no rain</em>]<br />
			The verb <em>expect </em>works differently, allowing the transferred 
			negation and using the future <em>
			will</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I expect it won't rain = I don't expect it will rain</em></p>
			<p>This explains, partially, why the verbs have irregular and 
			stylistically determined formulations using the pro-forms <em>not
			</em>and <em>so</em> for the object clause.<br />
			All the verbs in the list above can be negated by a formulation such 
			as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Is she coming? It doesn't appear so / It appears not<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Will it be expensive? I don't expect so / I expect not<br />
			</em>Generally speaking, the forms with <em>not</em> are more formal 
			with the exceptions of <em>hope</em> and <em>guess</em> with which 
			the <em>not</em> formulation is preferred in all styles.</p>
			<p>There are a number of other verbs which refer to belief and 
			assumption (or statements and questions) which do / do not allow transferred negation.<br />

			<p>English and a range of other European languages, such as Italian, 
			German and Polish allow transferred negation (sometimes with a 
			subtle change in emphasis) but many other languages (such as Thai) 
			do not allow it under any circumstances.<br />
			Other languages, such as Russian, will allow both forms but prefer 
			the negation on the subordinate clause (which is where logic demands 
			it).<br />
			Scandinavian and Germanic languages, according to ELT Concourse's long-suffering 
			and generous native-speaker informants, allow both forms but, like 
			English, often prefer the transferred-negation form despite its 
			illogicality.</p>
			<p>Spanish and French are not alone in varying the mood of the verb, 
			using the subjunctive for the transferred negation and the 
			indicative for the logical negation.<br />
			The subjunctive mood implies the counterfactual sense of, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think it's going to rain</em><br />
			but the indicative mood is used to express greater certainty as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's not going to rain</em><br />
			In common with these and other languages, English also uses a 
			subjunctive, or putative,<em> should </em>as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think this should be difficult<br />
			</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this won't be difficult<br />
			</em>(For more on this, see the guide to tense in dependent clauses linked in the list of related guides at the end.)</p>
			<p>In Spanish and Catalan, too, the convention is to put the 
			negation in the subordinate clause, where it belongs, so the 
			canonical form will be:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it wasn't like that</em><br />
			However, if one is contradicting something said, then the negation 
			will appear on the first verb as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think it was like that</em></p>
			<p>In English, conventional use of transferred negation often involves the non-assertive forms 
			so we will have, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I don't think we'll have <strong>any</strong> rain</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She doesn't believe <strong>anyone</strong> is working</em> <em>hard 
			enough</em><br />
			but when the negation is not transferred, the meaning may be more 
			assertively expressed as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I think we won't have <strong>some</strong> rain</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;She believes <strong>someone</strong> is not working hard enough</em></p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">The result of inter-language influences and the unpredictable 
			behaviour of the verbs is that learners will often produce either 
			unnatural or plain wrong language by assuming either:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style36">
				<li>
				all verbs of thinking and believing will function the same 
				way in English<br />
				or</li>
				<li>that English will function in the same way as other 
				languages</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Errors such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I think that he wouldn't come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I say not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He didn't state so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I didn't ask so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I think anyone isn't here<br />
			</em>occur for one or both of these reasons.</p>

			<p>The situation appears to be that in many languages, <strong>
			apart from English</strong>, which allow transferred negation, the 
			transferred form is not the preferred one and is <strong>marked</strong> in some way, to express, for example, 
			contradiction.<br />
			In English, the transferred form, with those verbs which allow it, 
			is the <strong>unmarked</strong> formulation and the marked formulation is to negate 
			the subordinate clause.</p>

			<p>The verb <em>catenate</em> may be defined as join together in a

			the <em>-ing</em> form or a past participle (<em>-ed</em> / -<em>en</em> form).</p>
			<p>We can negate either the main verb or the following non-finite 
			but the meaning often changes.&nbsp; Compare, for example</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>She didn't promise to come</em><br />
				which refers to the promising,

				<em>She promised not to come<br />

				<li><em>He didn't manage to complain</em><br />
				which means he was unable to complain,
				with<br />
				<em>He managed not to complain<br />
				</em>which means he controlled himself and did not complain 
				although he wanted to.</li>
				<li><em>Susan admitted not asking him<br />
				</em>which means she accepted the blame, with<br /><em>Susan didn't admit asking him<br />
				</em>which means she denied any blame.</li>
				<li><em>He spent the day not working<br />
				</em>which means he did no work that day, with<br /><em>He didn't spend the day working<br />
				</em>which means he only spent some of the day working.</li>
				<li><em>I don't want to make my opinion obvious<br />

				<dt><strong>Future and current possibility</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could arrive early tomorrow &rarr; She probably 
				won't arrive early tomorrow<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I should / would think he's arrived by now → I shouldn't / 
				wouldn't think he's arrived yet<br />
				</em>Here English works conventionally with transferred negation because<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should / would think he hasn't arrived yet</em><br />
				is marked and emphasises the doubtfulness of his being there.<br />
				The verbs <em>may</em> and <em>might</em> used for possibility 
				are more predictable and regular:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She might /may arrive early → She mightn't / may not arrive 
				early</em><br />
				and also allow transferred negation:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				You might think he's being serious → You mightn't think he's 
				being serious<br />
				</em>but, again, the non-transferred form is marked:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				You might think he's not being serious.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Futurity, willingness and intention</strong></dt>
				<dd>It is often averred that:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to talk to the boss about this</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll talk to the boss about this</em><br />
				are different insofar as the first refers to present intention 
				and the second either to current willingness or to futurity.&nbsp; 
				That is partly the line taken on this site in the guide to 
				talking about the future.<br />
				However, when the forms are negated, the distinction is less 
				clear, if it exists at all so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't talk to the boss about this</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not going to talk to the boss about this</em><br />
				are, for most intents and purposes entirely synonymous.<br />
				The other factor here is that the negated forms can carry the 
				sense of refusal rather than intention, willingness or futurity.<br />
				They do not in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not going to have time to do that</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't have time to do that</em><br />
				which are synonymous and refer to futurity alone and not to 
				willingness or intention.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Complaint</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could / might have told me!<br />
				</em>has no negation at 
				all because<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He couldn't have told me<br />
				</em>means<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I am sure he didn't tell 
				me<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He mightn't have told me<br />
				</em>means<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I am not at all sure 
				whether he told me or not</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Suggestion and advice</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might try being nice to him → You might try not 
				being nice to him </em>[not <em>*You mightn't try ...</em>]<br />
				Compare also:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shouldn't try to make him angry<br />
				</em>meaning<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will 
				probably try to make him angry and it's inadvisable<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				You should try not to make him angry<br />
				</em>which is advice about 
				being diplomatic.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Deduction</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That must be the postman → That can't / couldn't be the 
				postman<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She must have been exhausted → She can't / couldn't have been 
				exhausted</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Obligation</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had to phone her mother → She didn't need to phone 
				her mother</em> [so probably didn't]<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She had to phone her mother → She needn't have phoned her mother</em> 
				[but did]<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had to phone her mother → She didn't have to phone her 
				mother </em>[and may or may not have done]</dd>

			<h3>What is being negated?</h3>
			<p>As we saw above with catenative verbs, either the first or the 
			second, non-finite, form may be negated but in the case of modal 
			auxiliary verbs there is sometimes ambiguity.&nbsp; If for example, 
			we take:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; He may not come</em><br />
			we can interpret the meaning either as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is not allowed to come</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; It is possible he will not come</em></p>
			<p>In written English apart from clues from the co-text and context, 
			it is impossible to disambiguate the senses.<br />
			In spoken English disambiguation can be achieved by tone unit 
			separation.<br />
			The difference will then be the phrasing and stress.&nbsp; As:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He may </em>| <strong><em>not come</em></strong><br />
			which implies that it is a possibility,
			vs.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He may not </em>| <em> <strong>come<br />
			</strong></em>which implies that it is forbidden.</p>
			<p>Compare also:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I can
			</em>|<em> <strong>not</strong> smoke<br />
			</em>which means<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am able not to smoke<br />
			</em>with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			</em>|<em> cannot
			</em>/<em> can't <strong>smoke</strong><br />
			</em>which means<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I am not allowed to smoke.</em></p>

			<p>English does not confine itself to negation by structure.&nbsp; 
			We can also signal negative meanings even 
			though the grammar seems to be a declarative or positive form.&nbsp; 
			Not all languages do this and it is source of a good deal of error 
			and unnatural formulations.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>negative lexical or main verbs</strong></dt>
				<dd>These include verbs such as<span class="style_black"><br /><em>abhor, annul, avert, avoid, deny, deter, detest, disavow, 
				discard, dislike, disprove, disregard, disrupt, distrust, dodge, 
				doom, doubt, duck, elude, escape, eschew, evade, excuse, 
				exterminate, fail, fear, foil, forbid, forestall, forswear, 
				frown on, frustrate, harm, hate, hinder, impair, invalidate, 
				jeopardise, lack, loathe, mangle, mar, negate, neglect, 
				obliterate, obscure, obstruct, omit, ostracise, paralyse, 
				penalise, persecute, poison, prevent, punish, refrain, regret, reject, renounce, repudiate, scrap, shirk, shun, stop, 
				suffocate, threaten, thwart, undermine </em></span>etc.<br />
				which all 
				carry a negative meaning.<br />
				They take negative (non-assertive) adverbs, 
				pronouns and 
				determiners.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_black">denied / 
				regretted any</span> wrongdoing</em> 
				[not <em>*some wrongdoing</em>]<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The have <span class="style_black">failed 
				/ neglected</span> to be here
				<span class="style_black">yet</span></em> [not <em>*be here already</em>]<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S<em>he <span class="style_black">avoided / 
				escaped / eschewed / evaded</span> speaking to
				<span class="style_black">anyone</span></em> [not <em>*to someone</em>]<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_black">abhors / 
				hates / loathes / detests any</span> dishonesty</em> 
				[not <em>*some dishonesty</em>]<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We <span class="style_black">disregard any</span> 
				criticism </em> 
				[not <em>*some criticism</em>]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I <span class="style_black">refrained</span> from saying
				<span class="style_black">anything</span> too controversial </em>
				[not <em>*something too controversial</em>]</dd>
				<dt><strong>negative nouns</strong></dt>
				<dd>There are a few nouns which also carry a negative sense 
				which often require negative, non-assertive structures.<br />
				For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He has a complete <span class="style_black">lack</span> 
				of <span class="style_black">any</span> sense of humour<br />
				</em>not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>He 
				has a complete lack of some sense of humour</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A <span class="style_black">shortage</span> of
				<span class="style_black">any</span> useful tools made the work 
				difficult<br />
				</em>not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shortage of some useful tools made 
				the work difficult<br />
				</em>because that implies that only a few useful tools were 
				absent, not that all the tools were useless.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>In the <span class="style_black">absence</span> of
				<span class="style_black">any</span> apology ...<br />
				</em>not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>In the 
				absence of some apology ...</em><br />
				Nouns derived from the negative verbs above also work this way:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>His <span class="style_black">denial</span> of
				<span class="style_black">any</span> wrongdoing<br />
				</em>not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His denial of some wrongdoing<br />
				</em>because that implies that he admitted some but not all the 
				wrongdoing<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her <span class="style_black">escape</span> from
				<span class="style_black">any</span> blame<br />
				</em>not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her escape from some blame<br />
				</em>because that implies that she didn't escape all the blame<br />
				<em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My <span class="style_black">abhorrence / detestation / 
				hatred / loathing</span> of <span class="style_black">any</span> 
				sentimentality<br />
				</em>not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *My abhorrence of some sentimentality<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their <span class="style_black">failure</span> to arrive
				<span class="style_black">yet<br />
				</span> </em>not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Their failure to arrive already<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His <span class="style_black">avoidance</span>  of
				<span class="style_black">anywhere</span> too crowded<br />
				</em>not<br />
				<em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *His avoidance of somewhere too 
				crowded</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>negative prepositions</strong></dt>
				<dd>A few prepositions can negate sentences and require the use 
				of non-assertive determiners and pronouns.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Do this <span class="style_black">without any</span> delay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will argue <span class="style_black">against anyone</span> who thinks that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will buy the house <span class="style_black">excluding / 
				except any</span> of the contents<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sold everything <span class="style_black">bar</span>
				<span class="style_black">anything</span> he needed for his new 
				house</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>negative adjectives</strong></dt>
				<dd>There are some adjectives which also have negative senses 
				and require non-assertive forms.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_black">Unaware yet</span> of the problems he went ahead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was <span class="style_black">unhappy with any </span>of the changes and rejected all of 
				them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was <span class="style_black">careless of any </span>damage he might do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Ignorant of anything</span> better he went ahead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Powerless</span> to change 
				<span class="style_black">anyone's</span> mind, he gave up</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>negative senses</strong></dt>
				<dd>In addition to the negative-sense verbs and nouns, there are 
				occasions when the overall sense of an utterance is negative and 
				negative (i.e. non-assertive) pronouns or determiners will be required.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He got on the bus without <span class="style_black">anyone</span> 
				asking him for a ticket</em> (not <em>someone</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm too tired to do <span class="style_black">any</span> 
				more</em> (not <em>some more</em>)</dd>
				<dt><strong>negative conditional clauses</strong></dt>
				<dd>Some conditional sentences carry a negative connotation so 
				we find, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do <span class="style_black">anything</span> wrong, you will be 
				told about it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will get arrested if she does <span class="style_black">anything</span> so stupid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll close the meeting now unless <span class="style_black">anyone</span> has anything to add</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>negative morphemes</strong></dt>
				<dd>A set of prefixes in English have the effect of negating:<br />
				<em>un-,
				in-,
				im-,
				a-,
				non- </em>all usually provide the negative meaning of an 
				adjective:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unhappy, inexcusable, impossible, amoral, non-flammable</em> 
				etc.<br />
				<em>de-,
				un-,
				dis-</em> prefix verbs in the same way, implying reversal or 
				negation:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; denationalise, undo, dislike</em> etc.<br />
				Somewhat marginally, <em>pseudo-,
				mal-,
				mis- </em>also carry a negative denotation while not forming 
				proper negatives:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pseudointellectual, malformed, misused </em>etc.<br />
				For more on the meanings and uses of negative prefixes, see the 
				guide to word formation, linked below.<br />
				There is one, and only one, negative suffix in English: <em>less</em> 
				which is applied to nouns to form adjectives as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hopeless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; helpless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; faceless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friendless</em><br />
				The suffix always carries a privative meaning of being without 
				something.</dd>
