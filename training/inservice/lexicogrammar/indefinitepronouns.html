			<h1>Indefinite or impersonal pronouns</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="indefinite" height="207" src="../../images/abstract_indefinite310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide deals with pronouns other than the personal pronouns 
			(i.e., <em>I, me, him, her, yourself, your </em>etc.) or pronouns 
			identifying a specific noun (<em>it, they</em> etc.).<br />
			In that sense only, we are talking about <strong>impersonal</strong> 
			or <strong>indefinite</strong> 
			pronouns, although the term is horribly inexact because these pronouns often 
			refer to people and in the case of some categories, to particular 
			individuals or things.<br />
			For the sake of conciseness and clarity, we'll also use the term <strong>indefinite 
			pronouns</strong> because these pronouns do not refer to particular 
			people or things in the way that <em>you, me, it, they, them, ourselves</em> 
			etc. do.<br />
			In summary, these pronouns are either impersonal or indefinite 
			(and sometimes both).<br />
			There is
			<a href="../../initial/lexis/personalpronouns.html" target="_blank">
			a separate guide to personal pronouns</a> on this site.</p>

					<h2>Classification</h2>

			<p>Apart from the three forms of personal pronouns (personal: <em>I, 
			me, you, they </em>etc., reflexive: <em>myself, themselves, 
			ourselves</em> etc. and genitive / possessive: <em>my, your, his, 
			mine, their</em> etc.), there are the following main classes of pronouns and 
			this guide will take them one at a time.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Because most of the words analysed in the guide can act as 
			pronouns or determiners, it's worth pausing to explain the 
			difference.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Determiners</strong> come before nouns, noun phrases 
				or pronouns and often have an alternative <em>of </em>or<em> of 
				the </em>construction:</dt>
				<dd><em><span class="style_black">Both</span> parents are here<br />
				<span class="style_black">Both of the</span> children are here<br />
				<span class="style_black">Neither of </span>them want to be here<br />
				<span class="style_black">Which of the</span> books do you want?<br />
				<span class="style_black">Those of</span> us who don't want to 
				see the film will go and eat<br />
				I want <span class="style_black">that</span> book<br />
				</em>etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Pronouns</strong> proper replace the noun to which 
				they refer and do not have the alternative <em>of</em> 
				constructions.&nbsp; Some pronouns, especially <em>which</em> 
				and <em>that</em> can stand for entire clauses.&nbsp; They can stand as the subject or object of 
				a verb:</dt>
				<dd><em><span class="style_black">Both</span> have arrived<br />
				<span class="style_black">Neither</span> is useful<br />
				<span class="style_black">Which</span> do you want?<br />
				<span class="style_black">Those</span> are nice<br />
				<span class="style_black">That</span> was interesting<br />
				I enjoyed <span class="style_black">those</span><br />
				I gave <span class="style_black">everything</span> away<br />
				</em>etc.</dd>
			</dl>

			many items acting in both roles.&nbsp; Here's the list:</p>

			<p>It is not always a simple matter to identify whether words are 
			acting as pronouns <em>per se</em> or simply that the noun phrase 
			which they determine has been elided.<br />
			In spoken discourse, the latter is often the case as in, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like some cake?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, thanks, I don't want any </em>(cake)<br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked for three keys but they only sent two</em> (keys)<br />
			where the noun is elided and <em>any</em> and <em>two</em> retain 
			their determiner status.<br />
			At other times, it is clear that the item is acting as a pronoun in 
			its own right because the noun is not easily recoverable from the 
			context or could be a wide range of possible phrases. For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We have done enough</em> (work?, damage?, business? etc.)</p>
			<p>If you would like this list as a PDF document,
			<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_determiner_or_pronoun.pdf" target="_blank">
			click here</a>.</p>
			<p>In some analyses, the pronouns <em>one</em> and <em>ones</em> are 
			considered the pronoun equivalent of indefinite articles or the 
			determiner <em>some</em> as in, for 
			example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want a biscuit?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I'll have one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want some biscuits?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, the chocolate ones, please</em></p>

			<p>These look exactly the same as the <em>wh-</em> relative pronouns

			One addition to the list is <em>what</em> which is only colloquially 
			(illiterately, if you prefer) used as a relative pronoun (<em>The 
			man what I saw</em>).<br />
			The category is quite simple so a few examples will be enough.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6"><em><span class="style_black">Who</span> came to

				selection)</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>What</em></span><em> do you

				used when there is no or a nearly infinite selection)</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Whose</em></span><em> hat is 
				this?</em> (possessive interrogative pronoun)</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Whom</em></span><em> did you

				by <em>who</em>)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Both <em>which, whose</em> and <em>what</em> also act commonly as

			<p>This is a closed class traditionally containing only <em>this, 
			that, these </em>and<em> those</em>.&nbsp; They are distinguished by number and by whether 
			they refer to something near or far.&nbsp; There are a number of 
			uses:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>discourse markers</strong></dt>
				<dd>The pronouns are used to make text cohere and point to what 
				is to follow (cataphoric reference) or what precedes (anaphoric 
				reference).&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This</span> is what I mean ... &rarr;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				&larr; ... and <span class="style_black">that</span> is the 
				reason I'm late<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to suggest <span class="style_black">these</span>. &rarr;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &larr; ... so <span class="style_black">those</span> are 
				my reasons for not voting<br />
				</em>The demonstrative pronouns
				<em>this </em>and<em> these </em>can be used to refer forward 
				(cataphorically) and back (anaphorically) but
				<em><strong>that </strong> </em><strong>and</strong><em><strong> those 
				</strong> </em><strong>can only refer anaphorically</strong>.<br />
				In this role, the pronouns can substitute for a variety of 
				phrase types and clauses but there are some restrictions.<br />
				The pronouns <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> can substitute for 
				a noun phrase, a prepositional phrase or a verb phrase:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wanted the book on Venezuela but
				<span class="style_black">that</span> I couldn't find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have only $5 with me but this I will happily lend you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She opened a restaurant on the corner and
				<span class="style_black">that</span> was a bad position<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can put it in the middle and <span class="style_black">
				this</span> is a good place for it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They wanted me to help them but <span class="style_black">
				that</span> I couldn't do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has arrived too early and <span class="style_black">this</span> 
				is awkward for the host</em><br />
				The pronouns <em>these</em> and <em>those</em> can only usually 
				stand for noun phrases but it is possible to have plural 
				prepositional phrases as in, for example<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They opened shops in the town centre and 
				by the station but <span class="style_black">these</span> were 
				bad choices</em><br />
				Verb phrases are conceived as singular so:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have done the gardening and fixed the 
				car and </em><span class="style_black"><em>these</em></span><em> 
				/ <span class="style_black">those</span> were hard work</em><br />
				is very questionable if not wrong.</dd>
				<dt><strong>determiners</strong></dt>
				<dd>The pronouns <em>that</em> and <em>those</em> only have a determiner function 
				in, for example:<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those</span> who don't come to the 
				meeting will be able to vote by post<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That</span> which I really dislike is 
				... </em>(This is a formal and rather rare use.&nbsp; Normally,
				<span class="style_black"><em>what</em></span> is preferred to
				<em>that which</em>.)</dd>
				<dt><strong>pointing (deictic function)</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is the most familiar use.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This</span> is my boss, Mary<span class="style_black"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These</span> are the people I 
				wanted you to meet<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those</span> are my roommates<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That</span> is her husband<br />
				</em>These words can only be used for 
				impersonal objects of verbs unless they are followed by a noun 
				such as <em>person</em> and are functioning as determiners:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will use <span class="style_black">that</span> key to open 
				the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will use <span class="style_black">that</span> to open the 
				door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will elect <span class="style_black">that</span> person as 
				our representative<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*We will elect <span class="style_black">that</span> as our 
				representative<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				We want <span class="style_black">these</span> people thrown out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We want <span class="style_black">these</span> thrown out</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>pronoun reference</strong></dt>
				<dd>It is often difficult to distinguish this from the 
				determiner use:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want <span class="style_black">that</span> </em>(pronoun)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want <span class="style_black">that</span> book </em>
				(determiner)<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She selected <span class="style_black">those</span></em> 
				(pronoun)<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I think <span class="style_black">this</span> coat would suit me
				</em>(determiner)<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I think <span class="style_black">this</span> would suit me</em> 
				(pronoun)<em><br />
				</em>With the pronouns, it is optional to use <em>one(s)</em>, 
				as in <em>I want <span class="style_black">those</span> ones</em>.&nbsp; If <em>one(s)</em> is 
				included, the words act more as determiners of another pronoun.<br />
				As pronouns, the uses are slightly more restricted than they are 
				when the words are determiners.&nbsp; All four can be used as 
				pronouns to refer to both people and things in positive and 
				negative sentences so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Those</span> 
				are my books<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">These</span> are the men you asked 
				to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">That</span> isn't the manager who 
				was here before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">This</span> is the child I told you 
				about</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				but in questions, while we accept:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is <span class="style_black">that</span>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is <span class="style_black">this</span>?</em><br />
				we do not usually accept:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Who are <span class="style_black">those</span>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Who are <span class="style_black">these</span>?</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>other demonstrative pronouns</strong></dt>
				<dd>While it is traditional to limit demonstrative pronouns to
				<em>this, that, these</em> and <em>those</em>, two other 
				pronouns act in a very similar way but come in pairs:<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li><span class="style_black"><em>the former </em></span>and
					<span class="style_black"><em>the latter</em></span>, for 
					example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both John and Mary went to live 
					abroad; <span class="style_black">the former</span> in 
					America, <span class="style_black">the latter</span> in 
					France</em></li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em>the one</em></span> and
					<span class="style_black"><em>the other</em></span><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a clear potential benefit 
					and a drawback.&nbsp; We must try to take advantage of
					<span class="style_black">the one</span> while minimising 
					the danger of <span class="style_black">the other</span></em></li>
				</ul>
				Both <span class="style_black"><em>the former </em></span>and
					<span class="style_black"><em>the latter</em></span> can 
				substitute for noun phrases (as the examples above), verb 
				phrases and prepositional phrases.<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have cut the grass and washed 
					the car.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">The former </span>
					took longer but <span class="style_black">the latter</span> 
					needed doing more badly</em></li>
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried hanging it in the the 
					hall and in the living room.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
					The former </span>looked OK but <span class="style_black">
					the latter</span> was much better</em></li>
				</ul>
				Both <span class="style_black"><em>the former </em></span>and
				<span class="style_black"><em>the latte</em></span>r can also 
				appear without the other.&nbsp; So we can have, e.g.:<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have cut the grass and washed 
					the car.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">The former </span>
					took longer</em></li>
					<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried hanging it in the the 
					hall and in the living room.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
					The latter</span> was much better</em></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="style_black"><em>The one</em></span> and
					<span class="style_black"><em>the other</em></span> are more 
				rarely used for anything except noun-phrase substitution but 
				with the insertion of the <em>do</em> operator, we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must study harder or give up 
				university altogether.&nbsp; Do <span class="style_black">one</span> 
				or do <span class="style_black">the other</span>.</em><br />
				and the definite article is dropped in this case on the first 
				item but not the second, perversely.<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>The one</em></span> and
					<span class="style_black"><em>the other</em></span> do not 
				act as substitutions for prepositional phrases and cannot appear 
				separately.<br />
				These are functionally demonstrative pronouns and can be taught 
				that way.</dd>

			<p>You will not be alone if you have not heard these terms (they

			This group consists of:<br />

			<dl>
				<dt><strong>count</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>many, more, most</em> and <em>few, fewer, fewest</em>

				<dt><strong>mass</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>more much most</em> and <em>little, less, least</em> are

			</dl>
			<p>Notes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The distinction between <em>a little </em>and <em>little

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have <span class="style_black">little</span> interest and

				She has <span class="style_black">a few </span>friends and takes <span class="style_black">a 
				little </span>interest in their welfare</em></li>
				<li>Only real pedants will insist on not using<em> less</em> for 
				count nouns as in, e.g.<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have travelled 
				<span class="style_black">less</span> miles than 
				me<br />
				</em>and, in fact, the use of <em>less</em> is routine for

				than two years<span class="style_black"><br />

				than 10 feet<span class="style_black"><br />
				</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">less</span> than €5<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				However, the uses of <em>few</em> and <em>fewest</em> for count 
				nouns only are still common, particularly in written and more 
				formal language.</li>

			<p>This is a small group consisting of just two multi-word pronouns:</p>

			<p>The usual distinction here is to assert that the <em>some-</em> 
			series is used in positive statements (that is to say, assertive 
			uses) and the <em>any-</em> 
			series in negatives and interrogatives (or non-assertive uses), so we get, e.g.:<br />
			<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somebody</span> told him<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Has <span class="style_black">anybody</span> arrived yet?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I don't want <span class="style_black">anything</span> to eat</em></p>
			<p>There are, however, a few issues:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We need to distinguish by function not grammar.&nbsp; An 
				offer is not a question so there is a difference between:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want <span class="style_black">anything</span> to eat?&nbsp; </em>(<em>Are you hungry?</em>)<br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like <span class="style_black">something</span> to eat?</em>&nbsp; (<em>I'm 
				offering some food.</em>)</li>
				<li>Similarly, the speaker's understanding is important.&nbsp; 
				There is a difference between:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has <span class="style_black">somebody</span> sent you a letter?<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has <span class="style_black">anybody</span> sent you a letter?<br />
				</em>In the first, the speaker may either have a person in mind 
				or may be sure that a letter has arrived.&nbsp; The second 
				implies neither of those.</li>
				<li>Negatives are not only achieved with the use of <em>not</em>:<br />
				Negative adverbials:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He never goes <span class="style_black">anywhere</span> </em>(<em>no, neither, nor</em> work 
				the same way)<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He hardly does <span class="style_black">any</span> work </em>(<em>hardly, nearly, almost, little 
				few </em>etc. work the same way)<em><br />
				</em> Negative verbs:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They failed to prevent 
				<span class="style_black">any</span> of the consequences<br />
				</em>(other 
				negative verbs such as <em>forget, stop, abort, destroy</em> 
				etc. work the same way)<em><br />
				</em>Negative adjectives:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's reluctant to do 
				<span class="style_black">any</span> more<br />
				</em>(other negative adjectives 
				such as <em>hard, difficult, impossible</em> etc. work the same 
				way)</li>
				<li>The pronoun <em>any</em> also means <em>no matter who, no 
				matter what</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She eats <span class="style_black">anything</span><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Ask <span class="style_black">anyone</span><br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone</span> can come</em></li>

			<h3>Concord issues<br />
			<img alt="concord" height="133" src="../../images/handshake200.gif" width="200" /></h3>
			<p><em><strong>none</strong></em> is grammatically singular:<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is waiting for her friends but 
				<span class="style_black">none</span> has arrived<br /></em>is 
				grammatically correct but, because of the proximity of the 
				plural noun, many prefer<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is waiting for her friends but <span class="style_black">none
			</span>have arrived</em><br />
			The insertion of the preposition <em>of</em> often requires, or at 
			least allows, the plural verb form so we can have either:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;She is waiting for her friends but

			or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She is waiting for her friends but
			<span class="style_black">none</span> of them have arrived</em></p>
			<p><em><strong>neither</strong> </em>is also grammatically singular so we have<em><span class="style_black"><br />
			</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Neither</span> of her friends has arrived<br />
			</em>but, again, because of the notion that we are referring to two 
			people we also hear:<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Neither</span> of her friends have arrived<br />
			</em>and most people are, 
				slightly inconsistently, happy with either formulation.<br />
			Using neither without <em>of</em> is quite a formal structure as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I offered the boys the apples but
			<span class="style_black">neither</span> wants one</em><br />
			and in this case, the pronoun is always singular so we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I offered the boys the apples but
			<span class="style_black">neither</span> want one</em></p>

			<p>This pronoun / determiner has a number of uses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>As a determiner, it is the stressed form of the indefinite 
				article.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man waited at the gate<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One</span> man waited at the gate</em></li>
				<li>It functions as a determiner and a pronoun:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two girls were in the classroom but I only spoke to the 
				<span lang="x-none"></span>older <span class="style_black">one</span></em> (pronoun)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two girls were in the classroom but I only spoke to the
				<span class="style_black"><span lang="x-none"></span>one</span> older girl </em>
				(determiner)</li>
				<li>It is used as a pronoun in both the singular and the plural:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He offered me all of them and I took the blue
				<span class="style_black">ones</span><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He offered me all of them and I took the blue
				<span class="style_black">one</span></em></li>
				<li>It is used as an indefinite personal pronoun standing for 
				people in general.&nbsp; This use is considered formal.<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One</span> can't be too careful 
				with inflammable liquids, can <span class="style_black">one</span>?<br />
				</em>In AmE, the <em>one</em> in the question tag will usually 
				be replaced by <em>you</em>.<br />
				There is a possessive form, <em>one's</em>, which takes the 
				apostrophe.<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One</span> must be careful with
				<span class="style_black">one's</span> belongings when 
				travelling by train</em><br />
				There is no apostrophe on the plural use in 3.</li>

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have <span class="style_black">enough</span> money for 
				the journey<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				We have money <span class="style_black">enough</span> for the 
				journey<br />
				</em>The latter is rarer and more formal.<br />
				Neither <em>a lot (of) </em>nor <em>several</em> can follow the noun when they 
				function as determiners.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>a lot (of)</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>When this phrase is a determiner, it includes the 
				preposition <em>of</em>.<br />
				As a pronoun proper, <em>of</em> is not allowed.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a lot of time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a lot of chairs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a lot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We have a lot of</em></dd>

			<p>The major issue is that these sorts of pronouns work very 
			differently in different languages.&nbsp; A few things in particular 
			will bemuse learners:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">the distinctions in English between 
				gender of the noun a pronoun stands in for only occur with 
				personal pronouns, and then not with all of them.&nbsp; Most 
				languages which mark gender will have all the pronouns similarly 
				marked.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">the distinction in English between 
				pronouns which may stand for (or determine) mass vs. count nouns 
				is difficult to grasp.&nbsp; Many languages will not make the 
				distinction.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">the complications in English of 
				statements, negatives and interrogatives do not exist in most 
				languages.&nbsp; In fact, many will use the same pronouns in all 
				sentence types and many allow double negatives so we get<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I 
				don't have nothing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Somebody didn't come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Anybody came</em> etc.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">that most pronouns in this guide can 
				also be used as determiners is not a phenomenon universally 
				shared across languages.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The consequences are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">handle with care and be sure to raise 
				your learners' awareness of the distinctive uses of pronouns.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">contextualise <strong>everything</strong>.&nbsp; 
				Pronouns cannot be handled in isolation.&nbsp; Learners have to 
				know what, exactly, the pronoun is replacing or referring to.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">make sure controlled practice is 
				focused.&nbsp; You can't simply mix and match pronouns.&nbsp; 
				Take them conceptual area by conceptual area, as above.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">be clear in your own mind:<ul>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Are you dealing with pronouns or 
					determiners?</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Is mass vs. count nouns an issue?</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Is singular vs. plural an issue?</li>
					<li class="auto-style5">Is personal vs. impersonal use 
					an issue?</li>
