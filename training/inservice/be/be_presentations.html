			<h1>Giving presentations in Business English</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="presenting" height="207" src="../../images/presentation310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide will not attempt to repeat the content of guides to 
			speaking skills in general (for which there are links at the end) 
			but will focus on the purposes for giving spoken presentations in a 
			business setting and the associated language that needs to be 
			mastered.<br />
			A further omission from this guide is the kind of speaking skills 
			that Business English learners will need when interacting with their peers, 
			colleagues, customers and contacts informally, 
			as those do not differ substantially from generalised speaking skills covered 
			elsewhere on <strong><span class="orange">ELT </span>Concourse.</strong></p>

			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="multi-function" height="166" src="../../images/multi-function_b250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>Purposes</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Essentially, there are four purposes for a presentation in a 
			business context:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To report: setting out what happened, what was done and what 
				was discovered</li>
				<li>To explain or train: to help others acquire skills and 
				information</li>
				<li>To propose: to suggest ways forward</li>
				<li>To sell: to set out advantages and persuade</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and, although there are obvious commonalities, they require 
			different language, different skills and different text structures.&nbsp; 
			This is because the way each is structured and the language one 
			needs to use to make a case are different in each instance.&nbsp; This 
			is true whether a presentation is made in writing or in spoken 
			English.&nbsp; Because presentations are not off-the-cuff informal 
			events, the audience will expect a certain type of staging of the 
			information and, if the presentation does not follow conventional 
			staging, may become disoriented and irritated.<br />
			In other words, we need to look at the genre and the generic 
			structure which is conventional in an English-speaking setting.</p>
			<p>We'll take them one at a time.&nbsp; In what follows, the focus 
			is on the following five language categories:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Participants<br />
				These can be human or non-human and the reference here is to the 
				kind of entity which forms the theme of the language in the 
				presentation.&nbsp; For example, if we begin with:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have noted the need for ...<br />
				</em>then the theme is what the presenter and team have noted 
				but if the beginning is:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process is as follows<br />
				</em>then the theme is the process, not the people.<br />
				It is important that people are aware of which participants in 
				the presentation they need to emphasise by placing them in the 
				theme position.</li>
				<li>Verbal processes<br />
				There are three of these which we can divide like this:<ol class="auto-style79">
					<li>doing verbs:<ol class="auto-style80">
						<li>material<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This machine can process ...</em></li>
						<li>behavioural<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your customers demand ...</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>thinking, feeling and saying verbs:<ol class="auto-style80">
						<li>mental<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that ...</em></li>
						<li>verbal<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People have reported that ...</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>being verbs:<ol class="auto-style80">
						<li>existential<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an issue with production 
						times</em></li>
						<li>relational<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process is inefficient and 
						time consuming</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Modality<br />
				The three areas which concern us here are<ol class="auto-style79">
					<li>epistemic modality which is to do with what is possible 
					or likely<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process may take some time</em></li>
					<li>deontic modality which is to do with what is obligatory 
					or recommended<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process should be made simpler</em></li>
					<li>dynamic modality to do with willingness and ability<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be able to supply the product 
					with days</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Circumstances and adverbials<br />
				This refers mostly to adjuncts such as adverbs and prepositional 
				phrases such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crucially<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noticeably<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in practice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the shop floor</em></li>
				<li>Connections<br />
				This refers to coordination, subordination and also to conjuncts 
				which perform similar connective functions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, ...</em></li>
			</ol>

					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>Information reports</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The structure of an information report is the simplest of all 
			which is why we are starting here and why it is also a good idea to 
			start the training of presentation giving with this form.&nbsp; An 
			information report needs, above all, to be properly organised.&nbsp; 
			Data which are presented out of order or in unconnected sections are 
			more difficult to access and assimilate and that frustrates both the 
			listener and the purpose of the exercise.<br />
			The 
			structure looks like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="structure" height="307" src="../../imagesgraphics/be_info_report.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>
			This is the structure that good presenters use at the planning 
			stage.&nbsp; If a lot of information has to be communicated the 
			presentation needs to have some backup in terms of handouts, 
			diagrams and texts for people to take away.&nbsp; Reference should 
			be made to this material as the presentation unfolds, not left till 
			the end.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Explanations have a similar structure to Information Reports but 
			the language that is required to give them is quite different, as we 
			shall see.&nbsp; The aim of a presentation which attempts to explain 
			something is to enhance the skills and knowledge of the audience.&nbsp; 
			This may be overt training or it may simply be part of an ongoing 
			consideration of how the organisation accomplishes certain tasks.<br />
			The overall structure looks like this (usually):</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="structure" height="288" src="../../imagesgraphics/be_explanation.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>Again, the ordering of explanation texts is critical.&nbsp; It is 
			much easier for people to follow if the stages come in a logical 
			order without back shifting with expressions such as <em>but before 
			that, after we have</em> etc.</p>

			<p>Proposals closely resemble discussion texts insofar as they seek

			</table>
			<p>The final section of all four presentation types exemplified 
			above concerns the need to have space at the end for questions and 
			clarification.<br />
			Because this is common to all types of presentation, it makes sense 
			to handle how to conduct this part of the presentation in a separate 
			teaching section.<br />
			How you conduct the process depends to a large extent on who is 
			asking the question.&nbsp; Superiors have the right simply to ask 
			and to override any constraints that the speaker may try to put in 
			place.&nbsp; Colleagues and subordinates may need to be invited to 
			ask and are more amenable to constraint.</p>
			<p>The role of the presenter in this part of the process is as the 
			chair of a meeting.&nbsp; The presenter needs to be able to:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>apply topic constraints</strong></dt>
				<dd>In a presentation, a speaker may not have the luxury of 
				selecting questioners because some participants may be in more 
				powerful positions or simply happy to ask uninvited.<br />
				In this case the speaker needs to rely on topic constraint alone but 
				the constraint can often be signalled explicitly, by the parts 
				underlined in the following examples:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone have a question
				<span class="style_underline">about these figures</span>?</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Bearing </em><span class="style_underline"><em>this</em></span><em> 
				in mind, does anyone have a question?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone need to ask anything about </em>
				<span class="style_underline"><em>the results so far</em></span><em> 
				before we go on?</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>nominate</strong></dt>
				<dd>It is often the case that colleagues are in the audience and 
				they may need to be involved in this stage of the presentation.&nbsp; 
				The speaker is in a strong position to constrain who contributes 
				and who asks questions.&nbsp; It is quite simple to do this:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John, do you have anything to add?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can Mary explain that, please?<br />
				</em>and so on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>decide on open endedness</strong></dt>
				<dd>A presenter need not try to constrain by topic at all but 
				runs the risk of people going off topic and following tangents.<br />
				For example, all the following are open invitations to 
				tangential questions:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Is there anything at all anyone wants to ask?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any questions about anything?</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>re-focus</strong></dt>
				<dd>If open-ended invitation has, in fact, resulted in off-topic 
				contributions and questions, the presenter needs a strategy or 
				two to drag people back on task.&nbsp; This can usually be 
				achieved easily if the contributor is a colleague or subordinate 
				but may be unwise if the off-topic contribution comes from a 
				superior.&nbsp; Ways of doing it include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's an interesting point but not one 
				that I can deal with here and now.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good question.&nbsp; Perhaps we should talk about that later.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I leave that until after the meeting?</em></dd>

			</table>
			<p>An important skill for a presenter is to recognise the kind of 
			question that is being asked.&nbsp; People have a range of ways of 
			asking and answers will only be appropriate if the speaker has 
			recognised what the focus is.&nbsp; There are three main sorts</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Checking one's own comprehension.<br />
				Questions such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I right in thinking ...?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would I be wrong if I assumed ...?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I assume that ...</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				are all ways to check that one has understood accurately.<br />
				The response needs either to be affirmative (and can be short) 
				or refocusing when the questioner is mistaken.&nbsp; Usually, 
				something like:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that's exactly the point</em><br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Not quite.&nbsp; The point I was making is</em> (+ 
				repetition)</li>
				<li>Requesting repetition or reformulation.<br />
				Questions such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you go over that point again?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you explain again what ...?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you say that again?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that the same as saying ...?</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					ask for repetition and are requests, not questions so they 
				need to be responded to differently.<br />
				This means that presenters need to be able to rephrase what 
				they have said in simpler (or simply different) ways.</li>
				<li>Challenging.<br />
				Questions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that always the case?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we to believe that ...?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How reliable are the data?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What evidence do we have that ...?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				are all ways of challenging the speaker to justify comments 
				made.<br />
				This will mean that a speaker must be prepared to justify 
				statements and that, of course, is something to focus on at the 
				planning stage.<br />
				Many find that imagining a critic on your shoulder asking this 
				sort of question while the presentation is in the planning stage 
				helpful.</li>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are a number of pressures on anyone speaking in public.&nbsp; 
			In the classroom, we can reduce them somewhat.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Preparation level<br />
				Off-the-cuff presentations are not for most people.&nbsp; 
				Learners operating in a foreign language are even less able to 
				present <em>impromptu</em> and it isn't fair to ask them to do 
				so.<br />
				It is important, therefore to build in preparation time to any 
				teaching programme aimed at presentation techniques.<br />
				Being well prepared and knowing that you are, reduces the 
				pressure considerably.</li>
				<li>Topic familiarity<br />
				Trying simultaneously to research a new topic and prepare a 
				presentation on it is an unnecessary pressure in the classroom 
				so care should be taken, especially at the beginning, to allow 
				the learner to decide on the topic and type of presentation they 
				want to plan.&nbsp; That way, they can 
				focus on the presentation not the data because the latter are 
				well known to them.</li>
				<li>Audience size<br />
				Pressure increases in direct ratio to audience size so one way 
				to reduce the pressure is to get people to practise their 
				presentations in small groups of three or four before they have 
				to take the step up to presenting to the whole group.&nbsp; 
				Repeating a presentation may seem somewhat dull to us but it is 
				not seen that way by learners who appreciate the opportunity to 
				repeat a presentation more than once.</li>
				<li>Using visual aids<br />
				Visual aids can be extremely helpful or just an irritation 
				depending on how well they are designed.&nbsp; There are two 
				issues:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>They act as an irritation when they are used <strong>
					instead of</strong> explanation and description; they are 
					helpful when they are used <strong>to supplement</strong> 
					explanation and description to present data which cannot (or 
					should not) simply be read out.&nbsp; We have probably all 
					attended a presentation in which the speaker projects a 
					slogan and then reads it to us.&nbsp; That's a waste of 
					everyone's time.</li>
					<li>They have a further useful function when used well and 
					that is to replace the speaker's notes.&nbsp; If, for 
					example, slides are projected which refer to key data and 
					ideas, they will serve to remind the speaker of what should 
					be emphasised.&nbsp; If they are used indiscriminately, they 
					simply overwhelm the audience with detail and people lose 
					the thread.&nbsp; A rough rule of thumb is not to use more 
					than one slide per five minutes of the presentation.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Language unfamiliarity<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>The first area of language which needs to be tackled 
					before most people can even begin a presentation is that of 
					verbalising graphical data.<br />
					Practising the skill of looking at, say, a graph such as:<br />
					<img alt="bar" height="194" src="../../imagesgraphics/bar_chart.png" width="310" /><br />
					and being able to say something like<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>As can be seen, Series 3 
					remained around 2.0 for the first two Categories but 
					increased by 50% in the third Category and had more than 
					doubled by Category 4.</em></span><br />
					is valuable practice for anyone aiming to be able to present 
					data verbally.&nbsp; We need to do more than show the data, 
					we need to be able to explain them.</li>
					<li>Secondly, learners need to master a range of 
					prefabricated language to increase their fluency.&nbsp; 
					Examples are:<ol class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>To gather one's thoughts when questioned:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style6">Well, let me see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for the question.&nbsp; It's an important one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm, that's an 
				interesting question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, now, what I can say is ...</span></em></li>
						<li>To present a personal opinion (a coda, usually):<br /><em><span class="auto-style6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as far as I'm concerned<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				to my mind<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				in my view<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				as far as I can see<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				it seems to me that</span></em></li>
						<li>To orientate the audience:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">&nbsp;Now we 
						can move on to the second issue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarise ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essential point is ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way of saying this is ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example of what I mean is ...</span></em></li>
						<li>To invite questions:<br /><em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy 
						to try to answer any questions you may have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone have a question they'd like to ask?</span></em></li>
						<li>To deal with interruption:<br /><em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll come

					<h3>Visualising a presentation</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>A useful technique for (not only) Business English learners asked to give a presentation 
			is to get them to visualise it before they deliver it.&nbsp; It has 
			advantages:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It makes them less reliant on their notes, helping them to 
				be more mobile and maintain eye contact with the audience</li>
				<li>It increases their confidence because they will feel better 
				prepared</li>
				<li>It lets them see where they may need more content (or fewer 
				PowerPoint slides)</li>
				<li>It allows them to predict what people may ask and prepare 
				some kind of answer</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It works like this:</p>
			<h4>Step 1: learn the presentation</h4>
			<p>Learners should sit with their plan for the presentation and make 
			sure they can, without looking at it, recite the essential stages of 
			the talk.&nbsp; Depending on the genre (see above), this will 
			require three or four stages to be recited.</p>
			<h4>Step 2: run through the stages</h4>
			<p>This is where the use of visual aids such as projected slides is 
			most helpful.&nbsp; As was noted above, slides and other graphics 
			can replace the speaker's notes altogether if they are confined to 
			the key ideas in the talk.</p>
			<p>Once the staging is clear and memorised, learners need to focus 
			on</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>what they will say at the beginning of the presentation</li>
				<li>what they will say when displaying any data graphically (see 
				above under language familiarity)</li>
				<li>what they will say at the beginning of each stage</li>
				<li>how they will signal transitions between stages</li>
				<li>how they will signal the end and invite questions and 
				comments</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Step 3: reduce the notes</h4>
			<p>Learners can now re-visit their notes and reduce them to key words 
			on cards.&nbsp; If this procedure has been followed to the end, they 
			may not need the cards, but most people like some reassurance.</p>
			<h4>Step 4: visualise the whole presentation</h4>
			<p>The learners should now find somewhere comfortable to sit or lie and, with 
			their eyes 
			closed, visualise the whole presentation from start to finish.&nbsp; In 
			particular focusing on getting the order and staging right and going 
			over in their minds the short language chunks they need to memorise 
			to help them speak fluently</p>
			<h4>Step 5: questions</h4>
			<p>The final stage, before repeating Step 4 as often as necessary, 
			is to try to imagine what questions people are likely to ask and how 
			they will field them.</p>

			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>Setting up the room appropriately so the presenter is

				<li>Making sure everyone shows respect by turning up on time and 
				being quiet and attentive.&nbsp; It'll be their turn soon.</li>
				<li>Allowing for overrunning.&nbsp; Novice presenters, in any 
				language, are often poor at knowing how long something will 
				take.&nbsp; It's disturbing and can even be distressing to be 
				hurried along or cut short.</li>
				<li>Having a question or two in mind yourself to get the ball 
				rolling at the end of the presentation.</li>
				<li>Making sure the topic of the presentation is known to 
				everyone in the group.&nbsp; This simulates what will happen 
				when they attend lectures or lessons for real.</li>
				<li>During and before any student-led presentation, we should 
				not forego the opportunity for the other learners to practise 
				their note-making skills and their questioning strategies.</li>
