			<h1>Business English and the passive voice</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="passive" height="207" src="../../images/animals_bear_passive310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide will not cover the considerable structural and 
			semantic complications of the passive voice in English.&nbsp; For 
			that, you are referred to the general guide to the passive voice in 
			the in-service training section, linked below.<br />
			Here, we are concerned with how the passive is used in Business 
			English contexts.</p>

					<h2>Five reasons</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We do, however, need to remind ourselves of the five main reasons 
			for using the passive voice in English and then to see which ones 
			fit most easily with the use of English in a business context.<br />
			We also need to look briefly at the concepts that underlie these 
			five uses.<br />
			The five are:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Because we are less interested in the agent and more concerned 
			with the patient.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The invoice was issued<br />
			</em>We are not concerned with the agent (probably, we know it's 
			someone in the finance department).&nbsp; We are concerned 
			with what happened to the invoice (the patient, not the agent).</li>
			<li>Because it's obvious what the subject is so unnecessary to state 
			it.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CEO must be consulted<br />
			</em>we are aware that it is people in the company who do the 
			consulting.</li>
			<li>Because we don't know what the subject is.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Security has been breached<br />
			</em>we don't know who breached security.</li>
			<li>Because, stylistically or for social reasons, we are concerned 
			not to identify the agent.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A mistake has been identified<br />
			</em>we do not want to lay blame at anyone's door (certainly not our 
			own) so we omit the agent altogether.</li>
			<li>Because we want to emphasise the agent.&nbsp; This is often a 
			spoken form because we need to stress the agent when we speak.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The invoice was issued by the Finance Department</em><br />
			emphasises the fact that it is the Finance Department to whom you 
			should refer if there is a problem.</li>
		</ol>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<img alt="marekedness" height="166" src="../../images/hand_tick250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Markedness</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Underlying all the reasons above is the concept of markedness.&nbsp; 
			The passive is, in English and most other languages, marked in some 
			way to lend weight to an item.&nbsp; For example, we can choose to 
			say:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>The boss has arranged a meeting for this afternoon<br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or we can say:</li>
				<li><em>A meeting has been arranged for this afternoon<br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but we are less likely to say:</li>
				<li><em>A meeting has been arranged for this afternoon by the 
				boss</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In sentence 1, <em>The boss </em>is the marked item because the 
			phrase occupies the theme position in the sentence and implies that 
			the boss is the main player.&nbsp; The point of departure for what 
			follows is the boss' role and actions.<br />
			In sentence 2, it is <em>The meeting</em> which occupies the topical theme 
			slot and that is the point of departure for what follows (the 
			rheme).<br />
			Sentence 3, perversely, also emphasises the role of the boss, 
			because English tends to place important items towards the end of 
			clauses and the use of the agent in the passive structure emphasises 
			who called the meeting, not the meeting itself.</p>

					<img alt="task" height="65" src="../../../gfx/task_think100.jpg" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><strong><a name="1"></a>Task:</strong><br />
					To make this even clearer to learners (and you), decide 
					which of the following three clauses is like to come next 
					in the three cases above:<ol class="auto-style4">
						<li><em>and it'll be at 3 in the conference room</em></li>

			<p id="1" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">You should have:<br />
			Sentence 1. &rarr;&nbsp;c.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss has arranged a meeting for this afternoon so our meeting will have to wait.</span><br />
				</em>Because <em>The boss</em> is in the 
			theme position of the active-voice sentence and <em>this afternoon
			</em>forms part of the rheme, it is natural to continue to use that 
			rheme to explain why our meeting will be delayed and to make it 
			clear why this afternoon is important.<br />
			Sentence 2. →&nbsp;a.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp; A meeting has been arranged for this afternoon and it'll be at 3 in the conference room.</span><br />
				</em>Because <em>A meeting</em> is in the theme, 
			marked position, and, again, <em>this afternoon</em> is part of the rheme, 
			it is logical to add the information about the time and place.<br />
			Sentence 3. →&nbsp;b.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>A meeting has been arranged for this afternoon by the 
				boss</em> <em>and he expects everyone to be there</em></span>.<br />
			Because we have included the agent in the <em>
			by</em>-phrase at the end of the rheme, marking it for emphasis, the theme of the 
			following clause, <em>he</em>, continues on from there, forming the 
			next theme.</p>

					<h2>Selecting passive constructions in Business English</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is not the place to explain or suggest how best to 
			approach teaching the structural nuts and bolts of forming passive 
			clauses.&nbsp; On a Business English course, most participants will 
			know how to do that.&nbsp; What they need help with is identifying 
			when and why the passive should be used.<br />
			Most business-oriented communication is quite formal and it is in 
			formal writing and speaking that passive constructions are most 
			common.<br />
			Here are three of the reasons why we select the forms and the sorts 
			of forms we will select:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Impersonal tone<br />
				<img alt="impersonal" height="133" src="../../images/face_blank200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>Compare:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The delivery schedule will be with you by 
				Thursday of next week<br />
				</em>with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll get the delivery schedule to you by 
				Thursday of next week<br />
				</em>In the first sentence, the writer / speaker has selected 
				the passive in order to make it clear that she takes no personal 
				responsibility for the promise about Thursday.&nbsp; Keeping 
				things impersonal.<br />
				In the second sentence, the writer / speaker has committed 
				herself to the promise and the reader / hearer will know who to 
				contact to complain if the promise is not kept.&nbsp; Making it 
				personal.<br />
				Which form is selected is not a grammatical or even semantic 
				issue, it is a pragmatic one to do with the relationship between 
				the participants and the tone of the interaction.<br />
				Neither is, in other words, correct in any sense but learners 
				need to be aware of the effect of selecting one form over 
				another.<br />
				An intermediate statement can be formed along the lines of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll get the delivery schedule to you by 
				Thursday<br />
				</em>which commits not the individual but the organisation 
				itself to the promise.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Emphasising the agent<br />
				<img alt="highlight" height="133" src="../../images/highlight_text200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>Even in the written form, the <em>by-</em>phrase may serve 
				to emphasise responsibility, and, indeed, move it from the 
				speaker / writer to another.<br />
				Compare, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The department manager wrote the report<br />
				</em>with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report was written by the department 
				manager<br />
				</em>In the first case, the discourse may naturally be continued 
				with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... which was presented to the board<br />
				</em>but in the second case, a more likely continuation, which 
				emphasises responsibility would be<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... who was not aware of the potential problems.<br />
				</em>The choice of the type of relative pronoun clause depends 
				on the use of the passive voice.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Omitting the agent<br />
				<img alt="empty" height="133" src="../../images/frame_empty200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>The passive voice is frequently seen in business-orientated 
				texts because of shared information between speaker and hearer 
				or writer and reader so the use of the agent or the making of an 
				active-voice sentence is unconventional and may sound strange.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our factory in Strasburg made the 
				packaging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The receptionists will welcome the clients on arrival<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PA has made the appointments for tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has reserved a parking space for you<br />
				</em>all mark the subject, because it is in the theme position 
				and make it appear more important than the object whereas:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The packaging was made in Strasburg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clients will be welcomed on arrival<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The appointments have been made for tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parking space has been reserved for you<br />
				</em>are more both more likely and more natural because the 
				agent is either known, unknown or of no importance.</dd>
			</dl>

					<h2>The passive infinitive</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p> Because the direct use of modal auxiliary verbs, especially 
			those used deontically (to express degrees of obligation), is 
			unusual in formal language or Business English settings, passive 
			infinitives are commonly used.&nbsp; So for example, instead of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must agree the terms of the contract<br />
			</em>we will often prefer<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terms of the contract must be agreed<br />
			</em>because it is far less direct and discourteous.<br />
			Additionally, instead of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have let me know about the meeting<br />
			</em>we would normally prefer<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should have been told about the meeting<br />
			</em>which saves the face of the hearer by neatly omitting the 
			guilty party.<br />
			By the same token:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Finance Department ought to have issued 
			the invoices immediately<br />
			</em>is probably better put as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The invoices should have been issued 
			immediately<br />
			</em>because everyone knows who issues invoices and there is no need 
			to single out the guilty party.<br />
			Passive infinitives are, however, not easy to handle and learners 
			require a good deal of exposure and practice.<br />
			There are three main sorts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Present passive infinitives are formed by using the modal 
				auxiliary verb and the infinitive of <em>be</em> plus the past 
				participle of the main verb.&nbsp; Like this:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting can be held on Thursday<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The order should be processed soon<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work may not be completed in time<br />
				</em>etc.</li>
				<li>Perfect passive infinitives are formed with <em>have been</em> 
				plus the past participle and occur mostly with modal auxiliary 
				verbs as a commentary on the past as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That should not have been promised<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The package may have gone astray<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reports needn't have been so long<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work could have been completed much earlier<br />
				</em>An important conceptual point is that the form looks very 
				similar to the present perfect tense but does not necessarily 
				carry the sense of present relevance.&nbsp; The perfect passive 
				infinitive is, therefore, a past tense, not a present perfect 
				tense.</li>
				<li>Double passives<br />
				Passive infinitives often co-occur with other passive 
				constructions, forming double passives such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The order is expected to be filled by the end of the 
				week<br />
				</em>Some find such constructions clumsy at best, plain wrong at 
				worst.</li>
			</ol>
			<p> Although the passive infinitive is frequently used with modal 
			auxiliary verbs that is not solely the case because the form also 
			occurs with other verbs as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manager asked to be kept informed of progress<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The customer has requested to be told when the order is 
			dispatched<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The director expected it to have been done</em></p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td>
			 
					<img alt="dynamic" height="166" src="../../images/dynamic_water250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Dynamic and stative passives and participle adjectives</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p> In some languages, such as German, many other Germanic 
			languages, Spanish and Italian, there is a distinction between a 
			dynamic passive and a stative passive and that is signalled by the 
			choice of auxiliary verb.&nbsp; English can make this distinction by 
			the use of the verb <em>get</em> instead of the more usual <em>be</em> 
			to form the passive as in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The production schedule was disturbed<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The production schedule got disturbed<br />
			</em>However, in English, the use of <em>get</em> to form a passive 
			is considered informal at best (some disparage it altogether as 
			being slang, which it is not) and that is not a characteristic 
			generally parallelled in other languages.&nbsp; The use of <em>get</em> 
			to form a passive is, therefore, unusual in Business English and 
			somewhat jarring when it is used in formal contexts.<br />
			Because English can use the verb <em>be</em> to signal both a 
			dynamic and a stative passive, it is usually the preferred choice.&nbsp; 
			In English, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The email was issued by the Human Resources 
			manager<br />
			</em>can refer to both the action of issuing the email and the state 
			of the email concerning its source where other languages might 
			distinguish these aspects.<br />
			If the distinction does need to be made, the safe choice in English 
			is to rephrase the clause in the active voice, where this is 
			possible.<br />
			It is, unfortunately not always possible to use an active-voice 
			construction when the agent is unknown or obvious so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The staff was upset<br />
			could mean that the staff was in a state of being upset or that 
			something in particular upset them.&nbsp; Rephrasing in the active 
			voice is not possible unless the agent is known so we might have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes upset the staff<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manager upset the staff<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new working practices upset the staff<br />
			</em>and so on but all of these, as we have seen, put the agent in 
			the theme position and mark it for importance.</p>
			<p> The good news is that English does not distinguish the form of a 
			participle used as an adjective and the participle forming part of 
			an agentless passive construction so, for example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to ensure that the customer 
			is not inconvenienced<br />
			</em>the word <em>inconvenienced</em> can be seen as an adjective to 
			describe the customer or as part of a passive construction and for 
			communicative purposes, the distinction does not matter.&nbsp; And 
			in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The staff was upset<br />
			</em>the word <em>upset</em> is clearly adjectival in nature because 
			it can be modified conventionally as in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The staff was extremely upset<br />
			</em>and the active use is rare or disallowed:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The manager extremely upset the staff</em></p>
			<p> The less good news is that English syntax differs when a verb 
			form is used adjectivally.<br />
			The issue concerns the use of complementation by a <em>that-clause</em> or a <em>by</em>- phrase.&nbsp; The former is confined to 
			adjectival uses and the latter to verbal uses.<br />
			So, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The client was disappointed that the order didn't arrive on 
			time<br />
			</em>is an adjectival use of <em>disappointed</em> and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The client was disappointed by the order did not arrive on 
			time<br />
			</em>is not allowed because the <em>by</em>-phrase is a signal of 
			verbal use and needs a noun-phrase complement.&nbsp; We need to 
			rephrase that as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The client was disappointed by the late 
			arrival of the order</em></p>
			<p> Learners whose first languages distinguish the form of 
			adjectives from the forms of verbs in passive constructions are 
			prone to errors of this sort.</p>
