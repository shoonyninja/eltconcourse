			<p>Many theories which underlie classroom practice are based on an 
			intuitive but unproven assumption that replicating the ways in which 
			we acquired our first language will be inherently better than 
			teaching people <em>about</em> the language and hoping that this 
			will enable them to use it accurately to get things done.<br />Unfortunately, there is no profession-wide consensus concerning just 
			how we acquire our first language(s).&nbsp; The links, therefore, 
			between second-language teaching methodology and first-language 
			learning theories remain somewhat obscure.&nbsp; Simply put, any 
			second-language pedagogy based on a first-language acquisition 
			theory (or mix of theories) will reflect the preferred theory of 
			first-language learning.<br />For example, if you hold the belief that we learn our first language 
			by imitation of the language we hear around us, then you may be 
			inclined to develop a methodology containing a great deal of 
			modelling and repetition.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, you believe 
			that people learn their first language by hearing it and making, 
			confirming or adjusting hypotheses concerning how it is used and 
			structured, then you may be drawn to a second-language teaching 
			methodology which involves presenting people with lots of good data 
			about the language they are learning (i.e., rich examples of it in 
			use) and leading them to draw their own conclusions to develop an 
			internalised set of rules about structure and use.<br />There are, of course, a number of persuasive theories about how we 
			learn our first language and following the guides linked below will 
			help you understand them.&nbsp; From that, you can form a critical 
			understanding of those theories of second-language learning which 
			claim to replicate first-language acquisition.</p>

					<h3>
					<strong>We learn a second language in a way fundamentally 
					different from the way we learned our first language(s)</strong></h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>A different point of view is one that holds that second-language 
			learning is a fundamentally different process from first-language 
			acquisition.&nbsp; Those who take this view will not be constrained 
			to make second-language learning methodology replicate whatever they 
			believe first-language acquisition involves.<br />This means that the focus can be shifted to ideas about how mature 
			brains operate and how memory, the assimilation of new data and so 
			on function.&nbsp; From this point of view, too, come considerations 
			of motivation, understanding the sources of error and so on.&nbsp; 
			For example, if you believe that human brains actively seek patterns 
			in the data they perceive around them to make sense of it, then much 
			of the effort to construct an effective teaching approach will focus 
			on language patterns rather than a more generalised view of the 
			natural and almost effortless picking up of language that children 
			are capable of doing.&nbsp; If, to present another example, you believe 
			that many language items are stored as usable, prefabricated chunks 
			then you may be drawn to a methodology which focuses on phrases and 
			collocating words to encourage language learning.&nbsp; If you don't 
			believe that and are convinced that we store language items 
			discretely in areas associated with their senses and shapes, then 
			your approach to teaching will be different.</p>
			<p>The approaches outlined here are distinct but you will find a 
			good deal of overlap between them and some of the key concepts, 
			cognitivism <em>vs</em>. behaviourism, repetition and drilling <em>vs.</em> guided 
			discovery and communicative exercises and so on are common to both 
			schools of thought.<br />
			What will vary is the emphasis that is given to the concepts and how 
			strictly the methodology reflects the theory.</p>

			<p>By the age of around six, most children have acquired their first 
			language &ndash; its grammar and its lexicon – and by the age of 
			eleven or so, children's language (voice tones aside) is 
			indistinguishable from that of adults.<br />
			Thereafter, all that remains is to develop greater stylistic range 
			and appropriacy along with an increased and more complex 
			lexicon.<br />
			The stages of language acquisition have been extensively researched 
			and recorded in literally hundreds of studies around the world and 
			do not concern us here.&nbsp; What does concern us is <strong>how</strong> children 
			achieve this enormous feat of memorisation and control in so short a 
			time.<br />
			It concerns us because a number of influential theorists have based 
			ideas about the best way to learn a second language on what they 
			understand are the way or ways in which we have acquired our first 
			language.<br />
			In brief, here is an overview of the main theories of first-language 
			acquisition:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Innateness</strong> – language is in our genes<br />
				<img alt="gene" height="133" src="../../../../../images/gene_a200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>It has been pointed out that the great rapidity of language 
				acquisition in children cannot be achieved by conventional 
				learning.&nbsp; So, it is posited, just like crawling, grasping, 
				smiling and walking, language is not something that has to be 
				learned, in the same way as, for example, playing chess or 
				riding a bicycle.<br />
				Language is acquired by children because they are genetically 
				disposed to learn it.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Imitation</strong> &ndash; l say what I hear<br />
				<img alt="parrot" height="133" src="../../../../../images/birds_parrot_red200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Children learn to speak the language(s) of the community in 
				which they are raised.&nbsp; A child of Urdu-speaking parents 
				will, if raised in a Russian-speaking community, speak Russian, 
				not Urdu.&nbsp; That much is obvious to most people now, 
				although it wasn't always.<br />
				When you hear or see the word <em>parrot</em>, for example, 
				nothing in the form or the pronunciation of the word gives you 
				the slightest clue to its meaning.&nbsp; You have to hear the 
				word used in a meaningful context to be able to understand what 
				it refers to, imitate it and 
				use it correctly.<br />
				Imitation must, therefore, play a significant role or how else 
				can we explain these simple facts?</dd>
				<dt><strong>Reinforcement</strong> of behaviours &ndash; l say 
				what I am encouraged to say<br />
				<img alt="dog training" height="133" src="../../../../../images/animals_dog_training200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Behaviourist learning theories are somewhat out of vogue.&nbsp; 
				The theories rest on the assumption that correct language output 
				which is both meaningful and appropriate will be rewarded (by 
				attention, praise, chocolate biscuits or whatever) and the 
				behaviour will, therefore, be reinforced and more likely to 
				recur.<br />
				On the other hand, incorrectly formed, inappropriate or 
				meaningless language will not be reinforced and may, indeed, be 
				negatively received by lack of parental attention or praise or 
				even admonition and punishment.<br />
				Clearly, the theory has a lot in common with imitation theory 
				and is often considered part of it.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Active construction</strong> of grammar &ndash; I 
				say what I assume to be right<br />
				<img alt="construction" height="133" src="../../../../../images/woman_construction200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This theory depends on our accepting the simple premise that 
				we are all born with the ability to think about the world around 
				us.&nbsp; Language is part of that and we bring the same 
				cognitive powers to bear on it as we do with any other 
				phenomenon.<br />
				As we hear language around us and observe its use we make 
				hypotheses about what it means and how it works.&nbsp; As more 
				data come in, we refine the hypotheses and make new ones in a 
				continuous process of construction and experiment.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Connectionism</strong> &ndash; I say what I reckon 
				will be right<br />
				<img alt="connect" height="133" src="../../../../../images/selection_finger_network200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>An allied theory is that we think statistically about 
				language and make connections with language we already know to 
				be correct.&nbsp; We do not experiment at random to make our 
				personal construction of hypotheses about language, we work on 
				what is most likely to be correct given what we already know is 
				correct.<br />
				We won't always be right but we will beat the odds on being 
				wrong by simply guessing.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Social interaction</strong> &ndash; I learn to say what is 
				appropriate<br />
				<img alt="teaching" height="133" src="../../../../../images/teaching_outdoor200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This theory is supplemental to others and suggests that we 
				can only learn fully appropriate language effectively (however 
				we learn it) if it is set in a social context with which we can 
				relate and in which it carries real meaning</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>In a very small nutshell, these six theories are the most 
			commonly espoused to explain, either alone or in combination, how 
			humans acquire their first language(s).</p>

			<p>This part should be easy.<br />
			Most of the theories of second-language acquisition can be traced to 
			those of first-language acquisition because that is the natural 
			order of things.<br />
			As we noted at the outset, there are two camps (with a good deal of 
			overlap):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Those who believe that second-language acquisition closely 
				parallels (or should) the way first languages are learned.</li>
				<li>Those who believe that learning a second or subsequent 
				language is a qualitatively different undertaking from acquiring 
				one's first language(s).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the first camp, we find a number of theorists.&nbsp; In 
			particular, people such as Krashen who took the view that deliberate 
			learning of a language is unnecessary and that there is a 
			distinction between acquiring a language (a mostly unconscious 
			process) and learning a language (a conscious, organised and led 
			process).&nbsp; We will also find innovators in this camp including 
			James Asher, the developer of Total Physical Response learning and 
			others.</p>
			<p>In the second camp, we find those who assert that learning is a 
			complex cognitive process which requires a focus on the language to 
			be learned, elements of modelling, correction and drilling and a 
			focus on context and scaffolding of learning.</p>

			<p>In the Module One examination, you will be asked to analyse a

			other theories, to be able to do this successfully.&nbsp; They are 
			covered in more detail in the guide you will shortly be asked to 
			read but here's a summary:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Competence <em>vs</em>. Performance</strong><br />
				Competence is your general knowledge of the grammar of a 
				language.<br />
				Performance is your actual use of the language in speaking and 
				understanding it.<br />
				Materials will focus on one or the other either aimed at fluency 
				(performance practice) or language analysis (increasing 
				competence).</li>
				<li><strong>Use <em>vs</em>. Usage</strong><br />
				This refers to the difference between the formal structures of 
				the language and the language as it is used in real 
				communication for authentic purposes.<br />
				Materials which focus on elucidating the structures and forms of 
				language (controlled exercises in grammar, distinguishing 
				phonemes, focusing on isolated subskills and so on) are 
				concerned with usage.&nbsp; Those which focus on using the 
				language in real or simulated authentic contexts are focused on 
				use.<br />
				Usually a focus is applied to usage before use is considered, 
				because people need time to get to grips with form before 
				applying it in practice.<br />
				Task-based learning is an exception in that some forms of it 
				focus immediately on use and only later on usage and language 
				analysis / presentation.</li>
				<li><strong>Acquisition <em>vs</em>. Learning</strong><br />
				This distinction lies at the heart of some of the theories of 
				first-language acquisition we have already encountered.&nbsp; It 
				is attributed to Krashen (to whom there is a separate guide on 
				this site).<br />
				Acquisition is a process similar to the way in which some 
				believe children acquire their first language(s).&nbsp; It requires 
				meaningful and frequent interaction in the language in which the 
				speakers are not focused on form but on meaning.<br />
				Learning is, in contrast, a formal procedure which focuses on 
				the explanation of rules and correction of language form.<br />
				Materials which focus on exposure to authentic, contextualised 
				language are focused on aiding acquisition.&nbsp; Those that 
				require the learner to engage with the forms and structure of 
				language and text take a learning approach.</li>
				<li><strong>Deductive <em>vs</em>. Inductive processing</strong><br />
				Deductive processing involves the application of given rules to 
				the data.<br />
				Materials which provide rules and then ask the learners to apply 
				them to the data are focused on deductive cognitive processing.<br />
				Inductive processing works the other way around.<br />
				Materials which give lots of rich examples of the language in 
				use and then require the learners to work out what the rules of 
				use are, are focused on inductive cognitive processing.&nbsp; 
				Inductive approaches are often characterised as discovery 
				learning routines.</li>

			<p>We have chosen here to divide ideas about how languages are

			That is not, of course, the only way to do things.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Behaviourism <em>vs.</em> Cognitivism</strong><br />
				<img alt="thoughtfulness" src="../../../../../images/woman_thoughtful200.jpg" /></dt>
				<dd>This is the first great divide.<br />
				We saw in the consideration of first-language acquisition 
				theories that one (reinforcement) depended on the assumption 
				that learning a language is the application of a stimulus and a 
				reaction to the response.<br />
				So, for example, a repeat-after-me drill in which the learners 
				repeat what the teacher said, or a drill requiring learners to 
				manipulate the language in a way parallel to an example is based 
				on a process of habit formation which will be enhanced if the 
				learners receive praise or are rewarded by noticeably better 
				performance.<br />
				We saw, too, that some theorists consider language acquisition 
				to be a process in which the learner brings to bear real thought 
				and imagination, building and refining hypotheses (active 
				construction theory), making connections to known facts about 
				language (connectivism), assessing the outcomes of their own 
				language use (social interaction) and so on.<br />
				So, for example, a process which requires learners to look at 
				examples of the language in use (not usage) and notice its 
				salient features which they can then incorporate into their own 
				interior models is one that assumes that the learner brings 
				cognitive processes to bear and that is a good deal more than just 
				the formation of a habit.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Handling error</strong><br />
					<img alt="error" height="133" src="../../../../../images/error_nail200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>How error is treated often betrays how a teacher (or the 
				materials used) handle the possibility of error.<br />
				Free practice tasks (such as writing an email based on a model) 
				or exchanging thoughts about the topic of a teaching unit before 
				it has begun are error avoiding to some degree insofar as the 
				language which is produced is unpredictable as are the 
				communicative needs of the learners.&nbsp; Learners can avoid 
				errors in this kind of task by relying on the language they know 
				is correct and avoid taking risks.<br />
				Tasks which are very tightly controlled with only one possible 
				right answer are error-avoiding because the learners' choices 
				are strictly determined.&nbsp; Tasks which allow a range of 
				choices are, on the other hand, error provoking 
				because the learners' freedom is restricted to the use of 
				language which has been targeted.&nbsp; Asking, for example, 
				learners to choose between a limited number of possible responses 
				in a gap-fill test is error provoking because the learner is not 
				free to insert any language he or she happens to think of and is 
				sure is correct.&nbsp; The learner is constrained by the choices 
				provided and that can provoke errors if the choices are too 
				complex or contain unknown forms.<br />
				Many cognitive theories see error as an inevitable and useful 
				part of the learning process.&nbsp; Behaviourist approaches 
				abjure error because it interferes with good habit formation.<br />
				In particular, approaches in the audio-lingual tradition, 
				characterised by the use of strictly controlled drills and lots 
				of listen-and-repeat activities, try to avoid error at all 
				costs.&nbsp; Errors in this tradition are seen as failures of 
				the teaching-learning processes whereas other traditions see 
				errors as inevitable and seek to use them constructively.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Universal grammar <em>vs</em>. language uniqueness</strong><br />
				<img alt="universe" height="133" src="../../../../../images/universe200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>As we have seen, there are those, such as Chomsky and his 
				many followers, who assert that all languages contain universal 
				items such as noun phrases, verb phrases and so on.<br />
				Others are not at all so sure and point to the fact that some 
				languages do not contain the same elements as others and that 
				some languages contain word classes unknown in other languages.<br />
				Materials which focus on units such as noun phrases, adjective 
				phrases, universal intonation patterns and so on fall into the 
				universalist camp.&nbsp; They assume that learners will be able 
				instantly to recognise the function of phrases and clauses and 
				be able to acquire the skill of manipulating them in the target 
				language.<br />
				Other materials writers will not have this kind of focus and 
				their concern will be to present ways in which communicative 
				functions are realised in the target language without being 
				overly concerned with matters of word- and phrase-class.</dd>

					<h3>
					External factors</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are some significant issues here but one needs no more than 
			a modicum of teacherly intuition and common understanding to 
			recognise their influences on materials writers.<br />
			It is clear, for example, that those writers who take the trouble to 
			select engaging topics and graphics are concerned about task 
			motivation and those who include a good deal of personalisation and 
			involvement feel that such things are beneficial in terms of 
			memorisation and motivation.</p>
			<p>Three other, not so obvious, factors also have a bearing:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Social factors</strong><br />
					<img alt="social" height="133" src="../../../../../images/people_interaction200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Much of Communicative Language Teaching stresses the 
				importance of natural and appropriate language as the target of 
			instruction.<br />
			It follows that in order to be able to acquire pragmatic as well as 
			formal competence in a language, learners need to be exposed to 
			appropriately complex social situations in which the target language 
			is set.<br />
				Social interaction theory can be seen to be at work here, of 
				course, but the influence of connectivism and active 
				construction theories is also discernible.<br />
				Materials which take time and trouble to set language in a clear 
				social context, noting power relationships, familiarity between 
				speakers and so on, are drawing, knowingly or not, on some kind 
				of social interactionist theory.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Motivation</strong><br />
				<img alt="motive" height="133" src="../../../../../images/animals_donkey_carrot200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>You may legitimately assume that motivation is an internal 
				factor and, when it comes to considering global reasons for 
				learning, you'd be right.<br />
				However, there are two other sorts of motivation which are 
				external to the learner and subject to materials writers' and 
				teachers' actions: institutional and task motivation.&nbsp; The 
				latter, in particular, concerns materials writers because many 
				are careful to select texts, topics and tasks which engage and 
				involve learners.&nbsp; Some do not and most are variably 
				successful.<br />
				The learners' attitudes towards 
				the target-language culture and the status they perceive the 
				language to have are also important factors and materials which 
				project a positive vision of both are probably deliberately 
				chosen because the writers assume that positive attitudes 
				positively affect learning.<br />
			For more, see the guide to 
			motivation, linked below.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Input</strong><br />
				<img alt="input" height="133" src="../../../../../images/fill_sugar200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>One of Krashen's fundamental hypotheses concerns the level 
				of input that learners receive from which, he avers, they can 
				acquire the language.&nbsp; Too high and the data are useless 
				because too little comprehension occurs (and, therefore, too 
				little information to work with is available), too low and 
				nothing new is available to work with.<br />
				This theory (which to many seems intuitively correct) is closely 
				allied to the theory proposed by Vygotsky which posits the Zone 
				of Proximal Development (ZPD) in which the task the learner is 
				set is achievable with a small amount of help (scaffolding) from 
				what is known as a More Knowledgeable Other (MKO) but 
				is not so difficult as to cause anxiety or so easy that it 
				provokes boredom.&nbsp; The MKO, by the way, need not be the 
				teacher.&nbsp; It could be a fellow student, the materials or 
				even a video resource.</dd>

					<li>Chomsky distinguished between competence and

					Materials which focus on <strong><em>usage</em></strong> rather than
					<span class="style_brown">use

					Those which focus on <strong><em>use</em></strong> will be more likely to target 
					improvements in the learners’ <span class="style_brown"><em>

					<li>Materials which provide a rich source of authentic 
					language rather than breaking it down into discrete items 
					are designed on the basis that learners can
					<span class="style_brown"><em><strong>acquire</strong></em>
					</span>rather than learn language providing the input is at 
					the right level (in the <em><strong>Zone of </strong></em> <span class="style_brown">
					<em><strong>Proximal Development</strong></em></span>).</li>
					<li>If the materials present good examples of a target 
					structure in use rather than providing rules for its usage, 
					the materials writers’ concern is to use an
					<span class="style_brown"><em><strong>inductive</strong></em>
					</span>approach rather than a <span class="style_brown">
					<em><strong>deductive</strong></em> </span>one.</li>
					<li>Behaviourism is often contrasted with
					<span class="style_brown"><em><strong>cognitive</strong></em>
					</span>approaches to the theory of how people learn.<br />
					Materials which contain lots of listen-and-repeat exercises 
					and require learners to carry out mechanical drills based on 
					clear models assume a <span class="style_brown"><em><strong>
					behaviourist / audio-lingual</strong></em></span> approach 
					but those that ask learners to think about what the language 
					is doing and how it works come from a
					<span class="style_brown"><em><strong>cognitive</strong></em>
					</span>theoretical understanding.</li>
					<li>Interlanguage can be defined as<br />
					<span class="style_brown"><em><strong>the learner's current

					<li>Highly controlled exercises will not provoke

					but tasks with multiple choices will often do so.&nbsp; 
					Freer practice tasks will often be error
					<span class="style_brown"><strong><em>avoiding</em></strong></span>.</li>
					<li>If the author’s concern is to avoid error where 
					possible, the materials will contain more tightly
					<span class="style_brown"><strong><em>controlled</em></strong>
					</span>exercises and fewer multiple-choice
					<span class="style_brown"><strong><em>error-provoking</em></strong></span> 
					ones.&nbsp; This will 
					be evidence of the influence of <span class="style_brown">
					<em><strong>behaviourist / audio-lingual</strong></em></span> 
					approaches to methodology.</li>
					<li>Materials which focus heavily on quasi-authentic,

					influenced by social <span class="style_brown"><em><strong>
					interaction</strong></em> </span>theory and may also show 
					the influence of <span class="style_brown"><em><strong>
					connectionist</strong></em> </span>theory which avers that 
					learners can build on the known to learn the hitherto 
					unknown.</li>
					<li>Materials which build carefully on previous work and
