			<p>You do not have to take a course at a recognised centre to enter the Delta Module One examination.&nbsp; You can take the 
		examination at a Cambridge Open Centre.<br />
		To find an open centre near you,
		<a href="https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/find-a-centre/find-an-exam-centre/" target="_blank">
		click here</a> to go to the Cambridge site and enter the details.<br />
		(Note that you need to find an <strong>open</strong> centre rather than 
		a closed, <strong>internal</strong>-only centre.)<br />
			You can, naturally, take a taught course for Delta Module One and 
			there are providers of such things worldwide.&nbsp; The cost of a 
			taught course varies enormously but you should expect to pay between 
			£600 and £900 or so for a course.&nbsp; In addition, you will have 
			to pay the examination fee which is around £150.<br />
			This course is completely free (bar the examination fee which you 
			pay to the centre of your choice along, probably, with a local fee).</p>
			<p>The course for Module One covers all the syllabus areas.&nbsp; 
					Following it won't guarantee you a pass, of course, but if 
					you take your time, do things thoroughly and follow all the 
					sections you will be well prepared.<br />
					Parts of this course will send you off to follow guides 
					elsewhere on the site.&nbsp; Be prepared for that.</p>
			<p>This page serves as an introduction and contains:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>A description and link to a suggested study programme.</li>

			<p>This is not a drop-by-when-you-like course because it won't work 
			that way.<br />
			To follow it seriously, you need a study plan for yourself so that 
			you are managing your time intelligently.&nbsp; Your first task is, 
			therefore, to write a study plan and to do that, you need to 
			consider:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>There are six areas of the syllabus and each has both an 
				overview guide and links to some of the other guides on this 
				site that you should follow.&nbsp; You need to make sure your 
				study plan allows for time to do these.&nbsp; Some are longer 
				than others.</li>
				<li>You need to plan in time for revision and reviews.</li>
				<li>You need to plan in some catch-up time so you know you can 
				go back and review sections you found more challenging.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you would like a suggested study plan, there is one on this 
			site.<br />
			The plan is designed for someone devoting around 12 hours per week 
			to the course over around 8 weeks but can, naturally, be amended to suit your management 
			of your time.<br />
			<a class="deltahighlightlink" href="ELT_Concourse_Study_Plan_Delta_Module_One.pdf" target="_blank">You can download the plan as a PDF document

			<p>This is a reading task to familiarise yourself with

			The examination comprises two papers, each of 90 minutes with a 
			half-hour breather between them.&nbsp; The examination is held twice 
			a year, in early June and December, usually on the first Wednesday 
			of those months.</p>
		<p>The examination targets different areas:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Paper 1 tests your knowledge of<ul class="smallbluebullet">
					<li>ELT terminology</li>
					<li>writing and

				phonology and discourse).</li>

				<li>Paper 2 tests your knowledge of<ul class="smallbluebullet">

					<li>the aims, 
				purposes and principles behind published teaching materials</li>
					<li>the principles and beliefs underlying ELT methodology.</li>

			</table>
			<p>People work at different speeds and some sections are larger than 
		others.&nbsp; It is also true that people come to the course with 
			different experiences and knowledge.&nbsp; It is difficult to 
			predict, therefore, just how long you will need.<br />
			Overall, assuming no knowledge beyond that provided on an initial 
			training course such as CELTA or the Trinity CertTESOL, the course should take around 100 hours to complete.&nbsp; 
			That's a slightly generous allowance and many people may be able to do it 
			in less time.<br />
			Much depends on how thorough you want to be in chasing down the 
			links to guides on the site which appear in each section.<br />
			Sections 3 and 4 in particular, require you to do so.<br />

			<p>The examination is usually held in the morning of the first Wednesday in 
			June and December each year.<br />
			Plan your time so that you take the examination about a week or so after you have finished 
			the course, which allows you some recovery, revision and reflection 
			time.&nbsp; (This means, for example, if you intend to take the 
			examination in June, you can devote 8 hours a week to this 
			course starting in mid-February.&nbsp; That's a generous allowance 
			so you could take a week off in the middle.)<br />
			Decide how much time you can realistically devote to this each week 
			and then work backwards from your preferred examination date, 
			bearing the 100 hours of study time in mind.</p>

			<p>This course is free so you can't expect dedicated tutor support.&nbsp;

			<p><strong>This will not be easy</strong> and will require you to take notes, read, 
		respond to tasks and do quite a lot of tests and revision exercises.&nbsp; 
			There is no reading list because you are not expected to refer to 
			sources in the examination.&nbsp; There is, however, 
			<a href="../../delta_documents/ELT_Concourse_Delta_Module_One_Two_Reference_Lists.pdf" target="_blank">a reference 
			list for Modules One and Two</a> of the Delta which will open in a new tab for you to download and print 
			if you need to.&nbsp; You should have access to (and read!) at least 
			one resource for each area.</p>
			<p>The other resource that this course draws on heavily is the site 
			itself and from time to time you will be required or advised to 
			follow some of the guides in the in-service training area.&nbsp; You 
			do not need to do that immediately so you can simply note which 
			guide you should find later when time permits.<br />
			To have any chance of passing, you need to do the obligatory guides 
			but if you have aspirations for more than a pass or have time to 
			spare, doing the recommended guides will pay dividends.<br />
			The tests which accompany each area of the course (and which are 
			linked at the end of each guide) target more than has been covered 
			in the guide itself because they assume that you have followed 
			at least some of the recommended extra guides.<br />
			If you find them confusing or impossible, you can always go to the 
			guides to those areas to learn what you don't know.</p>
			<p>At the end of each section, you will encounter this graphic:<br />
			<img alt="pen" height="87" src="images/exampractice.jpg" width="87" /><br />
			and it will take you to some examination practice for the area you 
			have just studied.<br />
			(The image of a pen is deliberately chosen to encourage you to do 
			the examination practice by hand because you need to get accustomed 
			to that.&nbsp; In the examination itself, you will have to write 
			quickly, legibly and continuously for 3 hours and that is not 
			something that many people have done for a long time.)</p>
			<p>There is a complete
			<a href="../delta_M1_revision_course/delta_module_1_revision_index.html" target="_blank" class="deltahighlightlink">Delta Module One revision course</a> on this site but you should do

			If you are studying independently for Module One, you need to find a 
			Cambridge Open Centre where you can take the examination.<br />
		To find an open centre near you,
		<a href="https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/find-a-centre/find-an-exam-centre/" target="_blank">
		click here</a> to go to the Cambridge site and enter the details.<br />
		(Note that you need to find an <strong>open</strong> centre rather than 
		a closed, <strong>internal</strong>-only centre.)<strong><br />
			Most centres have a deadline for entry at least 4 weeks prior to the 
			examination and some may require even more notice so make sure you 
			apply in good time.</strong></p>

			Enjoy the course and good luck in the examination.<br />
			If you would like to send feedback including ideas for developing 
			the course, please use <a href="../../../../../contact.html">
