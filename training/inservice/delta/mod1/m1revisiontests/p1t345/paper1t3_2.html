			<p>
				<img alt="1.3" height="100" src="../../../delta_images/1.3.png" width="100" /></p>
			<p>You will be given a section of published ELT materials and 
			directed to some of the language features learners would need to be 
			able to command successfully to complete the task.<br />
				Your task is to provide three more things they need to know
				<strong>with examples of what you mean</strong>.<br class="auto-style20" />
				This question carries 12% of the possible marks so spend no more 
			than 10 minutes on it.</p>
			<p><strong>What follows is much longer than the type of item you 
			will get in the examination proper.&nbsp; Take as long as you like 
			and consider each one of the five activities based on the texts and 
			pictures separately.</strong></p>
			<p>This task for the learners at B1 level and is a listening and 
			matching task, followed by a speculation and speaking task.&nbsp; It 
			comes in five parts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The learners are given four pictures of museums and required 
				to listen to people describing their visit to each of them.&nbsp; 
				They have to match the picture to what they hear.</li>
				<li>They then compare their answers in pairs, saying what they 
				heard that helped them find the answers, to make sure they agree 
				and listen again to check.</li>
				<li>They have to discuss with their partners whether the 
				speakers, Mary and Fred enjoyed their visits or not and why.</li>
				<li>They have to say where they think the buildings are and 
				explain why they think so to their partner.</li>
				<li>They have to agree with their partners on a list of 5 things 
				that they would expect to find inside a history museum.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The four pictures and the tapescripts are as follows (the 
			learners get only the numbered pictures):</p>
			<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style29" style="width: 350px">
					<img alt="louvre" height="166" src="../../../../../images/buildings_louvre250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style27" style="width: 350px">
					<img alt="capitol" height="166" src="../../../../../images/buildings_capitol250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style31" style="width: 350px"><em>We went 
					there last spring while we were on holiday to get a break 
					from the hustle of the city.&nbsp; Inside it's fabulous with 
					lots of beautiful ceilings and some great exhibits, mostly 
					paintings but lots of other stuff, too.<br />
					It's a huge palace built in a baroque style with a 
					controversial modern bit in front of it.&nbsp; The modern 
					bit looks a bit like a crystal but I think it's attractive 
					although I have to admit it doesn't really fit in.<br />
					We spent hours there and could have spent longer.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style30" style="width: 350px"><em>We went 
					while we were touring around because Mary had always wanted 
					to see it.&nbsp; She'd learned about it at school you see.&nbsp; 
					She loved it to bits.&nbsp; It's a good place just to hang 
					out if the weather's fine.<br />
					You have to climb up a lot of steps to get to it but the 
					views from the front are pretty impressive.<br />
					I was a bit disappointed by it frankly because there isn't 
					much to see inside but I liked the colonnaded front and the 
					fact that it's all built in nearly white marble.</em></td>

					<td class="auto-style34" style="width: 350px"><em>

					cold I nearly dropped the camera.<br />
					It's pretty impressive really, I suppose, standing as it 
					does at the end of the square and with all the towers and 
					turrets on it but I don't like the dark peach colour much 
					and it cost a lot to get in.<br />
					We took a cab to get there and it was able to drop us right 
					outside the front door because the road runs almost up to 
					it.<br />
					There's a lot to see inside if you like that kind of thing 
					so I guess it's worth the money but I wouldn't go again.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style32" style="width: 350px"><em>This is 
					definitely one not to miss if you are ever in town and have 
					a few hours to spare.<br />
					Even from the outside, it's pretty impressive with all the 
					columns and so on but it's the inside that really got me 
					intrigued.<br />
					It's built around three sides of a huge courtyard and you 
					have to go in through the entrance on the right.&nbsp; Over 
					the top of the central bit there's a carved frieze but, to 
					be honest, I don't remember what that's about.<br />
					I enjoyed it but Fred just went to get in out of the rain!</em></td>

		<p>The learners will, of course, need to be able to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Understand most of the content and not be overwhelmed by too 
				much unknown lexis.</li>
				<li>Be able to use some language of speculation such as <em>I 
				think it is in ... </em></li>
				<li>Be able to give reasons using at least ... <em>because ....</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p><a name="1"></a>Can you come up with three more things <strong>
			with examples </strong>that the learners will need to 
			be able to do to complete the task?&nbsp; In the examination, you 
			only need three but think of more if you can.<br />
			<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'1.3',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here

			<ol id="1.3" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li>They will need to be able to listen for salient information 
				describing the buildings and ignore irrelevance such as comments 
				about the weather and reasons for being there (<em>freezing, to 
				get a break from the hustle of the city, just went in to get out 
				of the rain</em>) and the speakers' reactions to what was inside 
				(task 1).</li>
				<li>They will need to recognise at least some key lexis such as
				<em>column, frieze, square, crystal, steps, courtyard, marble
				</em>etc. (task 1).</li>
				<li>They will need to be able to remember and use some of this 
				lexis when explaining what alerted them to each picture, e.g.,
				<em>dark peach colour, the road runs almost up to it, three 
				sides of a huge courtyard</em> (task 
				2).</li>
				<li>They will need to be able to deploy some epistemic modal 
				language such as <em>might, could, probably, possibly, 
				obviously, it seems to me ... </em>etc. (tasks 2, 3 and 4).</li>
				<li>They will need to be able to decipher the language of 
				opinion in the texts such as <em>disappointed, one not to miss, 
				if you like that kind of thing, loved it to bits, got me 
				intrigued</em> etc. (task 3).</li>
				<li>They will need some awareness of intonation patterns 
				expressing disinterest (lowered voice tone of <em>if you like 
				that kind of thing</em>, for example) or enthusiasm (stress and 
				rising intonation on positive adjectives such as <em>fabulous</em> 
				etc.) (task 3).</li>
				<li>They will need some knowledge of the world to know what 
				sorts of things historical museums usually contain including, 
				for example, <em>cultural items, jewellery, old masters, 
				carvings</em> 
				etc. (task 4).</li>
				<li>They will need the lexis to be able to come up with a list 
				of items (<em>exhibits, paintings, artefacts, statues, objects</em> 
				etc.) (task 4).</li>
				<li>They may need to be able to use bi-lingual dictionaries to 
				fill in the gaps in their vocabulary such as not knowing, for 
				example, <em>ancient, historic, important archeological find</em> 
				etc. (task 4).</li>
				<li>They will need some negotiating language (such as <em>I 
				think we definitely need to include ..., don't you?</em>) (task 
				5).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You may have thought of others.&nbsp; You only have to find three 
			but you <strong>must</strong> exemplify all of them (as above).</p>
