			<p>As a teacher, you are probably quite good at advising your 
			students about examination techniques.&nbsp; Don't forget to tell 
			yourself the same things.</p>
			<p>Cambridge Assessment English issue reports on all three Modules 
			of the Delta quite frequently.&nbsp; These reports are publicly 
			available on its website from
			<a href="http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/teaching-english/teaching-qualifications/delta/about-the-delta-modules/" target="_blank">
			this link</a>.<br />
			What we have done here is to review the comments from a series of 
			reports, looking in particular for what the Principal Examiner has 
			repeatedly noted about weaknesses that lead to failing the Module One 
			examination.<br />
			We have also made some 
			suggestions about how to avoid the weaknesses altogether.<br />
			Passing an examination requires you to avoid things almost as much 
			as it requires you to do certain things so read on if you are 
			interested in passing the examination the first time around.<br />
			There are three areas which are repeatedly noted by the report 
			writers and we'll take them one at a time.&nbsp; They are not 
			prioritised, unfortunately, in the Cambridge reports so we can only 
			assume they are of equal importance and represent the most frequent 
			reasons for being unsuccessful in the examination.</p>

					Reason #1: Lack of adequate knowledge</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The reports for Module One cite this as <span class="style_black">
			<em>the 
			most common reason</em></span> for failing the examination.&nbsp; 
			Obviously, if you don't know your subject, you can't pass an 
			examination in it.<br />
			So, what knowledge do you really need?&nbsp; Here's a rundown:</p>
			<h3>Systems knowledge:</h3>
			<p>The reports repeatedly point out that unsuccessful candidates:</p>
			<p class="indentpara" style="width: 500px">have a very poor knowledge of language 
			systems, particularly describing grammatical and lexical form/use 
			and phonology which can result in a significant loss of marks in 
			Paper One, Tasks 4 and 5</p>
			<p>It might be suggested that ignorance of the nuts and bolts of 
			English <em>will</em> rather than <em>can</em> result in a 
			significant loss of marks.</p>
			<p>So, what do you need to do and what do you need to learn?<br />
			The features of the learner's text you are asked to look at for 
			Question 4 and the genre example for Question 5 are remarkably 
			consistent over the years so you need to be familiar with the 
			concepts and know the terminology to describe them.<br />
			If you can't, for example, define any of the following (which does 
			not constitute an exhaustive list) without going to a reference 
			text, you need to extend and deepen your knowledge of the structures 
			of English</p>
			<ol class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li>Verbs forms<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					finite and non-finite forms<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					aspects: continuous, simple, iterative, durative, habitual<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					tenses: absolute and relative<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; voice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					auxiliary verbs: primary and modal<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					verbal processes: relational, behavioural and material</li>
					<li>Lexis:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					lexical relationships: synonymy, antonymy, polysemy, 
					hyponymy, collocation, colligation<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					markedness: on adjectives, nouns, pronouns and verbs<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					cognate forms<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					style vs. register<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					mass vs. count nouns<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					prepositional phrases<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					types of adjectives<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					adverbials vs. adverbs</li>
					<li>Phonology:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					phonemes and allophones<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					consonants: plosives, fricatives etc. and places of 
					articulation: labial, alveolar, voiced vs. unvoiced etc.<br />

					forms etc.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					stress: word and sentences stress, timing etc.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					intonation: contours, tone movements etc.<br />
					You will find the ability accurately to transcribe English 
					phonemes and word stress is invaluable.&nbsp; There is
					<a href="../../../courses/transcription1/transcription.html" target="_blank">
					a mini-course in transcription</a> on this site.</li>
					<li>Phrase, clause and sentence structures:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					concession and/vs. condition<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

					<li>Genre and discourse:<br />

					conventional text staging for a range of genres<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					cohesion and coherence<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					theme-rheme structures</li>
				</ol>
				
				There are resources on this site to help.<br />
				
				The Handbook for Delta Candidates available on this site and 
				can be downloaded, free naturally, from
				<a href="../delta_guide.html">this link</a>.&nbsp; There are two 
				key parts of that:<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>A short guide to the essentials of grammar and structure.<br />
			As the handbook states, the analysis is an
				<strong>outline</strong> of the areas you need to know about, 
				not a definitive guide to what you need to know.</li>
				<li>A glossary of grammatical terms.<br />
				Work your way down through the list of terms in 
				the glossary and note any terms which you couldn't immediately 
				have defined before looking at the gloss.<br />
				When you have a list, you can then either
				<a href="../../../../searchthesite.html">search the site</a> for 
				the topic you need to find out more about or use
				<a href="../../../a-ztrainingindex.html">the A-Z index</a> of 
				topics.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you have done both of those things, try taking a short test to 
			identify areas which you still need to know more about.<br />
			To do that,
			<a href="../test_your_grammar/test_your_grammar_for_delta.html" target="_blank">
			click here</a> (that page opens in a new tab so shut it to 
			return).<br />A much longer and more searching test is available 
			<a href="../test_terminology_delta.htm">here</a> but is not 
			specific to Module One.</p>
			<p>Finally, here is the index of some of the 
			topic areas in the in-service training section of this site.&nbsp; 
			You can use it to focus on areas where you know your knowledge is 
			not yet adequate.&nbsp; The full list is available
			<a href="../../inserviceindex.html">here</a>.</p>

			<p>If you have done the Module One course on this site, it is 
			unlikely that you will suffer from a lack of awareness of what is 
			required in each task.<br />
			Equally, if you have taken an alternative, paid-for, course, your 
			tutors should have spared no efforts in making sure that you are 
			fully familiar with the demands of all tasks on both papers.&nbsp; 
			If that is not the case, what have they been doing with your money?<br />
			To remind you, here are the basics.&nbsp; For more, go to these

			<h3>Here's a summary and a few more tips:<br />
			<img alt="tips" height="133" src="../../../images/pencil_tips_b200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p><strong>Don't write more than you have to.&nbsp; There is a maximum 
			which the marker is allowed to award for each item (and it is 
			strictly adhered to).&nbsp; You will get no credit for writing more than 
			you have been asked to write, no matter how good it is.</strong></p>
			<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
				<li>
				<p>In Paper 1:</p>
				<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
					<li>
					Task 1 asks for 6 terms to match the definitions.&nbsp; 
					Supply them and no more.&nbsp; You will get no credit at all for 
					giving examples.
					</li>
					<li>
					Task 2 asks for a definition and an example.&nbsp; You will 
					get 2 marks for each correct definition up to a maximum of 8 
					marks and 1 mark for each example up to a maximum of 4 
					marks.<br />
					If the definition is wrong, the example is not scored at 
					all.<br />
					If you provide 2 examples for one item, one is wasted.&nbsp; You 
					cannot provide 2 examples for one item and none for another 
					in the hope that they will balance.&nbsp; They won't.&nbsp; You have 
					wasted one example and lost a mark.
					</li>
					<li>
					Task 3 is similar: 2 marks for each feature and 2 marks 
					for each example.&nbsp; Extra examples are a waste of your time.
					</li>
					<li>
					Task 4 asks for 4 strengths and weaknesses (i.e., you 
					should have at least one in each category).&nbsp; You get 3 marks 
					for each one and 2 more for one example of each.&nbsp; 
					Identifying more than 4 is a waste of time.&nbsp; Providing more 
					than one example of each is a waste of time.<br />
					You get no marks for justifying your choice, so don't.<br />
					You get no marks for prioritising the areas, so don't.
					</li>
					<li>
					Task 5 allows one mark for each correct point you make 
					but you will get no marks for repeating yourself.&nbsp; Make sure 
					you respond to all the demands of the task and tick them off 
					as you go along.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In Paper 2:<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
					<li>Task 1:<br />You get 2 marks for each positive or negative comment up to 
					a maximum of 12 marks (so include both sorts).&nbsp; You will get 
					no credit at all for a seventh comment which will simply be 
					ignored as will everything else over the 6 you have been 
					asked for.<br />You also get 1 mark for applying your comment to the learner 
					for each idea so make sure you do that.
					</li>
					<li>Task 2:<br />You will get 2 marks for recognising the purposes of the 
					exercises up to a maximum of 12 so you need to identify 6 
					purposes (not more).<br />You will get 2 marks for saying how the exercises combine up 
					to a maximum of 12 marks so you need to say 6 things (not 
					more).<br />You get 1 mark for each of the writer's assumptions you 
					identify.&nbsp; You are asked for 6 so give 6.&nbsp; Only the first 6 
					you state will be marked so make the first 6 your best 6.<br />You get 1 mark for explaining the assumption (so refer to 
					learning theory).<br />You get one mark for referring to an exercise which 
					illustrates the assumption.
					</li>
					<li>Task 3:<br />You get 2 marks for each correct point you make up to a 
					maximum of 15 points (i.e. 30 marks).<br />The more detail and background theory with correct 
					terminology use etc. you can give, the better.&nbsp; There are 10 
					marks available for the depth of your response.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
				Read the rubric and make sure you have responded to all 
				parts of the task.
				</li>
				<li>
				Later questions in both papers (the ones that carry the most 
				marks) usually consist of more than one sub-task.&nbsp; Make sure you 
				attend to all of them and tick them off as you go along.
				</li>
				<li>
				Keep it simple.<br />
				If you have forgotten a piece of terminology to describe 
				something, don't leave the area out altogether.&nbsp; You will get 
				credit for identifying something even if you don't use the 
				techno-term for it.
				</li>
				<li>
				Be sure of what you say.<br />
				Do not use terminology you aren't sure about.&nbsp; It is better to 
				supply a non-technical description with an example of what you 
				mean than describe something wrongly.
				</li>
				<li>
				Be prepared.<br />
				Do thorough revision and you will feel confident and assured.<br />
				Make sure you do the mock examinations on this site 
				conscientiously.

			<p>The breakdown of the marks awarded for each task on both papers 
			reflects the amount of time you should be spending on the tasks.&nbsp; 
			There is little point in taking half the time to get 10% of the 
			marks.<br />
			Every year, the reports highlight the fact that people who are 
			unsuccessful have often failed to complete some tasks (although it 
			is not possible to tell if that was due to lack of time or lack of 
			knowledge).</p>
			<p><strong>Keep an eye on the marking scheme and fix it in 
					your mind</strong><br />
			You have 90 minutes for each paper, so, bearing the marks 
			you can get for each question in mind, the time allocation should be 
			like this.</p>
			<p>In Paper 1:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style19">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style16">
					Task 1: 6 marks
					</td>
					<td class="auto-style17">
					Task 2: 12 marks
					</td>
					<td class="auto-style17">
					Task 3: 12 marks
					</td>
					<td class="auto-style17">
					Task 4: 20 marks
					</td>
					<td class="auto-style18">
					Task 5: 50 marks
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style16">
					5 minutes

					<td class="auto-style17">
					10 minutes

					<td class="auto-style17">
					10 minutes
					</td>
					<td class="auto-style17">
					18 minutes
					</td>
					<td class="auto-style18">
					45 minutes&nbsp;
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>So, start with task 5 and work backwards.&nbsp; That way, you will have 
		tackled the high-scoring tasks when you are fresh and alert.&nbsp; If 
		you fail to do Task 1 at all, you can still, in theory, score 94% of the 
		marks available.&nbsp; Even if you ignore both Tasks 1 and 2, you can 
		still get 82% of the marks.<br />
		This will leave you two minutes at the end to relax, knowing you have 
		done the best you can in the time available.</p>
			<p>In Paper 2:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style19">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style16" style="width: 114px">
					Task 1: 18 marks
					</td>
					<td class="auto-style17" style="width: 114px">
					Task 2: 42 marks
					</td>
					<td class="auto-style79" style="width: 114px">
					Task 3: 40 marks
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style16" style="width: 114px">
					16 minutes
					</td>
					<td class="auto-style17" style="width: 114px">
					38 minutes
					</td>
					<td class="auto-style79" style="width: 114px">
					36 minutes
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Leave task 1 till last.&nbsp; Even if you fail to do it at all, you have 
		given yourself the chance of scoring 82% of the marks on offer for the 
		paper.<br />
		Subtract 1 minute from each task and you'll have three minutes over at 
		the end.</p>
