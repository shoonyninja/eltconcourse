			<h1>Writing for <span class="deltablue">Delta</span>: a guide to style</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="style" height="207" src="../../images/woman_style310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Delta is, according to Ofqual (the UK Office of Qualifications 
			and Examinations Regulation) at Level 7 on its scheme, at the same 
			level as a master's degree.&nbsp; It is also, of course, a 
			qualification for <strong>teachers</strong> of English.&nbsp; You 
			are expected, therefore, to be able to write accurately, accessibly 
			and in an appropriate style.<br />
			The study of second-language pedagogy, which is what Delta is about, 
			requires academic writing in a social science genre.<br />
			Some brief advice is available in the guide to writing a Background 
			Essay for Delta and also in the guide to writing for Module Three of 
			the scheme.&nbsp; The following applies to Modules Two and Three 
			equally.</p>
			<p>This guide includes what is said elsewhere but is a bit more ambitious.&nbsp; 
			It provides examples of how to write and compares them with examples 
			of how not to write.</p>
			<p>This is quite a long guide in twelve parts, so here is an index 
			to what it contains.&nbsp; Click on <span class="style_red">-top-

				<dt><strong>Contractions</strong></dt>
				<dd>Unless you are citing directly or giving an example of 
				language use, the simple rule is to avoid contractions 
				altogether.&nbsp; So, do not write:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>My students can't often remember to use contractions so 
				don't sound natural</em>.<br />
				and prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>My students cannot often remember to use contractions so 
				do not sound natural</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Abbreviations</strong></dt>
				<dd>Standard abbreviations in the field are acceptable but any 
				abbreviations that you would have to explain to someone on an 
				initial training course should be written in full the first 
				time.&nbsp; So, do not write:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A TTT rather than a PPP approach to the area often allows 
				for more S-S interaction</em><br />
				and prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A TTT (Test–Teach–Test) rather than a PPP 
				(Presentation&ndash;Practice&ndash;Production) approach to the area often 
				allows for more student-to-student interaction</em>.<br />
				<strong>Never</strong> use abbreviations which simply save 
				typing such as <em>Ss</em> for <em>students</em>, <em>T</em> for
				<em>teacher</em>, <em>esp</em>. for <em>especially</em> and so 
				on.<br />
				See below for conventional Latin abbreviations which you should 
				use.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Colloquialisms</strong></dt>
				<dd>Using colloquialisms in academic writing is not acceptable.&nbsp; 
				Do not, therefore, write:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learners need a bit of time to figure out 
				the meaning of the lexis from the bits of language around it</em>.<br />
				and prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learners need adequate time to infer the 
				meaning of the lexis from the co-text</em>.<br />
				Colloquial language is often prefabricated cliché.&nbsp; In 
				academic writing, informal clichés should be avoided so do not 
				write:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Uncontextualised language should be avoided like the 
				plague</em>.<br />
				and prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Uncontextualised language should certainly be avoided.<br />
				</em>Other more formal clichés, often conjuncts, such as <em>by 
				the same token, on the contrary, under these circumstances</em> 
				etc. are acceptable.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Comparisons, similes and metaphors</strong></dt>
				<dd>In informal language frozen or clichéd similes are 
				frequently used to add spice to what is said.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it went like the wind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a new approach will be like a breath of fresh air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they talk like a machine gun</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				In academic writing, you should avoid formulaic comparisons and 
				make yourself clear in other ways.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it went very rapidly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a new approach will be refreshing and engaging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they speak in a staccato fashion</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				In general, simple similes, using, e.g., <em>like</em> or <em>as 
				... as</em>, should be avoided although metaphor 
				is often very effective, albeit sometimes difficult to handle.&nbsp; 
				So, for example, avoid formulations such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The students are like those I taught in 
				France.</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These materials are as good as any others 
				for this purpose.</em><br />
				and prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These students have similar 
				characteristics to those I am familiar with in France.</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These materials are equally effective for 
				this purpose.<br />
				</em>Metaphor is, as noted, often effective but try to avoid 
				overly colloquial expressions such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The students fish for the answers.<br />
				</em>and prefer, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students trawl the text for the answers.<br />
				</em>If you are in any doubt about the suitability of a metaphor 
				you have used, delete it.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Multi-word verbs</strong></dt>
				<dd>It is not invariably the case that multi-word verbs are less 
				formal than the one-word, often Latin-derived, equivalents.&nbsp; 
				Nevertheless, that is often the case so do not use multi-word 
				verbs where a reasonably synonymous alternative exists.&nbsp; Do 
				not write:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The learners' task is to switch the items around to make 
				a text which holds together and is linked up</em>.<br />
				and prefer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The learners' task is to re-order the items to make a 
				coherent, cohesive text</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Generic and colloquial adjectives and adverbs</strong></dt>
				<dd>While everyday, especially spoken, language is littered with 
				adjectives such as <em>good, fine, great, super, OK</em> etc. 
				and adverbs such as <em>incredibly, astonishingly, fantastically, 
				unbelievably</em> 
				etc., this is language to avoid in formal writing.&nbsp; Do not, 
				therefore, write:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>This is an incredibly useful exercise which is great for 
				getting learners to spot good collocations</em>.<br />
				and prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>This is a very effective exercise which is 
				beneficial in encouraging learners to identify appropriate and 
				conventional&nbsp;collocations.<br />
				</em>In particular, the use of <em>incredible / incredibly</em>, to mean, 
				usually,<em> good</em> or <em>very</em>, is a recent innovation in English.&nbsp; 
				The word properly means <em><span class="style_black">impossible 
				or very difficult to believe</span>
				</em>(Cambridge International Dictionary of English, 1995)<br />At all events, avoid the use of meaningless adjectives such 
				as <em>nice </em>and do not 
				use <em>fun </em>as an attributive adjective.&nbsp; Do not 
				write, therefore:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a nice, fun exercise which has good outcomes</em>.<br />
				and prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>This is an effective, engaging exercise which has 
				positive outcomes</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Exaggeration and understatement</strong></dt>
				<dd>Hyperbole, or exaggeration, is common in colloquial English but jarring in 
				academic writing so avoid expressions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are thousands of ways to present 
				new language</em>.<br />
				and prefer<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a large number of ways to 
				present new language</em>.<br />
				etc.<br />
				At all events, avoid ever writing something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an incredibly good technique with 
				millions of uses.<br />
				</em>Less often, litotes, or understatement, is used in 
				colloquial speech for effect but is rarely acceptable in formal, 
				academic writing.&nbsp; Avoid, therefore, writing, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This learner has been living in the USA for twenty years so 
				knows a bit about the culture.<br />
				</em>and prefer:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This learner has been living in the USA for twenty years so 
				is fully cognizant of the culture.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>The use of the first person</strong></dt>
				<dd>While it acceptable to use the first-person pronouns and 
				determiners when referring directly to your own experience, 
				their use in academic writing is usually disparaged.&nbsp; The 
				use of the first person can be interpreted as avoiding 
				presenting proper evidence, so try to 
				avoid it where you can.&nbsp; It is fully in order to write, for 
				example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It is my experience, working with learners from many Slavic 
				language backgrounds, that the accurate use of the definite 
				article is a consistent problem which is difficult to address</em>.<br />
				but not:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I find that my learners who speak Slavic languages can't use 
				the definite article properly and I have found that dealing with 
				it is hard</em>.<br />
				Avoid stating, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I do not believe that delexicalisation is a 
				useful concept</em>.<br />
				and prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It may be argued that delexicalisation is not a 
				sustainable concept</em>.<br />
				First-person pronouns <strong>are</strong> often appropriate in 
				the suggestions for the teaching section of a Background Essay or in 
				the description of research methodology for Module Three because this is where you 
				describe and interpret your work or experience.</dd>
				<dt><strong>The passive</strong></dt>
				<dd>In an effort to be seen as academic, there is a tendency to 
				overuse the passive.&nbsp; While passive-voice structures are 
				frequently useful, not least because they remove the need for a 
				subject pronoun, they can be overused to the point at which it 
				is unclear what the subject of a verb in the parallel active 
				sentence would be.&nbsp; Avoid, therefore:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It has been seen that my students are frequently unable 
				to use dictionaries effectively to select appropriate lexis</em>.<br />
				because that disguises who did the noticing.&nbsp; Prefer, in 
				this case:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I have noticed, by observation in class, that some of my 
				learners are unable to use dictionaries effectively to select 
				appropriate lexis</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Shibboleths</strong></dt>
				<dd>A shibboleth may be defined as:
				<span class="style_black"><em>A belief or custom that is not now 
				considered as important and correct as it was in the past</em></span> 
				(Cambridge International Dictionary of English, 1995).<br />
				There are two shibboleths that it is wise to avoid in formal, 
				academic writing:<br />
			<ol>
				<li>The split-infinitive<br />
				While there is no historical or stylistic justification for 
				derogating the use of a split infinitive, it is still generally 
				avoided in academic writing.&nbsp; So, for example, avoid:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It is necessary to carefully monitor this activity</em>.<br />
				and prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It is necessary carefully to monitor this activity</em>.</li>
				<li>The end-of sentence preposition (also known as an 
				Addisonian termination)<br />
				There is also little historical or stylistic basis for 
				disparaging sentences which end with a preposition, or which use 
				a preposition to end a clause with, but this formulation is 
				still considered inappropriate in academic writing.&nbsp; 
				Therefore, avoid, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>This is a good device to focus learners on the topic with</em>.<br />
				and prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>This is an effective device with which to focus the 
				learners on the topic</em>.</li>
			</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Gradability</strong></dt>
				<dd>In informal speech and writing, it is common to find 
				adjectives which are nominally ungradable being used gradably.&nbsp; 
				For example, <em>more unique, totally complete, completely perfect</em> 
				etc.<br />
				In formal, academic writing, such uses are better avoided.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Concord</strong></dt>
				<dd>In informal speech and writing, it is common to find 
				singular nouns followed by 
				plural verb forms and <em>vice versa</em>.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The class have similar aims and motivation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data is clear</em>.<br />
				etc.<br />
				In more formal writing such formulations should be avoided.&nbsp; 
				If you use a singular noun phrase, make sure the verb is also 
				singular (and <em>vice versa</em>) so prefer, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The group has similar aims.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data are clear</em>.<br />
				etc.<br />
				Concord issues also apply to quantifiers such as <em>a 
				range of, a variety of, a number of </em>and so on.&nbsp; All of 
				these are, in colloquial usage, often paired with a plural verb 
				form, a phenomenon known as proximity concord because of the 
				proximity of the plural noun to the verb, as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A range of techniques are available</em><br />
				However, in formal writing we should be careful to maintain the 
				grammatical accuracy of the concord and prefer, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A variety of problems arises with ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A range of techniques is available<br />
				</em>The expression<em> a number of </em>is an exception and is 
				almost always used with a plural verb form.<br />
				This is also the case when the subject of the verb is <strong>
				clearly</strong> plural as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A range of languages do </em>(not<em> does</em>) <em>not 
				distinguish between ...</em></dd>
				<dt>P<strong>ronoun and modifier use</strong></dt>
				<dd>In informal speech and writing, it is common to find 
				singular entities represented by plural pronouns in order to 
				avoid accusations of genderism.&nbsp; We see, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a student hands in their essay.<br />
				</em>which is not acceptable in formal writing because a 
				singular noun should be represented by a singular pronoun.&nbsp; So, if you want to avoid clumsy 
				formulations such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a student hands in his or her essay.<br />
				</em>prefer the plural:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When students hand in their essays.<br />
				</em>Cambridge English Assessment is, incidentally, not immune to this kind of 
				semi-literate clumsiness<em>.<br />
				</em>An allied point is that in colloquial language, the 
				quantifier <em>less</em> serves to modify both countable and 
				uncountable noun phrases.&nbsp; In more formal writing, we need 
				to distinguish <em>less </em>and<em> fewer </em>and reserve the 
				latter for countable noun phrases.&nbsp; Prefer, therefore:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are fewer students in the group who need basic literacy 
				training.<br />
				</em>to<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are less students in the group who need basic literacy 
				training.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>The apostrophe</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is a simple, well-known issue but one which is 
				regrettably carelessly handled in some candidates' writing.<br />
				The apostrophe denoting possessive, origin or descriptive 
				meanings comes after the singular noun, so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the class' preference </em>(or
				<em>the class's preference</em>, if you prefer)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the student's progress<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the learner's rights</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the school's materials</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				The apostrophe follows the plural ending in other cases, so we 
				have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the classes' preferences<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the students' progress<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the learners' rights</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;the teachers' material base</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Only if the plural is irregular does the apostrophe occur 
				elsewhere as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these people's inputs into the learning 
				process<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the children's sponsors demand a syllabus which includes ...</em><br />
				If, in general, punctuation, including the use of the 
				apostrophe and mysteries such as the semi-colon, is giving you 
				trouble, consult the guide on this site to their correct usage linked in the list of related guides at the end.</dd>

			<p>Most of us are quite sensitive to casual sexism or racism but 
			less perceptive when it comes to classifying learners by 
			nationality, culture or personality.<br />
			Statements such as the following should be avoided without clear and 
			careful justification for them (and for some, there is no obvious 
			justification which could be proposed):</p>
			<dl>
				<dt class="style_black"><em>These learners generally have a mix 
				of auditory and kinaesthetic learning styles</em></dt>
				<dd>because the whole area of learning styles theories has been 
				comprehensively debunked and even if there were any truth in the 
				theories, this is still unacceptable stereotyping because we all 
				have a mix of learning preferences.</dd>
				<dt class="style_black"><em>Asian learners may be less willing 
				to take risks</em></dt>
				<dd>because this describes all learners from Istanbul to 
				Vladivostok and Northern Siberia to New Guinea, some 4 billion 
				people with hugely varying first languages, cultures and 
				histories.&nbsp; It is the case that some cultures are more or 
				less risk averse and have more or less extreme power distances 
				and so on but you need to be precise and aware of the exceptions 
				and variations.</dd>
				<dt class="style_black"><em>Germans tend to expect teachers to 
				be authoritative</em></dt>
				<dd>because this borders on racism by proxy of nationality and 
				cannot possibly describe every person of that nationality.</dd>
				<dt class="style_black"><em>Arabs are accustomed to learning by 
				rote in schools</em></dt>
				<dd>because this assumes that all Arabic speakers, around 250 
				million people, share an educational culture and that within 
				those cultures no variety exists.&nbsp; It is worth remembering 
				that Arabic is better described as a macro-language or a 
				language group because many varieties are not mutually 
				comprehensible.&nbsp; The differences between varieties of 
				Arabic are as great as the differences between, e.g., Spanish 
				and Portuguese or German and Dutch.<br />
				Cultural differences across the nations which use a variety of 
				Arabic are very marked.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>and so on.</p>
			<p>The morals are do not assume that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>nationality and first-language invariably coincide (although 
				they often do)</li>
				<li>those members of a culture you have encountered are 
				representative of 
				all its members</li>
				<li>language and cultural borders are contiguous</li>
				<li>you can classify all learners by continent, area or nation</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Be careful because casual stereotyping like this has no place in 
			our profession.</p>

			<p>Using abbreviations derived from Latin is a feature of most 
			academic writing and you should be aware of and use the most common 
			ones.&nbsp; However, using them wrongly is deeply unimpressive.&nbsp; 
			Here, the examples are all in italics.&nbsp; In your writing, only 
			the Latinisms should be, except where noted for the first two items.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em><strong>i.e.</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>means <em>that is</em>, being the abbreviation of the 
				Latin <em>id 
			est.</em>&nbsp; It should not be confused with <em>e.g</em>.&nbsp; 
				Use it to link parallel ideas as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>All the students are at approximately the same 
				pre-intermediate level, i.e., A2 on the CEFR.<br />
				</em>This abbreviation is not usually italicised.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>e.g.</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>means <em>for example</em> and is the abbreviation of the 
				Latin <em>exempli gratia.</em>&nbsp; In full, it should be 
				written as <em>for example</em> and not the overly colloquial
				<em>for instance</em> or <em>say</em>.<br />
				This abbreviation is not usually italicised.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>cf</strong>.</em></dt>
				<dd>means <em>compare with</em> or <em>consult</em>, being short 
				for <em>conferre.&nbsp; </em>In Latin, it was an invitation to 
				the reader to consult an alternative source to compare with what 
				is being said.&nbsp; In English, it usually simply means <em>
				compare</em>.&nbsp; Use it to direct the reader to compare 
				something else in your text as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>One student has little instrumental motivation (cf. 
				comments above concerning the course aims in general).</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>et al</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>means <em>and others</em> and comes from the Latin <em>et alia</em>.&nbsp; 
				Use it in in-text references after the first author when there are more than three authors.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>(Smith et al, 1997:14)</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>et seq.</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This is the Latin abbreviation for <em>et sequens</em> and 
				it means <em>and what follows</em>.&nbsp; It is used to direct 
				the reader to a page or paragraph in a text and note that this 
				is where the relevant section starts.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>See Smith, 1992:350 et seq.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>sic</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This is the Latin for <em>so</em> or <em>thus</em>.&nbsp; If 
				you want to quote something that is incorrect or oddly phrased, 
				use this in brackets after the words or phrase to show that this 
				is how it appears in the original text.&nbsp; That way, the 
				reader will not think it is your mistake.&nbsp; Do not correct 
				anything that you are citing directly.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teacher in the home institution 
				informed us that "this class are mixed of reading level (sic)".</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>viz.</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>is the usual abbreviation for<em> videlicet</em> which means
				<em>namely, that is to say </em>or<em> it may be said</em>.&nbsp; It should, 
				in theory, not 
				be confused with <em>i.e</em>. although most writers use them 
				interchangeably.&nbsp; Use <em>viz</em>. when you want to give 
				more detail or be more exact.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Most students in the group have similar motivations for 
				learning English, viz., to study in an English-speaking 
				institution.</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>q.v.</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>stands for <em>quod vide</em>, which means <em>which see</em> 
				and 
				refers to a term that should be looked up elsewhere in a 
				document.&nbsp; It is often used for cross referencing.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;The end-of-course test includes two items which appear in 
				the pre-course test (q.v.) for comparison purposes.</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>ibid</strong></em>.</dt>
				<dd>stands for <em>ibidem</em>, Latin for<em> in the same place</em>, and is used in citations 
			to refer to the immediately preceding citation.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jones (ibid.)</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>op. cit.</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>stands for <em>opere citato</em>, Latin for<em> in the work cited</em>.&nbsp; It is used to refer to any 
				previously cited work, not just the last one.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jones (op. cit.)</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>pace</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>means something like <em>With all due respect</em> <em>to</em> 
				and is used by authors to show respect for the holder of a view 
				with which they disagree (often disrespectfully).&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not seem from my experience that 
				(pace Smith, 1994:200) the problem arises from 
				over-generalisation.</em><br />
				</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>passim</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>means very approximately <em>throughout</em> or <em>
				frequently</em> and refers to an idea or concept that occurs in 
				many places in a cited work so a particular page reference is 
				inappropriate.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Smith, 1994, passim)</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p><strong>Conventions</strong><br />
			There are some conventions you should use in your writing:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Place <em>*</em> before any malformed or erroneous 
				utterance, like this:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I go yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Place a <em>? </em>before any questionably correct 
				formulation, like this:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?There are less people here<br />
				</em>(Combining <em>*</em> and <em>?</em> indicates a form which 
				is almost unacceptable.)</li>
				<li>Use italics for examples of language use and language items, 
				like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The modal auxiliary verbs <em>might</em> and <em>could</em> 
				are polysemous.</li>
				<li>Use brackets around any optional items in a form, like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Help her (to) do it</em></li>
				<li>Use <em>AmE</em> and <em>BrE</em> to refer to American 
				Standard and British Standard English.</li>
				<li>Use slash marks around phonemic symbols and transcriptions, 
				like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expression <em>like this</em> is transcribed as: /ˈlaɪk.ðɪs/<br />
				(Note the use of ‘ˈ’ before the syllable to mark the main 
				stress. Use ‘ˌ’ to mark a secondary stress.&nbsp; So, for 
				example, the word <em>unbelievably</em> is transcribed as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˌʌn.bɪ.ˈliː.və.bli/<br />
				with the secondary stress marked on the first syllable and the 
				primary stress marked on the third syllable.)</li>
				<li>Use square brackets around phonetic symbols, like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The allophone in English of /l/ (the light /l/) is the dark 
				sound at the end of, e.g., <em>lull</em>, transcribed as [ɫ].</li>
				<li>Use either a raised schwa or a mark below the consonant to 
				mark syllabic stress, like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word <em>responsible</em> can be transcribed either as: /rɪ.ˈspɒn.səb.l̩/ 
				or as: /rɪ.ˈspɒn.səb.ᵊl/.</li>

			<p>The purpose of hedging what you say is to avoid challenging the 
			reader to think of all the times that you are probably wrong.&nbsp; 
			Here are some guides to how to do it:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Modal auxiliary verbs</strong></dt>
				<dd>The central modal auxiliary verbs, <em>could, may, might, 
				would</em> are common hedges.<br />
				Three marginal modal auxiliary verbs also play a role and these include
				<em>seem to, tend to, be likely to</em>.<br />
				Other modal auxiliary verbs make you sound too assertive and the reader 
				may well feel challenged to disagree.&nbsp; Therefore, avoid, 
				for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>This must be because ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has to be a result of ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This can't be an example of ...</em><br />
				etc.
				and prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>This could easily be because ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This may, quite arguably, be a result of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This might be an example of ...</em><br />
				or:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>This seems to be because ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tends to result from ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is likely to occur if ...</em><br />
				The modal auxiliary verb <em>would</em> is a versatile and useful one in 
				functioning to distance you slightly and make what you write 
				appear suitably hedged so avoid, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I argue that ...</em><br />
				and prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I would argue that ...</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Modal adverbs and adjectives</strong></dt>
				<dd>Avoid being too assertive in the use of adjectives and 
				adverbs.&nbsp; Doing so simply challenges the reader to think of 
				all the times you are wrong.&nbsp; So, for example, do not write:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> It is certain that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students always ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learners invariably ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an obvious tendency to ...</em><br />
				and prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> It is (clearly) arguable that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students frequently ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learners very often ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a perceptible tendency to ...</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Boosters and Downtoners</strong></dt>
				<dd>Boosters are commonly used in informal speech to add 
				strength to a message but should be used sparingly in academic 
				writing.&nbsp; Try to avoid, therefore, adverbials such as <em>
				invariably, extremely, astonishingly, definitely, certainly, of 
				course, predictably</em> etc.<br />
				Downtoning adverbials are, on the other hand, common in good 
				academic writing to present a modest case so be unafraid to use, 
				e.g., <em>usually, frequently, arguably, in my experience, from 
				experience, in this case</em> etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Modal nouns</strong></dt>
				<dd>Although these are less frequently used, their misuse or 
				non-use is 
				most glaring.&nbsp; Again, they challenge the reader to think of 
				times when what you say is not the case.<br />
				For example, avoid writing:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact is that ...</em><br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth of the matter is ...</em><br />
				and prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The supposition is that</em> ...<br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The (strong) possibility is that ...</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Verb forms and tenses</strong></dt>
				<dd>Anything stated in the present simple usually carries 
				the connotation that you believe something to be invariably the case.&nbsp; 
				So, unless this is what you mean, avoid:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Speakers of Romance language use single-word verbs instead 
				of multi-word verbs</em><br />
				and prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Speakers of Romance language (may) tend to use single-word 
				verbs instead of multi-word verbs</em>.</dd>

			<p>This is an area in which you need carefully to read what the 
			authority you are citing really said.&nbsp; There are three 
			important points to consider:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>What was the author doing?<br />
				Signal the quotation by stating the nature of the work you are 
				citing because this shows you have understood the author's 
				intentions.<br />
				For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>In her <strong>review of methodology</strong> Woodward 
				states, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an article <strong>criticising</strong> this approach, 
				Williams asserts, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <strong>teacher's book</strong> for this set of 
				materials, the authors are clear that, ...<br />
				</em>and so on.</li>
				<li>What function was the author performing?<br />
				This is where the choice if reporting verb is crucial.<br />
			For example, if you are reporting that a writer is <strong>agreeing</strong> with 
			another authority, it is an error to state:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Smith clarifies this view by stating, "..."</em><br />
			because the verb should be something like <em>supports, concurs with</em> 
			or <em>endorses</em>.<br />
			In other words, make the function match the verb and <em>vice versa</em>.<br />
				More examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jones <strong>suggests</strong> that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harris <strong>notes</strong> that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elgin <strong>summarises</strong> the issue as ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smith <strong>asserts</strong> that ... </em></li>
				<li>What level of certainty is being suggested?<br />
				In other words, what is the author's stance and how are you 
				signalling it?<br />
				For example:<ol class="auto-style22">
					<li>speculating or suggesting, in which case use, for example:<ol class="deltabluebullet">
						<li><em>Smith suggests ...</em></li>
						<li><em>Jones postulates ...</em></li>
						<li><em>Guru implies ...</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>discussing or examining, in which case use, for example:<ol class="deltabluebullet">
						<li><em>Smith notes ...</em></li>
						<li><em>Jones sets out ...</em></li>
						<li><em>Guru comments ...</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>claiming or asserting, in which case use, for example:<ol class="deltabluebullet">
						<li><em>Smith claims ...</em></li>
						<li><em>Jones shows ...</em></li>
						<li><em>Guru proves ...</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
&nbsp;<p>You also need to use a range of reporting verbs when you cite or paraphrase 
			authority.&nbsp; Avoid always writing, e.g.:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<em>Jones (1990:230) states, "..."</em><br />or<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<em>&nbsp;Jones (1990:230) says that "..."</em><br />and consider something more accurate and meaningful such as:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<em>Jones (1990:230) cautions us that "..."</em><br />or<br />&nbsp;
			<em>&nbsp;
			Jones (1990:230) observes / notes / makes the point that "..."</em></p>
			<p>For more on a range of appropriate reporting verbs, see the guide 
			to reporting verbs in EAP linked in the list of related guides at the end.&nbsp; 
			This diagram is taken from that guide.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="reporting verbs" height="231" src="../../imagesgraphics/reporting_verbs1.png" width="465" /><br />
			</p>
			<p>When you cite a source, it is useful to consider which reporting 
			verbs will best express the level of certainty that the author 
			intended.</p>

			<p>In all you write for Delta, you are expected to draw on 
			authority.&nbsp; That does not absolve you of the need to think, 
			sometimes.</p>
			<p>The authors you cite may well know more than you (about some 
			matters) but they are not necessarily, or even probably, cleverer or 
			more insightful than you.<br />
			So, if you see an internal inconsistency, a contradiction, an 
			unsupported assertion or simply something which does not seem 
			logical or consistent with the data you have, do not be afraid to 
			point it out.&nbsp; Do the same if and when you discover that two or 
			more authorities you have consulted disagree about something and 
			then include what you think.&nbsp; It shows you are reading 
			critically and not allowing yourself to be intimidated by the views 
			of someone lucky enough to get themselves into print.<br />
			That, of course, applies equally to what you access in printed form, 
			from presentations at training and conference sessions, on the web 
			and from this site.</p>

			The whole point of avoiding grammatical <em>faux pas</em> is make 
			sure that your writing is clear and accessible.&nbsp; Forcing the 
			reader to  rephrase  for you and correct the grammar in order to 
			retrieve your intended meaning is poor practice and reduces the 
			credibility of what you write.&nbsp; It also irritates the reader.<br />
			When you write at this level, your intention, presumably, is to 
			persuade the reader that you have mastered your topic area and write 
			from authority.<br />
			Very little undermines this impression as much as errors in syntax, 
			lexical choice and grammar.&nbsp; You are, after all, a teacher of 
			the language and you should be able to write it effectively, 
			accurately and clearly.&nbsp; All written work at this level must 
			be free from errors, typographical or otherwise.<br />
			Here is a selection of the usual issues to avoid.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>The run-on sentence or comma splice</strong></dt>
				<dd>Joining what should be two sentences with a comma (or not) 
				creates a run-on sentence which is clumsy and unclear.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We can also use </em>shall<em> with the future perfect 
				simple and continuous forms, this however, is usually a matter 
				of formality.</em><br />
				in which we have two different subjects for different verbs.&nbsp; 
				The sentence should be re-written as two separate statements:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We can also use
				</em>shall<em> with the future perfect simple and continuous 
				forms.&nbsp; This is, however, usually a matter of formality.<br />
				</em>Often less satisfactorily, you can use the semi-colon or a 
				dash to separate the clauses:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can also use shall with the future perfect simple and 
				continuous forms; this is, however, usually a matter of 
				formality.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can also use shall with the future perfect simple and 
				continuous forms – this is, however, usually a matter of 
				formality.<br />
				</em>There is a guide to how to avoid comma splices on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Using conjuncts as conjunctions (or </strong><em>
				<strong>vice versa</strong></em>)</dt>
				<dd>A conjunction joins clauses, either to coordinate or 
				subordinate, and is integral to the resulting compound or 
				complex sentence, but a conjunct links separate ideas, often in 
				separate sentences but always in separate clauses.&nbsp; Using a 
				conjunct as if it were a conjunction makes another form of 
				run-on sentence.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>These learners will have to use English in the workplace, 
				moreover, they will need to operate in an English-speaking 
				society.</em><br />
				in which the word <em>moreover</em> has been used as if it were 
				a conjunction.&nbsp; It is not, so the sentence should be 
				re-written.&nbsp; This can be achieved either by<ol class="auto-style22">
					<li>using a proper coordinating conjunction used to create 
					the compound sentence into which the conjunct can be 
					inserted.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>These learners will have to use English in the workplace
				<span class="auto-style23">and, moreover</span>, they will need 
				to operate in an English-speaking society.<br />
					</em>or</li>
					<li>as two separate sentences with the conjunct 
					performing its proper function.&nbsp; Like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>These learners will have to use English in the workplace.&nbsp;
				<span class="auto-style23">Moreover</span>, they will need to 
				operate in an English-speaking society.</em><br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>These learners will have to use English in the workplace.&nbsp; 
				They will, <span class="auto-style23">moreover</span>, need to 
				operate in an English-speaking society.</em></li>
				</ol>
				Used accurately, conjuncts perform a very useful cohesive 
				function in academic writing.&nbsp; They can:</dd>
				<dd class="auto-style40">enumerate <em>(firstly, finally</em>)<br />
				add (<em>moreover, furthermore, additionally</em>)<br />
				signal exemplification (<em>for example</em>)<br />
				signal apposition (<em>in other words, by which I mean</em>)<br />
				sum up or conclude (<em>in conclusion, to sum up</em>)<br />
				show results (<em>consequently, as a result, therefore, in view 
				of that</em>)<br />
				replace (<em>alternatively, instead</em>)<br />
				express an opposite meaning (<em>in fact, indeed, on the other 
				hand</em>)<br />
				concede (<em>however, at any rate</em>)<br />
				equate (<em>likewise, similarly</em>)<br />
				All the examples given here are conjuncts, not conjunctions.</dd>
				<dd class="auto-style5">There is a guide to conjuncts on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.</dd>
				<dt><strong>The hanging or dangling participle and prepositional 
				phrase</strong></dt>
				<dd>A dangling participle is usually defined as one for which 
				there is no obvious subject for the verb.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Talking to my students they tell me that they need more 
				listening practice.</em><br />
				Here, the reader is forced mentally to adjust the sentence to 
				discover who is talking to the students.&nbsp; It would, 
				therefore, be better phrased as, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>When I have canvassed my students' views, they all report 
				that they believe they need more listening practice.<br />
				</em>Readers of a text will expect the subject of a verb to be 
				the closest appropriate noun phrase to it.&nbsp; So, for 
				example, in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Using top-down strategies in combination with bottom-up 
				strategies, learners can infer some of the meanings of unknown 
				lexical items.</em><br />
				it is clear that it is <em>learners</em> who will use 
				the strategies even though the subject of the verb is separated 
				by nine words from the verb (<em>using</em>).&nbsp; However, in 
				this sentence we have a hanging participle:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Reading my students' essays, it is clear that they use a 
				limited range of appropriate adjectival phrases.</em><br />
				in which the reader has to sort out who is doing the reading and 
				who the using.&nbsp; The sentence needs 
				re-writing as, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Reading my students' essays, <span class="auto-style23">I 
				have noticed that</span> they use a limited range of appropriate 
				adjectival phrases.</em><br />
				in which the proper subject of the verb has been inserted so it 
				is clear who is doing the reading and who the using.<br />
				This also happens, less frequently, with the past participle as 
				in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brought up and educated in Greece, his writing tends to be 
				inaccurate in terms of orthography</em><br />
				which seems to imply that his writing was brought up and 
				educated in Greece rather than the student.<br />
				It would be better phrased as, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brought up and educated in Greece, he has difficulty with 
				accurate use of orthography and spelling.</em><br />
				where it is clear who was brought up and educated in Greece.<br />
				There is a guide to avoiding dangling participles on this site linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
				An allied grammatical <em>faux pas</em> is the dangling 
				prepositional phrase.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;At the age of 25, her formal education is now complete.</em><br />
				which appears to imply that her formal education is 25 years old 
				and that is not what the writer means.&nbsp; Much simpler and 
				clearer would be:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She is 25 years old and her formal education is now 
				complete.</em></dd>

			<p>There are many of these and a complete list would fill a small 
			book.<br />
			In what follows there is occasional reference to differences in 
			English-language varieties, especially American English (AmE) and 
			British English (BrE).&nbsp; Whichever variety you use, be 
			consistent.<br />
			Here are some favourite confusions and misuses to avoid:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>adverse</em> and <em>averse</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The adjective <em>adverse</em> means <em>harmful</em> as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>This may have an adverse effect on learning.</em><br />
				The adjective <em>averse</em> means <em>disliking</em> as in, for example<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>My students are averse to taking risks in public.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>affect</em> and <em>effect</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The verb <em>affect</em> means <em>to change</em>.&nbsp; The noun <em>effect</em> 
				refers to<em> the result of a change</em>.&nbsp; More rarely, the verb 
				<em>effect</em> means to <em>bring about a change</em>.<br />
				So, for example, we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setting may affect learners' 
				motivation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setting's effect on the learners' motivation was 
				negative.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to effect a change in the learners' motivation, the 
				setting needs to be changed.<br />
				</em>By the same token, the adjectives, <em>affective</em> and
				<em>effective</em>, mean different things.<br />
				The first refers to changing someone's emotional state as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a number of affective factors 
				in the plan to take into account.</em><br />
				The second means successful in producing the result you want as 
				in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an effective consolidation 
				activity.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>aural</em> and <em>oral</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>These two words are pronounced the same (as /ˈɔː.rəl/) but 
				the first refers to listening and the second to speaking.&nbsp; 
				To distinguish, some people pronounce the first as /ˈaʊ.rəl/.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>born</em> and <em>borne</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>These are pronounced the same but the first refers to 
				<em>having started life</em> and the second means <em>carried</em> so do not 
				write:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> The marker for singular, third-person subjects is born on 
				the verb suffix</em>.<br />
				and prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;The marker for singular, third-person subjects is borne 
				on the verb suffix.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>chord</em> and <em>cord</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The first of these refers to <em>a group of musical notes</em> but 
				the second is the one you should use to refer to <em>the vocal cords</em> 
				which contribute to voicing of a consonant because it means a 
				length of something like string or rope.&nbsp; It is nowadays 
				more accurate, some aver, to refer to <strong>vocal folds</strong>.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>communicative</em> and <em>talkative</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The term <em>communicative</em> does not only apply to 
				spoken language so do not confuse it with <em>oral</em>.&nbsp; If 
				you mean that some learners do not talk much then say so rather 
				than imply that they do not communicate.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>complement</em> and <em>compliment</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The first of these refers to the grammatical item which 
				completes a phrase as in, for example, <em>the complement of a verb</em>.&nbsp; 
				The second means <em>praise</em>.&nbsp; Both can be nouns or verbs.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>continual</em> and <em>continuous</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The first of these means recurring regularly as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He continually makes mistakes with past-tense endings.</em><br />
				The second of these means unceasing or non-stop as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talked continuously and without 
				interruption.</em><br />
				A class into which new students arrive regularly should be 
				described as having <em>continual enrolment</em>, not <em>
				continuous enrolment</em>, whatever the school prospectus may 
				say.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>discreet</em> and <em>discrete</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The first of these adjectives means <em>without attracting 
				attention</em> as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to monitor discreetly</em>.<br />
				The second adjective means <em>separate and distinct</em> as in, for 
				example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; A discrete-item test was administered to assess the students' 
				ability to distinguish these 
				phonemes.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>disinterested</em> and <em>uninterested</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The first of these means <em>impartial</em> or <em>unbiased</em> 
				as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tests were marked anonymously by disinterested 
				markers</em>.<br />
				The second adjective means <em>bored</em> or <em>not engaged</em> 
				as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; These students would be uninterested in a text about 
				kangaroos.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>elicit, illicit </em>and<em> evince</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The first verb means <em>to draw out by questioning or other 
				means</em> as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The task naturally elicits the past 
				perfect form</em>.<br />
				The second is an adjective meaning <em>illegal</em>.<br />
				The verb <em>evince</em> is not the same as <em>elicit</em>.&nbsp; 
				It means to s<em>how clearly </em>or<em> demonstrate </em>as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The test results evinced the learners' unreadiness to take the 
				examination.</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>ellipsis and elision</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>Ellipsis is a syntactical phenomenon in which a word or 
				phrase is omitted because it is known and can be recovered 
				uniquely. For example, in:<br />
				&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;
				John can’t help but I can.</em><br />
				we have ellipsis in the second clause of the verb <em>help</em> because 
				it is clearly recoverable by the listener or reader.&nbsp; Technically, ellipsis can only refer to an element that is 
				uniquely recoverable so, for example:<br />
				&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;
				I liked the shirt so I bought three</em>.<br />
				is not an example of ellipsis but of the omission of an object 
				phrase.&nbsp; There are a number of possible items which have been 
				omitted: <em>of them, shirts, items, types, colours</em> etc.&nbsp; An 
				alternative is to call this substitution by zero or substitution 
				of the noun phrase by the determiner <em>three</em>.&nbsp; The verb is
				<em>ellipt</em>.<br />
				Elision is a phonological phenomenon in which a sound is omitted 
				in normal or rapid speech.&nbsp; For example, the word <em>secretary</em> may 
				be pronounced /ˈse.krə.tə.ri/ or, eliding the third vowel sound, 
				as /ˈse.krə.tri/.&nbsp; Consonants, too, are frequently elided from 
				clusters as in the pronunciation of <em>glimpse</em> as /ɡlɪms/ with 
				elision of the /p/.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>imply</em> and <em>infer</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The first of these means <em>to suggest</em> as in, for 
				example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;The evidence strongly implies that the students need more 
				practice in this area</em>.<br />
				The second verb means t<em>o reach a conclusion</em> as in, for 
				example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Learners can infer the meaning from the co-text.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>insure</em> and <em>ensure</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>In British English, the first of these words refers to 
				protecting something with a policy that will indemnify you in 
				the event of loss or damage (hence an insurance policy).&nbsp; 
				The second of this pair means to make certain of something.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;To ensure that students are working alone on the task, I 
				separate them physically in different parts of the room.<br />
				</em>In AmE these verbs are sometimes used interchangeably.<br />
				The word <em>assure</em>, incidentally, means <em>to promise</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>invariably</em> and <em>usually</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The first adverb means <em>always, without variation or 
				exception</em>.&nbsp; 
				The second does not.&nbsp; Beware the use of the first of these 
				because you are setting yourself up for the reader to think of 
				an exception.&nbsp; For example, writing:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two clauses joined by the coordinator
				</em>and<em> can invariably be reversed</em>.<br />
				invites the reader to object:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about "Bring the food and I'll cook 
				the dinner"?</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>it's</em> and <em>its</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>If you are obeying the rule not to use contractions in 
				formal writing, the first of these should never occur.<br />
				<em>It's</em> is an abbreviation of either<em> it is</em> or <em>
				it has</em>.<br />
				<em>Its</em> is the possessive modifier for the pronoun <em>it</em>.<br />
				Correct, therefore, are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The activity has its uses in this respect</em>.<br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's been demonstrated that ...</em><br />
				Wrong, therefore, are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The activity has it's uses</em>.<br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Its been demonstrated that ...</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>nor</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>That the word <em>nor</em> is paired with <em>neither</em> 
				is not a mystery so we are all happy to accept, for example<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He neither noticed the mistake nor corrected it</em><br />
				The problem comes when we have a sentence such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He didn’t notice the mistake nor correct it</em><br />
				which is wrong because the negation of the first
				<span class="style_underline">clause</span> is carried forward 
				to negate the second <span class="style_underline">verb phrase</span>, 
				making, in effect, a double negative, so it should be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He didn’t notice the mistake or correct it</em><br />
				The rules are:<ol>
					<li>When the second item is a verb
					<span class="style_underline">phrase</span>, a noun phrase, 
					an adverb phrase or an adjective phrase then use <em>or</em>, 
					not <em>nor,</em> so we get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She hasn’t eaten or drunk anything<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn’t study French or German at school<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She never went happily or quickly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pie wasn’t well cooked or hot enough</em></li>
					<li>When the second item is a full
					<span class="style_underline">clause</span>, negation needs 
					to be reiterated because it cannot safely be assumed to 
					carry on from the first clause, use <em>nor</em>, not <em>or</em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The teacher didn’t notice the error, nor did anyone else 
					correct it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My students weren’t late to class and nor were most of their 
					colleagues<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn’t come happily to the theatre, nor did she enjoy the 
					play when she got there</em><br />
					and in the third example, we have the inversion of operator and verb in 
					the second clause.</li>
				</ol>
				If in doubt,  rephrase  with <em>neither … nor</em> or <em>either 
				… or</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>on behalf of</em> and <em>on the part of</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The term <em>on behalf of</em> means <em>for</em> or <em>
				representing</em> as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>One student speaks on behalf of the group.</em><br />
				The term <em>on the part of</em> means <em>done by, responsible 
				for </em>or <em>carried out by</em> as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The silence on the part of the teacher in this 
				methodology may sometimes disorientate the learners.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>ones</em> and <em>one's</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The pronoun <em>ones</em> is the plural form of <em>one</em> 
				and <em>one's</em> is the possessive modifier of the impersonal
				<em>one</em>.<br />
				Correct, therefore, are:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>One should be careful with one's grammar</em>.<br />
				and<br />
				&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I select the easier ones</em>.<br />
				Wrong, therefore, are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *One should be careful with ones grammar</em>.<br />
				and<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; *I select the easier one's</em>.<br />
				In AmE, the pronoun <em>one</em> is often followed by a personal 
				pronoun as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; One should look after his belongings</em>.<br />
				In BrE, that is considered wrong and should be:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; One should look after one's belongings.</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>phase</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em>
				<strong>faze</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>The first of these is a noun or verb referring to the <em>stage</em> of 
				something or a verb referring to the <em>staging</em> of a procedure.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This phase of the lesson is designed to 
				provide formal practice (q.v.) of the usage (q.v.) of the tense</em>.<br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The target lexis will be phased in over a 
				series of three lessons</em>.<br />
				The second of these is a verb only and means to <em>confuse, 
				discomfort</em> or 
				<em>bewilder</em>.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These learners are sometimes fazed by 
				being asked to provide a spontaneous opinion</em>.<br />
				The verb is informal, best avoided and almost 
				always, incidentally, used in the passive.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>phonetic</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em>
				<strong>phonemic</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>The first of these applies to the study of all human 
				language.&nbsp; The International Phonetic Alphabet contains 107 
				symbols and letters, 31 diacritics and 19 additional signs to indicate 
				sounds which the human voice can produce.&nbsp; You are not 
				likely to be analysing anything with this level of detail.<br />
				What you are interested in is phonemic analysis which applies to 
				only one language, English.&nbsp; To do that, you will need the 
				21 ways of representing the vowels and the 24 consonant symbols.&nbsp; 
				You may need a few bits and pieces such as syllabic consonant 
				markers, the glottal stop and stress marks but that's all.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>plethora</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>does not mean large range; it actually means a larger amount 
				than necessary so if you write, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;There is a plethora of coursebooks on the institution's 
				shelves</em>.<br />
				you are actually saying<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are too many coursebooks on the 
				institution's shelves</em>.<br />
				The word is, incidentally, a mass noun so *<em>there are a plethora</em> is 
				always wrong, whatever you mean.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>pour over</em> and <em>pore over</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The first of these refers to putting ketchup on your chips.&nbsp; 
				The second verb is the one to use in, e.g.,<em> pore over a text </em>
				(<em>study</em>).</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>practice</em> and <em>practise</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>If you are writing in AmE, the only word you need is <em>
				practice</em> as this does service as a noun and a verb.&nbsp; 
				In BrE, on the other hand, the verb is <em>practise</em> and the 
				noun is <em>practice</em>.&nbsp; The same applies to <em>license 
				/ licence</em> but AmE uses the first of these for both 
				grammatical functions.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>principal</em> and <em>principle</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The first means <em>most important</em> and the second 
				refers to <em>a fundamental rule</em>.&nbsp; It is possible, 
				therefore, to have <em>the principal principle</em> to mean <em>
				the most important basic rule</em> (but don't).</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>support, help</em> and <em>scaffolding</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>The term <em>scaffolding</em> is not simply a sophisticated 
				way to mean <em>support</em>.&nbsp; The term derives from 
				Vygotsky, originally, and refers to the stage of learning in 
				which the learner can almost but not quite achieve a task 
				without help.&nbsp; This is the Zone of Proximal Development.&nbsp; 
				The term <em>support</em> is often simply synonymous with <em>
				help</em>.<br />
				There is a 
				<a href="../teaching/scaffolding_zpd.html" target="_blank">guide to 
				scaffolding and the ZPD </a>on this site (new tab).</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>usage</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>is not a more sophisticated way to say <em>use</em>.&nbsp; 
				In language teaching, it refers to formal accuracy rather than 
				communicative use.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Usage will be the target of the first two phases (q.v.) 
				of the lesson and use will be tackled later.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>whose</em> and <em>who's</em></strong></dt>
				<dd><em>whose </em>is the possessive relative pronoun and <em>wh-question</em> word:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose money is that?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's the woman whose house I painted<br />
			who's 
			</em>is the contracted form of <em>who 
			is / who has</em> (and should, therefore, be avoided in formal 
				writing):<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who's lost the money?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who's laughing?</em></dd>

			<p>Jargon may be defined as the use of language specific to a field

			lock out non-professionals from a particular field of enquiry.</p>
			<p>Jargon, or terminology, often represents a specific meaning

			and many others are used in specific ways which differ from how they 
			are used in non-technical domains.&nbsp; Make sure you 
			know what they mean because using them in their everyday instead of technical sense can confuse and irritate the reader.&nbsp; 
			It also reveals that you are ignorant of the specific, technical 
			meaning.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, the overuse of terminology, especially if you 
			fail to define what specific authors mean by the terms you use can 
			be equally frustrating and irritating.</p>
			<p>As has been noted when considering abbreviations (a subset of 
			jargon), you need to define all the terms you use if they would be 
			unfamiliar to someone on a pre-service training course such as 
			CELTA.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">One use of the present perfect progressive 
			less commonly taught at this level is for the iterative aspect 
			(referring to repeated actions) as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<span class="auto-style38">&nbsp;&nbsp; People have been taking a shortcut 
			through my garden to the pub.</span><br />
			In which the tense form is marked (i.e., distinguished from the 
			simple form) to emphasise the repetition of an event.</p>
			<p>Here, the writer has not defined the tense description (because 
			that has already been done in the analysis of form) but has defined 
			the word <em>iterative</em> because this is a technical term 
			unlikely to be familiar to non-specialists and defined <em>marked</em> 
			because the word is being used in a technical sense rather than its 
			everyday one.</p>

			<p>This is not the place to discuss the overall generic structure of 
			your writing.&nbsp; That is covered elsewhere and generally concerns 
			the big picture in terms of information staging and how that differs 
			between, say, an information report and a discussion.<br />
			You should follow the links from the Delta index to discover more 
			about how the 
			overall structure, and with it the coherence of your text, is best 
			achieved.<br />
			You cannot, however, hope that coherent structure will somehow 
			magically evolve from your writing so a few basic rules are 
			important.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Rule 1: Headings, subheadings and relevance</strong></dt>
				<dd>Within any piece of extended academic writing, readers will 
				expect to be able to navigate through the text by following 
				clues that you provide.&nbsp; Most of these will come in the 
				form of headings and subheadings.<br />
				As you write, make sure you use these devices but also keep an 
				eye on the content of the heading and maintain relevance.&nbsp; 
				If you are getting off the topic, perhaps it is time for a new 
				subheading.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Rule 2: Topic sentences</strong></dt>
				<dd>Readers also expect that the first sentence of each 
				paragraph will reflect that paragraph's content.&nbsp; When you 
				come to proofreading your text, check that this is the structure 
				of each paragraph.&nbsp; If it is not, it is time to re-write or 
				rearrange.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Rule 3: Bullets and lists</strong></dt>
				<dd>Use bullet points sparingly and not as a substitute for connected 
			prose.&nbsp; Lists and tables are helpful but you must discuss their 
			content.<br />
				Numbered lists may often imply some kind of prioritisation but 
				bulleted lists do not.&nbsp; However, numbered (or lettered) 
				lists are convenient if you want to make internal referencing 
				because they avoid the need to refer to, say,<em> the fourth 
				bullet point above</em>, or whatever.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Rule 4: Cohesion</strong></dt>
				<dd>Coherence is maintained by a combination of understanding 
				the generic structure that you are aiming for  
				and a combination of Rules 1 and 2.&nbsp; Cohesion is maintained 
				by making sure that conjunctions and conjuncts are used in the 
				way you intend and lead to the connections you want to make.<br />
				As you proofread, keep asking yourself if this is invariably the 
				case.&nbsp; If cause and effect is the link you want to make, 
				for example, are you using structures which allow that to be 
				clear to the reader?&nbsp; If, on the other hand, 
				exemplification is what you want to signal, how have you 
				signposted that?<br />
				Cohesion can be enhanced by careful use of shell nouns (to which 
				there is a guide on the site, linked below).&nbsp; Briefly, 
				shell nouns such as <em>problem, idea, issue, fact, information, 
				difficulty </em>and so on allow you to encapsulate a number of 
				propositions in the shell of the noun.&nbsp; Thereafter, you can 
				simply refer to <em>this</em> or <em>it</em> to direct the 
				reader to all the propositions within the shell.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Rule 5: Get someone else to read your work</strong></dt>
				<dd>When you proofread your own work you may read what you 
				thought you wrote rather than what you actually wrote.&nbsp; 
				Someone else won't.&nbsp; You can simulate this effect by 
				reading your text aloud to yourself.&nbsp; Infelicities, lack of 
				coherence and cohesion and other faults become more apparent 
				that way.</dd>

			<p>Most centres and institutions will have rules about how you need 
			to present your work including the niceties of typefaces, line 
			spacing, margin widths and other requirements.&nbsp; You 
			need, of course, to follow them.<br />
			Even if your institution does not do this, at the very least, insert 
			a header and footer identifying the document and its author and use 
			page numbering.<br />
			For Module Three of the Delta, the following are required and the 
			same sort of presentation should be used for all written work for 
			Module Two as well.</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>2.5 cm. margins all round</li>
				<li>a title page with your identifiers (candidate number and 
				centre number included)</li>
				<li>a contents page</li>
				<li>page numbering throughout</li>
				<li>a footer with your name, candidate number and the title</li>
				<li>no footnotes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Avoid quirky and hard-to-read or childish typefaces such as
			<span class="auto-style24">Comic Sans MS</span> and stick to 
			popular, serious-looking fonts such as <span class="auto-style25">
			Arial</span>, <span class="auto-style26">Tahoma, </span> 
			<span class="auto-style39">Times New Roman</span> or Calibri.</p>
