			<p>If you are just starting out on a Delta programme, you may find 
			some of the internal patois difficult to follow.&nbsp; You may also 
			want to know how the assessment procedures work.<br />
			Here's a guide.</p>
			<hr />
			<h2 class="orangexxlargebold">Terminology</h2>
			<hr />
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>BE</strong></dt>
				<dd>Background Essay for an LSA (q.v.).&nbsp; Each essay must be 
				between 2000 and 2500 words in length.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Delta</strong></dt>
				<dd>Oddly, Delta doesn't stand for anything although its 
				predecessor, DELTA, stood for Diploma in English Language 
				Teaching to Adults.&nbsp; Rightfully, the diploma you are going 
				to get is called the Cambridge English Assessment Diploma in Teaching English to Speakers of 
				Other Languages.<br />
				Recently, someone in the Cambridge, where the ultimate overseers 
				of the scheme work, has decided to re-name the qualification as 
				DELTA.&nbsp; This is nonsense, of course, because it implies 
				that the term is an acronym when it isn't.<br />
				On this site, we'll continue to use the term Delta because we 
				know how to follow the conventions of acronyms and initialisms, 
				but it really doesn't matter all that much.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Delta5a</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is the form filled in by tutors and assessors for 
				feedback / assessment of your teaching assignments (see LSA).&nbsp; All the criteria are 
				graded as Met, Partially met or Not met.&nbsp; Overall grades 
				are awarded as Distinction, Merit, Pass and Fail.&nbsp; Tutors 
				and assessors use exactly the same form.&nbsp;
				<a href="delta_documents/Delta5a.pdf" target="_blank">Click here 
				for a blank example</a>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Delta5b</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is the feedback form for tutors assessing the PDA 
				(q.v.).&nbsp; Individual criteria are not graded and there are 
				only two overall grades: Pass or Fail.&nbsp;
				<a href="delta_documents/Delta5b.pdf" target="_blank">Click here 
				for a blank example</a>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Delta5c</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is the summary form filled in by your centre concerning 
				Module Two only.&nbsp; You have to sign this form.&nbsp;
				<a href="delta_documents/Delta5c.pdf" target="_blank">Click here 
				for a blank example</a>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Diagnostic lesson</strong></dt>
				<dd>See Unassessed lesson.</dd>
				<dt><strong>EA</strong></dt>
				<dd>This has two meanings:<br />
				External Assessment: this is the name given to the externally 
				assessed LSA (q.v.).<br />
				External Assessor: this is the Cambridge-appointed person who 
				carries out the EA and fills in a Delta5a (q.v.) on your work.</dd>
				<dt><strong>ELTM</strong></dt>
				<dd>Stands for English Language Teaching Management.&nbsp; You 
				can select to focus on this for Module Three or choose a 
				specialism (q.v.).</dd>
				<dt><strong>EP</strong></dt>
				<dd>The Experimental Practice part of the PDA (q.v.).</dd>
				<dt><strong>LA</strong></dt>
				<dd>Language Analysis.</dd>
				<dt><strong>LP</strong></dt>
				<dd>Lesson Plan for an LSA (q.v.).</dd>
				<dt><strong>LSA</strong></dt>
				<dd>Language Systems or Language Skills Assignment.&nbsp; You do 
				four of these.&nbsp; Three are internally assessed and one is 
				externally assessed.&nbsp; They are numbered 1-4 and each 
				consists of two parts:<br />
				The Background Essay of between 2000 and 2500 words<br />
				The Plan, the Lesson and the post-lesson Reflection and 
				Evaluation.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Moderation</strong></dt>
				<dd>This applies to Module Two.&nbsp; When the Delta5a (q.v.), 
				the Delta5c (q.v.) and the paperwork from one of your LSAs 
				(q.v.) arrive in Cambridge, this is what happens.&nbsp; The 
				paperwork is inspected to ensure that the correct result is 
				issued.&nbsp; See below under Systems.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Module</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is the name given to each part of the Delta scheme.&nbsp; 
				You have to pass all three before using the letters after your 
				name or claiming to possess a Delta Diploma.&nbsp; For more, see
				<a href="delta_overview.html">the Delta overview</a>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>PDA</strong></dt>
				<dd><strong>Professional Development Assignment</strong>.&nbsp; 
				This is part of Module Two.&nbsp; You must complete this assignment before your portfolio can be 
				submitted but you can pass Module Two even if you do not pass 
				this assignment.&nbsp; It comes in two parts:<br />
				Part A: a four-stage <strong>Reflection and Action</strong> element.&nbsp; Here 
				you reflect on your teaching, make an action plan and try to 
				improve where you need to.<br />
				Overall, for Part A, you write between 2000 and 2500 words (not 
				including the paperwork for the unassessed, diagnostic lesson).<br />
				Part B: the <strong>Experimental Practice Assignment</strong> where you research, 
				plan, teach and reflect on a lesson using materials, approaches 
				or techniques wholly new to you.<br />
				For this part, you write between 1500 and 2000 words (not 
				including the Lesson Outline or any materials).</dd>
				<dt><strong>PLE</strong></dt>
				<dd>The old term for the R &amp; E (q.v.)&nbsp; It stands for 
				Post-Lesson Evaluation.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Portfolio</strong></dt>
				<dd>For Module Two, this refers to all the internal coursework.&nbsp; 
				Some of this is sent to Cambridge, some may be required by 
				Cambridge.&nbsp; See systems, below, for more.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Referral</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is Cambridge's slightly coy term for a Fail.&nbsp; It's 
				called referral because you can try again.&nbsp; If you run out 
				of chances to try again, then the grade recorded is Fail.</dd>
				<dt><strong>R &amp; A</strong></dt>
				<dd>This means Reflection and Action and should not be confused 
				with R &amp; E (q.v.).&nbsp; It refers to the PDA (q.v.) Part A, 
				stages 1-4.</dd>
				<dt><strong>R &amp; E</strong></dt>
				<dd>The post-lesson Reflection and Evaluation part of an LSA 
				(q.v.).&nbsp; This used to be called a Post-Lesson Evaluation (PLE) 
				and some terribly old or old-fashioned tutors may still refer to 
				it that way.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Specialism</strong></dt>
				<dd>Module Three of the scheme requires you either to select to 
				focus on ELTM (English Language Teaching Management) or to 
				select from a range of possible subjects as a specialism.&nbsp; 
				For more, go to <a href="mod3/elts/m3_topic_choice.html">the guide to 
				choosing your Module Three topic</a>.<br />
				The assignment is a written essay, externally marked, of between 
				4000 and 4500 words.&nbsp; It must be submitted electronically 
				and may not exceed 10MB.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Unassessed lesson</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is also known as a diagnostic lesson.&nbsp; It forms 
				part Stage 1 of Part A of the PDA (q.v.) and is designed to allow you 
				and your tutors to identify suitable topics for the rest of the 
				Part A of the PDA.&nbsp; Centres will vary in what is required 
				of you for this.<br />
				It is not advisable to use <strong>only</strong> the data arising from this 
				lesson to select areas for development.<br />
				The lesson is unassessed but not unobserved.</dd>

			<h2>Module One: the examination</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This Module is about
					<em>Understanding language, methodology and resources for 
					teaching</em></p>
			<p>Module One is assessed <em>via</em> two, 90-minute written examinations 
			taken on the same day and separated by a half-hour breather.&nbsp; 
			The examination is normally taken at the centre where you took a 
			course but can be taken at any authorised Cambridge Examination 
			Centre.</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>To gain a Pass, you should score above 
				100 marks over both papers (i.e., 50%)</li>
				<li>To gain a Merit, you should score 
				above 130 marks over both papers (i.e., 65%)</li>
				<li>To gain a Distinction, you should 
				score above 150 marks over both papers (i.e., 75%)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These figures are approximate because grade boundaries for each 
			examination are set at grading meeting in Cambridge and may vary 
			slightly.</p>
			<p>Assessment looks like this:</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This Module is about
					<em>Developing professional practice</em></p>
			<h4>There is a combination of internal and external assessment.</h4>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>Three LSAs are internally assessed.&nbsp; 
				Double marking is normally carried 
				out between tutors.</li>
				<li>One LSA, normally the fourth, must be 
				externally assessed by a Cambridge approved assessor.&nbsp; The 
				results of that are sent directly to Cambridge and not discussed 
				with the centre (or you).</li>
				<li>Assessors do not discuss any 
				candidate's performance on the course with centres and are 
				unaware of the grades for assignments that have been awarded 
				internally.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>What is considered by Cambridge moderators for Module Two?</h4>
			<p>Your centre sends the following documents to Cambridge to help 
			the Moderators make decisions concerning the grade you are awarded:</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>One complete Language Systems or Language Skills assignment, 
				including the Background Essay, the Lesson Plan and the 
				Reflection and Evaluation along with the completed feedback form 
				(the Delta5a).<br />
				This is normally the best of your assignments but: <strong>if 
				the externally assessed LSA is systems focused, the submitted 
				internally assessed LSA must be a skills focused assignment, and
				<em>vice versa</em></strong>.</li>
				<li>The completed feedback forms (Delta5as) for the other two 
				internally assessed assignments.</li>
				<li>The Delta5c form which is summary of your performance on the 
				course so the Moderators can check that you have adhered to the 
				regulations regarding the mix of assignment focuses and so on.&nbsp; 
				You may ask to see what the centre writes about you on this 
				form.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All documents submitted to Cambridge are checked for plagiarism 
			or collusion.&nbsp; The checks are very thorough.</p>
			<p>In addition, the Moderators have before them the External 
			Assessor's completed Delta5a along with the Background Essay, the 
			Lesson Plan and the Reflection and Evaluation that you submitted for 
			the external assessment.<br />
			The process is as thorough, fair and objective as it can be.</p>
			<h4>Requirements for grades.&nbsp; For all of what follows, there 
			are two<strong> important provisos</strong>.</h4>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>You must complete all the coursework</li>
				<li>You must pass one complete language systems or language 
				skills assignment</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You cannot have your portfolio submitted to Cambridge if you do not 
			meet these requirements.<br />
			Both your internal work and the external assessment contribute to 
			your final grade.</p>
			<p>If your centre sends 
			a skills assignment to Cambridge, the externally assessed lesson 
			must be systems focused and <em>vice versa</em>.<br />
			If you undertake two skills assignments 
			internally, you must focus on systems for the externally assessed 
			lesson and <em>vice versa</em>.<br />
			In effect, this means you have to pass both parts of one 
			systems-based assignment and both parts of one skills-based 
			assignment to be considered for a pass in Module Two.</p>
			<p>The implications are:</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>If you want to focus on systems in the externally assessed 
			assignment you need to do one systems-focused assignment only which 
			is assessed internally during the course.&nbsp; The other two 
			internally assessed assignments must be skills focused.</li>
				<li>If you want to focus on skills in the externally assessed assignment 
			you need to do one skills-focused assignment only which is assessed 
			internally during the course.&nbsp; The other two internally 
			assessed assignments must be systems focused.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Grades are awarded like this:</h4>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>To gain a Pass grade</strong>, you need:</dt>
				<dd><ul class="deltabluebullet">
					<li >a Pass grade in both parts of one internally assessed 
					assignment which is sent to Cambridge</li>
					<li >a Pass grade in both parts of the externally assessed 
					assignment</li>
					<li >to complete but not necessarily pass the Professional 
					Development Assignment</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>To gain a Merit grade</strong>, you need:</dt>
				<dd><ul class="deltabluebullet">
					<li>a minimum of a Pass grade for the 
					Background Essay of the assignment which is sent to 
					Cambridge</li>
					<li>a Merit grade for one internally 
					assessed Planning, Teaching and Reflection and Evaluation</li>
					<li>three further Pass grades awarded 
					internally</li>
					<li>a Pass or Merit grade for the 
					Planning, Teaching and Reflection and Evaluation of the 
					assignment which is sent to Cambridge</li>
					<li>a Pass grade for the externally 
					assessed Background Essay</li>
					<li>a Merit grade for the externally 
					assessed Planning, Teaching and Reflection and Evaluation</li>
					<li>a Pass in the Professional 
					Development Assignment</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>To gain a Distinction grade</strong>, you need:</dt>
				<dd><ul class="deltabluebullet">
					<li>at least two Merit or Distinction 
					grades and two Pass grades in the internal coursework</li>
					<li>a minimum of a Pass grade for the 
					Background Essay of the assignment which is sent to 
					Cambridge</li>
					<li>a Merit or Distinction grade for 
					the Planning, Teaching and Reflection and Evaluation of the 
					assignment which is sent to Cambridge</li>
					<li>a minimum of a Pass grade for the 
					externally assessed Background Essay</li>
					<li>a Distinction grade for the
