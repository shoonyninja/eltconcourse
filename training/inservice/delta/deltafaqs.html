			<p>In the UK, the office of Qualifications and Examinations

			It is at the same level, therefore, as a Master's degree.</p>

			<p>You only have to take a recognised course at an authorised centre for Module Two (which has a combination of internal and 
			external assessment).<br />
			For Modules One and Three, there is no requirement to take a course.<br />
			There is a preparation course and lots of revision materials for 
			Delta Module One on this site as well as advice concerning how to 
			submit Module Three.&nbsp; Links are from <a href="deltaindex.html">
			the Delta Index</a>.</p>

			<p>There are no explicit entry requirements, although some centres

			Centres which impose entry requirements usually require an initial 
			teaching qualification (such as CELTA), a certain amount of 
			background teaching experience (often around 1200 hours or a year's 
			full-time teaching) and some 
			may require a first degree.<br />
			Some centres may also impose English language proficiency 
			requirements, especially concerning the ability to write clearly in 
			appropriate academic style.&nbsp; The usual minimum language 
			qualification is between or above levels C1 and C2 of the Common European Framework.</p>

			<p>Regrettably, Delta has become much like any other commodity.&nbsp; 
			You get, if you are careful and fortunate, what you pay for.&nbsp; 
			There are many dedicated, well-informed and able tutors who will 
			work hard to help you succeed and a few of the other sort, too.&nbsp; 
			Most organisations who offer Delta courses are doing it to make a 
			profit.&nbsp; If you appreciate that, you can approach the choices 
			with a suitably sceptical attitude.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Trust nobody who calls the qualification DELTA instead of 
				Delta.&nbsp; It hasn't been called DELTA for over a decade so 
				anyone still using the old upper-case letters for it is simply 
				sloppy or not paying attention.</li>
				<li>Do not trust a centre which only offers Module One and 
				Three.&nbsp; They know, and so do you now, that you don't need 
				to do a course at all for these modules and there is <strong>no</strong> 
				oversight from Cambridge regarding the tutors or the content of 
				courses ostensibly preparing for Modules One or Three.&nbsp; It 
				is, however, a good way for some organisations to make a few 
				pennies (yours, in this case).</li>
				<li>A centre that can't also offer preparation for Module Two 
				may not have properly qualified tutors (that's why it isn't 
				accredited to run a course for Module Two).<br />
				This is not to say that there aren't good courses out there for 
				Modules One and Three, just that there are more of the other 
				sort.</li>
				<li>Delta is a Master's degree level qualification.&nbsp; You 
				will be wise to check that the tutors a centre employs are up to 
				the demands of teaching at that level.&nbsp; Be aware that 
				Cambridge do not have minimum qualifications for tutors and some 
				are more able and more qualified than others.</li>
				<li>Be deeply sceptical of any centre that won't give you 
				specific details about their pass rates.&nbsp; Pass rates may 
				not be a precise guide to quality but it's the best measure you 
				have.<br />
				Low pass rates may mean<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>that a centre is so desperate to recruit people (and 
					take their money) that they are taking people on to a course 
					who have no realistic chance of passing or</li>
					<li>that the centre has poor, ill-informed tutors who are 
					not giving people proper advice and not planning a course in 
					a way that allows you the opportunity to build on and 
					develop your knowledge and skills or</li>
					<li>both.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Never trust a centre that does not interview properly or 
				give you a pre-interview task to complete that really tests you.&nbsp; 
				If they can't also present you with a proper contract setting 
				out the centre's and your responsibilities, walk away.</li>
				<li>Delta courses are expensive and you need to buy the best 
				quality you can get.&nbsp; The cheaper a course is, the less 
				likely the centre will be able (or willing) to invest in high 
				quality tutors and decent reference resources and so on.&nbsp; 
				You are not buying a cheese sandwich.</li>
