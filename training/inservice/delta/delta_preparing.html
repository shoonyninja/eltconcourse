			<h1>Be prepared for<span class="auto-style1"> </span>

			<p>
			<img alt="prepared" height="207" src="../../images/three_scouts310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>So, you've signed up to do a Delta course with a centre of your 
			choice (or, wisely, you are going to follow the Module One course on 
			this site and then follow the recommended study and writing route 
			for Module Three).<br />
			Now what?<br />
			Many centres will give you some pre-course reading and writing to do 
			and that usually has two purposes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To get you acquainted with the conventional style and 
				presentation formats of Delta written work</li>
				<li>To start you on the road to some serious skills and systems 
				analysis by reading some important texts</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You will, of course, do as the centre requires and complete those 
			tasks.</p>
			<p>There is a sister guide to this one which considered not what you 
			have to <strong>know</strong> but what you will be asked to <strong>
			do</strong> in terms of exercising cognitive powers.<br />
			If you would like to open that guide in a new tab,
			<a class="deltahighlightlink" href="delta_study_skills.html">click 
			here</a>.</p>
			<p>This guide is different because it seeks to acquaint you 
			with the broad outlines of some key concepts that you will encounter 
			on the course.&nbsp; That way, you will be able to recognise what it is 
			that your tutors are talking about or that you are being asked to 
			read about and set the ideas and issues in some kind of context.</p>
			<p>We will cover the areas under four main headings:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Learning</li>
				<li>Teaching</li>
				<li>Language</li>
				<li>Skills</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and within each section, we'll give you links to other guides on 
			this site where you can find out more, sometimes much more.<br />
			It is not necessary to follow them unless your curiosity drives you 
			there but you may like to return later to do things in a bit more 
			depth.</p>

			<p>It's unlikely that you encountered much on any course you have 
			taken before Delta (such as CELTA or the Trinity Cert. TESOL) about 
			learning theory and, unless you have been very conscientious, you 
			won't have encountered much since then.<br />
			However, it is arguable that unless we know something about 
			the possible ways people learn second or other languages, it is very 
			difficult to claim to be professional practitioners in the field and 
			even more difficult to design and deliver lessons in a principled 
			manner.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, nobody really knows how people learn although some 
			claim to know.<br />
			There are, however, some theories and hypotheses which are more or 
			less persuasive.&nbsp; They can't all be right and it is very 
			probable that they are all more or less wrong but it's the best we 
			can do for now.<br />
			We'll take the theories first and then turn the focus onto some of 
			the main hypotheses about language learning.</p>

					<h3>Theory 1: Behaviourism<br />
					Using and learning language is just like all other behaviour</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It was a chap called Skinner who famously pronounced that:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">We have no reason to assume ... that verbal 
			behaviour differs in any fundamental respect from non-verbal 
			behaviour, or that any new principles must be invoked to account for 
			it.<br />
			<span class="auto-style4">BF Skinner, Verbal Behaviour, 1957</span></p>
			<p>The theory contends that learning a language is the same as 
			learning any other behaviour.&nbsp; We do it by trial and error or 
			by practice and when we succeed the behaviour is reinforced and when 
			we fail that behaviour gets discarded.<br />
			For example, if you want to learn to ride a bicycle, the only sure 
			way to do it is to get on the bicycle and try.&nbsp; If you fall 
			off, you get back on and try something slightly different (how you 
			sit, how fast you go etc.) until you discover how to do it properly.<br />
			The theory behind this is that given the stimulus (the bicycle in 
			this case), you respond by getting on and trying to move it forwards 
			by pedalling.&nbsp; When you fall off and hurt yourself that 
			constitutes a sort of punishment but when you succeed in pedalling a 
			few meters, that constitutes a reward.&nbsp; Successful behaviour, 
			which is rewarded, is likely to be repeated.&nbsp; Unsuccessful 
			behaviour, which is not rewarded or is even punished, will not be 
			repeated.<br />
			So it is with language learning.&nbsp; When a learner says something 
			which is wrong, the teacher frowns or complains (punishment is not 
			usually considered appropriate) but when the learner says something 
			right and well-formed, the teacher praises and the learner receives 
			a warm glow of success.<br />
			Reinforcement is the important issue because from a behaviourist 
			point of view, the strength of the habit which is instilled is 
			directly related to the strength of the reinforcement that is 
			provided.<br />
			Enough repetitions of the stimulus &rarr; response â†’ reinforcement 
			cycle will see the behaviour become habitual and carried out 
			unconsciously (just as an expert cyclist does not have to think 
			about the action of cycling).</p>

					analysis</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In the same year that Skinner publish Verbal Behaviour, Noam 
			Chomsky published Syntactic Structures in which he pronounced:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Language is not a habit structure.&nbsp; 
			Ordinary linguistic behaviour characteristically involves 
			innovation, formation of new sentences and patterns in accordance 
			with rules of great abstractness and intricacy.<br />
			<span class="auto-style4">Syntactic Structures (1957)</span><br />
			</p>
			<p>which is, of course, the opposite point of view.&nbsp; <strong>
			<em>They cannot both be right</em></strong>.</p>
			<p>Chomsky was not, in fact, particularly interested in how people 
			learn a foreign language.&nbsp; His concern was much more with how 
			people acquire their first language(s) and with discovering and 
			elucidating the <span class="style_black"><em>rules of great 
			abstractness and intricacy</em></span> and figuring out how they are 
			acquired at a very early age.<br />
			Following on from the criticisms of behaviourist theory a host of 
			other ideas have been proposed concerning just how people learn a 
			foreign language of which three are important hypotheses in the 
			field of English Language Teaching.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Active construction of grammar rules<br />
				This hypothesis proposes that learners are actively constructing 
				rules from the data they encounter so, for example, having noted 
				that the plural of a noun in English is formed by adding -<em>s</em> 
				or -<em>es</em> to the base form, will correctly produce <em>
				cars, papers, tables, chairs </em>and thousands of other forms 
				until they bump into a noun like <em>mouse</em> when the rule 
				breaks down.&nbsp; Then the learner has to amend the rule to 
				take account of the exceptions and carry on.</li>
				<li>Connectionism<br />
				This proposes not that people make rules but that they work on 
				statistical probability and assume, therefore that because all 
				the verbs they have so far encountered, ones spelled like <em>
				ring, sing, sink</em> and so on make a change to the vowel in 
				the past tense producing <em>rang, sang</em> and <em>sank</em> 
				other verbs will follow a similar pattern.&nbsp; 
				Moreover, the learner has also encountered the past participles 
				of these verbs as in <em>rung, sung </em>and <em>sunk.&nbsp;
				</em>Now, instead of applying a rule and making the past tense 
				of <em>fling</em> and <em>flinged, </em>a learner may, on the 
				basis of some statistical likelihood prefer to guess at <em>
				flang, flung</em> and, as we see, will be only half right.&nbsp; 
				However, the important point is that people do not necessarily 
				apply rules, they apply statistical reasoning.&nbsp; In other 
				words learners do not ask:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which rule 
				should I apply here?</em></span><br />
				but:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the 
				likelihood that this item will be correct, given the evidence I 
				have?</em></span><br />
				The <em>connect</em> in <em>connectionism</em> refers to the 
				hypothesis that people make new neural connections in their 
				brains when they encounter new data and facts about the language 
				they are learning and these connections are not to rules but to 
				structures which are similar.</li>
				<li>Social interactionism<br />
				This hypothesis seeks to explain how people learn the rules of 
				appropriacy and style and the claim is that we learn language by 
				interacting with others in meaningful contexts.&nbsp; In other 
				words, we respond to the reactions of others and alter what we 
				say and develop our sensitivity to what it is appropriate to 
				say.<br />
				This theory of learning lies at the heart of communicative 
				language teaching of which a little more later.</li>

			<p>It is not surprising that the opposing theories of how people

			<p>Structural linguistics starts from an understanding of language 
			as a hierarchical system of items: phonemes, morphemes, words, 
			phrases, clauses, sentences.&nbsp; This, allied to a behaviourist 
			understanding of learning, led to the development of 
			audio-lingualism and some subcategories of it such as situational 
			language teaching (a peculiarly British invention) audio-visual 
			teaching and so on.&nbsp; There are two strands:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The syllabus must be structurally ordered in terms of rising 
				levels of difficulty from small units up to larger ones.</li>
				<li>Teaching consists mostly of hearing and repeating and 
				repetition drills to make the language an automatic habit.</li>

					<h3>Methodological approach 2: Functional / Communicative

					Language is a system of meanings and learning is a cognitive

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>These twin understandings underlie a wide range of classroom 
			approaches but what they all have in common is that language is seen 
			primarily as a way of making meaning so the focus is on the message, 
			not how accurately it is conveyed (providing it is comprehensible).<br />
			Allied to this understanding is a perception of the need to allow 
			learners to experiment with and use language for real (or simulated) 
			communication.&nbsp; The hypothesis is that learning will take place 
			in the struggle to communicate.<br />
			Communicative approaches are not without their critics.</p>
			<p>Other hypotheses about effective classroom procedures and 
			techniques which draw on one or both of these underlying theories 
			about teaching include:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Noticing: the gap and the language</li>
				<li>Inferring meaning: from reading and listening</li>
				<li>Deductive and inductive learning: in task design</li>
				<li>The Zone of Proximal Development and scaffolding learners' 
				efforts</li>
				<li>Drilling</li>
				<li>Interlanguage and the role of error</li>

			<p>Learning to analyse language in a way that keeps you a lot more 
			than one step ahead of your learners is something that people on 
			Delta courses find quite challenging.&nbsp; There are two ways to go

			<p>This involves focusing on a particular structure or relationship 
			between words and phrases and analysing the form first before

			so on work) and on the phonological features (such as the weakened 
			form of the word <em>if</em> in most spoken language) and so on.&nbsp; 
			Only later, in this kind of analysis will consideration be given to 
			what communicative significance the forms can carry (contingency, 
			threat, regret etc.).<br />
			It might also concern, for example, the consideration of the 
			multiple meanings of a verb such as <em>could</em> and the

			many other ways including a range of conjunctions, nouns like, <em>
			dependency</em> and <em>provision</em>, adverbials such as <em>in

			In terms of modality, such an analysis might start from 
			considerations of expressions of truth, impossibility and likelihood 
			(epistemic modality) and then consider what structures at what 
			levels should be taught to help people express these meanings.&nbsp; 
			Those structures might include modal auxiliary or semi-auxiliary

			</table>
			<p>If you take a processing approach to skills work on, 
			particularly, Delta Module Two, you will probably be accused of not 
			analysing the skill properly in an essay and not making the ways we 
			process texts explicit in the classroom.&nbsp; Both those criticisms 
			have significant flaws but now is not the time to be arguing with 
			the scheme.&nbsp; You can do that after you have passed all the 
			modules.<br />
			Taking a processing approach, means analysing two ways of 
			approaching a text:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Top down<br />
				<img alt="down" height="50" src="../../../gfx/down_arrow50.gif" width="30" /><br />
				This involves using our knowledge of the type of text we are 
				reading, the intentions of the writer / speaker and the Context 
				of Situation.<br />
				The Context of Situation is a hypothesis developed by Halliday 
				and other systemic functional linguists and is particularly 
				important in the both the comprehension of texts and their 
				production.&nbsp; In essence, it consists of:<ol class="auto-style5">
					<li>The Field<ol class="greenbullet">
						<li>what is being spoken or written about?</li>
						<li>what are the intentions and aims of the 
						participants?</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>The Tenor<ol class="greenbullet">
						<li>who are the participants?</li>
						<li>what is the relationship between speaker and hearer 
						or writer and reader?</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Mode<ol class="greenbullet">
						<li>how is the text transmitted (written, texted, 
						recorded, emailed, broadcast etc.)?</li>
						<li>how is cohesion maintained?</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Bottom up<br />
				<img alt="up" height="50" src="../../../gfx/up_arrow50.gif" width="31" /><br />
				This involves using our knowledge of the pronunciation, the lexicon, 
				syntax and other forms of the language to understand and build 
				texts.&nbsp; If, for example, if we are listening to someone, we 
				may be actively analysing the sounds they produce and the syntax 
				they use to understand the meaning of what we hear.&nbsp; We may 
				also process a written text in the same way, especially if 
				extracting almost all the meaning is important but in this case 
				we will use our knowledge of spelling and orthography instead of 
				phonemic knowledge.<br />
				We can, of course, use the same knowledge to produce a 
				well-written text or a coherent stretch of spoken discourse.</li>

			<p>It is, naturally, common to apply both approaches to skills 
			analysis just as good readers, writers, listeners and speakers apply 
			a range of top-down and bottom up skills to the comprehension and 
			production of texts.&nbsp; It is the mix that is important and we 
			should not try to place all the strategies and approaches in 
			watertight boxes.</p>
