			<p>
			The Delta qualification is so important to so many people's careers 
			in ELT that a number of mythologies have grown up around it and its 
			assessment.</p>
			<p>
			None is true &ndash; that's the meaning of a myth.&nbsp; Here are 
			the ten most popular.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

			Myth #1: The pass rate for Delta is very low</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			Actually, it is variable from centre to centre and across the 
			Modules.&nbsp; The arithmetic gets quite complicated because there 
			are three Modules (so three ways to fail) and each Module is 
			differently assessed.<br />
			The following is based on figures for 
			2017 but they are pretty much the same year on year.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Module One</dt>
				<dd>
				<ul class="deltabluebullet">
					<li>is assessed by an examination which has a fairly objective 
				external marking system</li>
					<li>the worldwide pass rate is around 70%</li>
					<li>the 30% who don't pass includes some who shouldn't really be 
				taking the examination (you don't have to do a course to enter) 
				and some who try again and again without getting any better or 
				doing the necessary work</li>
					<li>some centres consistently get around 100% success rates and many 
				candidates who don't succeed the first time will re-take 
				successfully</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt>Module Two</dt>
				<dd>
				<ul class="deltabluebullet">
					<li>is assessed by a combination of internal and external 
				assessments and is probably the least objectively marked of all 
				the Modules (although great efforts are made and no little 
				expense incurred trying to make it as standardised and objective 
				as possible)</li>
					<li>the worldwide pass rate is around 80% and, again, many centres 
				consistently do better than that</li>
					<li>re-take pass rates are very good</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt>Module Three</dt>
				<dd>
				<ul class="deltabluebullet">
					<li>is externally marked, again pretty objectively, against a 
				clear set of criteria (which are explained on this site)</li>
					<li>the worldwide pass rate is around 80% and some centres do even 
				better</li>
					<li>again, remember that you don't have to follow a course to enter 
				for this Module so the failures will include some people who are 
				very poorly prepared</li>
					<li>re-take pass rates are good as you can see from the table below</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>(For more on the details of how each module is assessed, see
			<a href="delta_terminology-systems.html" target="_blank">the guide to Delta systems 
			and terminology</a> (new tab)).</p>

			each Module.<br />

			<p>Clearly, if you look at the pass rates for people who pass all 
			three Modules at the same time, these figures will fall but, 
			overall, those aren't too bad odds.<br />
			The Module with the highest fail rate (over one third) is Module 
			One, which is one reason only why there is

			<p>
			There is no such thing as a Delta methodology.&nbsp; Really, there

			There are, however, a number of sensible and predictable things to

			<ol>
				<li>Read the criteria.&nbsp; It is your responsibility to plan a 
				lesson in such a way that you can demonstrate that you can 
				fulfil the teaching criteria.&nbsp; (For more, see
				<a href="mod2/meeting_delta_teaching_criteria/meeting_delta_criteria_index.html" target="_blank">the guide to meeting the teaching criteria</a> 
				(new tab)).</li>
				<li>There is an implicit understanding that you will teach in a 
				way that enhances your students' abilities to communicate 
				accurately and appropriately.&nbsp; If that is not your aim, 
				what is?</li>
				<li>There is ample opportunity in your lesson Commentary to 
				explain clearly why you are teaching the way you are.&nbsp; 
				Providing it is appropriate and properly rationalised, you will 
				not be penalised for any approach you take.</li>
				<li>The Cambridge Handbook explicitly states:</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style14"><span class="style_black"><em>The syllabus establishes a 
				structure within which candidates can develop awareness, 
				understanding and skills appropriate to working with a wide 
				range of learners in a variety of contexts.&nbsp; <strong>It does not

				teaching.</strong></em></span><br /><span class="auto-style13">(Cambridge English Delta, Handbook

			Module One is subtitled
					<em>Understanding language, methodology and resources for

			'using' or 'applying'.&nbsp; The examination is a test of your background knowledge, 
			not a test of your ability to apply it in the classroom.<br />

			<p>No.&nbsp; Assessors and centres are explicitly forbidden from

			very serious consequences indeed and people simply won't do it.<br />
			It's worth adding that external assessors see none of your 
			internally assessed work before or after your external assessment.&nbsp; 
			External assessors also do not see the centre's summary report on 
			your coursework or any other internal records.&nbsp; Only Cambridge moderators see the whole picture.</p>

			<p>Not always true.&nbsp; Of course it is important to do well in the external assessment.<br />
			Normally, as the regulations state, you have to pass both parts of

			a number of occasions when people have convincingly demonstrated 
			consistent strengths in the areas singled out by the external 
			assessor as serious weaknesses.&nbsp; In these cases a pass overall 
			may be awarded.<br />
			Note, however, that the evidence must be <strong>consistent and

			<p>In addition to the above, one unfortunate characteristic of a lot

			If you are told or perceive that an <em>a priori </em>assumption is 
			being made that certain things are true, you need to take a breath 
			and apply a little sceptical thought, whatever your tutors may say.<br />
			A short list will include:</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>Communicative Language Teaching is a superior approach</li>
				<li>People have different learning styles to which we should 
				cater</li>
				<li>Teacher Talking Time is a Bad Thing</li>
				<li>New language should be drilled</li>
				<li>Pair- and group-work is beneficial</li>
				<li>Translation and translating dictionaries are bad</li>
				<li>A focus on grammatical and pronunciation accuracy is

				<li>Guided discovery and/or inductive learning is to be
