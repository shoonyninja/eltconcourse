				<td class="auto-style4"><span class="style_black">Clearly</span>, 
				there is a distinction between <em>I'm going to go to London</em> 
				and <em>I'm going to London</em> (<span class="style_black">continuous 
				tense</span>) but for <span class="style_black">Germans</span> 
				who don't use a progressive, it is <span class="style_black">
				invariably</span> unclear.&nbsp; The <span class="style_black">
				usage</span> of the first is to express intention and the second 
				to indicate an arranged event.&nbsp; I have found that pictures 
				and charts clarify the concepts and are especially appealing to
				<span class="style_black">visual learners</span>.&nbsp; I recently 
				taught a difficult class containing a mix of young Taiwanese 
				girls (who were, <span class="style_black">of course</span>, shy 
				and reluctant to speak) and some <span class="style_black">
				typically</span> vocal and forthcoming Spanish young men.&nbsp; 
				For the former, in particular, the visual element was useful but 
				the latter needed to set the language in context and use it to 
				communicate.<br />
				<span class="style_black">Naturally, it doesn't materially 
				affect the meaning</span> if one says, <em>I am going to London

				am going to London.</em>&nbsp; It is important, however, to note 
				that the forms are <span class="style_black">only ever used
				</span>with <span class="style_black">dynamic, progressive verbs</span> 
				and it is <span class="style_black">never</span> possible to say
				<em>I am thinking, he will be thinking, he's going to be thinking
				</em>etc. to refer to the future.</td>

		<ol id="list" style="visibility:hidden">
			<li><strong>Clearly, Obviously, Certainly, rightly, unarguably, 
			definitely</strong> etc.<br />
			Adding adverbials like these just invites the reader to disagree 
			with you.&nbsp; It can also make you sound arrogant and opinionated.<br />
			Here are two (real) examples:<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Ellis rightly points out that 
				...<br />
				</em></span>This makes you sound as if you are more of an 
				authority than the writer and in a position to evaluate the 
				writer's work.&nbsp; You aren't; you are supposed to be using 
				the writer's work as authority for <strong>your</strong> work, 
				not the other way around.<br />
				If you want to make your view clear, couch it in terms like:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>I agree with the point that Ellis 
				(date: page) makes when he asserts ...</em></span></li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Clearly, students are 
				unaccustomed to dealing with weak forms.<br />
				</em></span>Your students may be but many are not.&nbsp; 
				Sweeping generalisations like this (with the added challenge to 
				the reader to think of all the times you are wrong) will not 
				help.<br />
				Soften your assertions with something like:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>It is arguable that many learners ...<br />
				In my experience, it is often the case that ... </em></span>etc.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>always, never, invariably</strong> etc.<br />
			Before you assert that something is invariably true, you need to 
			think long and hard.&nbsp; All languages are littered with 
			exceptions and irregular forms and speakers often distort the 
			conventional grammar to suit their meanings.<br />
			Assertions of this sort don't have to include an adverb.&nbsp; 
			Just using the present simple is enough to imply that something is 
			invariably true so soften what you say with something like <em>
			almost, usually, often </em>etc.<br />
			Asserting that something is always or never true invites the 
			reader to think of a counter example.</li>
			<li><strong>My students are / Maria is / most of the group is / this 
			material will appeal to visual learners</strong> etc.<br />
			There are two problems with uncritical statements like those:<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li>Learning styles theories are just that &ndash; theories.&nbsp; 
				They are controversial and not without severe and eminent 
				critics.&nbsp; Theorists in the area also disagree among 
				themselves.</li>
				<li>Even if you accept the validity of any of the theories 
				(multiple intelligences, VARK etc.) the theorists will tell you 
				that there is no such thing as <span class="style_black"><em>a 
				visual learner, an activist, a person of musical intelligence</em></span> 
				etc.&nbsp; It is the <strong>proportions</strong> of various 
				styles or intelligences that make up an individual's profile 
				that matter and everyone has a mix of these.<br />
				For more, go to <a href="../background/learningstyles.html">the 
				guide to learning styles</a>.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Asian / European / Russian / German etc. learners often 
			produce + error ...</strong><br />
			Nationality, much less continental provenance, is not a good way of 
			trying to categorise learners or their languages.&nbsp; If, by 
			'<em>Asian learners</em>', for example, you mean those with particular 
			languages, then say so and exemplify what you mean.&nbsp; Asia 
			covers all the territory from the Urals to Japan and Northern 
			Siberia to Sri Lanka and Indonesia.&nbsp; That's over 4.4 billion 
			people and something like 2000 different languages.&nbsp; Europe is 
			also very populous and home to 250 or so languages.&nbsp; The 
			Russian Federation alone has over 30 official languages (depending 
			on region) and another 100 or so minority languages, many of which 
			bear no relation at all to Russian.&nbsp; There is some doubt 
			whether any country on earth is actually monolingual whatever the 
			official line may be.<br />
			To avoid making silly statements like these, use the formulation
			<span class="style_black"><em>speakers of ...</em></span> and 
			exemplify what you mean.</li>
			<li><strong>Stereotyping<br />
			</strong>Not all Japanese girls are quiet and shy, not all male, 
			Italian teenagers are talkative and forthcoming and so on.&nbsp; 
			Casual, thoughtless national stereotyping has no place in our 
			profession.</li>
			<li><strong>Ordering of elements in sentences doesn't affect meaning</strong><br />
			It most certainly does.&nbsp; There are good reasons why you might 
			prefer to say<br />
			<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did the shopping after I had 
			finished the work</span><br />
			</em>rather than<em><br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I did the shopping I had finished 
			the work</span><br />
			</em>or<em><br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had finished the work before I did the 
			shopping</span><br />
			</em>Equally,<em><br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ball was kicked by the girl</span><br />
			</em>is not the same as<br />
			<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl kicked the ball</span><br />
			</em>and<em><br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to come, I'll give you a lift</span><br />
			</em>is not the same as<em><br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll give you a lift if you want to come</span></em>.<br />
			Speakers fit the grammar and form to the meaning and not the other 
			way around and decisions are not usually random.&nbsp; There are, 
			among other things issues of fronting for emphasis, end focus and 
			endweighting to consider.<br />
			See the guide to <a href="../phrases_clauses_sentences/fronting.html">fronting</a> 
			and <a href="../lexicogrammar/thereit.html"><em>it</em> and<em> there</em></a> 
			for more.</li>
			<li><strong>Writing (or saying) </strong><em><strong>usage</strong></em><strong> 
			when you mean </strong><em><strong>use</strong> </em>(and the other 
			way round)<em><br />
			Usage </em>is not a fancier way of saying <em>use.&nbsp; </em>In our 
			profession:<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li><strong><em>Usage</em></strong> means focusing on the 
				meaning attached to something as an instance of language 
				isolated from context.&nbsp; It is its <strong>signification</strong> 
				(what it means).</li>
				<li><strong><em>Use</em></strong> refers to the meaning of 
				something when used for communicative purpose.&nbsp; This is its <strong> 
				value </strong>(what it does).<br />
				For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>A: Why don't you see a doctor if 
				you are feeling so ill?<br />
				B: Mount Everest is very high and Mercury is the nearest planet 
				to the sun.</em></span><br />
				B's statement has significance (we know what is meant) but no 
				value (it communicates nothing useful).<br />
				<span class="auto-style4">(Widdowson, H. G., 1978, <em>Teaching 
				Language as Communication</em>, London: Oxford University 
				Press.)</span></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Stative and dynamic verbs</strong><br />
			Grammarians will use these terms but you should know that they are 
			shorthand for stative and dynamic <span class="style_underline">uses</span> 
			of verbs and make it clear that you do.<br />
			Many verbs normally called stative verbs can be 
			used dynamically.&nbsp; For example, the 
			verbs appear as homonyms in<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li><em>I think he's going to be late </em>(stative use)</li>
				<li><em>Please be quiet, I'm thinking </em>(dynamic use)</li>
				<li><em>He was feeling ill </em>(stative use with progressive 
				form)</li>
				<li><em>He felt the richness of the material </em>(dynamic use 
				with simple form)</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Confusing tense and aspect</strong><br />
			English exhibits a number of aspects (progressive, continuous, 
			durative, repeated, habitual etc.) and two of these (progressive and 
			perfect) are marked in the form of the tense.&nbsp; Be careful to 
			avoid things like <span class="style_black"><em>the progressive 
			tense</em></span>, therefore, and prefer <span class="style_black">
			<em>tense XXX in the progressive / perfect aspect</em></span>.&nbsp; For more, go to <a href="../verbs/aspect.html">the 
			guide to aspect</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>This </strong><em><strong>would / might / could / may</strong></em><strong> 
			be a good teaching solution for the issue of ...</strong><br />
			When you evaluate a teaching solution you need to show either that 
			you have done what you suggest and have reflected on its success or 
			that you can work from your teacherly intuition and experience 
			concerning its effectiveness and any drawbacks.&nbsp; Avoid too much 
			modality, therefore, and be more confident and less tentative.&nbsp; 
			For example,<span class="style_black"><em><br />
			This is an effective solution for the problem of avoidance because ... 
			although it also ...</em></span></li>
