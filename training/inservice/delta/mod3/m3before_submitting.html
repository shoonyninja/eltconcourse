			<p>This is not just a matter of running the text through a spell 
			checker.&nbsp; They aren't too good at recognising homophones.&nbsp; 
			It is generally preferable to get someone else to check your work 
			because they will read what you wrote, not what you think you wrote.<br />
			Apart from simple matters of spelling and lexical and syntactical accuracy, you need to check:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Your use of terminology and subject-specific concepts.<ol class="redbulletlist">
					<li>Is your use of any specific terminology accurate?&nbsp; 
					Have you checked?</li>
					<li>In particular, have you clearly understood the 
					difference between these?<ol class="greybulletlist">
						<li>use and usage</li>
						<li>register and style</li>
						<li>cohesion and coherence</li>
						<li>modality and modal auxiliary verbs</li>
						<li>phonemic and phonetic</li>
						<li>summative and formative testing</li>
						<li>diagnostic, achievement and proficiency testing</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Coherence:<ol class="redbulletlist">
					<li>Does the content of each section match what the 
					(sub)heading leads the reader to expect?</li>
					<li>Do you make clear links between the sections, referring 
					back and forward where necessary so the text is clearly 
					signposted?</li>
					<li>Have you maintained relevance or are there parts of the 
					text which are too general and not linked to your 
					specialism?</li>
					<li>Do your appendices contain discussion that should be in 
					the main text?</li>
					<li>Have you clearly signposted where in the appendices the 
					reader can find the relevant support for your discussion?&nbsp; 
					Don't make the reader hunt around.&nbsp; Label the 
					appendices logically.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Style:<ol class="redbulletlist">
					<li>Have you avoided sounding too assertive with terms like<strong>
					</strong><em>Clearly, Obviously, Certainly, rightly, 
					unarguably, definitely</em> etc.</li>
					<li>Have you avoided contractions and colloquialisms?</li>
					<li>Is the presentation consistent, with the same fonts and 
					text sizes for headings, subheadings and citations etc.?</li>
					<li>Are any citations from authority clearly identifiable 
					using "inverted commas" or indenting text in a different font or font 
					size?</li>
					<li>Have you referenced everything appropriately and 
					accurately?&nbsp; Plagiarism checks are in place in 
					Cambridge.</li>
					<li>Is your bibliography correctly set out?</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Presentation:<ol>
					<li class="redbulletlist">Make sure you have<ol>

			<p>Getting all these things right is not just a cosmetic exercise.&nbsp;

		<p>You can see that the marks are spread pretty evenly so you have to 
		give each section equal attention and probably equal space.</p>
		<p>Module Three is marked externally out of a maximum possible mark of 
		140.&nbsp; The marks you need to get are, approximately:<br />
			Pass: 80 | Pass with Merit: 100 | Pass with Distinction: 120</p>
			<p>That's a good guide to how much space you should have devoted to 
			each section.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Principal Examiner's reports often comment on the most frequent 
			weaknesses markers complain about.&nbsp; They are more or less the 
			same every year.<br />
			Here they are:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>not basing the whole assignment and course on the chosen 
				specialism<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li class="greybulletlist">So, apart from in the 
					introduction, where you show a grasp of the whole area, make 
					sure that what you say is relevant to what you are doing</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>not adequately researching the chosen specialism<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li class="greybulletlist">So, do your research thoroughly 
					and make sure you understand competing authorities and their 
					views</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>lack of theoretical underpinning in some or all sections<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li class="greybulletlist">So, refer to theory frequently</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>failure to analyse learners’ needs adequately and identify 
				learning priorities from the analysis or, for the Management 
				option, failing to carry out a good enough situation analysis<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li class="greybulletlist">So, <strong>use </strong>the data 
					you have collected</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>failure to link the design of the course to the needs 
				identified or, for the management option, failing to link the 
				proposal to the benefits and the situation analysis<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li class="greybulletlist">So, keep your list of priority 
					areas in mind when you design the course.&nbsp; Make sure 
					that the course content reflects the needs you have 
					prioritised.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>lack of clarity as to what is to be tested, when and how 
				during the course or, for the Management option a lack of 
				clarity in the implementation plan concerning who does what 
				when.<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li class="greybulletlist">So, set this section out 
					carefully distinguishing between formative and summative 
					assessment procedures clearly</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>lack of clear development of argument within sections and 
				links between sections<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li class="greybulletlist">So, refer frequently to earlier 
					and later parts of the essay while you are writing so the 
					essay is not a set of independent sections but a coherent 
					whole</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">not adhering to the word-count 
				limitations.&nbsp; Overall, the essay should be between 4,000 
				and 4,500 words.&nbsp; Deviations will be penalised.&nbsp; If it 
				is more than 4,600 words, it will not be marked at all.<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li class="greybulletlist">Check the number of words and be 
					strict.&nbsp; State, too, which version of Word you have 
					used to make the count.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you re-read your assignment, keep this list by you.&nbsp; 
			Can you be accused of any of it?&nbsp; If the answer is yes, then 
			re-visit and re-write that section.<br />
			The guides on this site to each section also tell you the most 
			common weaknesses so it may pay to check those again.</p>
