		<h2><a name="1"></a>Think for a moment</h2>
		<p>Consider a <strong>successful</strong> course that you have taken or 
		taught.&nbsp; What made it successful?&nbsp; In other words, what are 
		the characteristics of a successful course?<br />
		When you have a short list, 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'cp1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">click here for a longer one</a>.</p>
		<div id="cp1" style="visibility:hidden">
		<p><span class="style_brown">You may not have a list that is the same 
		but some overlap would be good!</span></p>
		<ol class="style_brown">
			<li><strong>Appropriateness and relevance</strong><br />
			Good courses do what they say they will.&nbsp; If learners perceive that 
			the approach, the organisation and the materials are all 
			contributing to the aims and objectives, it will encourage high 
			levels of motivation and commitment and these factors are crucial in 
			a successful course.</li>
			<li><strong>Coherence</strong><br />
			Good courses are taught by people who appear to know what they are 
			doing and are following some kind of plan.&nbsp; That plan may be 
			made explicitly available to the participants.</li>
			<li><strong>Well timetabled</strong><br />
			Good courses have timetables which are convenient and intensive 
			enough without being exhausting and confusing.</li>
			<li><strong>Materials</strong><br />
			Good courses use materials which appeal to the people on the course 
			and are relevant to their aims.&nbsp; Materials which are overtly 
			designed around the course participants are motivating and 
			intriguing.&nbsp; Materials which are professionally presented and 
			error free inspire confidence and that leads to motivation.</li>
			<li><strong>Approaches</strong><br />
			Good courses use approaches which conform to the styles of the 
			learners and are unthreatening and motivating.</li>
			<li><strong>Personnel</strong><br />
			Trainers and teachers on good courses are professional, properly 
			prepared, approachable and show overt concern for their learners and 
			that inspires confidence and motivates.&nbsp; Teachers who are 
			sloppy, uncaring or overworked have the opposite effect.</li>
			<li><strong>Involving and flexible</strong><br />
			Good courses overtly take into consideration the changing needs of 
			the learners and accommodate themselves to those needs.&nbsp; They 
			are flexible and responsive.</li>
			<li><strong>Autonomy</strong><br />
			Good courses allow the learners appropriate degrees of autonomy to 
			cater for individuals.</li>
			<li><strong>Assessment</strong><br />
			Good courses contain adequate amounts of assessment pre-, during- 
			and post-course so everyone can see how they are doing.</li>
			<li><strong>Environment and equipment</strong><br />
			Good courses take place in suitable accommodation and make use of an 
			appropriate range of aids and equipment which is used 
			professionally.</li>

			<dd>The Needs Analysis had two sections:<br />
			The characteristics of the group.&nbsp; You need to consider

			styles, interests, motivations, professional needs and so on.<br />
			The diagnostic test.&nbsp; Refer back to the previous section where 
			you have (or should have) summarised the outcomes of the test and 
			prioritised your language and skills targets.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Your reading and research</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Right at the outset of the essay, in the introduction, you 
			should have referred to the background literature on your chosen 
			specialism.&nbsp; Here you need to say how what you discovered has 
			influenced the design of the course proposal.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Aims and objectives</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>The objectives will be clear from the nature of most courses but 
			here you need to draw on the results of the diagnostic testing you 
			did and the outcomes of the research into the nature of the group 
			again.<br />

			How many hours?&nbsp; What sort of intensity?&nbsp; What's the 
			timetable?</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Teaching approaches</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>What expertise is available to you?&nbsp; What approach will 
			best appeal to the learners and match the course aims?</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Materials</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Do not just list these.&nbsp; You need to justify them 
			rationally because they target your aims and objectives and are 
			suitable for the nature of the group.<br />
			You may need to discuss the advantages and drawbacks of materials 
			designed for this course by the people teaching it compared to 
			commercially produced generic materials.&nbsp; See below for more.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Limitations and constraints</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>No course takes place in an ideal world so you need to mention, 
			for example:<br />
			The availability of teaching staff<br />
			The time available<br />

		<p>One of the characteristics of a good course is that it is coherent

		<p>If you take these sorts of considerations into account, the best way 
		forward may well be to use commercially produced materials for parts of 
		the course most appropriate for them and fill the gaps or target special 
		needs with in-house produced materials.<br />
