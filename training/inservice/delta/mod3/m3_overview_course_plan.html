			<p>This guide is mostly intended for people who want to enter for 
			Module Three independently and do not wish, cannot afford, do not 
			feel the need or are 
			unable to take a taught course.&nbsp; It will, however, be of some 
			utility to people taking or intending to take a taught course.</p>
			<p>You are probably aware that there are two options for Module 
			Three:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Extending Practice and ELT Specialism </strong>which 
				is designed to develop your mastery of:<ol class="auto-style1">
					<li>your specialist area<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so you will be the go-to person wherever you work</li>
					<li>conducting needs analyses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so you can always keep up with what your learners need</li>
					<li>curriculum and syllabus design<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so you are well placed to take on an academic management role</li>
					<li>types of syllabus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so you know what the options are</li>
					<li>course design and evaluation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so you know how to design a course which will benefit your 
					learners and be able to assess whether it did</li>
					<li>assessment of learners<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so you know how to test, evaluate and plan for your learners' 
					progress</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>English Language Teaching Management</strong> which 
				is designed to develop your mastery of:<ol class="auto-style1">
					<li>your chosen management area in general<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so you know how to talk about it, write about it and access 
					the literature</li>
					<li>conducting a situation analysis<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so you know in detail where an institution or business 
					current is</li>
					<li>designing change<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so you carry people with you towards definable and explicit 
					objectives</li>
					<li>implementing change<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so you can do this smoothly and effectively and assess 
					success (or otherwise) dispassionately</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In brief, then, the aim of your assignment is to make yourself 
			something of an expert on whichever option you are going for.</p>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>If you choose the ELT Specialism option, your choice is limited 
			to:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>Business English (BE)</li>
			<li>Teaching young learners/young adults (specified age group 
			required within a 5-year range e.g. 8–13, 14–19) (YL)</li>
			<li>English for Specific Purposes (ESP)</li>
			<li>English for Academic Purposes (EAP)</li>
			<li>Teaching examination classes (EX)</li>
			<li>Teaching one-to-one (1to1)</li>
			<li>ESOL learners with literacy needs (ESOLLIT)</li>
			<li>CLIL/Embedded ESOL (teaching English through subject/work‑based 
			learning or Content and Language Integrated Learning) (CLIL)</li>
			<li>Teaching monolingual classes (MON)</li>
			<li>Teaching multilingual classes (MUL)</li>
			<li>Teaching in an English-speaking environment (ESE)</li>
			<li>Teaching in a non-English-speaking environment (NESE)</li>
			<li>Teaching learners online/through distance/blended learning (DL)</li>
			<li>Teaching English to learners with special requirements, e.g. 
			visual/hearing impairment, dyslexia, ASD (SR)</li>
			<li>Language development for teachers (LDT)</li>
			<li>Language support (e.g. on mainstream teaching 
			programmes, specialist skills support, such as supporting writing 
			needs) (LS).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These are large areas in themselves so within your choice, you will 
		need to narrow the scope to something manageable.&nbsp; For example, 
		within Teaching Examination Classes, you should focus on a particular 
		examination and designing a course to prepare people for it.&nbsp; 
		Within English for Specific Purposes, of course, the range of possible 
		specialisms is very wide.<br />

			<p>If you choose this option, your choices are limited to the 
			following broad areas:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>Academic management</li>
			<li>Human resource management (HRM)</li>
			<li>Customer service</li>
			<li>Marketing</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These are large areas in themselves so within your choice, you will 
		need to narrow the scope to something manageable.<br />
		For example, 
		within Academic management, you could focus on introducing a new course, 
		introducing new technologies and/or course materials or varying the 
		content of a current course or courses.<br />
		Within Human resource management, you could focus on teacher development 
		programmes, raising the teaching teams' skills and qualifications or on 
		current employment practices to conform to regulations and laws or on 
		recruitment and retention strategies.&nbsp; Be aware that you do not 
		necessarily need to focus on teaching staff alone.<br />
		Within Customer service, you could investigate ways to enhance the 
		commitment and motivation of learners or creating a better fit between 
		the courses you offer and the demands of sponsors and other 
		stakeholders.<br />
		Within Marketing you could look at ways of investigating how your 
		organisation's target market may be changing and what responses you need 
		to implement or consider a range of marketing tools that the 
		organisation either does not use or uses inefficiently or ineffectively.<br />

			<p>
			Some issues are generic and common to both options for Module Three 
			so we'll handle those here because it doesn't matter which option 
			you select.&nbsp; Later, we'll take each option in turn and explain, briefly, 
			what is required of you and give you links to more detailed guides 
			to each section of the essay.<br />
			First, though, a bit more overview of both options.&nbsp; The 
			following is extracted from the Delta Handbook insofar as the author 
			appears to want to be understood.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<h3>Contents</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>Where the handbook is clear, the following are the regulations.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The product of your work is an essay of between 4000 and 
				4500 words, not including the contents page, the bibliography 
				and any appendices.<br />The essay must be written in clear, accurate English and you 
				will gain 10% of the total marks for:<ol class="auto-style1">
					<li>writing in a suitably academic tone and using suitable 
				hedging and referencing techniques</li>
					<li>presenting a properly organised, coherent piece of work 
				which does not impose a strain on the reader</li>
					<li>arguing clearly and presenting high-quality, thought-through 
				ideas</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>You may not exceed the word count.&nbsp; If you do, you will 
				be penalised and if you do by more than 100 words, the essay 
				will not be assessed.&nbsp; The word count includes text 
				embedded in any diagrams and charts, incidentally (although the 
				Handbook is silent on this).&nbsp; You 
				must state the word count on the essay and you should say which 
				word-processing package you used as a counter.</li>
				<li>Both types of essay are marked according to clear(ish), 
				section-by-section criteria</li>
				<li>Background:<ol class="auto-style1">
					<li>you need to refer to <em>an extensive range of reading 
				resources<br />
					</em>See instructions about the bibliography, below</li>
					<li>you are expected to do <em>appropriate research<br />
					</em>And the bibliography along with in-text referencing 
					will demonstrate this.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="present" height="133" src="../../../images/present_hand_flowers200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style23">
					<h3>Submission and presentation</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<ol>
				<li>You must present your assignment electronically in no more 
				than two files:<ol class="auto-style1">
					<li>the main body of the essay including the bibliography</li>
					<li>appendices</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Margins on both documents should be set to 2.5 centimetres</li>
				<li>The title page must include:<ol class="auto-style1">
					<li>the centre details (name and number)</li>
					<li>your details (candidate number and full name)</li>
					<li>type of assignment (ELT Specialism or ELT Management)</li>
					<li>topic (i.e., a title which clearly identifies what the 
					essay is about)</li>
					<li>the word count (and the name and version of the program you used to 
					count)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The main text must:<ol class="auto-style1">
					<li>include a footer with your name and the assignment title</li>
					<li>include a contents page immediately after the title page 
					(Word will do this for you if you ask nicely and have been 
					consistent with the style for headings and subheadings)</li>
					<li>not include footnotes</li>
					<li>include a page number either in the footer or in a 
					header (preferably as <em>Page x of n</em>)</li>
					<li>use consistent headings and subheadings.&nbsp; Settle on 
					a format and use it throughout (see the Delta Style Guide 
					for more)</li>
					<li>be submitted as a Microsoft Word document with a file 
					extension of .doc or .docx.&nbsp; No other format is 
					acceptable.&nbsp; If you do not have access to Microsoft 
					Word, you can use a free processor such as Apache OpenOffice 
					which you can download from
					<a href="https://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank">this 
					link</a>.&nbsp; If you write your assignment in a program 
					like this, you need to use the ‘Save As’ option and save the 
					text as a .docx document.&nbsp; Do not submit a .odt file 
					because that will not be accepted.<br />
					(The Handbook is wilfully unclear on this, stating, <em>
					either Microsoft Word of Adobe PDF format</em>, and then 
					stating that the main body must be in Word format.&nbsp; We 
					can only take that to mean that the appendices may be 
					presented either as Word or PDF files.&nbsp; It would be 
					helpful if those who demand clarity from candidates could 
					manage a little themselves.)</li>
					<li>include the bibliography (at the end, before any 
					appendices)</li>
					<li>be named as follows:<ol class="auto-style24">
						<li>for the ELT Specialism: centre number_candidate 
						number_Delta3_specialism code_mmyy<br />
						For example: 99999_017_Delta3_EAP_0622<br />
						Translated, that is candidate 017 from centre 99999, 
						submitting a Module Three assignment on English for 
						Academic Purposes for the June 2022 session.</li>
						<li>for the ELT Management specialism: centre 
						number_candidate number_Delta3_ELTM_mmyy<br />
						For example: 99999_017_Delta3_ELTM_0622<br />
						Translated, that is candidate 017 from centre 99999, 
						submitting a Module Three assignment for the Management 
						Specialism for the June 2022 session.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Appendices may be separately submitted as either a Word file 
				or a PDF document (presumably) and named as:<br />
				centre number_candidate number_Delta3_appendices_mmyy<br />
				for either type of essay.<br />
				For example: 99999_017_Delta3_appendices_0622</li>
				<li>File sizes must not exceed 10MB (the Handbook is 
				characteristically unclear but this figure applies to each file, 
				not the combined size)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Even with the help provided here and your own best efforts, it is 
			always possible that you won't pass Module Three (although a pass 
			rate of over 75% is reassuring).<br />
			If you don't pass, the regulations are that you can re-submit an 
			amended essay, responding to the reasons the first one did not pass<strong>, once only</strong>.&nbsp; You must do 
				so within one year of the original 
			submission.<br />
			For example, if you are referred in June you can resubmit in 
			December or the following June.&nbsp; If you are referred in 
			December, you can resubmit in June or December next year.<br />
			If the resubmission still doesn't pass or you miss the deadline, you 
			need to start again and submit a new assignment.</p>

			<p>The following is mostly for those who want to enter for Module 
			Three independently and will not be paying for a course.<br />
			There are plenty of paid-for Module Three courses, mostly delivered 
			online, and run by a number of centres.<br />
			If you do opt for a taught course, bear in mind that there is no 
			oversight from Cambridge concerning the staffing or content of such 
			courses.&nbsp; Anyone, anywhere can set up and run a Delta Module 
			Three course.<br />
			You will, therefore, be well advised to check carefully that the 
			centre has qualified tutors, knows something about your specialism 
			and is honourable before handing over your money.&nbsp; For more, 
			see <a href="../considering_delta.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
			considering Delta</a>.</p>
			<p>If you decide to enter independently, you need to construct a 
			personal work plan and do your own research.&nbsp; Here's some help.</p>
			<p>Before you begin at all, you are advised to follow these guides
