				For the purposes of Module Three, three types of test concern 
				us:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Diagnostic: to discover people's strengths and 
					weaknesses</li>
					<li>Proficiency: to discover people's current abilities and 
					level</li>
					<li>Achievement: to discover and evaluate how well a course

					<h2>Which test, when?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Testing happens more than once for the Module Three course:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>It forms an integral part of the needs analysis (diagnostic 
			assessment) but the testing must come <strong>after</strong> the 
			needs analysis or you won't be able to target the test properly.</li>
			<li>It is central to the evaluation of the course itself both during 
			the course (formative assessment) and at the end (summative 
			assessment).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>That means that Part 2 (the Needs Analysis) and Part 4 (the 
		Assessment) are both impacted by the ways you test and your 
		understanding of the guiding principles.&nbsp; That's nearly half the 
		whole of Module Three.&nbsp; There are four areas:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>As part of <strong>but not instead of</strong><em> </em>the needs analysis 
			process you need a test which will perform a dual function.&nbsp; It will 
			be a dual diagnostic and proficiency test.<ol class="auto-style6">
				<li>it will tell you how 
		well people have already mastered the language and skills they need 
				before the course begins.</li>
				<li>it will tell you where their strengths and weaknesses lie to 
				inform the course design.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>During and at the end of the course, <strong>part of </strong>your evaluation 
		of its success must involve tests to see how well the learning 
		objectives are being or have been addressed.&nbsp; These are achievement tests.</li>
			<li>Additionally, you will want to include some type of formative 
		assessment and evaluation while the course progresses.&nbsp; That, too, 
		will be a form of achievement testing and may also include elements of 
		diagnostic testing to help you plan where to go next and know whether 
		you need to tweak the course programme to take account of the learning 
		process.</li>
			<li>Finally, at the end of the course, you need to evaluate its success 
		and comment on its suitability for future use.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The principles set out below apply to all of these.</p>

		<p>You are dealing with a defined group of people (possibly quite a 
		small group or even a single learner) who will only take any of your tests once, probably.&nbsp; 
		Reliability is not, therefore, a <strong>central</strong> issue.<br />
		You are not constructing a public examination or an institution-wide 
		repeatable test.&nbsp; You are targeting only what you need to know 
		about <strong>this</strong> group for the purposes of planning a course 
		for <strong>them</strong>.&nbsp; You will need to make this clear in 
		your discussion if only to reassure the reader-marker that you 
		understand the principle involved.<br />
		<span class="auto-style7"><strong>It is <em>validity</em> and

		<p>You will recall that there are 5 types of validity to consider:<br />

		<p>There will be variations.<br />
		For the diagnostic test, all the above apply but for an end-of-course 
		achievement test, predictive validity may be less crucial.&nbsp; 
		Construct validity and content validity will still be important.&nbsp; 
		You have to test what has been taught / learned and you have to be able 
		to describe what you are testing.</p>

		<p>More than likely, you will be conducting the diagnostic / proficiency 
		test at a distance but the achievement test will be a face-to-face

		<ol>
			<li>You need to make sure that the test is reliable if different 
			people take it at different times.&nbsp; That means clear 
			instructions to the subjects and/or colleagues elsewhere.</li>
			<li>You need to consider the group's nature:<ol class="auto-style6">
				<li>If it's a large group, use a test format which allows for as 
				much objective marking as possible.&nbsp; The larger the group 
				and the larger the number of markers, the less reliable 
				subjective marking becomes.</li>
				<li>If it's a small group or a single student, you can use more 
				subjective marking because reliability is less of an issue</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>There may be institutional constraints concerning the amount of 
			time which can be devoted to this both by the group and by the 
			markers and course designer (you).&nbsp; If there are, discuss 
			them.</li>

			<h3>Impact: the fourth factor</h3>

			<p>This is a fourth factor you may like to consider, especially 
			regarding the end-of-course achievement test.<br />
			Impact refers to 
			the effect the process of testing has on the test takers and the 
			course itself.&nbsp; You don't need to discuss this when referring 
			to the diagnostic/proficiency, pre-course test but impact may be an 
			issue when you come to discussing the achievement test.&nbsp; 
			However, any in-course and end-of-course testing you do may impact 
			the course itself:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>the learners must perceive the tests as a fair assessment of 
				their progress (face validity)</li>
				<li>the teachers may be influenced by the nature of the tests 
				they know will be done (washback / backwash)</li>
				<li>the learners may become fatigued and demotivated by too much 
				testing</li>
				<li>testing can be a time-consuming process and time may be at a 
				premium</li>

					<h2>Designing the test</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>When you get down to designing the actual test items much will, 
		naturally, depend on what it is you want to test.&nbsp; Testing skills 
		vs. language items such as structure and lexis requires a different 
		approach usually.&nbsp; You need to think carefully before you plunge in 
		but here are some ways of doing it.</p>
		<h3>Test-item types</h3>
		<p>Here's a list.&nbsp; Think of the advantages and disadvantages to put 
		in the right-hand areas and then click on the graphic.</p>
		<p>
		<img id="img2" alt="item types" height="303" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img2',/*url*/'../images/m3testtask3answer.png')" src="../images/m3testtask3.png" width="450" /></p>
		<p>You will need to discuss the (dis)advantages in these sections of your 
		Module Three report.&nbsp; This discussion will be brief when it is 
		inserted into the Needs Analysis section because you are only concerned 
		with diagnostic / proficiency testing here and you only have 900 or so 
		words to devote to the whole section.</p>
		<h3>Response types</h3>
		<p>The next thing to consider is how you want the subjects to respond to 
		the items.&nbsp; On this will depend how long the test takes, how much 
		data you can gather and how subjective, or otherwise, the marking is.</p>
		<p>Here's another graphic to respond to.</p>
		<p>
		<img id="img3" alt="task 3" height="302" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img3',/*url*/'../images/m3testtask2answer.png')" src="../images/m3testtask2.png" width="450" /></p>
			<p>All tests are compromises so there are pros and cons to discuss 
			in the report:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>Adding reliability by making marking as objective as 
				possible and using discrete items with limited response types 
				will reduce validity by disallowing direct testing of the target 
				skill.</li>
				<li>Making sure you have high levels of content validity may 
				mean employing subjective marking of free-response items and a 
				loss of reliability and practicality.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Only you can decide, given the priority you place on certain 
			kinds of data, what the appropriate mix is but you must be clear in 
			your discussion that you are aware of the compromises you have made.<br />
			The questions posed above about which test types and item 
		designs are appropriate for the data you want to capture are not easy to 
		answer (and cannot be answered for your specific module focus here).&nbsp; What must be clear in the 
		discussions in the Needs Analysis section but particularly in the Course 
			Assessment section of the information report is that you have 
		thought about it all and based your tests on principles rather than 
		intuition and practicality alone.</p>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>In your report, you will have to describe and justify your testing 
		procedures but also discuss them (twice).&nbsp; In other words, you will embed a 
		discussion inside an information report.&nbsp; That discussion will also 
		include an evaluation of whether the test actually served its function.<br />
		In the in-service training section of this site there are guides to 
		assessing the four main language skills independently.&nbsp; They are:<br />
		<a href="../../skills/assessinglistening.html">The guide to assessing 
		Listening Skills</a><br />
		<a href="../../skills/assessingreading.html">The guide to assessing 
		Reading Skills</a><br />

		Speaking Skills</a><br />
		<a href="../../skills/assessingwriting.html">The guide to assessing 
		Writing Skills</a></p>
			<p>If you have followed <a href="m3structure.html">the 
		guide to structuring the whole of Module Three</a>, you will know how that 
		works but here's the overview</p>
			<p>
		<img alt="testing section structure" height="426" src="../images/m3testingstructure.png" width="700" /></p>
			<p>The content will depend on whether this forms part of the Needs 
			Analysis or part of the Course Assessment section.&nbsp; In either 
			case, you need to include all tests in your appendices.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>For the Needs Analysis, keep it brief and to the point but 
				don't be afraid to refer forward to a deeper discussion of 
				principles which will come later.</li>
				<li>For the Course Assessment section, you need more discussion 
				and more depth.<br />
				Here, too, you must devise ways of canvassing people's views 
				about the course generally and for some discussion of 
				questionnaire formats (which can be used for face-to-face 
				debriefs, too) you should refer to the relevant section of the 
				guides to Needs Analyses on this site.</li>

			<p>Examiners' reports contain more or less the same catalogue of

				<li class="greybulletlist">Make sure you <strong>show that you

				<li class="greybulletlist">Make sure you show that <strong>all</strong>

			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>being over-reliant on public examination materials<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li class="greybulletlist">This is especially relevant for assignments 
			focused on preparation for examinations.&nbsp; Be aware that simply 
			lifting test items of whole parts of the target examination is 
			rarely a good way to assess the learners.&nbsp; Do not confuse 
			proficiency testing (the examination) with summative and formative
