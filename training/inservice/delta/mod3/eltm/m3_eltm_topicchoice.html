	<h1><span class="deltablue">Delta </span>Module Three ELT Management: choosing your topic</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="choice" height="207" src="../../../../images/selection_sweets310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<h2>What are the choices?</h2>
		<p>The choices for the management option of Delta Module Three are 
		considerably more limited than the range for the ELT specialism option.<br />
		Here are the options according to Cambridge's Handbook for Module 
		Three</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>Academic management</li>
			<li>Human resource management (HRM)</li>
			<li>Customer service</li>
			<li>Marketing</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These are large areas in themselves so within your choice, you will 
		need to narrow the scope to something manageable.<br />
		For example, 
		within Academic management, you could focus on introducing a new course, 
		introducing new technologies and/or course materials or varying the 
		content of a current course or courses.<br />
		Within Human resource management, you could focus on teacher development 
		programmes, raising the teaching teams' skills and qualifications or on 
		current employment practices to conform to regulations and laws or on 
		recruitment and retention strategies.&nbsp; Be aware that you do not 
		necessarily need to focus on teaching staff alone.<br />
		Within Customer service, you could investigate ways to enhance the 
		commitment and motivation of learners or creating a better fit between 
		the courses you offer and the demands of sponsors and other 
		stakeholders.<br />
		Within Marketing you could look at ways of investigating how your 
		organisation's target market may be changing and what responses you need 
		to implement or consider a range of marketing tools that the 
		organisation either does not use or uses inefficiently or ineffectively.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, in the introduction to your Module Three essay, in which 
		you provide a rationale for your management specialism and review the 
		key issues, you will need to consider <span class="style_underline">
		<strong>general</strong></span> management principles and explain how 
		these relate to your specialism before you look at the specific 
		management principles which apply to your topic area.</p>
		<p>If Academic management is your first choice, you may find some ideas in
		<a href="../../../../../academic_management/academic_management_index.html">that section of this site</a>.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="decide" height="166" src="../../../../images/selection_doors250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>How do I decide?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The choice of specialism is not huge but the first principle for 
			making a choice should be consideration of your current role in your 
			language teaching organisation.</p>
		<p>Organisations vary quite considerably in terms of how job titles and 
		job descriptions are designed so it is difficult to offer more than 
		general advice here.<br />
		Within most organisations there are some generalities however, and you 
		need to look at whether you have the experience and knowledge you will 
		need to do justice to the topic.&nbsp; If you are not, have never been 
		and are unlikely to be associated with any marketing activities, for 
		example, you would be unwise to select a topic within that area.&nbsp; 
		On the other hand, if you are responsible for designing and implementing 
		training and development for teachers, then Academic management or Human 
		resource management are clearly options to consider.<br />
		If your role involves being the public face of your organisation, then 
		Customer service and Marketing are both relevant areas for you.</p>
		<p>Overall, the advice here is not to stray too far (or at all) outside 
		the areas of the organisation in which you have first-hand experience.<br />
		Look at the things 
		you are going to need to do for this option for Module Three and ask 
		yourself whether you have enough background knowledge and experience 
		already to know what you need to research and read.</p>
		<p>In outline, again from the handbook, you must do five things:</p>
		<ol class="greybullet">
			<li>research a chosen ELT Management specialism</li>
			<li>understand and use appropriate methods of situation 
			analysis for your specialism</li>
			<li>design a change proposal to address the issues you have 
			identified in the situation analysis</li>
			<li>design and implement a plan for the change you want to effect</li>
			<li>synthesise all your learning into a project which can be 
			coherently presented to a third party</li>
		</ol>
		<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="five" height="166" src="../../../../images/five_ducks250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>One at a time</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<h3>research a chosen management specialism</h3>
		<p>For this part of the Module, you will be assessed on your grasp of 
		the topic area.&nbsp; This includes:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>A rationale for the choice of specialism and a review of the key 
			issues</dt>
			<dd>In this part you will briefly justify your choice of topic.&nbsp; 
			Do not take it as a given that the change or development you intend 
			to introduce is valuable to the organisation.&nbsp; Set out the 
			reasons for doing what you intend.<br />
			You also need to make clear here how any overlap between the four 
			general topic areas has been considered.&nbsp; For example, 
			development programmes may enhance teachers' classrooms skills but 
			that, in turn, may have an impact on the level of customer service 
			your organisation provides.&nbsp; Be explicit about where the main 
			concern of your essay lies but also show that you have considered 
			other aspects.</dd>
			<dt>Understanding of key issues in the topic area</dt>
			<dd>This means you have to demonstrate a grasp of general ELT 
			management principles as well as the specific principles relevant to 
			your specialism.&nbsp; Note the word 'key'.&nbsp; Points here 
			have to be relevant and prioritised by importance.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h3>understand and use appropriate methods of situation analysis</h3>
		<p>For this part of the module you need to explain how you analysed a 
		specific aspect of the language teaching organisation in which you work 
		and show how the results of this analysis were used to clarify and 
		target areas for improvement.&nbsp; You need to do four things:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Explain the context and characteristics of your organisation.</li>
			<li>Explain how you analysed the situation showing where the data 
			originated, how the data were gathered and why this method of data 
			gathering was used.</li>
			<li>Explain the role of key stakeholders within and outside the 
			organisation and discuss their influence.</li>
			<li>Explain how you used the results of the analysis to focus on 
			what you are proposing to do.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>proposal and justification</h3>
		<p>Here, you have to maintain clear relevance to the situation analysis 
		and to the key principles you identified in the introduction.&nbsp; Do 
		five things:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Identify your priorities</li>
			<li>Link your proposed changes to your reading of management 
			literature.</li>
			<li>Set out what your aims are and what outcomes you hope to achieve 
			saying how the situation will be improved.</li>
			<li>Say exactly what you plan to do and how it will work.</li>
			<li>Explain the limits and constraints under which you work and how 
			you have taken them into account.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>implementation</h3>
		<p>Do six things here:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Explain your overall approach to implementing the change and how 
			your reading has influenced it.</li>
			<li>Describe the impact of the change on internal and external 
			stakeholders</li>
			<li>Be clear about exactly how you will implement changes.&nbsp; For 
			this you need a thoroughly worked out&nbsp;action plan.</li>
			<li>Explain how you will manage people and resources during the 
			actions.</li>
			<li>Explain any constraints and other factors which limit the way 
			you handle the change.</li>
			<li>Explain how and when you will evaluate what you have done / will 
			do.&nbsp; Did it work?</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>synthesise all their learning into a project which can be coherently 
		presented to a third party</h3>
		<p>If you have followed the guide to writing Delta background essays you 
		will be aware of the ways to make sure you maintain relevance and 
		reference acceptably.<br />
		The genre of Module Three is fundamentally an information report but 
		it's a long document so there will be embedded sections which follow the 
		staging and structure of a discussion, setting out arguments on either 
		side of an issue.<br />
		For a little more on this, review <a href="../../../eap/genre_eap.html">the guide to genre 
		in English for Academic Purposes</a>.</p>
		<p>Clearly, no site like this can cover all the possible topics within 
		the four general areas so only general structuring advice can be given.&nbsp; 
		That's the topic of <a href="../m3_structure.html">the guide to how to write Module Three</a>.</p>
