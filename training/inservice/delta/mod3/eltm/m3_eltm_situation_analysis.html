			<p>There is a wide range of things that you might want to know.<br />
			You need to select those areas which are important 
		to your intentions and your organisation.&nbsp; To do that, you need to 
			understand the organisation so step outside it for a moment and note 
			down:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>What are its main characteristics?</li>
			<li>What type of teaching does it focus on?</li>
			<li>What is its purpose?</li>
			<li>What are its ambitions?</li>
			<li>Who are the stakeholders?</li>
			<li>How does it fit with the local and national context?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This part of your essay is not the place to describe the organisation 
		or your role in it in great depth.&nbsp; The questions above are mostly 
		for you so that you are clear about the main characteristics of the 
		organisation.</p>
		<p>Here are two examples of how to proceed once you have a picture clear 
		in your head:</p>
		<h4><a name="eg1"></a>Example 1</h4>
		<p>You are focused on 
		enhancing your institution's marketing and promotional materials and the 
		media in which they appear.</p>
		<p>The first thing to note is that you will have to make a thorough 
		analysis of what marketing the organisation currently undertakes with 
		some appreciation of how effective it has been in the past.<br />
		You also need to consider what your marketing budget currently is and 
		discuss any constraints concerning the amount the organisation is able 
		or willing to invest to enhance what you do.<br />
		How will you go about gathering these data?<br />
		<a href="#eg1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'m3na1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have an answer to that</a>.</p>
		<div id="m3na1" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
		<p class="style_brown">You could:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style22">
			<li>Undertake a 5C analysis: <strong>Company, Competitors, 
			Customers, Collaborators, Climate</strong>.<br />
			A 5C analysis might look something like this although only the 5 
			major categories will be common to all.&nbsp; You have to decide, 
			based on what you are doing, which subcategories you need to 
			consider.&nbsp; The ones in this diagram are indicative, not 
			mandatory:<br />
			<img alt="5c" height="597" src="../../delta_images/5c_analysis_m3.png" width="620" /><br />
			Here is a suggestion for this topic, working clockwise round the 
			diagram:<ol class="auto-style24">
				<li>Company:<br />
				Make a list of all the marketing initiatives that have been 
				used in the past few years and compare the amount spent and the 
				targets of the marketing with outcomes.&nbsp; For example, if 
				the organisation invested heavily in advertising in a local 
				paper at one point, do you have a way of finding out if the 
				advertising actually produced a significant amount of new 
				business?&nbsp; If you do not have a way of judging that, 
				perhaps part of your innovation is to create a procedure to 
				enable you to judge.<br />
				Here, you are addressing the subcategories of strategy and 
				objectives.&nbsp; You can also consider technology here, of 
				course.</li>
				<li>Climate (or, you may prefer, Context):<br />
				Make an appraisal of what the demographic (social and economic) is that you want 
				to target and what technological and other aids are available to 
				you and it.<br />
				What legal and environmental issues might impinge on this?</li>
				<li>Competitors:<br />
				Analyse what your competitors do in terms of marketing.<br />
				How successful do they seem to have been?</li>
				<li>Collaborators:<br />
				See if you have collaborators (agents, information bureaux 
				etc.) who use marketing strategies with whom you can cooperate 
				to make things more effective.<br />
				In terms of the relationship you have with them, are your 
				collaborators involved in getting students or employing them or 
				teaching them after they leave you?&nbsp; We are referring here 
				to upstream and downstream relationships, respectively.</li>
				<li>Customers:<br />
				Consult your current customers to discover which parts of 
				your marketing (if any) they found most attractive and 
				influential.<br />
				What new sources of customers might you be able to access?</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Make a list of all the possible ways there are of marketing a 
			product (drawing on your reading and research) and then note which 
			of these your organisation currently does not use or uses rarely.<br />
			Are there reasons for this?</li>
		</ol>
		</div><p>This is not the place to plan a marketing programme.&nbsp; The 
		purpose of a situation analysis is to inform the planning that comes 
		later.&nbsp; It is purely a data-gathering exercise intended to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>discover what opportunities have been taken in the past and 
			judge how well they have performed</li>
			<li>identify possible ways to extend or enhance a marketing 
			programme</li>
		</ol>
		<h4><a name="eg2"></a>Example 2</h4>
		<p>You are focused on developing a teacher development programme so that 
		the teaching team are equipped with the skills they need to supply the 
		courses you run (or hope to run).<br />
		<a name="eg3"></a>Again, before you can start, you need to find out 
		consider three crucial issues.&nbsp; 
		What do you think they might be?<br />
		<a href="#eg2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'m3na2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have an answer</a>.</p>
		<div id="m3na2" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
		
		<ol class="auto-style22">
			<li>You need to identify exactly where there are any skills gaps in 
			the teaching team's profile.&nbsp; This means a certain amount of 
			critical objective appraisal allied to some careful and honest 
			introspection.&nbsp; You need to set out here how you will gather 
			the data and how you will then prioritise needs.&nbsp; Ways of 
			gathering the data might include:<ol class="auto-style24">
				<li>observation (by an internal manager or external consultant)</li>
				<li>meetings to discuss what development people want</li>
				<li>meetings to discuss what development the institution needs</li>
				<li>focus groups of similarly experienced or inexperienced 
				teachers so that you can identify whether needs are variable</li>
				<li>reading and research</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>You need to find out what resources the organisation and the 
			staff are prepared to devote to development programmes.&nbsp; 
			Knowing this will enable you to plan a programme realistically 
			rather than approaching it from an ideal-world perspective.</li>
			<li>You need to know what resources you already have internally and 
			what gaps will have to be filled by external consultants, trainers 
			and other experts or training courses.</li>

					</td>

			</table>
		<p>The moral of all this is to make sure that you are 100% clear about 
		the situation as it stands and can identify areas for improvement and 
		development.&nbsp; These data are the minimum you need <strong>before</strong> 
		you can being to make a plan.</p>

		<p>In what follows, the assumption is that you are have written a little 
		about the organisation (the answers to the first set of questions above) 
		and that you have identified the facet(s) that form the targets of your 
		study and plan.</p>
		<p>Here's the advice:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Get away from generalities as soon as you can and narrow the 
			focus to the specific area of the organisation's activities which 
			are the focus of the endeavour.</li>
			<li>Read and apply your reading to the context.&nbsp; You need to do 
			more than simply stating, for example, the nature of a 5C or a SWOT 
			analysis.&nbsp; You must apply the principles to the data you are 
			gathering with a target in mind.</li>
			<li>Choose the ways you gather data carefully, give examples of the 
			procedures in the appendices and critically discuss the pros and 
			cons of the methods you used.&nbsp; No data-gathering procedure is 
			ideal and all will have drawbacks as well as advantages.&nbsp; How 
			clean are your data?</li>
			<li>What priorities emerge from the data?&nbsp; Summarise (perhaps 
			in a chart, if that's appropriate) making it clear what the outcomes 
			are and how you will focus your plan.</li>
			<li>Set out the major areas that the plan will attack.</li>

		<p>In the diagram below, the Conclusion section of the needs analysis 
		discussion includes <span class="style_black"><em>Identify salient 
		outcomes</em></span>.&nbsp; This means you must <strong>list and 
		prioritise</strong> the outcomes of the analysis.&nbsp; It also means 
		that you need to say what the criteria are that you used to prioritise 
		the needs.<br />
		It will help to write two lists:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A list of the essentials along the lines of<br />
			<em>This need is important because </em><span class="style_black">
			(insert the criteria you used to identify this fact)</span><em> ... 
			and is included in the </em><span class="style_black">(insert a 
			clear reference to which part of the proposal you are talking 
			about)</span><em> ... section of the Implementation plan (see page x).</em></li>
			<li>A list of aims and needs that are less vital along the lines of<br /><em>Although the need for </em><span class="style_black">(state the need 
			you identify) </span><em>... is identifiable from the data, it is 
			not included in the proposal because </em><span class="style_black">
			(insert criteria [lack of time, not important for the majority of 
			stakeholders, not feasible given the budgets and resources available etc.])</span><em> 
			so does not form part of the proposal's targets.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Here's a coherent way of structuring this part of your 
		assignment.&nbsp; Note the need to insert a discussion section into the 
		heart of the description and how that is differently staged and 
		structured.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="sit analysis" height="361" src="../../delta_images/situation_analysis_structure_m3.png" width="620" /><br />

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>The appendices are <em>extra</em></h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
		These do not take the place of discussion in the main text.<br />
		You need to include all the instruments you used to gather data.&nbsp; 
		Do not summarise the outcomes here &ndash; the summary belongs in the main 
		text.<br />
		In the appendix, include all the data you gathered so that the 
		discussion (see above) of effectiveness, advantages and disadvantages is 
		clear to a reader who takes the time to refer to the appendix but also 
		to one who takes the data on trust.</p>
		<hr />

					<h2>Review what you have written</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This section of the assignment carries 20% of the marks available 
			for the whole assignment so it's important to read through it again when 
		you have finished (or think you have) and check how a reader will react 
		to it.<br />
			In particular, will a reader know:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style12">
			<li>how and why you have targeted your situation analysis?</li>
			<li>that you have conducted procedures which are relevant to what 
			you need to learn?</li>
			<li>what your rationale for the design of the procedures was and 
			that you are aware of any drawbacks which may affect how clean the 
			data are?</li>
			<li>what you have prioritised and why?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If the answer to any of these questions is No or Maybe, go back and 
		re-write some of the section.</p>
