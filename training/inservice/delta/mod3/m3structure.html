			<h2>The mechanics</h2>
		<p>This is repeated from <a href="../mod2/essaywriting.html">the guide 
		to writing a Delta Background Essay</a> because it has obvious relevance 
		here.&nbsp; Skip this bit if you have followed that guide.</p>
			<h3>Referencing</h3>
			<p>You will need to make sure that the in-text referencing and the 
			bibliography follow a standard convention.<br />
			For details, go to a website for advice.&nbsp; There’s a good guide 
			to the Harvard referencing system 
			produced for Anglia Ruskin University that you can access
			<a href="https://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm" target="_blank">
			by clicking here</a>.<br />
			Briefly, however:</p>
			<h4 class="auto-style9">For in-text references</h4>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>Books and articles</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>At every point in the text where there is a particular 
				reference, include the author’s surname and the year of 
				publication with page numbers if you are quoting specific words 
				– for example:<br />
				<span class="style_brown">In his survey of the social habits of Delta tutors, Bloggs (1998) 
			refuted that ...</span><br />
			or<br />
				<span class="style_brown">In his survey of the social habits of 
				Delta tutors, Bloggs (1998: 19) states that, "<em>I can assert without fear of successful 
			contradiction that …</em>"</span><br />
				Make sure that it is 100% clear where your writing stops and a 
				quotation begins, either by using inverted commas or indenting 
				the citation etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>Website references</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>You may not know the author’s name or date (but give them as above 
			if you do) so this is acceptable:<br />
				<span class="style_brown">It has been suggested (Wikipedia (2013)) that …</span></dd>
			</dl>
		<dl>
				<dt><strong>For the bibliography</strong></dt>
				<dd>For ease of access, you may like to divide your bibliography into 
			Books and Articles, Teaching Materials and Electronic resources.</dd>
				<dt class="auto-style5"><strong><em>Books</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>List references in alphabetical order by the surname of the 
				first author.&nbsp; If the author is unknown you should use 
				“Anon”<br />
				For up to three authors include all names; if there are more 
				than three, give the first author’s surname and initials 
				followed by <em>et al</em>.<br />
				Provide, in this order and format:
			Author surname/s and initial/s + ed. or eds. (if editor/s), Year of 
			publication, <em>Title in italics</em>, Edition (if not the first edition) as 
			ordinal number + ed., Place of publication: Publisher<br />
			For example:<br /><span class="style_brown">Jones, D, ed., 1995, 
				<em>My Teaching and Other Fiascos</em>, 5th ed., London: 
				Concourse publications</span></dd>
				<dt class="auto-style5"><strong><em>Articles</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>Include also: full journal title, volume number (issue number) and 
			page numbers, for example,<br /><span class="style_brown">Bloggs, T, 1997, 
				<em>Developing fluency through ferret keeping</em>, English 
			Language Teaching Journal, 41, 3 pp. 18-83</span></dd>
				<dt class="auto-style5"><strong><em>Electronic resources</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>E-journals – include full URL and date of access, for example:<br />
				<span class="style_brown">Bloggs TA, Brown GC, 2012, <em>Spoken English in 
				Weston super Mare</em>, in 
			The Wandering Linguist [online], p. 105. Available from: http://www.wanderling.com/1111 [Accessed 23/08/2004]</span></dd>
				<dt class="auto-style5"><strong><em>Websites</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>Supply author/s or corporate body, date of publication / 
				last update or copyright date, available from: URL [Accessed 
				date], for example:<span class="style_brown"><br />
				eltconcourse.com, 
				<em>How to write a Delta Background Essay,</em> available from: 
			http://www.eltconcourse.com/this page [accessed 02/11/2014]</span><br />
			or:<br /><span class="style_brown">Bloggs, T, (no date), <em>Ideas for a Creating a 
				Happy Classroom</em>, 
			available from http://eltconcourse.com/training/happiness.pdf [Accessed 
			03/07/2014]</span></dd>
			</dl>
		<h3>Avoiding accusations of plagiarism</h3>
			<ol class="auto-style6">
				<li>You are expected to do wide reading and research on the 
			Delta course so never be afraid to show that you have accessed a 
			range of other people’s work – nobody is expecting you to originate 
			all the ideas and information in your work.</li>
				<li>Read your essays and check whether everything that is not in your 
			own words or from your own resources has been acknowledged.</li>
				<li>Make sure that you include in your bibliography anything you 
			refer to in the text and exclude any reading to which you do not 
			make explicit reference.&nbsp; This includes materials that you put in 
			appendices and use in lessons and plans, by the way.</li>
				<li>Don’t be tempted to think that if you have changed a few words 
			from a source you have read that you don’t need to acknowledge it – 
			you do.</li>
				<li>If in any doubt – reference it.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Latin abbreviations</h3>
			<p>Using the following is conventional but unimpressive if used 
			wrongly.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em>i.e.</em></dt>
				<dd>means <em>that is</em>, being the English translation of the 
				Latin <em>id 
			est.</em>&nbsp; It should not be confused with <em>e.g</em>.</dd>
				<dt><em>e.g.</em></dt>
				<dd>means <em>for example</em>, and is the translation of the 
				Latin <em>exempli gratia.</em></dd>
				<dt><em>cf.</em></dt>
				<dd>means <em>compare with</em> or <em>consult</em>, being short 
				for <em>conferre.&nbsp; </em>In Latin it was an invitation to 
				the reader to consult an alternative source to compare with what 
				is being said.&nbsp; In English, it usually simply means <em>
				compare</em>.</dd>
				<dt><em>et al.</em></dt>
				<dd>means <em>and others</em> and comes from the Latin <em>et alia oret alii</em>.&nbsp; 
				Use it when there are more than three authors.</dd>
				<dt><em>et seq.</em></dt>
				<dd>This is the Latin abbreviation for <em>et sequens</em> and 
				it means <em>and what follows</em>.&nbsp; It is used to direct 
				the reader to a page or paragraph in a text and note that this 
				is where the relevant section starts.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>See Smith, 1992:350 et seq.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>sic</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is the Latin for <em>so</em> or <em>thus</em>.&nbsp; If 
				you want to quote something that is incorrect or oddly phrased, 
				use this in brackets after the words or phrase to show that this 
				is how it appears in the original text.&nbsp; That way, the 
				reader will not think it is your mistake.&nbsp; Do not correct 
				anything that you are citing directly.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teacher in the home institution 
				informed us that "this class are mixed of reading level (sic)".</em></dd>
				<dt><em>viz.</em></dt>
				<dd>is the usual abbreviation for<em> videlicet</em> which means
				<em>namely</em> or <em>that is to say</em>.&nbsp; It should not 
				be confused with i.e.</dd>
				<dt><em>q.v.</em></dt>
				<dd>stands for <em>quod vide</em>, which means <em>which see</em> and 
				refers to a term that should be looked up elsewhere in a 
				document.&nbsp; It is often used for cross referencing.</dd>
				<dt><em>ibid</em>.</dt>
				<dd>stands for <em>ibidem</em>, <em>in the same place</em> and is used in citations 
			to refer to the immediately preceding citation.</dd>
				<dt><em>op. cit.</em></dt>
				<dd>stands for <em>opere citato</em>, 
			<em>in the work cited</em>.&nbsp; It is used to refer to any 
				previously cited work, not just the last one.</dd>
				<dt><em>pace</em></dt>
				<dd>means something like <em>With all due respect</em> <em>to</em> 
				and is used by authors to show respect for the holder of a view 
				with which they disagree (often disrespectfully).</dd>
				<dt><em>passim</em></dt>
				<dd>means very approximately <em>throughout</em> or <em>
				frequently</em> and refers to an idea or concept that occurs in 
				many places in a cited work so a particular page reference is 
				inappropriate.</dd>
			</dl>
			<h3>Integrating citation</h3>
		<p>A section of the advice guide to writing Module Two Background Essays 
		is concerned with how any citations are a) properly references and b) 
		integrated into your text.<br />

			<h3>Style</h3>
			<p>See <a href="../delta_style_guide.html" target="_blank">the guide to writing 
			style for Delta</a> for the much bigger picture concerning how to write, 
			reference and present your essay.<br />
			If you would prefer that guide (which is quite long) as a PDF file, 
			click
			<a href="../delta_documents/ELT_Concourse_Delta_style_guide.pdf" target="_blank">
			here</a>.</p>
		<p>This is an academic essay so you need to maintain a certain 
			formality.</p>
			<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
				<li>Avoid non-standard abbreviations, contractions and so on.</li>
				<li>Do not use slang or overly colloquial language.</li>
				<li>Use the first person only when you are referring directly to your 
			own experience.&nbsp; If you want to state your opinion, hedge it 
				with something like, <span class="style_brown"><em>It can, however, 
				be argued from my experience that ...</em></span></li>
				<li>Use subheadings which actually relate to the following text.</li>
				<li>Use bullet points sparingly and not as a substitute for connected 
			prose.&nbsp; Lists and tables are helpful but you must discuss their content.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The word count</h3>
		<p>The word limits are absolute: the assignment must be between 4000 and 
		4500 words long.&nbsp; If your assignment is over the word count by up 
		to 100 words, it will be marked but you will be penalised.<br />
		<strong>If the assignment is over 4600 words or under 3900 words, it will be returned to you 
		unmarked.</strong></p>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Cambridge have clear guidelines for the mechanics of how the 
			essay should look and you should follow them to the letter.&nbsp; 
			They are:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>File names and formats:<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
					<li>no more than two documents</li>
					<li>a Word (.doc or .docx) for the main text</li>
					<li>the main text file name must be: centre number_candidate 
					number_surname_Delta3_specialism abbreviation_month year.&nbsp; 
					For example:<br />
					00111_017_bloggs_Delta3_EAP_0618.docx</li>
					<li>a Word or PDF document for the appendices</li>
					<li>the appendix file name must be: centre number_candidate 
					number_surname_Delta3_appendices_month year.&nbsp; For 
					example:<br />
					00111_017_bloggs_Delta3_appendices_0618.pdf</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>2.5 cm margins all round</li>
				<li>a title page with your identifiers (candidate number and 
				centre number included)</li>
				<li>a contents page</li>
				<li>page numbering throughout</li>
				<li>a footer with your name, candidate number and the title</li>
				<li>no footnotes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Do not include in the appendices any text which should appear in 
			the main essay.&nbsp; This means that a reader should be able to 
			follow your discussion without reference to the appendices at all.&nbsp; 
			Appendices are there to support what you say, not summarise it.</p>
		<p>The Cambridge regulations for the appendices are slightly different 
		depending on whether you are submitting an essay on an ELT specialism or 
		on an ELT Management topic:</p>

			</table>
		<p>The finished article for Module Three is an Information report.&nbsp; 
		As such, it has (or should have) certain conventional features which 
		will occur repeatedly.&nbsp; The essay is long at 4500 words so each 
		section will follow a conventional structure embedded in the whole.<br />
		In other words, the overall structure is an information report and the 
		sections within it are sub-reports following the same staging and 
		structure.&nbsp; That is what the reader expects.</p>
		<h4>Information report structure</h4>
		<p>The report will have three sections and so will each mini-report 
		embedded within it.&nbsp; These sections are</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>A general statement identifying the topic (either overall or 
			of each sub-section)</dt>
			<dd>For the report as a whole, this will probably be quite a long 
			section which introduces the topic, makes it clear to the reader 
			what the focus is and how it will be addressed.<br />
			For each sub-section of the report, you will also need this stage to 
			make it clear to the reader what will follow.&nbsp; For example<em><br />
			<span class="style_brown"><strong>Pre-testing</strong><br />
			Given the nature of the learners and their rather precise aims, it 
			was necessary to construct a pre-test which would identify the 
			learners' current abilities in the four areas of competence the 
			course is designed to address.</span></em></dd>
			<dd>or<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><strong><em>Needs analysis</em></strong><em><br />
			For this group, needs analysis was conducted in two ways: a) through 
			a meeting with the group's sponsor and a representative of the group 
			and b) via a questionnaire completed independently by each group 
			member.</em></span><br />
			or, for an ELT Management assignment:<br />
			<em class="style_brown"><strong>Situation analysis</strong><br />
			Because the focus of this innovation concerned better meeting the 
			needs of our learners in in-company teaching programmes, the 
			analysis was focused in two ways: a) on the perceptions of the 
			participants, gathering data via questionnaires and focus-groups and 
			b) by conducting lengthy meetings with the management and human 
			resource departments of the companies with whom the institution has 
			long-standing and amicable relationships.</em><br />
			These examples identify the focus of the sub-section and give 
			the reader some inkling of what is to follow, i.e. a description and 
			discussion of the testing formats, items and procedures with comment 
			on each or the same for the needs analysis.</dd>
			<dt>Description</dt>
			<dd>Here you insert the body of what you are writing about, 
			describing and evaluating as you go along.</dd>
			<dt>Conclusion</dt>
			<dd>Here you identify the most salient parts of the report and 
			comment overall on achievement (or otherwise).</dd>
		</dl>
		<h4>Discussion structure</h4>
		<p>Within each section, you will probably need to insert some discussion 
		of procedures, plans, tests, needs or situation analyses and so on.&nbsp; These 
		sections (or sub-sub-sections) take a slightly different form:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>A general statement identifying the issue</dt>
			<dd>For example,<br />
			<em><span class="style_brown">Relying on only a two-fold needs 
			analysis procedure was the only practical way forward, given the 
			time constraints.</span><br />
			</em>or<em><br />
			<span class="style_brown">Given the constraint that the management 
			of the companies with whom we work have limited time available to 
			devote to investigating the needs of their employees for language 
			skills, it was thought that best way to gather the data we need to 
			align our courses more closely to our clients' needs was to ...</span><br />
			</em>These examples identify the focus of the sub-section and gives the 
			reader some inkling of what is to follow, i.e. a discussion of the 
			merits and demerits of the procedure.</dd>
			<dt>Arguments for</dt>
			<dd>Here you set out the merits and the success of the procedure.&nbsp; 
			There should be a number of points made here.</dd>
			<dt>Arguments against</dt>
			<dd>Here you set out the drawbacks.</dd>
			<dt>Conclusion</dt>
			<dd>Here you reach a balanced and fair conclusion regarding the 
			efficacy of what you did.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>An alternative but equally valid structure is to mix arguments for 
		and against in a series rather than confining them to lists of one or 
		the other so the format goes: For &gt; Against &gt; For &gt; Against &gt; For &gt; 
		Against &gt; etc. rather than For &gt; For &gt; For followed by Against &gt; Against 
		&gt; Against etc.</p>
		<h3>On mixing things up</h3>
		<p>A sure-fire way to confuse your reader and lose coherence is to mix 
		in to discussions things which belong in the information reports and <em>
		vice versa.<br />
		</em>For example, if you are discussing the efficacy of the tests, 
		questionnaires, meetings, focus groups or other data-gathering 
		techniques, that is the place to comment on how successful they were 
		in terms of validity, comprehensiveness and accuracy etc.&nbsp; It is not the place to describe the 
		procedures.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you are describing the reasons behind 
		the selection of analysis formats, this is not the place to 
		discuss their (dis)advantages.&nbsp; That belongs in the discussion 
		which follows or precedes the description.</p>

		<p>Here is some advice and questions to answer for both types of essay:</p>
		<ul class="greybulletlist">
			<li>Refer to your introduction here and to the principles you set 
			out to follow.&nbsp; How have you applied these principles?</li>
			<li>What benefits do you perceive the proposal / course will have?<br />
			Do not simply list them, relate them to parts of your proposal.</li>
			<li>What are the limitations of your proposal?<br />
			Consider drawbacks and constraints.</li>
		</ul>

			<p>More detail is available from the Cambridge website which 
		contains a detailed look at the Management option rather than the other 
		topics (it's available at
		http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/teaching-english/teaching-qualifications/delta/how-to-prepare-for-delta/).</p>
		<p>The handbook for all Delta Modules is available from
		http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/images/181161-delta-handbook-for-tutors-and-candidates-document.pdf </p>
		<p>Your report is marked as follows:</p>

		<p>It looks like this:</p>
		<table class="auto-style26">

		<p>You can see that the marks are spread pretty evenly so you have to 
		give each section equal attention and probably equal space.</p>
		<p>Module Three is marked externally out of a maximum possible mark of 
		140.&nbsp; The marks you need to get are, approximately:<br />
			Pass: 80 | Pass with Merit: 100 | Pass with Distinction: 120</p>

		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>Here's a summary of the report structure.&nbsp; You may like to print 
		it out and keep it to hand while you write.<br />
