	<h1>Module Three ELT specialism: choosing your topic</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="choice" height="207" src="../../../images/choice_sweets310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<h2>What are the choices?</h2>
		<p>Before you set out on the Delta Module Three, you need to consider 
		how you will choose the topic.<br />
		Here are the options according to Cambridge's Handbook for Module 
		Three</p>
		<ul class="greybulletlist">
			<li>Business English (BE)</li>
			<li>Teaching young learners/young adults (specified age group 
			required within a 5-year range e.g. 8–13, 14–19) (YL)</li>
			<li>English for Specific Purposes (ESP)</li>
			<li>English for Academic Purposes (EAP)</li>
			<li>Teaching examination classes (EX)</li>
			<li>Teaching one-to-one (1to1)</li>
			<li>ESOL learners with literacy needs (ESOLLIT)</li>
			<li>CLIL/Embedded ESOL (teaching English through subject/work‑based 
			learning) (CLIL)</li>
			<li>Teaching monolingual classes (MON)</li>
			<li>Teaching multilingual classes (MUL)</li>
			<li>Teaching in an English-speaking environment (ESE)</li>
			<li>Teaching in a non-English-speaking environment (NESE)</li>
			<li>Teaching learners online/through distance/blended learning (DL)</li>
			<li>Teaching English to learners with special requirements, e.g. 
			visual/hearing impairment, dyslexia, ASD (SR)</li>
			<li>Language development for teachers (LDT)</li>
			<li>Language support (e.g. on mainstream teaching 
			programmes, specialist skills support, such as supporting writing 
			needs) (LS).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These are large areas in themselves so within your choice, you will 
		need to narrow the scope to something manageable.&nbsp; For example, 
		within Teaching Examination Classes, you should focus on a particular 
		examination and designing a course to prepare people for it.&nbsp; 
		Within English for Specific Purposes, of course, the range of possible 
		specialisms is very wide.<br />
		Nevertheless, in the introduction to your Module Three essay, in which 
		you review the general area and set out the key issues, you need to 
		focus on the specialism as a whole, not the group or the course type 
		which will later be the focus.<br />
		That means, for example, reviewing the key issues in teaching 
		examination classes before you focus on a course designed to prepare for 
		a particular examination.&nbsp; Equally, if your focus is on English for 
		Specific Purposes, you need to review the general area of ESP teaching 
		before you get to the details of the course you are designing.</p>
		<p>In addition, you may choose to focus on ELT management for Module 
		Three.&nbsp; For this, you will have to select from four areas:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Academic management</li>
			<li>Human resource management (HRM)</li>
			<li>Customer service</li>
			<li>Marketing</li>
		</ol>
		<p>There is more advice in <a href="eltm/m3_eltm_topicchoice.html">the guide 
		to selecting a management option topic</a>.&nbsp; Here, too, the advice is to narrow down the area to something like, 
		e.g., <em>Introducing a new course management system</em> or <em>
		Enhancing in-house development programmes</em> etc.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="decide" height="166" src="../../../images/choice_doors250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>How do I decide?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>That's a very wide choice so, to narrow it down, look at the things 
		you are going to need to do for Module Three and ask yourself whether 
		you have enough background knowledge and experience already to know what 
		you need to research and read.&nbsp; Now is not a good time to be 
		considering something wholly outside your teaching experience (unless 
		you have a lot of time on your hands).</p>
		<p>In outline, again from the handbook, you must do five things:</p>
		<ol class="greybulletlist">
			<li>research a chosen specialism</li>
			<li>understand and use appropriate methods of needs 
			analysis/diagnostic assessment for a specific group of learners</li>
			<li>understand and apply key principles underpinning syllabus design 
			and course planning</li>
			<li>consider learner assessment and course evaluation</li>
			<li>synthesise all your learning into a project which can be 
			coherently presented to a third party</li>
		</ol>
		<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="five" height="166" src="../../../images/five_ducks250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>One at a time</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<h3>research a chosen specialism</h3>
		<p>For this part of the Module, you will be assessed on your grasp of 
		the topic area.&nbsp; This includes:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Review of the relevant literature in the topic area</dt>
			<dd>This means you have to have access to a range of resources, of 
			course.&nbsp; For certain topics, such as CLIL, there really isn't 
			much available.&nbsp; For others, such as Business English, there's 
			a wealth of data.&nbsp; Choose something practical to research.</dd>
			<dt>Understanding of key issues in the topic area</dt>
			<dd>Note the words 'key' and 'in the topic area'.&nbsp; Points here 
			have to be relevant and prioritised by importance.</dd>
			<dt>Application of knowledge to practice and identification of key 
			issues</dt>
			<dd>If you have little or no experience of teaching in your topic 
			area, you will find this very difficult to do.&nbsp; You need to 
			refer to classroom practice here.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h3>understand and use appropriate methods of needs analysis/diagnostic 
		assessment for a specific group of learners</h3>
		<p>For this part of the module you will be assessed on your 
		understanding of testing and needs analysis and your ability to examine 
		the results and justify priorities for the learner(s).&nbsp; There is a 
		key guide on this site to <a href="../../background/testing.html">
		testing, evaluation and assessment</a> but you will need to apply this 
		to your chosen topic.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You will need to understand how diagnostic testing works, how it 
			can be made valid and reliable and what sorts of tests are 
			appropriate to the learners.</li>
			<li>Then you will have to analyse the results of the test(s) and needs 
			analysis and discuss the outcomes and implications.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>understand and apply key principles underpinning syllabus design and 
		course planning</h3>
		<p>Here, you have to show that you understand the key principles of 
		syllabus and course design.&nbsp;
		<a href="../../background/syllabusdesign.html">There's a guide to 
		syllabus types</a> on this site to get you started.<br />
		Then you will have to set out a justification for the learning aims that 
		emerged from the testing and needs analysis.<br />
		Finally, you need to design the course.</p>
		<h3>consider learner assessment and course evaluation</h3>
		<p>Again you will need to draw on your knowledge of achievement testing 
		(and making it reliable) and also on a range of other ways to evaluate 
		how successful the course has been.</p>
		<h3>synthesise all their learning into a project which can be coherently 
		presented to a third party</h3>
		<p>If you have followed the guide to writing Delta background essays you 
		will be aware of the ways to make sure you maintain relevance and 
		reference acceptably.<br />
		The genre of Module Three is fundamentally an information report but 
		it's a long document so there will be embedded sections which follow the 
		staging and structure of a discussion, setting out arguments on either 
		side of an issue.<br />
		For a little more on this, review <a href="../../eap/genre_eap.html">the guide to genre 
		in English for Academic Purposes</a>.</p>
		<p>Clearly, no site like this can cover all the specialisms so only 
		general structuring advice can be given.<br />
		That's the topic of the guide to how to write Module Three.</p>
