				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There is a wide range of things that you might want to know, of 
		course, and a list was provided on the general guide to this area.<br />
		Now you need to select from that list those areas which are important 
		to your learner(s).<br />
		Here are two examples:</p>
		<h4><a name="eg1"></a>Example 1</h4>
		<p>You are focused on 
		an examination group preparing for the IELTS Academic Format and 
		intending to go on to study at an institute of Higher Education in the 
		UK (a popular choice).</p>
		<p>The first thing to note is that learners will have a common set of 
		needs arising from the nature of the examination.&nbsp; The IELTS 
		website describes the function of the examination as</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>
			<span class="auto-style21">The Academic format is, broadly speaking, for 
		those who want to study or train in an English-speaking university or 
		Institutions of Higher and Further Education.&nbsp; Admission to 
		undergraduate and postgraduate courses is based on the results of the 
		Academic test.</span><span class="auto-style18"><br />
		</span>
		</em><span class="auto-style14">(https://www.ielts.org/test_takers_information/what_is_ielts/academic_or_general_training.aspx.&nbsp; 
		This site also gives you extensive information concerning the nature of 
		the test items and the marking scheme, of course.)</span></p>
		<p>We can already make a few judgements concerning the learners' needs 
		because we know two crucial things already.&nbsp; What are they?&nbsp; 
		<a href="#eg1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'m3na1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have an answer to that</a>.</p>
		<div id="m3na1" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
		<p><span class="auto-style22">We know:</span></p>
		<ol class="auto-style22">
			<li>The range of skills that the students will need to deploy to get 
			the score they need in the examination</li>
			<li>We also know that, thereafter, the learners will need to deploy 
			the language in an English-speaking environment generally and an 
			academic one in particular</li>
		</ol>
		</div><p>This is not the place to plan an IELTS / EAP course for you so there 
		won't be a list here of the areas you need to investigate further.<br />
		However, the general point here is that before you conduct a needs 
		analysis you already know what to look for because the aims of the 
		course have been clearly set out.&nbsp; In this example, the aims are:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>To prepare the learners for the demands of the IELTS examination</li>
			<li>To prepare the learners to function successfully in an 
			English-medium academic setting and in an English-speaking 
			environment generally</li>
		</ol>
		<h4><a name="eg2"></a>Example 2</h4>
		<p>You are focused on a mono-lingual (German) General English summer 
		course for teenagers (15-17 years old).&nbsp; They are coming to the UK 
		for a 2-week, 30-hour language course mixed with some social activities 
		and an excursion programme.&nbsp; They will stay in a university 
		residence block.</p>
		<p><a name="eg3"></a>Again, we have three crucial bits of information before we start.&nbsp; 
		What are they?&nbsp; 
		<a href="#eg2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'m3na2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have an answer</a>.</p>
		<div id="m3na2" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
		
		<ol class="auto-style22">
			<li>We know the ages of the students and can make some kind of 
			estimation of their needs in terms of activity types and topic 
			focuses</li>
			<li>We know their first language and that will prepare us for many 
			lexical and structural issues that we need to address on a course</li>
			<li>We know where, at least in the short-term, the learners will have 
			to deploy English (which won't be with host families)</li>
		</ol>
		</div>
		<p>However, there's a lot we still don't know and will need to find out 
		before the course can be planned.&nbsp; Make a list of the things you 
		would want to know and then 
		<a href="#eg3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'m3na3',0,'style.visibility','visible')">click here to see if you coincide</a>.&nbsp; 
		Obviously, there's no 'right' answer but, equally obviously, there are 
		certain things which should be on the list.</p>
		<div id="m3na3" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden"><ol class="auto-style22">
			<li><strong>skills: </strong>are the learners going to need to take 
			any kind of examination or are they only focused on improving 
			certain skills?&nbsp; If so, what are they and are there any 
			identifiable subskills needs?</li>
			<li><strong>accuracy levels: </strong>is it important that the learners focus on producing accurate 
			language or is basic communicative competence the aim?</li>
			<li><strong>lexis and structure</strong>: often, these kinds of 
			students are grammar-rich but lexis-poor.&nbsp; Is this the case 
			here?</li>
			<li><strong>functions:</strong> are there specific functions (such as asking for permission, 
			inviting, offering, declining etc.) which the learners will need 
			and/or can't yet handle?</li>
			<li><strong>learning styles</strong>: are there particularly common 
			learning styles in the group?&nbsp; What kinds of activities will 
			they respond well to?</li>
			<li><strong>interests</strong>: are there any topics of common 
			interest to most of the group?&nbsp; Will the excursions have a 
			bearing?</li>
			<li><strong>level</strong>: what is the learners' current level?&nbsp; 
			Is it a reasonably homogenous group?</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Your list and this one should coincide in many cases but we will all 
		have a slightly different response.</p>
		
		<p><span class="style_red"><strong>Task: Now do the same thing for 
		your chosen focus group or learner.</strong></span></p>
		</div><p>The moral of all this is to make sure that the aims of the 
		course (its learning outcomes) should be explicit <em>before</em> you 
		conduct a needs analysis in any depth.&nbsp; That way, you are armed 
		with a short-list of things you need to know and can get on with 
		planning how to find them out.</p>
		<hr />

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Finding out</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>In what follows, the assumption is that you are not in daily contact 
		with the learners and do not have the opportunity to interview them face 
		to face.&nbsp; The needs analysis will, perforce, be carried out on paper or 
		online.</p>
		<p>At this point, you need to refresh your memory concerning the various 
		ways to ask questions that were covered in the general guide to 
		constructing a needs analysis.<br />
		There is a guide, almost a mini-course, on this site to
		<a href="../../../../../development/classroom_research.html" target="_blank">
		doing classroom research</a> (new tab).&nbsp; It will help you formulate 
		questions and see how to do research that provides usable and objective 
		data.&nbsp; You are advised to follow that guide.<br />
		The trick, if there is one, is to make the question type match the kind 
		of information you are after.&nbsp; The following uses the two examples 
		above of group types.<br />
		See if you can fill in the 
		right-hand side of this table and then click on it to compare the 
		response with your notes.</p>
		<p>
		<img id="img1" alt="needs analysis task" height="258" src="../../delta_images/m3natask.png" width="500" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'../../delta_images/m3nataskresponse.png'); FP_changeProp(/*id*/'comments',0,'style.visibility','visible')" /></p>
		<div id="comments"style ="visibility:hidden">
		
		<p>Comments:</p>
		<p>The lists won't coincide because some data can be gathered by 
		alternative means.&nbsp; However:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Because you can't possible list all the topics that might be of 
			interest, you have to narrow the focus and a scaling task seems a 
			good way of being able to identify which topics will appeal to the 
			majority while avoiding those which are of great appeal to a 
			minority only.</li>
			<li>Self-assessments of skills levels and skills needs lend 
			themselves to matrix-style questions because they can be given the 
			same range of four options.&nbsp; It also allows you to provide the 
			metalanguage in a comprehensible way for things like speaking 
			subskills.</li>
			<li>A matrix question asking people to score between 
			one and ten provides quite fine information but it's only worth 
			setting these if you can respond to the fineness of data that you 
			get.&nbsp; In this case, too, the advantage is that you can give the 
			learners a list of possible classroom interaction patterns.</li>
			<li>Because you can't predict the range of areas of study in advance 
			and there will be only one answer per learner, a simple question is 
			the best way.&nbsp; Later, you will have to draw on that range for 
			course-content planning.</li>
		</ol>
		</div><p>Once you have constructed the questionnaire and have got someone else 
		to proofread it for accuracy and lack of ambiguity, you can administer 
		it and analyse the results mathematically.<br />
		For Module Three, you will need to draw out the most important results 
		which impinge on course planning, prioritise them and then integrate 
		them into your description of the course, justifying as you go along.</p>
		<p>For an example of a basic needs analysis form in PDF format,
		<a href="../../../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_Example_basic_needs_analysis.pdf" target="_blank">
		click here</a>.&nbsp; Clearly, what you use will have to more 
		sophisticated and better targeted than this little example but the 
		principles are the same.</p>

		<p>Part of the Needs Analysis will involve some form of diagnostic

		<p>The Needs analysis comes first.&nbsp; You cannot design a decent

		<p>In the diagram below, the Conclusion section of the needs analysis 
		discussion includes <span class="style_black"><em>Identify salient 
		outcomes</em></span>.&nbsp; This means you must <strong>list and 
		prioritise</strong> the outcomes of the analysis.&nbsp; It also means 
		that you need to say what the criteria are that you used to prioritise 
		the needs.<br />
		It will help to write two lists:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A list of the essentials along the lines of<br />
			<em>This need is important because </em><span class="style_black">
			(insert the criteria you used to identify this fact)</span><em> ... 
			and is included in the </em><span class="style_black">(insert a 
			clear reference to which part of the course design you are talking 
			about)</span><em> ... section of the Course Design (see page x).</em></li>
			<li>A list of aims and needs that are less vital along the lines of<br /><em>Although the need for </em><span class="style_black">(state the need 
			you identify) </span><em>... is identifiable from the data, it is 
			not included in the course because </em><span class="style_black">
			(insert criteria [lack of time, not important for the majority of 
			participants, not feasible given the learners' level etc.])</span><em> 
			so does not form part of the course targets although it is addressed 
			in </em><span class="style_black">(state part of the course design 
			where you address this need, if in fact, you do)</span><em>.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Here's a coherent way of structuring this part of your 
		assignment.&nbsp; Note the need to insert a discussion section into the 
		heart of the description and how that is differently staged and 
		structured.</p>

			<li>The results of both of the above (a table format is easiest) but
