			<h1>Study skills for <span class="deltablue">Delta</span>: what you have to be able to do</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="stdy" height="207" src="../../images/reading_revision310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This is a guide that you should be following before you start a 
			Delta course, not when you are coping with the demands of being in 
			one.</p>
			<p>There is a sister guide to this one called <strong>Be prepared 
			for Delta</strong> and the aim of that is to introduce you to the 
			broad outlines of some key concepts that you will encounter on the 
			course.&nbsp; That way, you will be able to recognise what it is that 
			your tutors are talking about or that you are being asked to read 
			about and set the ideas and issues in some kind of context.<br />
			If 
			you would like to open that guide in a new tab,
			<a class="deltahighlightlink" href="delta_preparing.html">click here</a>.</p>
			<p>This guide is different because it focuses not on what you need 
			to <strong>know</strong> but on what you will need to be able to
			<strong>do</strong> in terms of learning, thinking, writing and 
			teaching successfully to pass a course.<br />
			It is arranged in six sections which more or less follow the 
			taxonomy of skills developed originally by Bloom (1956) and revised 
			later by Anderson and Krathwohl.&nbsp; That taxonomy seeks to set 
			out:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">a framework for classifying statements of what 
			we expect or intend students to learn as a result of instruction.<br />
			<span class="auto-style9">Krathwohl, 2002:212</span></p>
			<p>and it applies to you as much as your learners.<br />
			In what follows, we'll be using the verbs we need to describe each 
			of the skills you need to deploy on a course and we'll also try to 
			identify what it is that the tasks you are set (or choose to take 
			on) during a course are asking you to do.&nbsp; For that, we'll 
			focus on some more verbs.</p>

			</table>
			<p>When you are sitting at your desk preparing to teach or reading 
			about teaching and language, there's little you have to remember 
			because references are to hand and there is time to think.<br />
			However, in the Module One examination and when you are actually 
			teaching, there are no references to hand so you have to rely on 
			your memory alone.&nbsp; There is no short cut to memorising facts 
			and terminology but help is at hand on this site.&nbsp; In the 
			Module One section, you will find links to lots of terminology tests 
			and reading through the guides to various language and methodology 
			areas will acquaint you with more.<br />
			Advertisers, of course, are keen to discover how often people have 
			to see something before they remember it and the usual figure they 
			settle on is seven.&nbsp; We can do a bit better than that because 
			we are actively trying to remember something rather than have it 
			foisted on us by an advertising copy writer.&nbsp; A better rule for 
			us is around four times:</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>the first time you read, see or hear a fact, it may wash 
				over you unconsciously or you may take a little notice</li>
				<li>the second time, you will be reminded that you have seen or 
				heard it before</li>
				<li>the third time it will be familiar and</li>
				<li>the fourth time, you will be able to recall it actively</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To shorten the time it takes to remember something, it's a useful 
			idea to write it down.&nbsp; The act of writing means that the fact 
			or idea is both noticed and recalled more easily.<br />
			However, if you never read through your notes, your time will have 
			been wasted because the item will be pushed out of your short-term 
			memory and deleted.<br />
			To make sure that it remains in your long-term memory, you have to 
			be aware of how your memory works.&nbsp; Schmidt (1990) provides the 
			following, based on Kihlstrom:</p>
			<img height="155" src="../../imagesgraphics/input.png" width="620" alt="input diagram" /><p>
			What this means is that you may pay attention to an item but if you 
			don't retrieve it from your short-term memory store and do something 
			with it (such as write it down), the item may be lost and forgotten.&nbsp; 
			The usual figure given by psychologists who specialise in this kind 
			of investigation is that the short-term or working memory store 
			decays in 20 to 30 seconds so that's the time in which you have to 
			make a note before the item is lost (lumen, no date).</p>
			<p><strong>Moral</strong>: take notes immediately on what you read 
			and hear and review them frequently, once the next day and once more 
			after a few days have elapsed.&nbsp; When you do the first review, 
			take the time to re-write the notes in a neater and more memorable 
			form.&nbsp; The act of doing so constitutes retrieval and rehearsal 
			and it is that process which contributes to the item sticking in 
			your long-term memory store.</p>
			<p>Verbs which are asking you to be able to recall ideas, concepts 
			and terms are, for example:<br />
			<em>Identify,
					List,
					Name,
					Recall,
					State,
					Tell, Define<br />
			</em>and so on.</p>

					<h2>Understanding</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It is, naturally, not enough to be able to remember lots of facts 
			and ideas.&nbsp; You need to understand them and demonstrate that you understand them.<br />
			There are some simple ways to make sure that you have understood 
			something:</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li><strong>Think of your own examples </strong>of what is 
				meant.&nbsp; E.g.:<br />
				If you come across a writer who says:<p class="auto-style8"><em>
				Irregular verbs in English fall into recognisably regular 
				patterns and that aids our learners' memory for them so, for 
				example, just as we have</em> ring-rang-rung<em>, we also have </em>
				sing-sang-sung, drink-drank-drunk <em>
				and so on.</em></p>
				OK, that's all true and the technical term for this is vowel 
				mutation so in a notebook, you should write:<p class="auto-style8">
				<em>Vowel mutation in irregular verbs forms: </em>
				sing-sang-sung, drink-drank-drunk, buy-bought-bought, 
				bring-brought-brought, seek-sought-sought
				<em>etc.</em></p>
				The simple fact that you have added your own examples to the 
				list demonstrates to you and anyone reading what you are writing 
				or listening to what you are saying that you have understood 
				what is meant by vowel mutation (also sometimes called umlaut).</li>
				<li><strong>Re-word what you hear or read </strong>in a way that 
				makes better sense to you.&nbsp; E.g.:<br />
				You have come across:<p class="auto-style8"><em>Formal practising (as in a classroom or home 
							study) can allow explicit knowledge to become 
							implicit (i.e., automatically produced)</em></p>
				and that's probably quite easy to understand but if you leave it 
				at that, you may not be able later to demonstrate that you 
				understand the idea, so you could re-express it as something 
				like:<p class="auto-style8"><em>Explicit knowledge can be shown 
				if a learner is able to say, for example, how question tags work 
				in English but to make that knowledge implicit and automatically 
				acted on requires extensive practice so that the forms are 
				produced almost without the learner needing to think consciously 
				about them.</em></p>
				and what you have done is demonstrated that you understand as 
				well as adding an example which shows that you have grasped the 
				essence of what you have read or heard.</li>
				<li><strong>Explain an idea</strong> to someone else.<br />
				A sure sign that you have understood something is the ability to 
				explain it to someone who does not know the fact and cannot 
				understand it until you make it clear.<br />
				Even if someone suitable is not near you, you can simulate this 
				by speaking aloud and imagining you are explaining the item to 
				someone else.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				You have read that:<p class="auto-style8"><em>Transferred 
				negation involves attaching the negation of a clause to the 
				first (main) rather than the subordinate clause in a sentence as 
				in, for example:<br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think Mary's coming<br /><em>rather than the less natural:<br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Mary's not coming</p>
				This is not a simple idea so now you have to sit back and try to 
				say how you would explain this to someone else using a different 
				example, of course.&nbsp; Perhaps something like:<p class="auto-style8">
				<em>The reason we say:<br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't believe it'll rain<br /><em>rather than<br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe it won't rain<br /><em>is that English often transfers the negative signal to the 
				subordinate clause.&nbsp; You can see this is true if you add a 
				tag question to the sentence because:<br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't believe it'll rain, will it?<br /><em>rather than<br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't believe it'll rain, do I?<br /><em>is the natural way to do this.</em></p>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Transfer</strong> from diagram to prose or vice 
				versa<br />
				Frequently, on this site and elsewhere, concepts are explained 
				through the use of diagrams (as above for memory issues) and one 
				way to be sure you have understood is to restate a diagram in 
				words or <em>vice versa</em>.<br />
				For example, a simple diagram such as:<br />
				<img alt="stress" height="58" src="../../imagesgraphics/stress-timed.png" width="310" /><br />
				can be explained in prose as:<p class="auto-style8"><em>In 
				predominately stress-timed languages, such as English and Dutch, 
				the four parts of:<br /></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I | want to | go to the | station<br /><em>although they contain a varied number of syllables (between one 
				and three), will take the same time to utter.<br />However, in predominately syllable-timed languages such as 
				French, each syllable will take the same time to utter so </em>want to<em> will take twice as long as 
				</em>I<em> and </em>go to 
				the<em> three times as long.</em></p>
				You can, naturally, do this the other way round and render prose 
				such as:<p class="auto-style8"><em>Material process verbs refer 
				to <strong>doing</strong>, i.e., to events in the world such as
				</em>break, explode, vanish, slide <em>and so on but behavioural 
				processes usually have animate subjects and include verbs such 
				as </em>sing, imagine, complain<em> and so on</em></p>
				as a diagram in a notebook like:<br /></li>
				<img alt="do" height="87" src="delta_images/do_example.jpg" width="310" /><br />which is simple enough to help you recall 
				<strong>and</strong> 
				demonstrate understanding of the types of verbal processes.</ul>
			<p>When you are writing on a Delta course, usually in a Background 
			Essay for Module Two, you need to show that you have understood the 
			concepts you are discussing and the system above works well in this 
			regard.&nbsp; Make sure you:</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>write clearly about what you have learned from authority or 
				experience (or both)</li>
				<li>exemplify it with your own example (not one culled from the 
				reference book)</li>
				<li>explain what it means</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and that requires you to write in prose as well as itemise ideas 
			and facts with lists and bullet points as we have done here.</p>
			<p>Verbs which are asking you to be able to demonstrate 
			understanding of ideas, concepts and terms are, for example:<br />
			<em>Compare,
					Describe,
					Discuss,
					Explain,
					Illustrate,
					Rephrase,
					Talk about<br />
			</em>and so on.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<h2>Applying</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Once you have managed to recall and understand terms and 
			concepts, it's time to ask yourself how to apply these to the real 
			worlds of teaching and learning.<br />
			In Delta Module Two Background Essays, this will mostly concern you 
			when you are setting out the teaching solutions to the issues you 
			have identified with the system or skill you have analysed.&nbsp; At 
			other times, for example, in the Module One examination, you are 
			explicitly marked on your ability to apply concepts to the data you 
			are given in the question paper.<br />
			In Module Three, too, whichever is your topic choice, you are 
			expected to demonstrate that you have read and understood a good 
			deal but also that you are able to apply what you know to real-life 
			scenarios.&nbsp; Here are some examples of how you may want to do 
			this:</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>For Module One, Paper 1, Task 4 (and other tasks in both 
				papers)<br />
				Here, for task 4, you are asked to identify strengths and 
				weaknesses in an example of learner output.&nbsp; To do that 
				accurately and clearly, you need to apply the terminology you 
				have learned and understood to the task so, for example, if you 
				are faced with a sentence such as:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>
				<span class="style_black">Although she didn't have much money, 
				but she was always generous</span><br />
				</em>it is necessary to identify what's wrong (the duplication 
				of the conjunctions) and then describe it as:<p class="auto-style8">
				<em>While it is a strength that the learner has begun correctly 
				to use </em>although<em> as a concessive subordinating 
				conjunction, she has also inserted a coordinating conjunction,
				</em>but<em>, which is misplaced.&nbsp; Most Chinese languages 
				double the conjunction in this way and that may be the source of 
				the error.</em></p>
				And in that you have recalled the terms correctly, demonstrated 
				that you understand them by noting the types of words and 
				applied your knowledge to the explicit example you are given.<br />
				Easy.</li>
				<li>For a Background Essay in Module Two<br />
				Here, you need to demonstrate the ability to apply your 
				knowledge and understanding to specific cases.<br />
				For example, if you have identified as a problem that the 
				English verbal aspect system is both complex and not usually 
				parallelled in learners' first languages, you now need to examine 
				how you might approach the issue in specific cases.&nbsp; To do 
				that, you need to introduce your idea with something like:<p class="auto-style8">
				<em>I noted above (Section 2.3.1) that learners whose first 
				languages do not have a perfect aspect, although they may have 
				somewhat parallel forms, often have difficulty grasping the 
				concept of relative or relational tenses.<br />
				The first step is raising awareness of the nature of a 
				relational tense in the perfect aspect such as:<br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John has finally arrived<br /><em>to allow the learners to see two things:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the tense refers to the present<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the nature of the present is determined by a past event<br />
				To do that, I ...</em></p>
				and then you go on to say what materials you use, how you 
				encourage learners to notice the meaning and so on.<br />
				That is application of knowledge and understanding to the real 
				world.</li>
				<li>In Module Three<br />
				In this Module, you are required either to set out a proposed 
				course programme or to set out a management proposal for change 
				in an organisation.&nbsp; In both cases, this requires the 
				application of knowledge and understanding of key ideas and 
				concepts to the task.<br />
				The trick is linkage so you could begin each section by stating:<p class="auto-style8">
				<em>The results of the needs analysis (Section 2.6) clearly show 
				that these learners require good levels of speaking and writing 
				skills in their work in English.&nbsp; Therefore, the first hour 
				of each day is devoted to these skills set in the topic areas of 
				meetings and technical reports to maintain relevance to their 
				professional setting (as identified in Section 2.2)</em>.</p>
				or<p class="auto-style8"><em>The results of the situation 
				analysis (Section 2.6) clearly show that the institution lacks 
				the necessary information technology skills in house.&nbsp; This 
				proposal, therefore, includes the option of outsourcing this 
				area of our work in order to maximise the efficient use of time.&nbsp; 
				The outsourced work will cover ....</em></p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you can see in all three of these examples, there is no point 
			in being able to apply knowledge and understanding if you do not 
			explicitly state what you are applying it to.</p>
			<p>Verbs which are asking you to demonstrate the ability 
			to apply your understanding of ideas, concepts and terms are, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>Apply,
					Complete,
					Demonstrate,
					Illustrate,
					Discuss, Relate, Explain, Outline<br />
			</em>and so on and they all occur in all three Modules.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Analysis goes hand-in-hand with application and may be considered 
			part of the ability to apply knowledge and understanding.<br />
			In particular, your ability to analyse data is tested and expected 
			in the following areas (but also throughout any decent course):</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>Module One, Paper 1, Task 5<br />
				This task asks you to look at a piece of text (usually written) 
				and identify not only the genre in which it is written or spoken 
				but also the nature of some of the expressions and language 
				items within it.&nbsp; That means you have to understand how to 
				analyse language.<br />
				If, for example, you are faced with a piece of text taken from 
				an instruction manual, you are likely to come across a 
				procedural text, at least in part, although other parts of a 
				text like this are often set out as information reports.&nbsp; 
				You need to know and understand the differences and the salient 
				characteristics of each text type and be able to apply your 
				knowledge to analysing the text.<br />
				An example of how this is done might be:<p class="auto-style8">
				<em>The text headings all refer to stages in the use of this 
				machine and the addition of numbered diagrams aids the reader to 
				know what part of the machine is being described.<br />
				The text itself, contains many behavioural verb processes, for 
				example ...<br />
				and the textual themes refer to the ordering of events as in ...<br />
				In particular, the use of the fronted and heavily marked 
				adverbials, </em>under no circumstances<em> (line 4) and </em>
				before attempting to dismantle ... (<em>line 18) show that care 
				is being taken to give explicit warnings and instructions which 
				is typical of a procedural text.</em></p>
				As you can see, analysis is more than description.</li>
				<li>Background Essays for Module Two<br />
				The core of any background essay is the section in which you do 
				two things:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>analyse the language system or skill you have selected</li>
					<li>identify issues for a range of learners in a range of 
					context and link them to the analysis</li>
				</ul>
				This requires you to analyse <strong>and</strong> apply the 
				analysis.&nbsp; A simple way, not the only way, to do this is to 
				interweave the analysis with the identification of issues for 
				learners.&nbsp; That way, you are in less danger of analysing 
				something you don't later discuss in terms of teaching and 
				learning or, far worse, identifying issues which you have not 
				analysed.</li>
				<li>Module Three<br />
				In both types of Module Three essays, you are required to 
				present the data that you have gathered either on the learners 
				for whom you are designing a course or on the institution for 
				which you are making a management proposal.&nbsp; In both cases, 
				you have to do more than present the data; you have to analyse 
				it and identify the key issues so that your proposal will be 
				linked to the data and your analysis of it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Verbs which are asking you to be able to demonstrate the ability 
			to analyse the data you have are, for example:<br />
			<em>Analyse,
					Categorize,
					Distinguish,
					Examine,
					Investigate,
					Organize<br />
			</em>and so on and they all occur in all three Modules.</p>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In all three modules of the Delta scheme, you are required to 
			make evaluations of the data you have, the ideas you are suggesting 
			and the ways you have gathered data and information.<br />
			Evaluation requires all the skills we have so far covered and in 
			addition it requires you to be explicit about the criteria you are 
			using to judge the target of the evaluation.<br />
			Evaluation is a high-level skill which requires you to apply all the 
			previous four skills.&nbsp; You have to judge what is relevant, what 
			is crucial and what is peripheral and make a judgement concerning 
			its effectiveness and usefulness.</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>In Module One, Paper 2<br />
				All three tasks in Paper Two require evaluation.<br />
				Task 1 requires you to look carefully at a test or an extract 
				from one and, given the purposes of the test, to evaluate how 
				well it will work to provide the data which the test setter 
				wants to extract.&nbsp; To do that, you have to look at the test 
				and judge it not only against a range of criteria you have learned 
				and understand but against the purpose for which it is intended.<br />
				It's no good saying that a test is, for example, unreliable, if 
				it is only intended to be administered&nbsp;once to a single 
				learner or small group.<br />
				Task 2 presents you with an extract from some teaching material 
				and asks for some identification and analysis of the purposes of 
				the tasks.&nbsp; It also, however, requires some evaluation of 
				the assumptions that the material writers were working from 
				concerning language, skills and learning that underlie the 
				materials.<br />
				Task 3 presents you with an extract or two from something such 
				as a methodology or resource book, a lesson plan, a discussion 
				of a lesson or tutor feedback.&nbsp; Your task is to answer a 
				series of questions about it based on your knowledge of 
				approaches, methods, theories, resources and roles.&nbsp; That 
				requires the application of all the skills we have so far 
				discussed and some evaluation of the material.</li>
				<li>In Module Two<br />
				In Background Essays, when you come to writing about teaching 
				solutions to the issues you have identified, you are explicitly 
				required to<em> evaluate how the selected procedures, 
				techniques, resources and or materials might be used effectively 
				in classroom practice</em>.<br />
				After you have taught an observed and assessed lesson, you have 
				to write a post-lesson Reflection and Evaluation document and, 
				as its name implies, part of this requires you to reflect on and 
				evaluate your own planning, teaching and the learners’ progress 
				as evidenced in this lesson.<br />
				In the Professional Development Assignment you are required 
				throughout to evaluate your own developmental progress and the 
				ways in which you have tried to ensure that you have some.&nbsp; 
				You are also asked to evaluate the ways you measured whether you 
				were successful in your endeavours.</li>
				<li>In Module Three, at the end of each section, you need to be 
				clear that you are thinking about the effectiveness of what you 
				did to gather data and what you propose based on what you know.&nbsp; 
				That means identifying the gaps in your knowledge, being honest 
				about any defectiveness in what you did and drawing together an 
				overall picture of what was achieved.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are no examples in the above simply because it is 
			impossible to provide them but the verbs you should be looking out 
			for include:<br />
			<em>Appraise,
					Assess,
					Conclude,
					Evaluate,
					Judge,
					Justify,
					Measure<br />
			</em>and so on and they all occur in all three Modules</p>

			<p>This is the highest level skill you will need for Delta and it 
			applies only to Modules Two and Three simply because it is almost 
			impossible reliably to asses anyone's creative abilities<em> via</em> 
			an examination.</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>In Module Two<br />
				You are asked to create, from scratch, complete lessons which 
				will address at least some of the issues you have researched and 
				written about in the Background essay.&nbsp; This means 
				considering a range of factors which will include at least:<ul class="deltabluebullet">
					<li>learners' needs and expectations</li>
					<li>the selection of achievable aims and objectives</li>
					<li>an understanding of how learning (probably) happens</li>
					<li>clear analysis of the skill or system which you are 
					targeting</li>
					<li>an understanding of how the lesson fits with the other 
					lessons and the course as a whole</li>
					<li>the role of materials, activities and tasks</li>
					<li>an appropriate general structure for the lesson which is 
					developmental and logical</li>
					<li>an ability to justify and evaluate what you are doing 
					both before and after the lesson</li>
				</ul>
				Also in Module Two, as part of the Professional Development 
				Assignment, you are required to investigate an area of teaching 
				wholly new to you, research its background theory and practice 
				and design a lesson which uses it which you will then evaluate 
				in terms of success.</li>
				<li>In Module Three, whichever route you take, you will have to 
				draw together your understanding of the data you gather, the 
				needs of the learners or the institution and then synthesise all 
				of that into a sensible and justified proposal which you can 
				evaluate honestly and objectively.<br />
				That is not a task to be taken lightly.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At any time in these processes you may be asked to:<br />
			<em>Assemble,
					Collect,
					Combine,
					Construct,
					Create,
					Design,
					Devise,
					Formulate,
					Make,
					Manage,
					Plan,
					Prepare</em> and<em>
					Propose</em></p>
			<p>That can be quite a daunting list but this is the part of a Delta 
			course that most people find the most rewarding and personally 
			satisfying.</p>

			<p>In this guide, the assumption may appear to be that the six 
			skills&nbsp;are separable and discrete entities but in the real world, of 
			course, they are often combined in various ways.<br />
			For example, when planning a lesson, all six skills will be in play 
			because you need to:</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>remember what the aims of your lesson are and the nature of 
				the skill or system that you are targeting</li>
				<li>remember and show you understand the terminology you need to 
				explain how the systems and skills work</li>
				<li>apply that knowledge and understanding to the aims and 
				objectives taking into account the learners and their needs</li>
				<li>analyse the language or skills in a way that is accessible 
				to the learners</li>
				<li>evaluate the learning that took place and the way you 
				planned to teach</li>
				<li>create the lesson and, often, its materials</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At other times, not all the skills will be needed but it is 
			reasonable to assume that more than two will be combined for any task 
			you are set unless it is simply a matter of rote learning (and few 
			good courses ask only for that).<br />
			In training sessions, therefore, be prepared to be asked to list and 
			analyse, to identify and evaluate, to apply and create at various 
			times.<br />
			This is, of course, much easier to prepare for if you know what 
			skills you are being asked to use.</p>
			<p>If you are preparing independently for Module One and / or Module 
			Three of the Delta, use this guide to make sure you are aware of 
			which skills you should be using and when you should be using them.&nbsp; 
			That gives you a head start.</p>
			<p>Here's a handy cut-out-and-keep aide memoire to keep by you.&nbsp; 
			We have taken a small liberty with this in reversing the order of 
			Apply and Analyse because that's the way it's done in most Delta 
			essays and plans.&nbsp; The two usually go hand-in-hand in any case.</p>
