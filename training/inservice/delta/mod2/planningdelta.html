		<p>Before doing all this, you may want to follow

		<h3>Here's the picture</h3>
		<p>
		<img alt="plan" height="272" src="../images/plan.png" width="400" /></p>
		<p>We'll take each element of the plan separately and match the content 
		of the plan to the Delta assessment criteria.<br />
		Also included in this guide are typical criticisms made by Delta 
		assessors.&nbsp; Be careful to ensure that they can't be levelled at you 
		and your planning.<br />
		A lesson can pass or fail on the strength of its plan so this is not a 
		box-ticking exercise.</p>
		<p>Your role is not just a planner, as we shall see.</p>

		</table>
		<p>All plans start with a consideration of the learners, their needs, 
		their learning preferences and their interests so it's unsurprising that 
		this is the first criterion for a Delta assessment.</p>
		<p class="indentpara">5a) includes<br />
		(i) a brief general overview of the group of learners and the course<br />
		(ii) information about individual learners relevant to the lesson</p>
		<p>Here you need to explain the context of the lesson.&nbsp; It may be 
		that your observer-assessor knows most of this but it is unlikely that 
		an external assessor will.&nbsp; The key question to ask is<br />
		<em>What do I need to tell the observer to make the context clear?</em><br />
		Do that but do no more.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>It is here that you demonstrate your familiarity with the group and 
		the fact that there are some commonalities to bear in mind when planning 
		for them.&nbsp; If you are sharing a class, do not rely on other 
		people's perceptions (but draw on them).&nbsp; It is <strong>your</strong> 
		view and <strong>your</strong> response to the group that is most 
		important.</p>
		<h4>To meet 5a) (i)</h4>
		<p>Set out the following (in a grid or table if you like):</p>
		
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style5" style="width: 60%">

				in their workplaces</em></td>

				<td class="auto-style9"><em>most members of the group are

				attendance is compulsory but somewhat variable</em></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>That's enough.&nbsp; There is no need, unless the group is very unusual, 
		to say more here.<br />
		There may be an unusual item worth adding to the 
		list.&nbsp; For example, if the group is particularly heterogeneous, has 
		split aims and so on.&nbsp; Before you write something about this, ask 
		yourself if it's really relevant to your lesson.&nbsp; If it isn't, 
		leave it out.<br />
		It's important to state your familiarity with the group.&nbsp; The less 
		you have, the less will be expected of you in certain areas.&nbsp; (That 
		is <strong>not</strong>, however, an excuse for not doing research into 
		needs, preferences and abilities.)</p>
		<p>
		<span class="auto-style11"><strong>TASK: what would you say about the 
		group you are currently teaching or have recently taught?</strong></span></p>
		<h4>To meet 5a) (ii)</h4>
		<p>Here your focus is on the individuals <strong>in relation to the 
		lesson you are planning</strong>.</p>
		<p>The data are probably best set out in a grid, but you may need to 
		vary the columns to suit your group.&nbsp; For our example, all the 
		learners have the same aims but your group may be less homogenous and 
		you'll need to include a column for <em>Reasons for learning</em>, for 
		example.&nbsp; Special needs, too, may need a column or a comment such 
		as:<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jose is a little deaf 
		so needs to sit near the front to hear me clearly and to be face-to-face 
		in any pair-work or group-work activity.</em></span></p>

		</table>
		<p>Much guff is used to distinguish between aims and objectives.<br />
		However, it is important to distinguish between the outcomes for the 
		learners and the aims for the teacher.<br />
		For example, your aim may be <em>to teach the first conditional for 
		bargaining </em>but that is what you are going to do not what the 
		learners will achieve.&nbsp; There are three good reasons for setting out 
		your aims in terms of learning outcomes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>It will be easier for you to select the most appropriate 
			materials and procedures when you have stated very clearly what you 
			want the learners to acquire</li>
			<li>If you define objectives precisely, you are in a better position 
			to judge whether they have been achieved</li>
			<li>If you transmit to the learners what your intentions are 
			vis-à-vis learning outcomes, they can use their own experience to 
			try to achieve them</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It's not a mystery then, why the criterion for planning states:</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><span class="auto-style3">5b) sets out clear and appropriate overall 
		aims and learning outcomes for the lesson in relation to language 
		systems and/or language skills and learner needs</span></p>

		<p><a name="p1"></a>If you have done <a href="../../../initial/teaching/planning.html">the basic guide to planning</a>, you'll know that there

		procedure?</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Students will exchange ideas about sports and pastimes</li>
			<li>The class will practise making question forms with conditional

			<li>At the end of the lesson, the learners will be more aware of the

		</div><p>Once you have settled on the outcomes you want to achieve, you can

		<p>The part <span class="style_black"><em><strong>in black text</strong></em></span> tells the reader exactly how the aim will be 
		realised.&nbsp; That's the way to write aims.</p>
		<p>There are three important things to consider when you are deciding 
		upon aims and objectives:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Challenge</strong></dt>
			<dd>When you set out the aims and objectives for the lesson, make

		<em>look after, look at, look for, get on, get off, check in, wait for,

		Next week, my co-teacher and I intend to extend and develop their

			For example,<em><br />
			<span class="style_brown">The class as a whole (with one exception) has

		</ol>
		<p>Make sure you refer to both.</p>
			<p>If you are teaching an unfamiliar group or one in which some of 
			the learners are not well known to you, do not be afraid to sound 
			tentative but say, too, how you will overcome the unexpected or 
			unpredictable.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style43">The usual class teacher has assured me that

		<p> The sorts of problems you should consider are</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Problems that learners may have with the

		topic)</li>
			<li>Learners’ potential problems with the skill(s)/subskill(s) they 
			will have to deploy</li>
			<li>Levels of interest in the topic</li>
			<li>Level of challenge</li>
			<li>What might go wrong (not only with technology)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This is not the place to say that the learners won't know the target 
		language or can't deploy the target (sub)skill.&nbsp; Of course not &ndash; 
		that's why you are teaching it.&nbsp; So, for example, avoid saying 
		something like:<br />
		<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The learners may not 
		understand the meaning of the six phrasal verbs which form the targets 
		of the lesson.</em><br />
		because you are stating the obvious.<br />
		It is, however, perfectly in order to say something like:<br />
&nbsp;<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp; The learners may have trouble 
		understanding the polysemous nature of two of the target phrasal verbs.</em><br />
		because that is a precise issue to do with the forms and the analysis of 
		meaning (which you have already done and to which you should refer).<br />
		Do not list issues.&nbsp; Explain them.</p>
		<p>Then you set out the solutions you have in mind.&nbsp; Some like to 
		use a table for this with problems on the left and solutions on the 
		right.&nbsp; That works well to make sure you have covered everything.&nbsp; 
		For example, in continuous prose:</p>
		<p class="auto-style40" style="width: 646px"><span class="style_brown"><em>There are issues both with transitivity 
		vs. intransitivity and (in)separability with the target items so I have 
		arranged the projector slides and the handouts to highlight the 
		differences in colours and text font styles to aid the noticing process 
		(appendix 2).&nbsp; The first half of the text contains only 
		intransitive forms of multi-word verbs (</em>queue up, stand up<em> 
		etc.) and the second half contains transitive forms (</em>push through, 
		grab hold of <em>etc.).&nbsp; The answer to the first while-listening 
		question can be arrived at without encountering a transitive or 
		separable verb but the second question requires some noticing of the 
		object of the verb.&nbsp; For this reason, I shall play the recording in 
		two distinct parts.<br />
		Three of the learners work in public transport of various kinds so 
		will be familiar with the topic and may have some specialist vocabulary 
		to contribute.&nbsp; Others will be less well informed but they all 
		struggle to get to work or school on overcrowded buses and trains so 
		will be familiar with the topic area discussed in the audio text of a 
		radio interview.&nbsp; I shall make sure that the three groups all have 
		one of the experts as a member so the expertise can be shared.</em></span></p>

		<p>You need to address all parts of this criterion with a rationale for 
		the lesson's design, materials and procedures.<br />
		There are three things to 
		do:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Say why you are doing what you are doing the way you are doing 
			it.&nbsp; Refer to the learners here, their needs and the context of 
			the lesson.&nbsp; Look back at what you wrote under 5a (the 
			profiles) and 5d (the timetable fit) to do this.<br />
			</li>
			<li>Identify the nature of the lesson structure and shape.&nbsp; If, 
			for example, you are taking a Test-Teach-Test approach (or any other 
			approach or mixtures of approaches to designing the lesson), say why 
			you feel this is relevant to the aims and nature of the learners.</li>
			<li>Say how your research and reading for the essay informed your 
			planning.&nbsp; Quote from the essay if you like but don't just 
			repeat yourself – explain.<br />
			Reference any citations conventionally.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>and there are two things not to do:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Do not claim to be implementing an approach or lesson shape 
			which your procedures do not exemplify.&nbsp; If you have designed 
			the lesson as Test-Teach-Test, for example, make sure that the 
			stages reflect this and then you can say why you have chosen this 
			approach.&nbsp; Bear in mind that there is no preferred approach in 
			a Delta observation / assessment.&nbsp; What you need to find is an
			<strong>appropriate</strong> approach given the targets and the 
			current level of the learners.<br />
			Be aware, too, that using tasks in a lesson is not the same as 
			taking a Task-Based Learning approach to lesson design.</li>
			<li>Do not be tempted to describe the lesson.&nbsp; This is the 
			place to justify and explain, not describe.</li>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>While there are many good reasons to have a plan (see above) there are 
			also ways in which a plan can actually get in the way of responding 
			to your learners.&nbsp; This calls for a little flexibility.</p>
		<p>A map is not the territory.&nbsp; Do not confuse the model (your 
		plan) with the reality (your lesson).</p>
		<p>While both focus and variety can be planned, flexibility, by 
		definition, cannot.&nbsp; What the teacher does when things do not go 
		according to plan is just as important as knowing what to put in the 
		plan in the first place.<br />
		However good the plan, and however carefully you have thought about your 
		learners, their needs and their preferences, something will arise in 
		almost all lessons which was not predicted in your plan (or predictable).</p>
		<p>Two of the assessment criteria for the teaching on Delta 
		Module Two make explicit reference to your ability to respond to reality 
		rather than march through a plan.&nbsp; These criteria are that you 
		demonstrate that you can effectively:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><span class="style_black"><em>7e) notice and judiciously exploit 
			learners’ language output to further language and skills/subskills 
			development.</em></span></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><span class="style_black"><em>9a) implement the lesson plan and 
			where necessary adapt it to emerging learner needs.</em></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Both these criteria concern responding to emerging events and will involve some departure from the plan.</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>To meet 7e):<br />
				You need to be alert to what the learners are actually producing 
				and that may not be what you had in mind when you wrote your 
				plan.&nbsp; Listen to your learners and be prepared to use what 
				they produce to extend and develop their knowledge and skills.</li>
				<li>To meet 9a):<br />
			It may, for example, turn out that the learners' mastery of a 
			language item which you had assumed in the section above under 
			criterion 5e) is not as secure as it needs to be.&nbsp; This may 
			require quite a serious diversion from your plan if the lesson 
			depends on their knowing how to handle the language in question.<br />It may also be the case, on the other hand, that the learners are 
			already aware of and can handle some of the targets of the lesson.&nbsp; 
			If that occurs, you would be very unwise to continue with the 
			teaching procedures you had planned for these targets or you could 
				be accused of under-challenging your learners and taking them 
				nowhere new.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The moral of all this is: <strong>Teach the learners, not the 
			plan</strong>.</p>
		<hr />
		<p>That's it.<br />
		Now all you have to do is teach the lesson and write 
		a bit about how it went and what you should do next.</p>
