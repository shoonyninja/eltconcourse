			<h1><span class="deltablue">Delta </span>Module Two: analysing language skills in the background essay</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="analysis" height="207" src="../../../images/analyse_microscope310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide concerns meeting the criteria for a Delta essay in 
			section 3.&nbsp; The two criteria are:</p>
			<p class="auto-style2">Successful candidates can effectively 
			demonstrate an understanding of the specific area by:</p>
			<ol class="indent">
				<li><em>analysing the specific area with accuracy, identifying 
				key points</em></li>
				<li><em>showing awareness of a range of learning and teaching 
				problems occurring in a range of learning contexts</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is a guide with examples, not a model.<br />
			There are a number of reasons why it is not possible to provide a 
			model analysis:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>When you select your topic area for a Language Skills 
				Assignment, you will, naturally, focus on an area which your 
				class needs to master.&nbsp; What that might be for you in your 
				setting is unpredictable and any model analysis will almost 
				certainly not be relevant in whole or in part.</li>
				<li>Once you have decided on your topic area, you will have to 
				narrow down your focus by the level of learners you have in mind 
				or by the particular subskills you are concerned with, excluding some areas 
				of the skill so that your analysis will be in 
				adequate depth and not a low-level, superficial survey of the 
				whole area.&nbsp; How you will do that is, again, not 
				predictable, because it will depend on the nature of your 
				students' needs and the focus of the lesson which you 
				have in mind.</li>
				<li>No analysis, here or anywhere else, can be a complete model 
				because the word count for Delta essays is severely limited to 
				2500 words overall and the analysis part of your essay is 
				probably going to around 1000 to 1500 words to allow you space 
				to address all the other issues in the essay (definitions, 
				teaching suggestions etc.).&nbsp; This means that you will, 
				perforce, have to leave out some interesting areas of the 
				analysis which others might decide to include.&nbsp; What 
				follows is, therefore, deliberately selective and incomplete but 
				serves to demonstrate the level of depth and precision which is 
				needed for Delta.</li>
				<li>It is a matter, often, of personal preference whether you:<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li>address the criteria individually by doing the analysis 
					in a dedicated section and then linking the discussion to 
					the difficulties learners and teachers have with the topic 
					in a following section or</li>
					<li>combine the analysis with the discussion of learning and 
					teaching problems as you go along.&nbsp;
					What follows takes a separated approach for the sake of 
					clarity and cannot, 
					therefore, stand as any kind of model for a combined 
					approach.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In this guide, we will be presenting models of analysis 
				drawn from a range of disparate language skill and subskill areas so there 
				will be little sense, if any, of a coherent and cohesive 
				discussion.&nbsp; We will, whenever it seems relevant, give 
				examples of listening, reading, writing and speaking subskills.<br />
				You, naturally, will make every effort to keep your analysis and 
				discussion of problems consistently relevant to your essay title 
				and to the limitations of the scope that you set out in the 
				introduction.</li>
				<li>Finally, this site takes a dim view of plagiarism, as does 
				Cambridge English and all Delta centres.&nbsp; There is no 
				intention here, then, to produce an analysis which can simple be 
				copied and pasted into an essay.&nbsp; Try that and you will be 
				found out.</li>

			</table>
			<p>For any skills background essay analysis, you need to consider 
			three important, connected areas.&nbsp; You may opt to conflate the 
			first two of these into a single section, because they are closely 
			connected.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Purposes:<br />
				The purposes to which the subskill(s) you have in mind may be 
				put.&nbsp; For example, here you need to consider the general 
				needs of all learners and the purposes for which they need to 
				apply the selected subskills.</li>
				<li>Text types:<br />
				We approach text types, whether written or spoken, in different 
				ways depending on their nature.&nbsp; We do not listen to a 
				weather forecast in the same way that we listen to a platform 
				announcement or a lecture, for example.</li>
				<li>Subskill analysis:<br />
				This is where your research shows.&nbsp; You need to look at 
				exactly what the skill involves and how it is applied to a text.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A useful place to start is with
			<a href="../../../initial/teaching/teaching_skills_essential.html" target="_blank">
			the essential guide to teaching language skills</a> (new tab) which sets out 
			what learners need to know about which skill they are using, how 
			they are using it, why they are using it and with whom they are 
			communicating.&nbsp; The diagram, taken from that guide looks like 
			this:<br />

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is the central starting point for any analysis 
			of any skill.<br />
			Here, there are the matters of depth and detail to consider.&nbsp; 
			At Delta level, you need more of both than you may be accustomed to 
			considering on whatever pre-service course you have taken.<br />
			Here are two examples, one of inadequate depth but superficially 
			accurate analysis, the other of more depth and detail.&nbsp; It's 
			not too hard to pick which is which.</p>
			<p><strong>Accurate but inadequate:</strong></p>
			<p class="style_black">People read for two basic reasons:</p>
			<ol class="indent">
				<li>to get information, for example, reading a news report</li>
				<li>for entertainment, for example, reading a short story</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>In a bit more depth with more detail:</strong></p>
			<p class="style_black">The reasons people read are often closely 
			related to the register in which they need to function.&nbsp; We can 
			distinguish</p>
			<ol class="style_black">
				<li>
				reading for general purposes, for 
				entertainment (novels, stories etc.), to inquire into an area of 
				interest (popular science texts, historical articles etc.) or to 
				remain informed about the world (newspapers, general websites 
				etc.).</li>
				<li>
				
				reading for specific purposes, in work-related settings (emails, 
				reports, written correspondence, procedures etc.), for study 
				(text books, journals, specialised websites etc.), to pursue a 
				hobby (magazines, newsletters, instructions etc.), for 
				instrumental purposes (instructions, recipes, advertisements 
				etc.)</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="style_black">Our purposes for reading will affect the 
			kinds of skills we need to deploy but the skills will often be 
			applicable for both the overarching purposes for reading which we 
			have.&nbsp; For example, we may use skimming skills when reading a 
			newspaper article to get the general gist of what is happening and 
			we may deploy the same skill to determine if a journal article is 
			likely to provide the data we need in a specific area of work or 
			study.<br />
			Equally, we may read extremely intensively to be certain we have 
			fully understood a text in both domains, to understand critical 
			professional instructions, to follow a detailed study text as well 
			as to understand the motives of a character in a novel or a poet's 
			use of metaphor.<br />
			For the purposes of this essay, I shall focus on reading for 
			specific information and the ways in which we use our knowledge of 
			genre-specific text structure and information staging, whether we are 
			reading for general or specific purposes, to locate the sections of 
			the text on which we need to focus our attention.&nbsp; I shall also 
			consider in what follows how we use our knowledge of cohesion and 
			deixis in texts to understand the author's linking of ideas.</p>
			<p>Nothing in the first example is actually wrong but the analysis 
			is at a low level of detail and precision, simply skating over the 
			surface.<br />
			In the second example, there is greater use of terminology (to be 
			precise), greater depth of analysis (to point out the overlapping areas) 
			and better exemplification (to add detail).</p>
			<p>The <strong>moral</strong> for Delta essays is:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Use terminology accurately and appropriately and do not be 
				satisfied with calling something simply a transaction or an 
				interaction, for example.&nbsp; The reader needs to know that 
				you are aware of overlapping subskills and of the various 
				subtypes hidden within superficial classifications.</li>
				<li>Strive for more depth so it is clear to the reader that you 
				are aware of the issues in the analysis and have researched 
				beyond the level of skills books for classroom use.&nbsp; This will 
				contribute to a sense of your having done proper research.</li>
				<li>Exemplify what you say clearly and comment on your examples 
				to make it clear to the reader that you understand what you are 
				saying.&nbsp; This contributes to the amount of detail you can 
				provide.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here are two more examples focusing on speaking skills to 
			see how the addition of precision, depth and detail is achieved.&nbsp; 
			The first paragraph is accurate but lacks adequate depth, precision 
			and detail.&nbsp; What follows exemplifies what is required at Delta 
			level.</p>
			<p><span class="style_black">There are two types of speaking that 
			most students need to know.&nbsp; Firstly, they need to transact in 
			English, i.e., get things done and secondly, they need to interact 
			to maintain social relationships and be part of community.</span></p>
			<hr />
			<p class="style_black"><span class="style_black">Traditionally, speaking has been classified 
			as either transaction, getting things done or interaction, oiling 
			the social wheels.</span><br />
			This simple dichotomy, while it allows a certain classroom focus, is 
			inadequate for learners above B1 level because it disguises the fact 
			that we frequently interact within ostensibly transactional 
			exchanges and transact within interactional ones.&nbsp; My learners, 
			preparing for study and work in an English-speaking setting, need 
			both skills and need to be able to integrate them smoothly.&nbsp; It 
			is also arguable, as Jones [reference citation] has pointed out, 
			that <span class="style_underline">all</span> learners above a 
			certain level of mastery need to combine suasion with social chat 
			and insert politeness and personal affect language into even simple 
			transactional encounters.</p>

			</table>
			<p>This is the second strand of the analysis, whatever your skill focus.&nbsp; 
			It is here that you demonstrate that you understand the differences 
			between text types and can analyse them conventionally.<br />
			Here, again, are two examples, the first drawing on a lay 
			understanding 
			and the other, better one, drawing on a more sophisticated 
			understanding of generic structure.</p>
			<p><span class="style_black">A television news bulletin in English will usually 
			follow a predictable format with the top story coming first followed 
			by a description of one or two of the following items to whet the 
			viewers' appetites and will finish with sports reports and, often a 
			lighter item to entertain the viewers.</span></p>
			<p>There's not much wrong with this analysis, so far as it goes but 
			at Delta level, we need much more precision and to demonstrate more 
			awareness.&nbsp; Here's what's meant:</p>
			<p><span class="style_black">A television news bulletin in English will usually 
			follow a predictable format with the top story coming first followed 
			by a description of one or two of the following items to whet the 
			viewers' appetites and will finish with sports reports and, often a 
			lighter item to entertain the viewers.&nbsp; This sort of text 
			follows the staging of an information report: a general statement 
			and identification of the topic followed by a description organised 
			into coherent bundles of data (place, time, participants, actions 
			etc.).<br />
			The individual news items usually take this format:</span></p>
			<ol class="style_black">
				<li>The main item will usually be introduced in the perfect 
				aspect or even a present simple tense to lend a sense of urgency 
				to the report.&nbsp; Typically, expressions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Large crowds have gathered outside ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				An earthquake has struck in ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				There are reports of ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The president is visiting ...<br />
				</em>Viewers who are alert to the use of these tense forms are 
				able to understand the gist of what has occurred and be prepared 
				for the lexis in the report that follows, using predictive 
				listening skills.</li>
				<li>What follows will provide the detail and will often be 
				described in the past simple:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Riot police were deployed in ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Rescue services were trying to reach ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The president said, "...</em>"<br />
				so alert listeners, primed with this knowledge can focus in 
				particular for behavioural and material process verb phrases and 
				be able to pick out the main points even if some of the detail 
				is not comprehended.<br />
				Or, if there is a reporter on the scene, the voice over the film 
				will often be in the present tense (even though there may be a 
				considerable delay between the events and the film being 
				available to view):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the scene this morning in ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The devastation is ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Let's hear what she had to say ...<br />
				</em>Here, listeners need to be more focused on relational 
				process verb phrases in order to understand the connections 
				between the events and states being described.</li>
				<li>The story facts having been established, the item will then 
				often have a coda in which an expert or person intimately 
				involved in the events will provide a commentary.&nbsp; Here the 
				viewer / listener needs to be alert to markers of subjective 
				views in order to be able to distinguish fact from opinion and 
				speculation.&nbsp; Typical discourse-marking conjuncts, 
				disjuncts, modal 
				expressions and copular verb forms are what the viewer / 
				listener needs to locate here:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite possibly, ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Moreover, ...<br />
				... in my view ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				What might be happening is ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				This could develop into ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				In all probability ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				It seems, then, that ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				What appears to have happened is ...</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>And this analysis is far better in terms of precision, depth and 
			detail.&nbsp; It draws on reading and research, is above the level 
			of a classroom skills book or other texts and shows awareness of 
			not only structure but probable content verb types.&nbsp; The 
			analysis should then be extended to focus on other language items 
			which will allow a fuller understanding such as the use of time and 
			place adjuncts and other adverbials such as prepositional phrases.</p>

					<h2>Subskill analysis</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>No Delta essay, properly written, can hope to analyse the whole 
			of a skill so it is necessary to limit yourself to a subset of 
			skills that form the core focus (one of which you have in mind 
			for the lesson you are going to teach).<br />
			Here we will not provide an example of an inadequate analysis for 
			the simple reason that no such analysis will confine itself to the 
			specific subskills which Delta requires.<br />
			Here, then, is an example of skills analysis which focuses on 
			specific and definable subskills (to do with identifying types of 
			turn passing and responding appropriately), partly based on one of 
			the guides in the English for Academic Purposes section of this 
			site:</p>
			<p><span class="style_black">Identifying and responding to selection 
			and constraint in academic settings is a key listening skill which 
			learners who wish to study in an English-speaking setting need to 
			acquire.&nbsp; It is also a skill which can, and should, be deployed 
			in general social settings because the same turn-taking constraints 
			and opportunities can arise.</span><br class="style_black" />
			<span class="style_black">The considerations are:</span></p>
			<ol class="style_black">
				<li>Selection and constraint<br />
				In small groups, i.e., around twenty or fewer, tutors may select 
				the next person to take a turn, either by naming them or by 
				alluding to them in some way.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the question we should be asking, John?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we have two people here who have been reading the 
				text.&nbsp; Does either of you have a question?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do those who will actually do the work want to know?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Tutors may signal who is to respond to something said by using 
				gaze, focusing on whoever is required to contribute.&nbsp; Being 
				alert to what shifting gaze means is a cultural issue in part 
				but can be taught.<br />
				In this case, the learner needs to recognise two important 
				points: not only that it is his or her turn to ask a question or 
				make a point but also that the topic of the question has been 
				constrained by what the tutor is currently talking about.&nbsp; 
				Off-topic questions are not usually welcome.<br />
				In other, less academic, settings the same kinds of pattern are 
				observable although, because the power relationships are usually 
				more even, the language selected to realise the function will be 
				different (and usually much less formal).&nbsp; Selection will 
				often be achieved simply through gaze shifting but constraint 
				will normally be verbally achieved.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Gaze shift] <em>Agreed?</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, John, which is it to be?</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Gaze shift] <em>What do you think about that?</em></li>
				<li>Constraint only<br />
				In lecture settings, a speaker may not have the luxury of 
				selecting questioners because participant names are unknown or 
				because the audience is simply too large.<br />
				In this case the speaker needs to rely on constraint alone but 
				the constraint is often signalled explicitly, by the parts 
				underlined in the following examples:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone have a question 
				<span class="style_underline">about these figures</span>?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bearing <span class="style_underline">this</span> in mind, does anyone have a question?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone need to ask anything about 
				<span class="style_underline">the results so far</span> before we go on</em><br />
				Failure to notice question-topic constraint is quite serious 
				because it irritates the tutor / lecturer as well as other 
				participants.<br />
				Again, in general, social English settings, the same phenomenon 
				is observable but in this case the listener needs to be alert to 
				other forms of constraint signalling, such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What say you to 
				<span class="style_underline">a night out</span>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm thinking about getting <span class="style_underline">a dog</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather forecast's not too good for 
				<span class="style_underline">tomorrow</span></em><br />
				in all of which the topic of the next turn has been constrained 
				to going out, dogs and the consequences of the weather, 
				respectively.&nbsp; Failure to notice constraint can often lead 
				to communication breakdown and some frustration in one's 
				interlocutor.</li>
				<li>Open-ended invitation<br />
				A tutor may do neither of the above and simply signal the fact 
				that a question from anyone on any topic is welcome.&nbsp; This may 
				occur at the end of teaching phases by the tutor falling silent 
				or signalling open-endedness by, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anything at all anyone wants to ask?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any questions about anything?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Recognising the lack of topic constraint may be as important as 
				recognising its existence.<br />
				In general, social settings, again, lack of constraint and 
				selection is rarer but occurs.&nbsp; This phenomenon is often 
				signalled by turn-passing manoeuvres such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, anyway, so ... </em>[falling tone 
				and falling volume]<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's that.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, well, never mind.</em></li>

			<h3><a name="skip"></a>Learning and Teaching problems with skills</h3>
			<p>You may, as was noted above, choose to consider problems for 
			learning and teaching simultaneously with the analysis and that is a 
			legitimate approach.&nbsp; For clarity's sake here, however, we 
			shall consider them separately but use some of the same examples that we 
			have used so far for analysis.&nbsp; It is also appropriate in many 
			skills-focused essays to consider problems for learning and teaching 
			in tandem with solutions.&nbsp; We shall not do that here but you 
			should bear in mind that each of the comments below could be 
			followed by a teaching solution or two.<br />
			When you come to discuss learning and teaching problems, you need to 
			do three connected things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Consider your own setting and then</li>
				<li>Think outside your own setting to show that you are aware of 
				other possibilities</li>
				<li>Know how other languages work both in terms of skills.&nbsp; Do not only focus on your own 
				students.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Additionally, if you have restricted your focus by level of 
			learners, you need constantly to refer to this restriction and make 
			sure that you don't stray into areas which are clearly too difficult 
			or too easy.<br />
			Here are some (incomplete) examples and, again, they are just that, not models 
			for all the reasons explained above.</p>

					<h3>Problems with purposes</h3>
					<h3>listening</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It has been asserted with some justification [reference citation] 
			that although the purposes one has for listening to a text are 
			common across all cultures, the skills are not easily or 
			automatically transferred.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>At lower levels in particular, there is often a sense of 
				needing to understand everything in a text.&nbsp; When this is 
				not achievable, as it often isn't even for native speakers, I 
				have noted that learners will often lose the thread and switch 
				off completely, making the carefully prepared listening text I 
				am using worthless.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				A text which is authentic and produced by an unprepared native 
				speaker will often contain false starts and back-tracking 
				repairs such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Er, no that's not it exactly, it's um, more ...</em><br />
				Such texts tend to demotivate and confuse unless learners have 
				been alerted to the existence of such events.&nbsp; Even then, 
				at lower levels, too much of this kind of things is worth 
				avoiding.&nbsp; Choosing texts which are both at least 
				pseudo-authentic and which do not contain such distractions is 
				challenging.<br />
				Learners need, from the outset to know why they are listening.&nbsp; 
				If only the gist is required, as it often is in real life, then 
				they need training in ignoring peripheral data.</li>
				<li>Learners who are unaware of the function of simple conjuncts 
				and disjuncts, such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To put it another way, ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Honestly, ...</em><br />
				will often miss their import.&nbsp; If they do, comprehension 
				can be seriously impaired.<br />
				If the learners' purpose is to extract the three main points 
				from a text, missing a conjunct such as <em>in other words ...</em> 
				is a serious matter.</li>
				<li>Especially at lower levels, it is inevitable that almost all 
				listening texts, even contrived ones, will contain blocking 
				vocabulary unknown to the learners.&nbsp; If the items are 
				non-essential, they can be safely ignored but learners actually 
				have no way of deciding whether an item is key or peripheral 
				unless it is specifically signalled prior to listening.&nbsp; 
				Again, such items can stop learners in their tracks and 
				encourage them to disengage from the task.<br />
				If the purpose of listening is simply to monitor for a 
				particular item, training in ignoring blocking vocabulary and 
				listening out for, say, a name of a place or a person is 
				important.&nbsp; See below for suggestions concerning how to 
				achieve this.</li>

					<h3>Problems with text types</h3>
					<h3>reading / listening</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Unfamiliar text types can present learners with real reading 
			problems because the staging and information structuring in them 
			will be unknown and they will have little information concerning 
			where critical information is likely to occur.<br />
			Cross culturally, too, text structures differ 
			(as the analysis shows) and the preferred way 
			of organising texts in English may not be something that learners 
			from different cultural backgrounds will automatically appreciate.<br />
			At all levels, and especially when dealing with a new text type, 
			readers need some analytical work on where information is likely to 
			be staged and how the structure of the text may differ from what 
			they are used to.<br />
			For example, in some cultures what is confined to the coda in 
			English (the writer's reaction to events which have been set out 
			previously) may conventionally be prefaced to the whole recount so 
			readers will be looking in the wrong place for the data they need to 
			understand the text fully.<br />
			Academic texts, too, are similarly varied across cultures and in 
			some the conclusion is the starting, not ending, point for the 
			writing.</p>
			<p>Authenticity is another issue.&nbsp; While it is motivating and 
			often helpful to use authentic texts, care needs to be taken to 
			ensure that they are typical of the genre and not quirky and unusual 
			examples of what people will usually have to read.<br />
			Authenticity is of two types and both need to be addressed:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Text authenticity refers to whether a text is as it was 
				written for native-speaker readers or whether it needs to be 
				simplified for the non-native learners of English.<br />
				Texts can be described on a cline from truly authentic 
				(unaltered and in the original presentation), quasi-authentic 
				(altered in terms of inserting a glossary of lexis and other 
				learner aids), semi-authentic (based on an authentic model and 
				retaining some semblance of its original presentation) and 
				contrived (specially constructed for pedagogical purposes).</li>
				<li>Learner authenticity applies to the uses to which the text 
				is put.&nbsp; A text may be authentic as such but if the use to 
				which it is put is not, for example, as a basis for the analysis 
				of verbal processes and other language forms then the text's 
				authenticity and motivational effect may be compromised.</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			<ol>
				<li>At these levels, background distractions and non-ideal 
				conditions are also problematic.&nbsp; While it is clear that we 
				need to prepare learners for real-life listening settings, we 
				need to make sure that listening texts are well recorded and 
				clear or motivation will fall and frustration increase.<br />
				This may mean some loss of authenticity in favour of 
				accessibility and skill development.</li>
				<li>The use of audio-only listening texts in the classroom is a 
				problem which can frustrate learners and make the tasks too 
				difficult.&nbsp; It is rare, in real life, and certainly so for 
				most low-level learners, to listen to texts with no visual 
				support.&nbsp; In fact, training learners to use such support is 
				an essential part of the process and this cannot be done in 
				isolation.&nbsp; See below for suggestions concerning how to 
				achieve this.</li>
			</ol>

					<h3>Problems with subskills</h3>
					<h3>speaking</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The difficulty which is immediately apparent when teaching 
			speaking skills is the task of breaking the skill down into areas 
			which can form the focus of the skill development in the classroom 
			and making the tasks and content of the procedures authentic enough 
			to simulate real-life communication in speaking.<br />
			For example, teaching the skills needed appropriately to recognise 
			and take turn-passing opportunities in spoken interactions requires 
			the learners simultaneously to listen for cues and to select 
			responses which are socially, linguistically and culturally 
			appropriate.<br />
			Distinguishing between 
			backchannelling routines (which occur <strong>within</strong> turns) 
			and opportunities to take up a turn (which occur <strong>at transitions</strong>) is 
			also necessary.</p>
			<p>Maintaining, rather than merely initiating or responding within 
			interactions is another issue that needs to be considered.<br />
			If learners are unaware of the need both to respond to an utterance 
			and, within the same turn, to initiate anew, this will soon lead to 
			the dead-end interactions well known to anyone who has tried to keep 
			a conversation going single handedly.<br />
			It is in this area that breaking subskill of responding and 
			initiating down is most helpful as a way of getting learners to 
			notice how conversational structure usually works, at least in 
			English because languages and cultures differ in the amount of 
			directness that is allowable and the illocutionary force of 
			statements which will be understood.<br />
			For example, learners need to recognise the four types of 
			initiation:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Elicitation: <em>Do you want something to drink?</em></li>
				<li>Request: <em>Can you do me a favour?</em></li>
				<li>Directive: <em>Listen.&nbsp; This is vital.</em></li>
				<li>Informative: <em>I have just got back from Mongolia.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>and not all of these will be common to all languages and cultures 
			and perceived as initiations of any sort.</p>
			<p>Learners also need to appreciate the three types of response plus 
			new initiation in the same conversational move that are normal and 
			know how they are achieved:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Preferred:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, please.&nbsp; Thanks very much.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Of course.&nbsp; What can I do for you?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I'm listening. Tell me what's so important.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Have you indeed?&nbsp; What was it like?</em></li>
				<li>Temporised:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps later.&nbsp; Can we eat first?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Maybe, but I'm busy today.&nbsp; How about tomorrow?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				OK, but I think I know what it involves already.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				That sounds nice.&nbsp; You must tell me about it later.</em></li>
				<li>Dispreferred:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, thanks.&nbsp; I have to go now.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Not at the moment.&nbsp; Sorry about that.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Maybe, but I don't have time for this now.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				How interesting.&nbsp; Well, I must be off to get my train.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Without breaking the subskill of maintaining conversations down 
			like this, learners may well not appreciate the need in temporised 
			and preferred responses to follow up the response with a new 
			initiation which invites a response plus initiation from the other 
			person.</p>
