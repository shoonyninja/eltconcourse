			<h3>Referencing</h3>
			<p>You will need to make sure that the in-text referencing and the 
			bibliography follow a standard convention.<br />
			For details, go to a website for advice.&nbsp; There’s a good guide 
			to the Harvard referencing system 
			produced for Anglia Ruskin University that you can access
			<a href="https://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm" target="_blank">
			by clicking here</a>.<br />
			Briefly, however:</p>
			<h4>For in-text references</h4>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>Books and articles</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>At every point in the text where there is a particular 
				reference, include the author’s surname and the year of 
				publication with page numbers if you are quoting specific words 
				– for example:<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his survey of the social habits of Delta tutors, Bloggs (1998) 
			refuted that ...</em></span><br />
			or<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his survey of the social habits of 
				Delta tutors, Bloggs (1998: 19) states that, "I can assert without fear of successful 
			contradiction that …"</em></span><br />
				Make sure that it is 100% clear where your writing stops and a 
				quotation begins, either by using inverted commas or indenting 
				the citation etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>Websites</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>You may not know the author’s name or date (but give them as above 
			if you do) so this is acceptable:<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been suggested (Wikipedia (2013)) that …</em></span></dd>
			</dl>
			<h4><strong>For the bibliography</strong></h4>For ease of access, you may like to divide your 
			bibliography into Books and Articles, Teaching Materials and 
			Electronic resources.<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>Books</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>List references in alphabetical order by the surname of the 
				first author.&nbsp; If the author is unknown you should use 
				“Anon”<br />For up to three authors include all names; if there are more 
				than three, give the first author’s surname and initials 
				followed by <em>et al</em>.<br />Provide, in this order and format:
			Author surname/s and initial/s + ed. or eds. (if editor/s), Year of 
			publication, <em>Title in italics</em>, Edition (if not the first edition) as 
			ordinal number + ed., Place of publication: Publisher<br />For example:<br />
				<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jones, D, ed., 1995, 
				<em>My Teaching and Other Fiascos</em>, 5th ed., London: 
				Concourse publications</span></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>Articles</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>Include also: full journal title, volume number (issue number) and 
			page numbers, for example,<br /><span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bloggs, T, 1997,
				<em>Developing fluency through ferret keeping</em>, English 
			Language Teaching Journal, 41, 3 pp. 18-83</span></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>Electronic resources</em></strong></dt>
				<dt class="auto-style5">E-journals – include full URL and date of access, for example:<br />
				<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bloggs TA, Brown G.C., 2012,

			<p>You are expected at Delta level to do proper research into and

					<td style="width: 15%"><strong><em>1 Grammar</em></strong><em><br />
					Anecdotes involve the descriptions of past events. As a 
					result, past verb forms are more frequently used to help to 
					narrate the main events. Storytellers also use progressive 
					aspects to provide a temporal frame around an event or 
					series of events (Thornbury and Slade, 2006).<br />
					Example:<br />
					It was two weeks ago, my friends and I were having drinks in 
					a bar.<br />

					<td class="auto-style46">
					<div id="integrate" style="visibility:hidden">
					<ol class="style_brown">
						<li>The first problem is that this counts as plagiarism 
						because the citation has not been properly punctuated to 
						show where it starts and stops.<br />
						The source is properly referenced but the original is:<br />
						<em><span class="style_black">
						<span class="auto-style45">The pragmatic effect of 
						progressive aspect is to provide a temporal frame around 
						an event or series of events</span><br />
						</span></em>and it is taken from page 160 of Thornbury, 
						S and Slade, D (2006) <em>Conversation: From Description 
						to Pedagogy</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.<br />
						Some of this paragraph is the writer's own prose and 
						some isn't.&nbsp; That's plagiarism.</li>
						<li>The writer has left it there with no comment on what 
						it means although an example is provided.&nbsp; This 
						forces the reader to see how the example fits in and 
						does not show that the writer has understood the point 
						being made here.&nbsp; 
						The text should go on with something like:<br />
						<span class="style_blue"><em>As the following example 
						shows, the speaker selects the form of the progressive 
						(were having) to situate what follows in a specific time 
						frame.</em></span></li>
						<li>The example itself is incomplete because the writer 
						has not realised (or not explained) that the progressive 
						aspect is then followed by verbs in the simple past, 
						usually, so it should go on:<br />
						<span class="style_blue"><em>... when something quite 
						strange happened.</em></span></li>
						<li>The writer has not explained how this is significant 
						or what any implication is.&nbsp; Following the example, 
						the reader expects to be told something like:<br />
						<span class="style_blue"><em>It is, therefore, important 
						that any model text presented to learners includes an 
						example of this initial temporal framing.</em></span></li>
						<li>The author has not fully thought this through:<ol class="auto-style47">
							<li>many verbs are not used in the progressive in 
							some senses in English so the temporal frame with 
							verbs such as <em>be, need</em> and <em>hurt</em> 
							can be achieved in the simple past as in, e.g., <em>
							I needed to see the doctor that morning so I took 
							the bus to town ...</em> or <em>I was on holiday in 
							Spain when I first saw ...<br />
							</em>It is important to view any citation you use 
							critically and mention when what is said may not be 
							entirely and always the case.</li>
							<li>the issue is one of progressive vs. simple verb 
							forms so the expression '<em class="style_blue">past 
							verb forms</em>' needed more precision.&nbsp; Events 
							are described using past
							<span class="style_underline">simple</span> verb 
							forms, frames are achieved by the use of progressive 
							forms.&nbsp; That's the whole point.</li>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li>The author needed to choose an appropriate reporting 
						verb and re-write the opening as:<em><br />
						<span class="style_blue">Anecdotes involve the 
						descriptions of past events. As a result, past simple 
						verb forms are more frequently used to help to narrate 
						the main events. Thornbury and Slade suggest / aver / 
						explain / point out that storytellers also use 
						progressive aspects "to provide a temporal frame around 
						an event or series of events" (Thornbury and Slade, 
						2006: 160).</span></em></li>

				<li>Make sure your examples are complete and representative of

			<p>This is an academic essay so you need to maintain a certain 
			formality.</p>
			<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
				<li>Avoid non-standard abbreviations, contractions and so on.&nbsp; 
				So don't use SS when you mean learners or students, and so on.</li>
				<li>Do not use slang or overly colloquial language.&nbsp; So 
				don't write <em>mess up</em> when you mean <em>confuse</em> or
				<em>disorder</em> etc.</li>
				<li>Avoid the use of meaningless adjectives such as <em>nice, 
				great, lovely</em> and so on.&nbsp; They carry no sense so consider 
				what you really mean: <em>enjoyable, helpful, effective </em>
				etc.&nbsp; Do not use <em>incredibly</em> when you mean <em>
				extremely</em> or just <em>very</em>.</li>
				<li>Use the first person only when you are referring directly to 
				your own experience.&nbsp; If you want to state your opinion, hedge 
				it with something like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em class="style_brown">It can, however 
				be argued from my experience that ...</em></li>
				<li>Hedge what you say in academic terms.&nbsp; Using modality 
				carefully and including hedging adverbials can be very effective 
				in achieving a more reasoned and reasonable tone.<br />
				This means avoiding writing, for example:<br />
				<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is obvious that we must ...</em><br />
				and writing something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clearly arguable that we should ...</span></em><br />
				For more, see <a href="../../eap/hedgingandmodality_eap.html">
				the guide to hedging and modality</a>.</li>
				<li>Use a range of reporting verbs when you cite or paraphrase 
				authority.&nbsp; Avoid always writing, e.g.:<br />
				<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jones (1990:230) states, "..."</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp; Jones (1990) says that 
				"..."</span></em><br />
				and consider something more accurate and meaningful such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp; Jones (1990:230) cautions us that "..."</span></em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp; Jones, 1990, observes / notes / makes the point that 
				"..."</span></em><br />
				For more on a range of appropriate reporting verbs,
				<a href="../../eap/reportingverbs_eap.html">see the guide</a>.</li>
				<li>Use subheadings which actually relate to the following text.</li>
				<li>Use bullet points sparingly and not as a substitute for connected 
			prose.&nbsp; Lists and tables are helpful but you must discuss their content.</li>

			<h3>Content: there are four parts to address</h3>
			<h4>Part1: Identification of and justification for the choice of area</h4>
			<p>The introduction needs to set out exactly what the title of the 
			essay means.<br />
			For example,</p>
			<p class="auto-style22"><span class="style_brown"><em>In this essay, the focus is on the future 
			forms in English most needed by learners at A1 and A2 (Common 
			European Framework) levels.&nbsp; It covers the analysis of going to, the 
			will future and the use of the present progressive tense.</em></span></p>
			<p>Then you need to justify it with something like</p>
			<p class="auto-style22"><span class="style_brown"><em>This area has been 
			selected for three reasons:<br />Bloggs (1999: 26) points out that 
			these forms "are essential to any accurate use of future time forms"<br />
			</em>
			</span>(you have shown reference to 
			research and reading).</p>
			<p>Then you need to draw on your own experience</p>
			<p class="auto-style22"><span class="style_brown">In my 
			experience with learners at these levels, there is persistent 
			confusion regarding ….<br />
			</span>(you are drawing on your experience)<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>Learners need these forms in order to be able to …<br />
			</em> 
			</span>(you are showing 
			you understand the value to learners in general for the area of 
			focus)<br />
			You can go on to discuss specific learners you have 
			encountered but this is not the place to discuss the class you will 
			teach – that belongs in the Commentary on the lesson plan.</p>
			<h4>Part 2: Analysis (for a systems focus)</h4>
			<p>This means what it says so it takes the form of an information 
			report on each area of focus and each section follows this 
			structure:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>Identifying the topic</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>e.g., subheading: <span class="style_brown"><strong>going to</strong></span></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>General statement</strong></em></dt>
				<dd >e.g., <em class="style_brown">This structure is very common and 
				has two fundamental functions in the language.</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>Description</strong></em></dt>
				<dd><strong>Form</strong> (describe with exemplification)<br />
				<strong>Pronunciation</strong> (with exemplification and transcription)<br />
				<strong>Meaning and Use / Function</strong> (with exemplification)</dd>
			</dl>
			<h4>Part 2: Analysis (for a skills focus)</h4>
			<p>Here you follow the same three-part structure but the focus is on 
			analysing the subskills (not, please, ways of teaching it).&nbsp; So you 
			have:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>Identifying the topic</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>e.g., subheading: <span class="style_brown"><strong>scanning</strong></span></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>General statement</strong></em></dt>
				<dd >e.g., <em class="style_brown">This skill is employed when 
				the reader is identifying a specific item in a text (such as a 
				date or name).</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><em>Description</em></strong></dt>
				<dd><strong>The skill </strong>(what it is)<br />
			<strong>Purpose </strong>(why it is used)<br />
			<strong>Function</strong> (how it works)</dd>
			</dl>
			<h4>Part 3: Issues for learning and Teaching</h4>
			<p>This is also an information report and follows a similar structure 
			for each issue you identify.<br />
			(It can, therefore, be combined with the analysis like this: 
			Analysis of form / subskill followed by the issue for learning or 
			teaching set out as below.&nbsp; This works well for some topics but 
			needs careful handling to keep on track.&nbsp; Subheadings are vital 
			here to guide the reader.)</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>Identify the issue</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>E.g., with a subheading (e.g., <span class="style_brown">
				<strong>Learners’ first 
			languages differ from English</strong></span>).&nbsp; For some 
				information about how learners' first languages differ and may 
				be classified, go to
				<a href="../../background/typesoflanguages.html">the guide to 
				language typology</a>.<br />
				For a skills-focused essay, you may need to discuss how text 
				structures and writing conventions vary across cultures and/or 
				how issues of politeness and deference may affect how people 
				speak.&nbsp; Try <a href="../../discourse/turn-taking.html">the 
				guide to turn-taking</a> for an example of how that may be 
				approached.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>General statement</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>Make a general statement about it referring to your analysis 
				in Part 2.&nbsp; E.g.:<span class="style_brown"><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learners may be 
				tempted to draw on their first languages to understand the 
				various concepts but languages differ in many ways.</em></span><br />
				Or, for a skills-focused essay:<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In English, the structure of a 
				formal presentation is normally ... but in other languages and 
				cultures such as ... the stages may be ... and learners need explicit 
				training in the conventions or they can confuse and disorient 
				their listeners.</em></span></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>Description</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>Now add the detail, for example<span class="style_brown"><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learners from Italic language 
				backgrounds will expect to find specific and recognisable tense 
				forms to refer to the future, while those from other language 
				backgrounds such as ...<br />
				</em></span>
				<span class="style_blue">Or, for a 
				skills-focused essay:</span><em><span class="style_brown"><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Learners whose first languages structure texts differently may 
				produce texts whose information staging is unfamiliar to 
				English-language speakers and difficult to access.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
				reading, they may be unaware of where to look for information in 
				texts because of a lack of familiarity with conventions.</span></em><br />
				Now exemplify what you mean.<br />
				Now say why it's a problem for learning or teaching or both with 
				an example of the sorts of errors which can occur and how they 
				might affect communication.</dd>
			</dl>
			<h4>Part 4: Teaching suggestions and solutions</h4>
			<p>This is <span class="style_underline">not</span> another information report.&nbsp; It is a discussion because 
			it asks you to discuss both advantages and disadvantages of ideas 
			based on your own experience or teacherly intuitions so it has a 
			different structure and staging.<br />This section <strong>must</strong> be linked back to the content you have already 
			written, especially the content of Part 3.<br />
			This is also the place, in a skills-focused essay, to consider such 
			things as process and product approaches.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>Statement of position</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>something like<em><span class="style_brown"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address the 
				issue of …<br />
				</span> </em>Refer <strong>explicitly</strong> to the issue 
				identified – do not require the reader to figure out what issue 
				you are talking about.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>Preview of argument</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>For example,<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my experience 
				guided discovery procedures are effective because ...</em></span></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>Description</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>Here you describe what the technique / procedure / materials 
				are, using an appendix for detail.&nbsp; Supply enough detail here to 
				make the procedure clear, however.&nbsp; For example<em><span class="style_brown"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This procedure involves three steps.&nbsp; Firstly, ...<br />
				</span> </em>Then set out the staging clearly.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>Evaluation</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>This is a kind of coda, saying how and why you think what 
				you are suggesting is useful and pointing out any drawbacks.&nbsp; 
				It can come in two parts:<br />
				Arguments for with evidence: here you say what it helps with and why 
			– draw on your experience to evaluate.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have found that this 
				procedure is effective in alerting learners to the need for ...</em></span><br />
				Arguments against: here you state the shortcomings (if any) of 
				the procedure / materials etc.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown"><em>Without careful preparation, 
				however, this procedure will not evince the language target so 
				it must be preceded by ...</em></span></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>And so on for the rest of the ideas.&nbsp; You should have at least four 
			and they should be of different types – presentation ideas, practice 
			ideas, focus on form, focus on function etc.</p>
			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			<p>If you need a conclusion, keep it short and to the point.&nbsp; Do not 
			repeat what you have said – sum it up.</p>
			<h3>Proofreading</h3>
			<p>Your essay should be free from slips and errors.&nbsp; The syntax 
			should be clear and the reader should be guided through the essay 
			with subheadings.&nbsp; Make sure the subheadings actually reflect 
			the content of what follows.</p>
			<hr />
			<h2>Visualising the essay structure</h2>
			<p>Here's a diagrammatic way of seeing the structure of a good Delta 
			essay with sections overlapping and linked together.&nbsp; You could print a copy to have in front of you as you 
			write.</p>
			
			<img alt="structure" height="261" src="../images/essaystructure.png" width="465" /><br />

			Organising the core of the essay</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			The two key sections are the Analysis and the Identification of 
			learning and teaching issues.&nbsp; There are three ways to go about 
			organising this section.&nbsp; You choose, but don't mix them up.&nbsp; 
			Decide how you will do it and stick to the pattern or the reader 
			will get confused and irritated.</p>
			<h4>
			Route 1: keeping the parts separate:</h4>
			<p>
			<img alt="Route 1" height="327" src="../images/route1be.png" width="500" /></p>
			<h4>
			Route 2: combining analysis with issues:</h4>
			<p>
			<img alt="Route 2" height="327" src="../images/route2be.png" width="500" /></p>
			<h4>
			Route 3: combining issues with solutions</h4>
			<p>
			<img alt="route 3" height="377" src="../images/route3be.png" width="500" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Each route has advantages.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Route 1</strong> (keeping things separate)</dt>
				<dd>This is simpler but requires you to be very firm about 
				coherence and make sure that the identification of issues only 
				deals with things you have analysed.&nbsp; Do not suddenly bring 
				in something new here.<br />
				You need to make <strong>explicit</strong> reference from the 
				identification back to your analysis.<br />
				Make sure you identify at least one issue in each area of 
				analysis (meaning, form, phonology or skill, subskills, use, 
				purposes).<br />
				Be clear how the teaching solutions refer to the analysis and 
				issues you have identified.&nbsp; Do not target a new area that 
				you have not previously discussed.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Route 2</strong> (combining analysis and identification of issues)</dt>
				<dd>This almost ensures that you will be coherent because each 
				area of analysis is followed by the discussion of difficulty.<br />
				You may lose the thread if you find that there is an analysis 
				area for which you cannot identify a problem.&nbsp; You may even 
				be tempted to invent a problem that doesn't really exist.<br />
				You still need to make <strong>explicit</strong> reference from the teaching 
				suggestions to both analysis and identification of issues.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Route 3</strong> (combining issues with teaching 
				solutions)</dt>
				<dd>This route, too, will help you maintain linkage and 
				coherence because each issue you identify is followed 
				immediately by a teaching solution or two.<br />
				You will need to keep an eye firmly on the discussion in the 
				analysis to make sure you not identifying an issue you have not 
				analysed.<br />
				You will still need to make <strong>explicit</strong> links to 
				the analysis.<br />
				You may be tempted to insert more analysis here and that will 
				lead you astray.&nbsp; If you are tempted, go back and insert 
				the analysis where it belongs.</dd>

			<p>Do <strong>not</strong> be tempted to combine Analysis with

			The essay will become incoherent and difficult to follow because too 
			much is intertwined.</p>
