			<p>In your plan, you set out and named the stages of the lesson and the aims 
			of each stage.<br />
			Look again at the procedures and their aims and ask yourself:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Are the aims of all stages part of my 
				overall aims for the lesson?</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Will the procedure / materials / tasks 
				etc. actually help the learners move on from where they are to 
				where they are going to be?</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">What can go wrong with the procedure 
				and how will I repair it?</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>There are two guides on this site which are helpful
			</strong>in this area because you have to decide whether an activity 
			or task is for awareness raising, for teaching (skill getting) or for 
			practice (skill using).&nbsp; The guides are
			<a href="../../../../initial/teaching/activitytypes.html">to 
			activity types</a> and
			<a href="../../../../initial/teaching/tasktypes.html">to task types</a>.<br />
			During the lesson, therefore, ask yourself (silently) this question:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>Have I given and got adequate feedback yet?<br />
				If so, move on (whatever it says in the plan).<br />
				If not, keep going (whatever it says in the plan).</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Exploiting your plan is more than following it.</p>
			<p>At the planning stage:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Judge if you have allowed enough time 
				properly to exploit what you have in mind.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">If you are using technology, make sure 
				you are well rehearsed and have a Plan B for when it doesn't 
				work.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">You need to be an efficient manager of 
				the space and the equipment so make sure you practise and avoid 
				faffing around in the lesson itself.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the lesson:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Make sure you have learnt your plan.&nbsp; 
				Do not force yourself continually to refer to written copy 
				during the lesson.&nbsp; It distracts you, the learners and the 
				assessor.&nbsp; There is a visualisation exercise to do at the 
				end of these four guides which will help with that.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">While an activity is in progress, 
				monitor it so that you&nbsp;know when it's reached its target and you 
				can move on.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Keep the planned outcome of each stage 
				in mind and don't get tempted to do something extra just because 
				it's fun.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Don't cut something short if the 
				outcomes are required by the next stage.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Don't extend things uselessly, even if 
				the students are enjoying it or it has taken less time than you 
				planned.</li>

			<p>This is mostly a planning issue.&nbsp; Look at the stages of the 
			lesson and make sure:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">There are clear <strong>transitions</strong> 
				between stages so the lesson has a sense of purposeful 
				development.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">That you have planned how to <strong>
				signal these transitions</strong> to the learners.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">That there is a <strong>variety of 
				interaction</strong> in the lesson: student to student, students 
				to students, teacher to students, teacher to whole class, 
				teacher to group, group to group etc.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">That you have planned for <strong>
				variation in pace</strong>.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">That you have planned for <strong>
				variation in activity types</strong>.<br />
				Try to avoid: 
				explain &rarr; handout &rarr; task &rarr; feedback &rarr; next 
				explanation &rarr; next task etc. for the whole of the 
				lesson.&nbsp; It gets dull and predictable.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">That you have catered for the <strong>
				learning preferences</strong> of individual learners with times 
				to read, to write, to speak, to think etc.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">That the <strong>learners will have a 
				record</strong> to take away with them.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>In the lesson:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>Get everyone's attention before you segue between stages of 
				the lesson so everyone knows you are moving on.</li>
				<li>Be clear and assertive in signalling the end of a stage and 
				the beginning of the next.&nbsp; Don't let things just slide 
				along.</li>

			<p>At the planning stage, you need to make sure that there are times

			Make sure in the lesson:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>You allow time to let these checking stages happen.</li>
				<li>You monitor carefully so you know what's been learned and 
				what hasn't.</li>
