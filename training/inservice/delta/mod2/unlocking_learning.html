			<p>There isn't a word in English to describe something midway 
			between a method and a technique.&nbsp; Procedure is the best we can 
			find.<br />
			The term is slightly misleading because these are not procedural 
			techniques like drilling, nominating, waiting and so on.&nbsp; Nor 
			are they purely teaching behavioural formulae such as concept 
			checking or Dictogloss.<br />
			The four procedures, for want of a better word, described here 
			underlie a good deal of teacher behaviours in the classroom which 
			can lead to real learning.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Good question.<br />
			There is, of course, a very large range of possible procedures and 
			techniques which good teachers use appropriately to enhance learning 
			in the classroom.<br />
			Some are managerial issues such as grouping learners effectively, 
			nomination, drilling, concept checking, instructional language, 
			questioning and so on.<br />
			Others are purely techniques such as eliciting, dictation of one 
			kind or another, using games, using music, song and poetry, schemata 
			activation, warmers and so on.<br />
			What is special about these four is that they are at one stage 
			removed from pure technique because they are the reasons why the 
			technique is employed.<br />
			It can be envisioned like this:<br />
			<img alt="four ideas" height="318" src="../../../imagesgraphics/four_ideas.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>The graphic is intended to show that these four ideas lie at the 
			heart of much good teaching (not all of it) and are surrounded by a 
			cloud of second-level behaviours which depend on one or more of the 
			key ideas.&nbsp; The outer ring is meant to be indicative rather than exhaustive.<br />
			If you have taken an initial training course, you may well be 
			familiar with all the techniques in the outer ring because 
			second-level behaviours such as the ones listed above constitute a 
			good deal of what participants on such courses learn about and 
			should be 
			able to employ in the classroom.&nbsp; Many are taught by 
			demonstration and modelling followed by imitation by the trainee.</p>
			<p>However, rarely mentioned on such courses is why the techniques are 
			being employed at all because such courses are usually short and 
			staunchly practical with little time or interest to discover deeper 
			reasons why we do the things we do in the classroom.<br />
			One reason why this guide is in the Delta section, although it is 
			linked from elsewhere, too, is that an essential difference between 
			initial- and diploma-level training lies precisely in investigating 
			what underlies good practice.</p>
			<p>These four top-level ideas are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Noticing</li>
				<li>Input vs. output</li>
				<li>Inferencing</li>
				<li>Scaffolding</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All four depend on four overarching hypotheses to do with learning 
			and we'll summarise those first to set the scene.</p>

					<h2>Overarching hypotheses</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It has not gone unnoticed by most language teaching professionals 
			that learning only happens when the learner is ready for it to 
			happen.&nbsp; Most teachers have experienced times when they know 
			that what they are doing is not working in the sense that, although 
			the learners may seem busy, involved and active, nothing new is 
			being acquired.<br />
			At other times, the golden classroom moments, we have also been 
			aware that what is happening is contributing to real progress.&nbsp; 
			Learners are moving on, almost visibly, from where they were towards 
			where they want to be.<br />
			Underlying this phenomenon are four connected hypotheses concerning 
			what happens when people learn.</p>

					<td valign="top" class="auto-style41">This is not to do with grand theories of 
					motivation concerning, for example, the difference between 
					intrinsic and extrinsic motivation or between instrumental 
					and integrative motivation.&nbsp; For that, see the guide to 
					motivation linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
					Here, the concern is based more on the individual's 
					understanding of what is useful and usable.<br />
					There are three related elements:<ol class="auto-style39">
			<li>Valence: the value attached to an outcome.<br />
			<em>How much does the learner value learning English?</em></li>
			<li>Expectancy: the individual's ability to achieve the goals set.<br />
			<em>Does the learner believe she/he can 
			successfully learn English from this input and these tasks?</em></li>
			<li>Instrumentality: the likelihood that the effort will be rewarded 
			with a successful outcome.<br />
			<em>Does the learner believe the learning will help him/her to use English successfully?</em></li>
		</ol>
					In other words, have we set a task or a challenge that the 
					learners perceive as useful in terms of affording them an 
					opportunity to get from where they are now to where they 
					want to be?<br />
					This is the basic starting point for learning.&nbsp; If 
					valence, expectancy and instrumentality are all low, 
					learning is unlikely to happen no matter how entertaining 
					and interesting the lesson is.<br />

						is asking too much or too little &ndash; challenge is

					<p>In other words: without a knowledge of where the

					<span class="style_underline"><strong>anything</strong></span>:

					The origins of interlanguage studies lie in the discovery 
					that although many errors are caused by interference from 
					the learners' first language(s), some clearly are not: they 
					are attempts at forming hypotheses about the language and 
					may be incomplete, over-elaborate or plain wrong.&nbsp; 
					Knowing what hypotheses our learners are currently working

					<td valign="top" class="auto-style43">This is a cognitive 
					theory of learning and the one which will, for the most

					The theory rests on the assertion that learners of a 
					language are actively 
					hypothesising what its rules are and refining their 
					hypotheses as more data become available.&nbsp; It explains, 
					among much else, the fact that second language learners may 
					apply a newly-acquired rule indiscriminately and, for 
					example, put and <em>-ed</em> ending on all verbs to show past tenses 
				before they refine the hypothesis and link the phenomenon only 
				to regular verbs in English.&nbsp; It will also explain errors 
				such as <br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Do you can come?</em></span><br />
				as evidence that the learner has made a hypothesis that all 
				verbs form questions in this way in English.<br />
				Only later will the learner reconstruct the hypothesis to 
				exclude modal auxiliary verbs from the scheme.<br />
					Evidence 
					for this includes what is called the U-shaped learning 
					curve.&nbsp; It has been observed that learners will often 
					begin with the correct form and say, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the party</em><br />
					but will later produce:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I goed to the party</em><br />
					because before they acquired the rule, they merely 
					reproduced a chunk of heard language but, having learned the 
					rule they applied it too widely.&nbsp; Later, they will 
					grasp the rule's limitations and revert to the correct form.<br />
					What follows assumes that learning is not a matter of 
					imitation and repetition (although that may play a role) but 
					an active cognitive process in which the learner is engaged 
					not passively receiving.<br />

			<p>It has been asserted, famously by Krashen, that language may be 
			acquired by an unconscious process of 'picking it up' and there are 
			those who would assert that they have, indeed, done just that.&nbsp; 
			Krashen's point is that acquisition is a process similar to the way in which children 
			acquire their first language(s).&nbsp; It requires meaningful and 
			frequent interaction in the language in which the speakers are not 
			focused on form but on meaning.<br />
			This is not to say that Krashen dismisses instruction altogether 
			because he goes on to state:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The classroom is of benefit when it is the 
			major source of comprehensible input.<br />
			<span class="auto-style59">Krashen, 1982</span></p>
			<p>and elsewhere, he makes it clear that for lower-level students, 
			the classroom may be the only place where comprehensible and useful 
			input is obtained.<br />
			Learning is, however, a formal procedure which focuses on the 
			explanation of rules and correction of language form and Krashen 
			states:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">When acquirers have rich sources of input 
			outside the class, and when they are proficient enough to take 
			advantage of it (i.e. understand at least some of it), the classroom 
			does not make an important contribution.<br />
			<span class="auto-style59">Ibid</span></p>
			<p>Ellis, reviewing this, points out that:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>It is clear that 'acquisition', in the sense intended by Krashen, 
			can involve some degree of consciousness (in noticing and noticing 
			the gap).<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style59">Ellis 1994:363</span></span></p>
			<p>He goes on to say that one possibility ...</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>... is that explicit knowledge functions as a facilitator, helping 
			learners to notice features in the input which they would otherwise 
			miss and also to compare what they notice with what they produce.<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style60">Ibid</span></span></p>
			<p>There are, as Ellis notes above, two forms of noticing:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Noticing features of the language that you need to learn</li>
				<li>Noticing the difference between what you produce and the 
				target with which you are presented</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If Krashen is right that all that is needed for language 
			acquisition to occur is meaningful and frequent interaction in the 
			language in which the speakers are not focused on form but on 
			meaning, then deliberately encouraging noticing has no place.<br />
			However, if Ellis is correct and one of the major functions of the 
			teacher is to act as a facilitator and help learners to notice 
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>salient</strong></span> input, then it certainly does have a place.<br />
			There is guide devoted to noticing on the site, linked below, but 
			here we are concerned not with the how and what of noticing but the 
			when, why and where.</p>
			<p>All of the mega-hypotheses outlined above play a role here:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Motivation</dt>
				<dd>Noticing will not be effective, however cleverly it is 
				encouraged, if the learner is unconvinced that the language or 
				skill which is the target is useful, relevant and central to the 
				learner's aims.<br />
				In other words, the targets of noticing must be explicitly 
				linked to the learners' perceived needs and contribute to the 
				notion that what is being pointed out, by whatever means, <em>will help him/her to use English successfully</em>.</dd>
				<dt>Interlanguage</dt>
				<dd>Without a good understanding of where a learner's current 
				interlanguage lies between zero knowledge of the target language 
				and full mastery, it is not possible to identify what should be 
				noticed and what can safely be ignored because it is either 
				already part of the learner's competence or so far beyond the 
				learner's abilities that the time is wasted because there is 
				simply too much that needs to be noticed.</dd>
				<dt>Active construction of grammar</dt>
				<dd>This concerns what the learner does with the what he or she 
				has been encouraged to notice.<br />
				Noticing the gap, for example, becoming aware that a more 
				natural way of saying:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will perhaps not come</em><br />
				could be<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He might not come</em><br />
				will allow the learner to perceive the gap between his/her 
				production with the clumsy <em>perhaps</em> clause and the smoother model 
				using the modal auxiliary verb.&nbsp; However, if language is 
				not learned by a process of refining internally constructed 
				rules, the time is wasted, of course.<br />
				Noticing the features is a parallel event.&nbsp; A learner who 
				is encouraged to notice the tense structure in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I </em><span class="style_underline">
				<strong><em>had</em></strong></span><em> my house </em>
				<span class="style_underline"><strong><em>painted</em></strong></span><br />
				may be able to construct an internal grammar which includes some 
				kind of clause-parsing mechanism such as<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, I see, it 
				is past tense of </em>have<em> + the object + past participle of 
				the main verb and means that I got someone else to do it.</em></span><br />
				This will, however, not happen unless the next condition is also 
				fulfilled.</dd>
				<dt>Is it in the learner's ZPD?</dt>
				<dd>The nature of the ZPD means that the learner must be led to 
				notice not all and every feature of the language but the 
				features which are of concern just above his or her current 
				level of ability.&nbsp; Too obvious and nothing is learned, too 
				obscure and nothing is learned.<br />
				This means in the classroom that tasks need to be set which 
				encourage the learners to notice the features that contribute to 
				an incremental small step (i.e., lie within the zone of
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>proximal</strong></span> 
				development) and all that is required is a small nudge in the 
				right direction.</dd>

					The concept of input is perhaps the single most important

					language grammars<br />
					<span class="auto-style59">Gass, 1997:1</span></p>
			<p>Note the comment that <span class="style_black">
			<em>l<strong>earners create second language grammars</strong></em></span>.<br />
			The key premise is that learners do not 
			acquire a second language by a process of repetition practice or 
			drilling.&nbsp; The assumption here is that learners take an active 
			part in learning by:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>developing hypotheses based on the language they hear 
				and read</em></li>
				<li><em>testing these hypotheses against the reality of new 
				input</em></li>
				<li><em>refining the hypotheses to match the new reality</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In other words, second-language learning is a cognitive process 
			involving, as we saw above, the active construction of an 
			internalised grammar (and more).&nbsp; 
			Nearly all second-language acquisition theorists would concur with 
			that, incidentally.</p>
			<p>Input refers to all the target language that the learner reads 
			and hears.<br />
			intake refers to the part of input which the learner comprehends and 
			acts on to develop his or her development of an internal grammar of 
			the target language, the interlanguage.<br />
			We can already see how the input-intake hypothesis is closely 
			related the mega-hypotheses outlined above.<br />
			There is a fuller guide to the notions of input and output, linked 
			below.&nbsp; Here a summary of the mechanism which is proposed will 
			suffice.&nbsp; A pictorial view of what happens, based on Kihlstrom, is presented by Schmidt:<br />
			<img height="155" src="../../../imagesgraphics/input.png" width="620" alt="input diagram" /><br />
			To explain:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style39">
				<li>The sensory registers accept data from a number of sources, 
				primarily what we hear and what we read.&nbsp; If we pay them no 
				attention (as we might pay no attention to a passing car while 
				we are watching TV) no memory is retained at all.&nbsp; The 
				information is lost.</li>
				<li>If we do pay attention to the data (i.e., notice what we 
				read and hear actively), the data are placed in the short-term 
				memory store (also called working or primary memory).</li>
				<li>Finally, the data have to be processed in some way in order 
				to remain in long-term memory and one way of doing that is to 
				produce what we have heard, write what we have read and so on.&nbsp; 
				That is what is meant by rehearsal and retrieval.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here's how the four mega-hypotheses impact on this notion of how 
			input becomes intake:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Motivation</dt>
				<dd>If the input we receive is obviously irrelevant and 
				peripheral to the kinds of language we think we need, we will 
				pay less or even no attention to the data.&nbsp; Input, in other 
				words stalls at the starting grid.<br />
				The second question in the summary of expectancy theory outlined 
				above is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<em>Does the learner believe he/she can 
			successfully learn English from this input and these tasks?<br />
				</em>If the answer is no, the process goes no further and the 
				input is ignored.<br />
				The obvious classroom implication is to make the materials which 
				we present as engaging and relevant as possible.&nbsp; Making 
				materials and their contents relevant is not just a motivational 
				factor or part of what has been called edutainment.&nbsp; It is 
				a critical factor in ensuring that input is treated with enough 
				attention for it to have a chance of becoming intake.</dd>
				<dt>Interlanguage</dt>
				<dd>A good understanding of where a learner's current 
				interlanguage lies allows the teacher to select input which is 
				targeted at the perceived gaps in the learners' interlanguage.<br />
				This is not just a matter of interest and engagement, it is also 
				to do with selecting language in the input which will, 
				incrementally, move the learners' interlanguage one step along 
				to the right, towards mastery of the language.<br />
				The nature of the way in which input may become intake lies on 
				the right of the diagram above and the process of rehearsal and 
				retrieval needs to be carefully focused on the state of the 
				learners' current interlanguage or the process will falter at 
				best, collapse at worst.<br />
				Again, this point merges with the final one about the ZPD.</dd>
				<dt>Active construction of grammar</dt>
				<dd>This concerns what happens when we encourage the process of 
				moving from the short-term to the long-term memory store.&nbsp; 
				The theory is that actively engaging with the language, making 
				and amending or adjusting hypotheses, aids this process because 
				rehearsal and retrieval can only be achieved if the language is 
				cognitively processed.&nbsp; That means
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>active</strong></span> 
				construction of grammar, not just being told about it.</dd>
				<dt>Is it in the learner's ZPD?</dt>
				<dd>If the input is outside the ZPD, then, again, the process 
				falls at the first hurdle.&nbsp; Overly simple or overly 
				difficult input means that the learners are operating 
				outside their ZPDs and not processing the language at all either 
				because it is boringly simple or intimidatingly difficult.<br />
				Attention may be present, especially in motivated learners but, 
				if the material is outside the zone, the language cannot be 
				recorded even in the short-term memory and it certainly can't be 
				processed in a way that allows it to enter the long-term store.</dd>

					<h2>Inferencing</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Inferencing involves making logical deductions based on data to 
			which we are exposed.&nbsp; For example, if you are standing in a 
			railway station on Platform 6 and you hear:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the 4:45</em><br />
			you will probably, and probably rightly, infer that this means that<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train which is on this platform is the 
			one timetabled to leave at 4:45</em><br />
			you don't need to have it spelled out for you because the other data 
			around you tell you that the utterance is not referring to a bus, an 
			aeroplane, a meeting or a horse race.<br />
			There are two main reasons why inferencing is an important skill to 
			practise:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style39">
				<li>No user of a language can possibly know all the words, 
				structures and expressions in the language so we have to infer 
				meaning from what we <strong>do</strong> know.</li>
				<li>Very few texts, whether spoken or written, actually contain 
				all the information we need fully to understand them.&nbsp; Speakers 
				and writers will always assume some prior knowledge in their 
				hearers and readers.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We infer from three general sources (although each can be 
			subdivided as the guide to inferencing, linked below, makes clear.</p>
			<ol class="auto-style39">
				<li>Extra-linguistic sources:<br />
				These include:<ol class="auto-style61">
					<li>knowledge of the world<br />
					this was what you used to understand the train announcement</li>
					<li>knowledge of people's motivations<br />
					this is how you figured out that the announcer had some data 
					to impart</li>
					<li>knowledge of roles in society<br />
					this is how you knew to trust the message you heard</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Intra-linguistic sources:<br />
				These include:<ol class="auto-style61">
					<li>lexis<br />
					we will expect any text, written or spoken, to include terms 
					related to its subject so, when reading a recipe or 
					listening to a platform announcement, we will expect to find 
					terms such as <em>mix, cook till done, chop, oven, pan, eggs</em> 
					etc. and <em>platform, times, depart, arrive, numbers</em> 
					etc. respectively and will not be primed at all to hear or 
					read <em>rhinoceros, spade, carburettor, seaside </em>or<em> 
					surgery </em>etc.</li>
					<li>structure<br />
					we can assume from our general schema to do with texts that 
					the essential information will be presented in a predictable 
					order with a recipe listing ingredients before procedure and 
					a train announcement telling us what the train is before 
					giving times and platform numbers.&nbsp; This is called our 
					generic knowledge of information staging of texts.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Inter-lingual clues<br />
				These are mostly to do with words or structures which have 
				cognates in other languages.<br />
				For example, if you are a Germanic language speaker then words 
				like <em>land, drink, is, garden, sea, ship, fruit a</em>nd so on will 
				not be mysterious or hard to decode.&nbsp; Equally, if your 
				first language is Romance in nature then words like <em>operation, 
				amplifier, contradiction</em> and <em>express</em> will be equally transparent 
				to you.<br />
				For the most part, too, structures such as comparatives, 
				determiners and quantifiers will also be accessible at least 
				receptively.<br />
				On the other hand, if you are a speaker of a non-Indo-European 
				language such as Japanese, Mandarin, Arabic or Thai such 
				resources will be far less available and functionally absent.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There's no doubt at all that the ability to infer is something 
			that needs attention in the language classroom although there is 
			ample evidence to assume that people do this kind of thing all the 
			time in their first languages and hardly ever think about it.</p>
			<p>However, here too, the influence of the mega-hypotheses can be 
			felt.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Motivation</dt>
				<dd>If the input we receive is too poor to make sensible 
				inferences from it, then motivation will be a factor.<br />
				Asking people to guess what something might refer to without 
				providing them with adequate data to do so is frustrating for 
				them and ultimately dysfunctional.<br />
				Asking people to infer meaning at all is, in some circumstances, 
				something that needs careful handling.<br />
				The third question in the summary of expectancy theory outlined 
				above is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<em>Does the learner believe the learning will help him/her to use English successfully?<br />
				</em>If the answer is no, because a learner is not (yet) 
				convinced that guessing is a useful procedure, then the lessons 
				to be learned from inferring in any way will be lost.</dd>
				<dt>Interlanguage</dt>
				<dd>A good understanding of where a learner's current 
				interlanguage lies allows the teacher to imagine what is and is 
				not actually inferable from the data that are present.<br />
				Clearly, if the level of a learner's vocabulary does not allow 
				prediction of terms which might appear in a text, then he or she 
				will not be alert enough to spot lexical chains or be able to 
				infer what the lexis might actually mean.<br />
				Again, this point merges with the final one about the ZPD.</dd>
				<dt>Active construction of grammar</dt>
				<dd>Inferring from context is not always a reliable procedure 
				because learners can, and often will, form hypotheses about the 
				language they are presented with which are false.&nbsp; This 
				wastes time and cognitive energy because the hypothesis has to 
				be discarded, rather than adjusted, if it is too far adrift from 
				reality.<br />
				For example, if in a recipe one encounters:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; slice, chop, fry and then grate the vegetables</em><br />
				a learner might assume that <em>fry</em> is just another way of 
				cutting vegetables (based on knowledge of <em>slice</em> , <em>
				chop</em> and <em>grate</em>) and miss out an important step.<br />
				The hypothesis about the meaning of <em>fry</em> then has to be 
				discarded because it is too far from the truth to be usefully 
				amended.</dd>
				<dt>Is it in the learner's ZPD?</dt>
				<dd>If the input is outside the ZPD, then, again, the process 
				fails because there is either no need to infer the meanings 
				because 
				the language is familiar and the task lies to the right of the 
				ZPD illustrated above or there simply isn't enough familiar 
				language from which sensible inferences can be made and the task 
				lies to the left of the ZPD.&nbsp; Either way, the effort to 
				encourage inferencing has failed.<br />
				Inferencing only works at all if a task lies firmly in the green 
				zone.</dd>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>As the guide to scaffolding, linked below, makes clear, there is 
			a good deal more to it than just helping or assisting learners to 
			reach their targets.&nbsp; It is an active process inextricably 
			linked to the notion of the Zone of Proximal Development.</p>
			<p>In brief, scaffolding involves six elements (based on Wood, 
			Bruner and Ross 1976:98):</p>
			<ol class="auto-style39">
				<li>recruitment: gaining the learners' attention to what the 
				target is and encouraging them to believe it is important to 
				them</li>
				<li>reduction in degrees of freedom: simplifying the task by 
				reducing the number of constituent acts required to reach 
				solution</li>
				<li>direction maintenance: keeping the learner motivated and on 
				task by chopping up the task into doable sections</li>
				<li>marking critical features: helping learners to notice the 
				gap</li>
				<li>frustration control: the teacher's assistance should make 
				the acquisition of the target language or skill less, not more, 
				stressful than working alone</li>
				<li>demonstration: presenting an idealised version of the 
				language you want the learners to acquire.&nbsp; (It may also involve 
				demonstrating part of a task but not all of it, in order to make 
				the task doable at all.)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is a long way removed from the loose way in which the term 
			scaffolding is coming to be used in English Language Teaching where 
			it seems, rather too often, to be a synonym for helping or 
			supporting.&nbsp; The key difference is that scaffolding is a 
			consistent, active process which involves collaboration between 
			teacher and learner to shape the emerging language.</p>
			<p>Here, too, all the mega-hypotheses play a role.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Motivation</dt>
				<dd>This impinges on the first and third elements of scaffolding 
				set out above.<br />
				Learners need to believe that being helped and supported to 
				reach the targets is a better (or at least no worse) way of 
				proceeding that simply being told the right answer.&nbsp; The 
				object is to raise their interest in and commitment to tasks.<br />
				It may, for example, involve the teacher making it clear that 
				polishing and improving their production will make them more 
				effective speakers or writers in English or convincing them that 
				the target item is worth learning.<br />
				In other words, it addresses the second motivational question:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<em>Does the learner believe he/she can 
			successfully learn English from this input and these tasks?<br />
				</em>Point f. above is also affected by issues of motivation but 
				less globally.&nbsp; We are talking here of task motivation in 
				terms of frustration control.&nbsp; The teacher's assistance 
				should not be so overbearing as to remove all motivation to work 
				on the task and not so minimal that the learner feels as if he 
				or she is floundering.&nbsp; It's a narrow line to walk.</dd>
				<dt>Interlanguage</dt>
				<dd>Scaffolding is all about moving learners incrementally along 
				the interlanguage cline between zero knowledge and full mastery.&nbsp; 
				If you don't know where they are on the cline, this can't be 
				effectively done.<br />
				It also involves incremental, small steps, not huge leaps.&nbsp; 
				The object of scaffolding is to provide just enough assistance 
				and no more to allow learning to happen.<br />
				Again, this point merges with the final one about the ZPD.</dd>
				<dt>Active construction of grammar</dt>
				<dd>Part of the hypothesis is that learners are continually revising 
				and revisiting their hypotheses about how the language they are 
				learning works.&nbsp; That is what is meant by active 
				construction.<br />
				The task of scaffolding is to aid this process, not by 
				presenting data that fly in the face of everything the learner 
				thinks she or he knows but by presenting data which can be used 
				to revise a hypothesis even if only very marginally.&nbsp; A 
				marginal step along the interlanguage cline is better than 
				falling off the ladder altogether.</dd>
				<dt>Is it in the learner's ZPD?</dt>
				<dd>Scaffolding relies on a careful identification of the ZPD.&nbsp; 
				It cannot work at all outside the green zone illustrated above.<br />
				Point d. above refers to <span class="style_underline">salient</span> features and these are only 
				salient if they are limited to one or two extra skills or pieces 
				of knowledge that the learner needs to complete the task 
				satisfactorily.&nbsp; Any more than that and you are encouraging 
				guesswork, any less and no learning is happening at all.<br />
				Scaffolding comes in many guises and may involve partial 
				demonstrations (as opposed to models to follow slavishly), 
				direction (as in helping learners to know where to look in texts 
				for specific data), supplying partial answers to tasks and so 
				on.&nbsp; It is not so much the what of scaffolding that is 
				important but the how and why.</dd>

					<h2>The level of challenge</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Underlying what has been discussed in this guide is a fifth 
			principle: getting the level of challenge right.&nbsp; If, as is 
			frequently assumed, learning occurs when people make connections 
			between what they already know and new data then the level of 
			challenge is crucial.&nbsp; Too little and no new connections can be 
			made, too much and connections can't be perceived.</p>
			<p>Challenge is not only to do with the difficulty of the language 
			or skill which learners are required to master, i.e., the level at 
			which one is teaching.&nbsp; It is also to do with the cognitive 
			effort that the learners are asked to expend on a task.<br />
			In particular, the work of Bloom and many others in the area of 
			designing a taxonomy of educational objectives is influential and 
			informative.<br />
		Very briefly, the revised taxonomy measures the level of cognitive 
		challenge as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Level 1: <strong>remembering</strong><br />
				This involves simply the ability to recall a fact.&nbsp; For 
				example, that the past tense of <em>undertake</em> is <em>
				undertook</em>.</li>
				<li>Level 2: <strong>understanding</strong><br />
				This involves some deeper thought to get to grips with a fact.&nbsp; 
				For example, that certain items or events have characteristics 
				in common.&nbsp; For example, that there are some simple (and 
				not so simple) rules about how to form comparatives and 
				superlatives of adjectives.</li>
				<li>Level 3: <strong>applying</strong><br />
				This involves using knowledge and understanding to make a 
				decision.&nbsp; For example, knowing that a lion is a 
				carnivorous animal, understanding what that means and applying 
				it to being cautious in approaching the animal.&nbsp; In 
				language-learning terms, this means applying a rule you have 
				acquired to more examples of the language to see if the rule is 
				working.</li>
				<li>Level 4: <strong>analysing</strong><br />
				This requires the application of levels 1 to 3 and then going on 
				to breaking things down into constituents to understand fully 
				what is happening.&nbsp; For example, breaking complex noun 
				phrases into understandable and classifiable constituents or 
				being able to recognise the different forms of multi-word verbs 
				are both analysis tasks.</li>
				<li>Level 5: <strong>evaluating</strong><br />
				This involves using all the processes in levels 1 to 4 and 
				judging how well, for example, one's use of language measures up 
				to the models with which one has been presented.&nbsp; It may 
				also require the learners to evaluate the level of formality 
				they need to aim for in certain settings or the level of formal 
				accuracy that is required.</li>
				<li>Level 6: <strong>creating</strong><br />
				This is the most demanding level of all because it requires the 
				use of the previous 5 levels in order to synthesise data into a 
				new and original work.&nbsp; This, obviously, requires 
				independent and quite sophisticated language use but it is 
				simultaneously a high-demand cognitive process for which people 
				need adequate preparation if a task is to be completed to their 
				and others' satisfaction.</li>

			<p>There is a difference, fairly easily discernible in a classroom 
			by an observer, between a competent but undertrained teacher and a 
			very good teacher whose practice is firmly based on principles.&nbsp; 
			The former is someone who</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>knows how to use some noticing techniques</li>
				<li>can provide some comprehensible input just above the 
				learners' current level</li>
				<li>can help learners to infer meaning</li>
				<li>can assist them when they are doing tasks or asking 
				questions</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The latter, however, is someone who can do all of that and:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>knows when and how to use these techniques appropriately</li>
				<li>is aware of the level of cognitive challenge that tasks 
				present</li>
				<li>and understands the difference between:<ul class="greybullet">

					<li>being exposed to language and getting usable input</li>
					<li>inferring and guessing</li>
					<li>helping and scaffolding</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is what assessors often mean when they write something like</p>
			<p class="indentpara">This candidate is a good teacher at an initial 
			training level but not quite there yet at Delta level.</p>
			<p>You, of course, need to fall into the second category and that 
			means not only applying the techniques but understanding them and 
			being able to select them appropriately and use them effectively.<br />
			That is much more than mastery of technique.</p>
