			<p>
			<img alt="writing1" height="207" src="../../../images/write_assignment310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This is a step-by-step guide to writing your first Delta 
			essay.&nbsp; It will take through the process this way:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="process" height="198" src="../delta_images/process_writing_be.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>
			In what follows, you will be advised to look at some other guides on 
			this site.&nbsp; All the links come at the end in the order in which 
			they appear in the text.</p>
			<hr />

					<h2>Choosing your topic</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<h3>The choices and their implications</h3>
			<p>Remember that you have to do 4 assignments in all:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Two assignments focus on language systems</strong>.&nbsp; 
				They must be different areas.&nbsp; You can choose from:</dt>
				<dd>Grammar (i.e., a structure or set of allied structures)<br />
				Lexis (with the focus on systems, not reading etc.)<br />
				Phonology (with the focus on systems, not speaking skills)<br />
				Discourse (again with the focus on systems, not on reading, 
				speaking or writing)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Two assignments focus on language skills</strong>.&nbsp; 
				There must be one of each sort and you can choose from:</dt>
				<dd>Receptive skills: reading or listening<br />
				Productive skills: writing or speaking</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Some centres will insist that you do one or the other for your 
			first Language Skills / Systems Assignment (hereinafter, LSA).&nbsp; 
			Usually the choice is systems.&nbsp; Other centres will give you a 
			freer hand.</p>
			<p>There are implications because your choice of what to cover in 
			LSA 1 will affect what you can do later.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbullet">If you feel happy 
				writing about and teaching lexis, for example, and you choose to 
				do that for your first assignment, it means that you can't use 
				that area for the externally assessed assignment (usually the 
				last of the four).</li>
				<li class="redbullet">In the same way, if you focus on a 
				receptive skill for one of your assignments, the second skills 
				assignment will have to be on speaking or writing.</li>
				<li class="redbullet">If you do two systems assignments 
				during your course, the externally assessed assignment must be 
				on skills and, of course, <em>vice versa</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is important that you think about your choice for the topic of 
			each assignment carefully.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<h3>Choosing</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In most centres, you will do an unassessed diagnostic lesson 
			before you get to LSA 1.&nbsp; That is Stage 1 of Part A of the 
			Professional Development Assignment.<br />
			There is no reason at all for you not to use the same topic for any 
			of the assessed assignments.</p>
			<p>You may already have something firmly in mind for your first 
			assignment.&nbsp; If you don't and are staring at a blank 
			word-processing screen, the place to go now is
			the in-service 
			training index.&nbsp; There you will find guides to 
			different facets of the systems of English.&nbsp; Choose one, work 
			through the guide, and you have made a good start.&nbsp; There are 
			also less technical guides in 
			the initial plus index that 
			you may want to follow, especially if you are choosing a less 
			familiar area.</p>
			<p>OK.&nbsp; Now you have a topic, you need to review the advice in
			the guide to writing a 
			Delta Background Essay before going on to specifics concerning 
			each section.</p>
			<p>There is more information in the short guide to
			choosing your topic for an 
			assignment.</p>

			<p>Most people are happier dealing with something 
			non-slippery for the first assignment, so we are going with systems 
			here as our example.&nbsp; In particular, from here on, the example 
			will be based around this title:</p>
			<p class="auto-style3"><em>Helping learners at B1 level understand 
			and use modality for obligation and lack of obligation.</em></p>
			<p>We have done four things here:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We have made it clear that we are focused on systems 
				(structures for expressing obligation or its lack)</li>
				<li>We have limited ourselves by level (B1)</li>
				<li>We have said that we will focus on both understanding and 
				using the structures</li>
				<li>We have implied that we won't only be looking at modal 
				auxiliary verbs</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The title alone has already got us well on the road to meeting 
			criteria 2a and 2b for the Delta Background Essay.&nbsp; (Now might 
			be a good time to download
			the guide to the Background Essay criteria, linked below and
			<a href="../delta_documents/ELT_Concourse_Delta_criteria_Background_Essay_explained.pdf" target="_blank">
			here</a>.&nbsp; It is a PDF document that will open in a new tab.)</p>
			<p>Now we have the cover page and footer for our assignment:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="title page" height="360" src="../delta_images/title_page.gif" width="250" /></p>
			<p>and that makes us feel better already.</p>

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>The introduction</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is the part where we meet criteria 2a, 2b and 2c at 
			Distinction level.</p>
			<p>We need to say:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li class="redbullet">What we are doing<br />
				For example, we might begin with:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li class="style_black">This essay will focus on helping 
				B1-level learners use and understand deontic modality (i.e., for expressing 
				obligation or its lack) in English.&nbsp; Explicitly, the essay 
				will cover the use of common modal auxiliary verbs: <em>have to, must, 
				ought to</em> and <em>should</em> as well as the use of modal 
				adverbs and adjectives appropriate to the level.<br />Because the focus is on B1-level learners, the essay will not 
				look at unusual forms of modal expression for obligation such as
					<em>Don't you dare do that!</em> and the subtleties of past 
				modal use (e.g., <em>didn't have to </em>vs. <em>needn't have</em>) 
				are also beyond the scope.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="redbullet">Why we are doing it<br />
				Here, you need to describe your own experience and make 
				reference to what you have read and researched.&nbsp; For 
				example:<ul class="style_black">
					<li class="greybullet">In my experience, learners at this 
				level often have difficulty with English modal expressions in 
				general and are often particularly confused by the fact that 
				English uses a range of modal expressions to signal obligation 
				or its lack (e.g., the distinctions between <em>must, have to, 
				mustn't </em>and<em> don't have to</em>).</li>
					<li class="greybullet">It is clear from my research that many 
				languages (Korean, Greek etc.) have a much more limited range of 
				modal auxiliary verbs under which the shades of meaning in English are 
				subsumed (Swan and Smith, 2001, <em>passim</em>).&nbsp; It has 
				also been asserted that<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modal auxiliary </em> <span class="style_underline">
					<em>verbs</em></span><em> 
				are, however, very variable across languages.</em><br />
				(eltconcourse.com, emphasis in the original).</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="redbullet">Why it is important<br />
				Here, you just have to say what value to learners your chosen 
				topic is.<br />
				For example:<ul class="redbullet">
					<li class="auto-style58">Expressing obligation or its lack is a 
				key communicative need for many learners, either when referring 
				to personal motivation or that of people around them.&nbsp; 
				Understanding distinctions between strong advice, obligation and 
				legal, moral or logical compulsion is also important for 
				learners who may come into contact with native or very competent 
				speakers of English in virtually all settings and registers.<br />
					On the other hand, the inability to handle the language and 
					the concepts it encodes may result in learners sounding too 
					demanding, too timorous or too permissive.<br />
					Examples of the kinds of errors they may make are in the 
					analysis and discussion of the issues for learners in this 
					essay.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Notice that we have</p>
			<ol>
				<li>set out our stall clearly (and avoided accusations of 
				leaving certain important things out)</li>
				<li>drawn on personal experience</li>
				<li>drawn on research</li>
				<li>said why being able to handle the structures is important 
				for learners in general, not just our learners</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It's looking like a distinction, already.</p>

					<h2>The analysis</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>You will be unsurprised that this section will not tell you 
			exactly what 
			to write.<br />
			The analysis is contained in the guides on this site so if this is 
			an area you want to address, you should start with the index to 
			modality in the in-service section.</p>
			<p>You'll need to research a bit and focus on expressions such as <em>
			It's (very) important to ..., It's (absolutely) vital to ..., It's 
			not (at all) necessary to ..., It's important not to ... / to avoid 
			+ -ing</em> etc.)<br />
			The first thing to be sure of doing (note that modal adjective, by the way) is to define your key terms.<br />
			In this case they are <strong>modality</strong> and <strong>
			obligation</strong>.<br />
			The first signals the speaker's perception of events or states.<br />
			The second can be roughly paraphrased as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">&nbsp;I state that it is 
			necessary to do something, not necessary to do something or 
			necessary not to do something</span></em>.</p>
			<p>Now you have to get on and do the analysis:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet">Form: the positive, negative and 
				interrogative forms of the selected modal auxiliary verbs and modal adjectives and adverbs 
				used for obligation.</li>
				<li class="greybullet">Meaning: how meaning is expressed 
				using the forms</li>
				<li class="greybullet">Use: considerations of style, 
				register and hedging etc.</li>
				<li class="greybullet">Pronunciation: especially common 
				contractions and stress on adjectives and adverbs</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here's an example of parts of an analysis, lifted partially from 
			the guide on this site which is something you can do providing you credit 
			it:</p>
			<table class="auto-style46">
				<tr>
					<td>
			<p class="nomarginbottom"><span class="style_black">The modal 
			auxiliary verb <em>must</em> has no 
			future or past forms for obligation although it does epistemically in the sense of 
			deduction where the perfect form is used, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He must have 
			arrived late<br />
			</em>so the use of <em>have to</em> is obligatory in, 
			e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I had to do it<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll have to see<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Lewis suggests that English does not have a past form of <em>must</em> 
			because </span></p>
					<p class="auto-style45"><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The intrinsic meaning of must does not admit the 
			concept of remoteness.&nbsp; This being so, no form exists to 
			express the concept in English.</em><br />
					(Lewis, 1986: 111)</span></p>
					<p class="auto-style44"><span class="style_black">That seems 
			arguable on two grounds.</span></p>
					<ol>
						<li>
						<span class="style_black">Firstly, used epistemically (deductively here), the verb
						<span class="style_underline">does</span> have a past from as in, 
			for example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He must have spoken good 
						English because they understood him easily</em><br />which is a past form of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<em>He must speak / be speaking good English because 
						they are understanding him easily</em><br />although when the verb is used deontically (for obligation, the 
			topic of this essay) the form is not acceptable because<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						He must have caught the bus</em><br />is clearly not the past form of<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He must catch the bus</em></span>
						</li>
						<li>
						<span class="style_black">Secondly, if one takes a related language, such as German, we 
			find that the cognate verb <em>müssen</em> does, in fact, have a 
			past tense as in, e.g., <em>wir mussten</em> (<em>we had to</em>).&nbsp; 
			It does not seem that a German speaker feels that the verb use is 
			somehow more remote or less intrinsic simply because the past tense 
			is used.&nbsp; A similar phenomenon is observable in Dutch (<em>we 
			moeten</em> vs. <em>we moesten</em>).<br />Learners may be tempted to see the perfect form here as the past of 
			the <strong>obligation</strong> function rather than the <strong>logical deduction</strong> function.&nbsp; In some languages, e.g., 
			German, they are, in fact, parallel and imply either the 
			obligation or the deduction functions.&nbsp; We may encounter errors 
			such as<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We must have gone to school at 9<br />
						</em>when <em>had to</em> 
			is meant.</span>
						</li>
					</ol>
			<p><span class="style_black">When an adjective implying obligation 
			is used with an intensifying adverb, it is common for either or both to 
			be stressed as in, e.g., <br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is </em><strong><em>absolutely vital</em></strong><em> that 
			the work is done today</em><br />
			or only the adjective may be stressed as in, e.g.,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is absolutely </em><strong><em>vital</em></strong><em> that 
			the work is done today.</em></span><br />
			<span class="style_black">and rarely, only the adverb is stressed as 
			in, e.g.,</span><br />
			<span class="style_black">
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is <strong>absolutely </strong>vital that 
			the work is done today</em></span></p>
			<p><span class="style_black">Another issue for learners at B1 level is 
			that of gradability in adjectives.<br />
			For example, <em>important</em> is gradable so we can have <em>very 
			important, more important</em> etc. but <em>imperative</em> and <em>
			vital</em> are generally non-gradable so learners, unaware of this, 
			may be tempted to produce, e.g., <em>*very imperative</em> or <em>
			*very vital</em>.&nbsp; (Note, however, that in negative expressions 
			both are gradable: <em>less imperative, less vital </em>etc. 
			although this somewhat subtle point is one I would probably be 
			unlikely to focus on unless it comes up in another context.)</span></p>

			thinking because a serious comment is made on the opinions of 
			authority (Lewis).&nbsp; If you are looking for a Distinction, you 
			must read and write critically and not simply insert citation to 
			prove you have read a book.</p>
			<p>This site is, naturally, a very good place to start your research 
			but you may like to go to
			the guide 
			to reference materials for other ideas.<br />
			At Delta level, you need to look beyond grammars designed for 
			learners, excellent though some of them are.&nbsp; You need to look 
			at reference grammars for a fuller picture and then select the parts 
			of the analysis you present bearing your chosen level, focus or type 
			of learners in mind.</p>

			<p>You might combine this with the analysis (as in the example 
			above).&nbsp; That's sometimes a good way to make sure that the 
			issues you identify are closely tied to your analysis and you are 
			not suddenly introducing a problem with a form or meaning you have 
			not analysed.<br />
			You'll find information on this part in the guide to teaching modal 
			auxiliary verbs 
			(linked below) but you must also draw extensively on your own 
			experience.<br />
			You need to mention issues for learners and teachers with:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet">form</li>
				<li class="greybullet">meaning</li>
				<li class="greybullet">use</li>
				<li class="greybullet">pronunciation</li>
			</ul>
			<p>but you <strong>absolutely must</strong> (modal with an 
			intensifying adverb, by the way) keep your eye firmly fixed on the 
			level of the learners (in this case, B1).&nbsp; Being able to 
			pronounce <em>have</em> is not a problem but being able consistently to use 
			the schwa for <em>to</em>, is a problem, for example.</p>
			<p>Examples of the identification of issues for learners are given 
			above in the integration of issues with the analysis.<br />
			You need to remember to include issues for teachers as well as 
			learners so a look through
			the guide to 
			teacher-induced error may be useful.<br />
			You should follow up the identification of issues with an 
			example of what happens when learners make errors.&nbsp; You 
			promised to do that in the introduction (see above).</p>

			<p>Tie these closely to your analysis and identification of issues.<br />
			For example, if you have identified that the negative of <em>must</em> 
			comes in two forms (<em>mustn't </em>and <em>don't have to</em>) and 
			that this is a real problem for, e.g., speakers of German and many 
			other languages, then you need to tackle ways to present, practise 
			and reinforce the concepts.</p>
			<p>Do not introduce here teaching suggestions or materials which 
			have no relationship to your analysis and identification of issues.&nbsp; 
			That will mean you fail under criteria 2d, 2e and 4c and you do not 
			want to do that.</p>
			<p>Make sure you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet">State what issue you are targeting 
				and refer to where you analysed it</li>
				<li class="greybullet">Describe the procedure and or the 
				materials well enough for the reader to understand (don't just 
				bung them in the appendix and make the reader do the work)</li>
				<li class="greybullet">Evaluate the idea stating positive 
				and negative points</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You need to outline and evaluate four or five ideas but make sure 
			they attack different targets and are of different kinds (e.g., 
			presentation, practice, consolidation, revision etc.).</p>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<p class="auto-style57">I have successfully introduced and presented 
			the role of intensifying adverbs with adjectives of obligation using 
			the dialogue in Appendix 4.<br />
			After introducing the characters, their roles and the situation I 
			have played the tape once for general gist understanding.&nbsp; Then I 
			have played it again asking the learners to write down only the 
			words emphasised by the speakers (<em>absolutely vital, very 
			important</em> etc.).<br />
			Together, the learners figure out inductively from the examples they 
			now have which of the adjectives are gradable (modifiable with <em>
			very</em>) and which require intensifying adverbs such as <em>
			absolutely, wholly, totally </em>etc.).<br />
			At this stage, the learners discuss in pairs why the speakers choose 
			to use emphasisers and how they are feeling.&nbsp; I usually give 
			them a worksheet for this stage so that we can check the answers 
			together at the end.&nbsp; It is very important that they grasp the 
			use and meaning here.<br />
			Then the class can go on to practise the forms by ...<br />
			A logical extension is to apply the intensifiers to the modal 
			auxiliary verbs 
			themselves to make statements stronger as in, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I absolutely 
			have to go before six<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really must get on with some work<br />
			</em>etc. 
			because here, too, as was noted in Section 3 of the analysis, the 
			modifier is not stressed but the modal is and weak forms (see 
			analysis of phonology) are not deployed.<br />
			I have noted, however, that these procedures can sometimes lead to 
			learners overusing intensifiers unless the attitude of the speaker 
			is made very clear from the outset.</p>
			<p>Note that the writer draws extensively on personal, practical 
			classroom experience.&nbsp; It is <strong>very</strong> important to 
			do that.<br />
			Note, too, that the writer has suggested a potential drawback and 
			said how it may be overcome.</p>

			<p>If you find that you have bitten off more than you can chew in 2500

			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet">Go back to the title and introduction 
				and re-write both to leave out some areas and further narrow 
				your focus.&nbsp; Then remove from the rest of the essay 
				any mention of the areas and expand what you do say in the 
				remaining ones.</li>
				<li class="greybullet">Re-read everything you have written 
				and cut anything that is not centrally relevant to the title and 
				scope.&nbsp; Do not remove examples because they are important 
				but you don't need three examples of everything.</li>

			<p>For obscure reasons, some centres insist that you have one.&nbsp; 
			If you do, keep it short and use it to sum up rather than repeat 
			what you have said.&nbsp; You do not have words to waste on it.&nbsp; 
			Start with <em>In summary</em> because that will keep you on track.<br />
			An example might be:</p>
			<p class="auto-style57">In summary, as my analysis has shown, this is 
			an area replete with problems for students and subtleties of 
			meaning, form and pronunciation which needs handling with care.&nbsp; 
			The central teaching issue is to make the context and the attitudes 
			of speakers clear in any presentation (see the analysis of meaning) 
			and to provide contextualised and personalised practice (see, 
			especially, suggestions 2 and 4 in this respect).</p>
