		<p>The Professional Development Assignment, Part A concerns Reflection

		we need some data to chew.<br />
		Where does this information come from?<br />
		<a name="1"></a>Pause for a moment and think of some possible sources of information 
		about your teaching and then 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'randa1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">click here when you have a short list</a>.</p>

		<p>Here's a picture of some possible inputs:<br />

			<p>We can consider them one at a time.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>The diagnostic observation</strong></dt>
				<dd>Because the diagnostic lesson looms large on most Delta 
				courses, there is a section on this page (below) which considers 
				how best to approach this.&nbsp; Here, it is enough to note that 
				this should not be your only source of information, although 
				you'd be foolish not to see it as an important one.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Other observations</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are observations you have done of others or that others 
				have done of you.&nbsp; In some institutions, observations are 
				frequent, whether peer-to-peer or undertaken by academic managers 
				of one sort or another.&nbsp; In others, observation hardly 
				happens at all or is half-hearted lip-service to the notion.&nbsp; 
				Whichever is the case, you need to compare the outcomes of the 
				diagnostic observation with what has been said about your 
				teaching in the past.&nbsp; Look for commonalities.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Your colleagues</strong></dt>
				<dd>When we work with people, we often get a strong sense of 
				where their individual strengths and weaknesses lie.&nbsp; You 
				can probably list some for your colleagues.&nbsp; Now is the 
				time to ask yourself:<br />
				<em>What would your colleagues write in the strengths and 
				weaknesses columns about you?</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Reading and research</strong></dt>
				<dd>This may not be particularly scholarly or very seriously 
				done but any reading you have done or conferences / workshops you have 
				attended etc. will tell you something about your own teaching.&nbsp; 
				You may have thought, for example, when reading or being told 
				about something<br />
				<em>That's an interesting idea, but ...</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>That's such obvious nonsense, because ...</em><br />
				Now is the 
				time to revisit your thoughts and see if your responses betray 
				certain assumptions you have consciously or unconsciously made 
				concerning best practice.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Learners' responses</strong></dt>
				<dd>Some learners can be quite sophisticated in their appraisal 
				of their teachers (indeed, some institutions actively canvass 
				their students' views about their teachers).&nbsp; Other 
				learners are less sophisticated, or less interested but all 
				learners react to what happens to them in one way or another.&nbsp; 
				Now is the time to gather your thoughts:<br />
				<em>How would your 
				learners respond if asked what your strengths and weaknesses 
				are?</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Your intuitions</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is often a neglected area.&nbsp; Observers see small 
				slices of your teaching.&nbsp; You see it all.&nbsp; Sit down 
				now and write a list of your most obvious strengths and 
				weaknesses.&nbsp; When you have a list, prioritise it:<br />
				<em>Which 
				strengths and weaknesses have the most positive or negative effect on learning in 
				your classroom?</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>You may have identified other sources which you consider 
			important.&nbsp; That's fine, of course.&nbsp; You may also have 
			dismissed some of the list above as not being available to you.&nbsp; 
			That's OK, too.</p></div>

			records will be sent to Cambridge and it will not be taken into 
			account when awarding the grade overall for Module Two.&nbsp; Relax; 
			the outcomes are for you.</li>
			<li>You will be given some sort of feedback probably both oral and 
			written</li>
			<li>Most centres will require you to write a proper plan</li>
			<li>Many centres require you to write a Reflection and Evaluation 
			document after the lesson</li>
			<li>The feedback you receive from the observer must be included as 
			an appendix to the PDA Part A</li>
			<li>The lesson is not assessed in any formal way and 
			does not contribute at all to the final grade for the Professional 
			Development Assignment</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Before you set out on the diagnostic lesson, there are some things to 
		ask yourself:</p>
		<ol >
			<li>Is this a lesson in which I can take on a number of different 
			roles?&nbsp; It's good if it is, because your tutor can provide 
			richer feedback.</li>
			<li>Am I happy that I have correctly analysed the language and or 
			subskill which is / are the targets of the lesson?&nbsp; It's 
			helpful if you do because your tutor wants to focus on your teaching 
			behaviour and style, not only the content of what you are teaching.</li>
			<li>Have I thought about how I am going to give feedback to my 
			learners on their production?&nbsp; Giving and getting feedback are 
			very important parts of your teaching repertoire and you want to 
			make sure you are doing this efficiently and helpfully.&nbsp; 
			There's <a href="../../../initial/teaching/feedback.html">a guide to 
			giving and getting feedback</a> on this site.</li>
			<li>Have I included stages where I can check learning?&nbsp; See
			<a href="../../../initial/teaching/checking_learning.html">the guide to 
			checking learning</a> for more.</li>
		</ol>

				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Don't base this part solely on the outcomes of the 
		diagnostic lesson.&nbsp; Your tutor watched only a small slice of your 
		teaching.&nbsp; You see it all.&nbsp; Look at the diagram at the 
		beginning and the notes below it to see what other data sources you 
		should consider.<br />
		Obviously, if the tutor has identified important areas to work on in the 
		diagnostic lesson, you should prioritise these but don't limit yourself 
		unnecessarily.&nbsp; Consider also:</p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li>your preferred teaching style and beliefs about what is 'best 
			practice'</li>
			<li>the culture of where you teach in terms of what the institution 
			requires of teachers and learners</li>
			<li>how you adapt to certain teaching contexts and types of learners</li>
			<li>your knowledge (or lack of it) of methodology, techniques,

		<p>For this stage, you need to write between 800 and 1000 words.<br />
		That's not much so be concise and stay relevant.&nbsp; Using bullet 
		points usually saves words but don't do that at the expense of providing 
		some discussion.&nbsp; A simple list is not enough.&nbsp; Here's what 
		you do:</p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li>Summarise your key teaching strengths and areas to work on.&nbsp; 
			Choose a maximum of five (preferably fewer but no fewer than three) or you won't have space and you won't stay 
			focused.<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
				<li>Identify reasons for these strengths and areas to work on 
				where possible</li>
				<li>Explain what the effects of your strengths and weaknesses 
				are on learners and learning</li>
				<li>See if you can link what you do with your underlying beliefs 
				and principles</li>
				<li>Identify the source of these strengths and weaknesses: 
				training, knowledge, your personality etc.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Say why development in these areas will be beneficial to you and 
			your learners</li>
			<li>Produce an action plan for developing your teaching.&nbsp; Many 
			people find a table the best way to set this out.&nbsp; Consider:<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
				<li><strong>Action</strong>: what are you going to do?&nbsp; 
				This could be something like<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think more carefully and plan good 
				concept-checking questions</em></span><br />
				or<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experiment with different ways 
				to give feedback to my students</em></span><br />
				or<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider more carefully the 
				types and sources of error before I jump in to correct.</em></span></li>
				<li><strong>Objective</strong>: say why you are taking this 
				action.&nbsp; How will it help?&nbsp; Look at it from your 
				learners' point of view.</li>
				<li><strong>Evaluate</strong>: say how you will find out whether 
				the action was helpful or not.&nbsp; This might include: getting 
				a colleague to observe, asking your students via a 
				questionnaire, getting a focus group of students together to 
				talk about what they thought, recording yourself, keeping a 
				teaching diary and so on.<br />
				Make sure this column or section doesn't simply include more 
				action but is clear about how you will measure success.&nbsp; A 
				famous dictum in management science is:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can't 
				measure it, you can't improve it</em></span><br />
				Here's an example of how the first row of an action plan might

		<p>There is some advice about how to write questionnaires and 
		the sorts of item-types which are appropriate in the in-service training
		<a href="../../teaching/needs_analyses.html">guide to conducting 
		a needs analysis</a>.&nbsp; That section is not written with the Delta mind but the considerations are the same and 
		you can adapt the procedures to get the data you want.</p>
		<h3>Observer tasks</h3>
		<p>These work well whether used by an observer or by yourself when 
		reviewing a recording of some teaching.<br />
		You can, of course, write a questionnaire for an observer but 
		simple tasks like this often produce cleaner results.</p>
		<h4>Charts</h4>
		<p>This can be an effective way to focus your observer (or you, if you 
		are reviewing a recorded lesson) on what you want 
		to discover.&nbsp; Start with a blank chart and three coloured 
		pens to play with while the lesson progresses.&nbsp; You can also use a set of blank circles and make pie charts if that's 
		easier.&nbsp; Clearly, you can vary the parameters to suit what you want 
		to be the focus.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="chart" src="../../../imagesgraphics/observation_bar_chart.png" height="215" width="465" /></p>
		<h4>Simple tasks</h4>
		<p>
		<img alt="simple task" height="303" src="../../../imagesgraphics/observation_areas_task.png" width="465" /><br />
		etc. for the following stages.</p>
		<h4>Interaction charts</h4>
		<p>Again, these can be filled in by an observer or by you when you 
		review a recorded lesson.&nbsp; You need to limit them to short phases 
		or they become unmanageable.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="interaction" height="273" src="../../../imagesgraphics/observation_interaction_chart_full.png" width="465" /></p>
		<h4>Questionnaires for learners</h4>
		<p>Again, simple, attractive questionnaires which are for simple 
		responses are often better than requiring written answers from learners 
		because the data is easy to interpret.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="learner feedback" height="320" src="../../../imagesgraphics/learner_feedback_chart.png" width="465" /></p>
		<p>This is another way of getting feedback from learners, lesson stage 
		by stage.&nbsp; 
		Get them to put a cross on the line.<br />
		Warning: learners are poor at remembering what they did!</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="what we did" height="310" src="../../../imagesgraphics/learner_feedback_chart2.png" width="465" /></p>
		<h3>Apportioning time</h3>
