			This short guide is intended to be read in conjunction with (or 
			after) the ones which focus on meeting the teaching criteria.&nbsp; 
			It will, insofar as this is possible, avoid repeating anything 
			contained in those guides which apply to meeting the teaching 
			criteria on Delta in general.<br />
			If you have not yet looked at the guides to meeting the teaching 
			criteria,
			<a href="meeting_delta_teaching_criteria/meeting_delta_criteria_index.html" target="_blank">click here for the index</a>.<br />
			Those guides are supplemented by a guide to the things you need to 
			avoid doing when teaching on a Delta course, in particular.&nbsp;
			<a href="things_to_avoid_teaching.html" target="_blank">Click here to go to that 
			guide</a>.<br />
			There are a number of links in this guide to other sections of the 
			guides to Delta Module Two which you may like to follow as you go 
			along.&nbsp; They will open in a new tab so you can simply 
			shut the page to come back here.<br />
			Here, we are concerned with planning and teaching skill-focused 
			lessons on Delta.</p>
			<p>
			For elusive reasons the Delta syllabus (and others constructed in 
			Cambridge) is wedded to the idea that you should demonstrate the 
			ability to teach skills not once but twice.&nbsp; So be it.<br />
			The issue, of course, is that unless you are teaching young children 
			or on an adult literacy course, most of your learners already know 
			how to read, write, listen and speak.&nbsp; What they need now is to 
			learn how to do those things in English.<br />
			It follows, therefore, that an important thing to keep in mind is 
			that by the end of your lesson the learners will have <strong>learnt</strong> 
			something, not just <strong>practised</strong> it.<br />
			If you are tempted, therefore, to practise scanning and skimming 
			above A1 level, or gist listening skills, think again.&nbsp; Your 
			learners have almost certainly been there and done that.</p>

			<p>All plans should, of course be unique and focus on the lesson you 
			are going to deliver.&nbsp; On any delta course, you will be 
			criticised for any hint of a one-size-fits-all section of a plan.</p>
			<p>There is a separate guide to
			<a href="planning_delta.html" target="_blank">planning for a Delta 
			lesson</a> which considers all the assessment criteria for a plan 
			and how to make sure you meet them.&nbsp; Here, we will focus on 
			avoiding the pitfalls of planning to teach skills-focused lessons.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>The class profile</strong><br />
				<img alt="profile" src="../../../images/man_profile200.jpg" /><br />
				In addition to<span class="style_black"><br /><em>a brief general overview of the 
				group of learners and the course</em></span>,<br />
				this part of the plan requires you to provide<span class="style_black"><br /><em>information about individual 
				learners <strong>relevant to the lesson</strong></em></span><br />
				and it is the last four words which are important.<br />
				Your overview (usually set out as a grid) will mention things 
				like motivation, preferred learning activities, interests, 
				special needs, classroom behaviours and so on which will, of 
				course, be relevant to the lesson and its topic.&nbsp; You 
				should also have a column headed something like
				<span class="style_black"><em>For this lesson</em></span> in 
				which you comment (briefly) on the individual learners' 
				abilities in the skill you are targeting.&nbsp; Do not be vague 
				here and make sweeping generalisations along the lines of <br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has difficulty 
				reading<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is reluctant to speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finds listening to natural speech challenging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writes slowly and carefully but is still having trouble with 
				the script</em></span><br />
				etc.<br />
				These are valid statements to make but you need to address the 
				specific subskills that your lesson targets.&nbsp; Here are some 
				examples of better expressed profile sections:<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has expressed an interest in reading academic texts so this 
				lesson on unpacking complex nominalisations should help him do 
				so.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finds responding in real time to conversational initiations 
				very challenging because she over monitors herself.&nbsp; She 
				should find today's focus on prefabricated language chunks 
				particularly appealing and helpful.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is concerned to make sure she understands everything she 
				hears and is easily blocked by any unknown or unrecognised 
				lexis.&nbsp; She needs to focus on monitoring what she hears for 
				relevance and having the confidence to ignore what she doesn't 
				understand.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intends to start an undergraduate course in the USA next 
				September and will need to write reports in English.&nbsp; He is 
				confident in using specialised engineering lexis but will 
				benefit from this lesson which focuses on the information 
				staging and main discourse features of Report genre.</em></span><br />
				Assessor complaints 
				to avoid:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The profiles of 
				learners are helpful in a general way but provide only patchy 
				data concerning the skill in general with nothing specific to 
				the focus on reading for gist.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The individual profiles refer only to general language 
				ability, not to the learners' speaking skills</em></span>.<br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li><strong>Aims and objectives</strong><br /><em><img alt="aim" height="133" src="../../../images/aim_snooker200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</em>This part specifically requires you to have<em><span class="auto-style3"><br />
				clear and appropriate overall aims and 
				learning outcomes for the lesson <strong>in relation to language systems and/or language skills</strong> and learner needs</span></em><br />
				 The critical part here is <strong>and/or</strong>.&nbsp;
				 Clearly for a skills-focused lesson, you will need an explicit 
				and clear statement of what subskills the learners will be able 
				to use or use better by the end of the lesson.&nbsp; However, no 
				lesson is likely to be language free or free of some language 
				which is new or needs recycling so you should not lose sight of 
				the need to have a subsidiary aim which focuses on language 
				systems.<br />
				Here are two examples of how to meet this criterion for a 
				reading skills or speaking skills 
				lesson:<br />
				<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of this 
				lesson, the learners will be better able to access authentic 
				report texts to extract the key data by using knowledge of the 
				conventional information staging and structure of such texts.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsidiary objective: the learners will have been alerted to 
				and be able to use the terms to define various stages of a 
				report text, in particular abstract, supporting data, research 
				data, exemplification, conclusion, literature survey ... and be 
				aware of where they conventionally appear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of the lesson, learners will be able to recognise 
				linguistic and paralinguistic signals which are invitations to 
				take a turn in informal conversations.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of the lesson, learners will be able to use a 
				limited range of linguistic and paralinguistic signals to signal 
				an invitation to take a turn in informal conversations.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsidiary objective: the learners will be able to recognise 
				and use prefabricated chunks of language which indicate an 
				invitation to take a turn.&nbsp; In particular, question tags 
				and their intonation patterns, falling-tone questions including, 
				Don't you agree?, Isn't that the right?, What do you day? Or am 
				I wrong?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsidiary objective: the learners will be able to use 
				paralinguistic features with these language chunks including 
				making eye contact, voice tone lowering and glancing downwards.<br />
				</em><span class="style_blue">Assessor complaints 
				to avoid:</span><em class="style_brown"><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aims set 
				out what is to be achieved but not how in terms of the subskills 
				which are the targets.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate has not set out in adequate detail which 
				subskills of ... she is targeting.</em></span><br />
				</em><span class="style_black">
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate has failed to include the 
				extensive amount of lexical work which was involved in the 
				lesson</em></span>.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">and so on.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Analysis</strong><br /><img alt="analysis" height="133" src="../../../images/analyse_microscope200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				You are required to analyse your target skill(s)
				<span class="style_black"><em>in 
				terms of linguistic, discoursal and communicative features</em></span>.<br />
				You will find a fuller guide to
				<a href="analysis_be_skills.html" target="_blank">analysing 
				skills for a Background Essay</a> in this section of the site.&nbsp; 
				From that analysis, you need to extract only what is relevant to 
				this lesson.&nbsp; Do not be tempted to cut and paste because 
				that betrays an inability to select what is relevant.<br />
				Your analysis should be only of the (sub)skills which form the 
				targets of your lesson and should be exemplified through the 
				materials you intend to use.&nbsp; This is not the place to make 
				general comments about macro-skills.<br />
				There are three elements:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>linguistic</em></span>: what are 
				the language features of the skill(s) which form the targets of 
				your lesson?<br />
				This might include co-text, word class, phonological features, 
				conjuncts, deixis and a host of other factors.<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>discoursal</em></span>: what are 
				the elements here?<br />
				This part might include theme-rheme connections, IRF sequences, 
				shared knowledge between speakers and listeners, turn-taking 
				signals, clarification strategies and a whole lot more.<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>communicative</em></span>: what 
				functions and notions are involved in the skill(s) you intend to 
				teach?<br />
				This might include adjacency pairs, notions of distancing and 
				politeness, genre-specific information staging, communicative 
				purposes, setting-specific skills use and much more.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">Assessor complaints 
				to avoid:</span><em class="style_brown"><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no 
				analysis of the subskills which form the target of the lesson.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The analysis lacks detail concerning how this subskill is 
				employed.</em></span><br />
				</em><span class="style_black">
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate has failed to analyse the communicative 
				effect of the competent use of the subskills involved in the 
				lesson</em></span>.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">and so on.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Timetable fit</strong><br />
				<img alt="jigsaw" height="133" src="../../../images/jigsaw_missing200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Focus on the skills development programme for the group, not on 
				everything they have done / will do next.<br />
				This means setting out quite clearly what allied skills work 
				they have done and what is planned.&nbsp; For example, if your 
				lesson targets a specific speaking subskill, you need to say 
				what other speaking skills lessons they have done and how that 
				links with what you are doing and say how you intend to go on 
				helping the learners to develop their speaking skills.<br />
				Most skills lessons also have a systems input of some sort (see 
				under aims and objectives).&nbsp; Do not forget to include these 
				in the timetable fit in terms of what language they have already 
				encountered and what they will meet next.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">Assessor complaints 
				to avoid:</span><em class="style_brown"><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate 
				has outlined in general terms what the skills syllabus for this 
				class is but has not made specific reference to the skills 
				involved in this lesson.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate has failed to explain how this subskill will be 
				consolidated in future.</em></span><br />
				</em><span class="style_black">
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no mention of any previous work 
				which has been done concerning this skill</em></span>.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">and so on.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Assumptions, anticipated problems and solutions</strong><br />
				<img alt="problem" height="133" src="../../../images/problem_serious_hands200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				You are obliged here to identify what assumptions you are 
				making:<br />
				<span class="auto-style3">relevant to the aims and learning 
				outcomes of the lesson</span><br />
				so make sure that you are focused on the deployment of the 
				(sub)skill(s) you are targeting.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What level of mastery of the skill are you anticipating that 
				the learners already have, if any?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What skills, if any, that the learners already have can be 
				transferred to your lesson targets?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you assuming that the learners will be able to handle the 
				linguistic content of the lesson as well as the skills 
				objectives?<br />
				You are also asked to<br />
				<span class="style_black">anticipate and explain potential 
				problems</span><br />
				and<br />
				<span class="style_black">suggest appropriate solutions to the 
				problems outlined</span><br />
				The problems and solutions you focus on here should primarily 
				not focus on the lesson aims (obviously) but should refer to the 
				skills requirements and any difficulties you perceive concerning 
				the language and the tasks (as well as the general issues 
				outlined in the overall guide to planning at Delta level).<br />
				<span class="style_blue">Assessor complaints 
				to avoid:</span><em class="style_brown"><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate 
				has not addressed the issue of how well the learners can already 
				deploy allied subskills.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate has failed to explain how he will address the 
				issue of potential lexical overload in the text.</em></span><br />
				</em><span class="style_black">
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no mention of a viable solution 
				to the learners' tendency to avoid applying this subskill</em></span>.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">and so on.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Procedures and materials</strong><br />
				<img alt="materials" height="133" src="../../../images/materials_paint200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The first issue is to make sure that you plan in a section of 
				the lesson in which the skill can be <strong>explicitly</strong> 
				described and understood by the learners.&nbsp; You are not 
				smuggling in work on subskills.&nbsp; You need at some point in the 
				lesson to have a phase in which the learners are seen to be 
				aware of what skills they are applying, how and why.<br />
				Secondly, a serious problem with all skills lessons is ensuring 
				that the skill can actually be deployed in the time available 
				for the lesson (40-60 minutes only).&nbsp; There is, therefore, 
				a pressing need to limit skills objectives so that the learners 
				can demonstrate to their and your satisfaction that they are 
				better able to do something in the language that they could not 
				do at the outset.<br />
				Avoid, therefore, lessons whose entire content concerns 
				preparation to apply a (sub)skill.&nbsp; If, once you have done 
				the majority of the planning, it looks as if you will have less 
				than, say, 20% of the time available for the application of the 
				skill(s), you need to rethink your aims and be less ambitious.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">Assessor complaints 
				to avoid:</span><em class="style_brown"><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no 
				stage of the procedure in which the focus on the subskill, its 
				usefulness and appropriacy to the text type is made clear to the 
				learners.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate planned the lesson so that there was 
				insufficient time at the end for the target subskills to be 
				applied so achievement cannot be demonstrated.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials were not suited to the application of the 
				relevant subskills in the time available.</em></span><br />
				</em><span class="style_blue">and so on.</span></li>
				<li><strong>The commentary</strong><br />
				<img alt="commentators" height="133" src="../../../images/commentators200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Here you need to focus on the (sub)skill(s) you are targeting, 
				obviously, and you need to make it clear how your planned lesson 
				will allow for the <strong>perceived</strong> development of the 
				skills.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">Assessor complaint 
				to avoid:</span><em class="style_brown"><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commentary 
				makes clear why this lesson structure has been chosen and why 
				the topic should appeal to the learners but the candidate makes 
				no mention of the usefulness of this subskill for the learners.</em></span></em><br />
				To avoid that issue, it is helpful to set out here what it is 
				about the context of the situation that you are going to focus 
				on in the lesson.&nbsp; The diagram, taken from the essential 
				guide to teaching language skills looks like this:<br />
				<img alt="ftm" height="354" src="../../../imagesgraphics/field_tenor_mode_2.png" width="465" /><br />
				When planning the lesson and writing the commentary, you are 
				advised to bear all that in mind so that it is clear that you 
				are concerned to show that your learners will know which skills 
				they are using, how they are using them, why they are using them 
				and with whom they are using them.<br />
				The guide from which that is taken, has some suggestions for 
				ways to alert your learners to the information they need.&nbsp; 
				It is linked
				<a href="../../../initial/teaching/teaching_skills_essential.html" target="_blank">
				here</a> and opens in a new tab.</li>

			<p>Most of the assessment criteria for teaching are generalisable to 
			any lesson (they have to be) so for detailed advice concerning how 
			to meet them, you should refer to
			<a href="meeting_delta_teaching_criteria/meeting_delta_criteria_index.html">the 
			guides to meeting the teaching criteria</a>.&nbsp; In that you will 
			also find examples of the criticisms from assessors that you should 
			try to avoid being levelled at you.<br />
			Here we will look at meeting the criteria in a skills lesson, in 
			particular, and that mostly concerns certain criteria only.<br />
			We'll take each category in turn:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">Category 6 of the criteria: relationships with the 
				learners<br />
				<img alt="relationship" height="133" src="../../../images/animals_relationship_bears200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				There is some advice 
				concerning how to meet the four assessment criteria in the 
				section in the guides linked above.<br />All that needs to be added here is that for a skills lesson, you 
				need to be alert to whether you are making sure that everyone 
				has an equal opportunity to engage with the materials and apply 
				the skills.<br />For example:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>If you are teaching a reading lesson, have you allowed for 
				the extra time that people with other scripts may need to 
				process the written word?</li>
					<li>If you are teaching speaking, have you made sure that any 
				role play you set up allows both (or all) parties to an exchange 
				to practise the skills which form the lesson's targets?</li>
					<li>If you are teaching listening, have you ensured that the 
				material is equally accessible everywhere and for everybody.&nbsp; 
				If it is recorded, for example, is it equally clear everywhere 
				in the room?</li>
					<li>If you are teaching writing and want to take a cooperative 
				approach, will all the members of a pair / group be required to 
				practise the skills or can some sit back and let others get on 
				with it?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Category 7: language models and information<br />
				<img alt="model" height="133" src="../../../images/woman_model200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This includes how well you exploit and 
				build on what the learners supply.<br />
				In a skills lesson, in 
				particular, you need to focus on criterion 7d:
				<span class="style_black">giving accurate and appropriate 
				information</span>.&nbsp; You will not meet this criterion if 
				you do not consistently alert the learners to what skills they 
				should be applying, how and why.&nbsp; It is not enough that 
				your materials and procedures automatically make people apply 
				particular skills and subskills; you have to make sure that the 
				learners notice the skills they are applying and know why they

				<li>Category 8: procedures and monitoring<br />
				<img alt="monitor" height="133" src="../../../images/monitoring200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				With a skills lesson, you need to be very alert when you plan 
				and when you teach.&nbsp; Monitoring is the key criterion here 
				(8d).&nbsp; With much skills work it is not immediately obvious 
				whether learners are applying the skills and subskills you want 
				them to apply so you need to be active, alert and aware of what 
				the learners are really doing.&nbsp; Try to keep your focus and do not slip into 
				correcting peripheral language when it is the skill that is the 
				focus.<br />When you monitor, there are two purposes:<ol class="auto-style27">
					<li>check monitoring involves making sure quickly that 
					everyone in the room is on-track and doing what you asked 
					them to do.&nbsp; For example:<ol class="greybullet">
						<li>If you are keen to promote skim reading for gist, 
						make sure you get around the class and can satisfy 
						yourself that nobody is reading word by word and trying 
						to understand everything</li>
						<li>If you want people to make brief notes for speaking 
						or writing exercise to follow, make sure that nobody is 
						laboriously writing complete sentences</li>
						<li>If you want people to monitor a listening text for 
						relevance, make sure they know what they are listening 
						out for and that they are not simply trying to 
						understand everything they hear</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>support monitoring involves making sure that you are on 
					hand when needed to help and support the learners.&nbsp; 
					Many skills are unfamiliar to your learners so they may need 
					considerable help to apply them to the task you set.<br />
					For example:<ol class="greybullet">
						<li>If you are keen to promote skim reading for gist, 
						you may need to nudge the learners into reading the 
						opening and closing paragraphs only or to find the topic 
						sentences of each paragraph to get the main message</li>
						<li>If you want people to prepare an oral presentation, 
						they may need help in selecting the ordering of what 
						they want to say and that may require you to suggest 
						what are the most important points and nudge the 
						learners into seeing connections rather than random 
						thoughts</li>
						<li>If you want people to work together on a written 
						text, satisfy yourself that not only one learner is 
						doing all the work and that everyone is practising the 
						(sub)skill which is the target of this phase</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Category 9: management<br />
				<img alt="manage" height="133" src="../../../images/management200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Two critical criteria here for a skills lesson concern adapting 
				the plan to emerging needs and ensuring learners remain focused.<ol class="greybullet">
					<li>With skills lessons, it is often hard to judge in 
					advance how well the learners will grasp the subskills you 
					are trying to get them to use.&nbsp; Never be afraid to 
					stop, rewind part of the lesson and get people back on track 
					and using the skills.&nbsp; Do not be tempted to carry on 
					even though you know that some of the learners are not using 
					the skills which form the targets of your teaching.</li>
					<li>Equally, it is easy for learners to wander off track 
					when asked to apply new skills so you need to be alert to 
					keeping them focused.&nbsp; This usually means asking 
					instruction-checking questions frequently to help them stay 
					on course.&nbsp; You may want to ask, for example:<ol class="smallgreybullet">
						<li><em>Are you going to read all the text?<br />What are you looking for in the text?<br />Where will you expect the topic sentence to be?</em></li>
						<li><em>Tell me the two things you need to understand from what 
					you will hear.<br />Will you be able to understand every word you hear?<br />Are you focused on the time or the place?</em></li>
						<li><em>Are you going to write full sentences?<br />Will you be working alone or with two partners?<br />When you have written 5 points, what do you do next?</em></li>
						<li><em>In this exercise are both people equal or does one have 
					more authority?&nbsp; Which one?<br />Do you need to be polite?<br />Who speaks first?</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
