			<h1>Help! I've been referred in <span class="deltablue">Delta </span>Module Two</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="help" height="207" src="../../../images/handshake_computer310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>First off, you are not alone.&nbsp; Over 15% of people are 
			referred in Module Two.</p>
			<p>Second, you should know that your chances of passing a re-take 
			assignment for Module Two are good because:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You know the system.&nbsp; You have now submitted four 
				complete Language Skills / Systems assignments and there are no 
				nasty surprises.</li>
				<li>You have had the experience of having an External Assessor 
				in your classroom and marking your written work.&nbsp; This will 
				make you more relaxed and able to perform at your best next 
				time.</li>
				<li>You have completed a course and know where your own 
				strengths and weaknesses lie.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In fact, you are in a better position now to be successful than 
			you were the first time around.&nbsp; So, try again.<br />
			Look at the positives.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="open" height="166" src="../../../images/door_open_a250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style6">
					<h2>Where next?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The first thing to do is look carefully at the regulations.&nbsp; 
			Good centres provide advice, help and support for referred 
			candidates but some centres don't.&nbsp; Either way, you need to know now 
			what's required of you and what the systems are.&nbsp; Here's the 
			breakdown:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Eligibility<br />
				You are entitled to re-take twice, making three attempts in all.&nbsp; 
				This is providing:<ol class="auto-style7">
					<li>your portfolio of internal assignments is complete</li>
					<li>you have at least a Pass grade in both parts of a Language 
				Systems or Skills assignment</li>
					<li>you have completed (but not necessarily passed) the 
					Professional Development Assignment</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Time limits<br />
			You must re-take within a one-year period following the issue of 
			results.<br />
			For example, if you are referred in June, you can try again in any 
			two of the October and December sessions in the same year, and/or 
			the June session in the following year.&nbsp; If you are referred 
			in December, you can try again in any two of the June, 
			October or December sessions of the following year.</li>
				<li>Referral assignment topic<br />
				There are some things to consider:<ol class="auto-style7">
					<li>Unless Cambridge have specifically told you otherwise, 
					you need to choose the same focus (skills or systems) that 
					you chose for the externally assessed assignment.</li>
					<li>You are allowed to choose the same skill or the same 
					systems area so, for example, if your first externally 
					assessed assignment was on listening for gist to follow a 
					lecture, your referral assignment could be on listening for 
					detailed information.&nbsp; To be safe, it is probably best 
					to choose another receptive skill but you need to be careful to ensure 
					that it is very different from the skill you focused on in 
					the internal course work.<br />
					Equally, if your systems focus was on a tense area, you 
					could choose an area of lexis, multi-word verbs, modality, 
					subordination and a host of other topics.&nbsp; What you 
					should not do is select another tense area as the focus.<br />
					The advice in both cases is to ensure that you don't find 
					yourself repeating anything so choose an obviously 
					different topic.</li>
					<li>You cannot use an internal assignment for the referral 
					assessment and you must be very careful that what you submit 
					differs completely from anything you have done internally.</li>
					<li>You cannot teach the same lesson or one very similar to 
					it but you are allowed to use the same class or one at the 
					same level.</li>
					<li>You cannot just rewrite your essay.&nbsp; What you 
					submit must be wholly new although you may refer to the same 
					sources.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you do not comply with the first two criteria, you cannot 
			re-take Module Two but you can enter a wholly new course and try 
			again.<br />
			If you try to cheat the system by submitting a re-vamped version of 
			a previous essay or by teaching what is effectively the same lesson 
			as one you have already taught on the course, you will probably be 
			found out.&nbsp; That is not a good outcome.</p>

					<h2>Get a report from Cambridge</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>You need to do this through the centre where you entered for 
			Module Two.&nbsp; You cannot apply directly.&nbsp; You will have to 
			pay for the report, naturally, but in relation to the amount you 
			have already spent on doing a course, it is not a significant amount 
			of money.</p>
			<p><strong>If you do not get a report, you are in the dark and guessing what 
			went wrong and where you need to improve.&nbsp; That is not a good 
			place to be.</strong></p>
			<p>The report you receive will be based very closely on the one the 
			External Assessor sent to Cambridge and will address every criterion 
			on the Delta5a form.<br />
			It will show you which criteria were Met, Not met or Partially met 
			and will summarise the important strengths and weaknesses of the 
			essay, your planning, teaching and post-lesson reflection and 
			evaluation.<br />
			You will <strong>not</strong>, however, get any of your paperwork 
			returned to you with inserted comments and so on as you got 
			(presumably) from your tutors on your course.&nbsp; You will need, 
			therefore, to have your original papers in front of you when you 
			read the report.</p>
			<p>There are three possible overall outcomes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You have failed both parts of the assessment: the essay and 
				the plan, teaching and reflection and evaluation.&nbsp; If this 
				is the case, you need to prepare for the referral assignment 
				carefully, focusing on all parts of the assessment criteria.</li>
				<li>You have passed the essay but failed the planning, teaching 
				and post-lesson reflection and evaluation.&nbsp; If this is the 
				case, do not ignore any criteria which are marked Partially met 
				or Not met for the essay but your focus will, obviously, be on 
				the second section.</li>
				<li>You have failed the essay but passed the planning, teaching 
				and post-lesson reflection and evaluation.&nbsp; If this is the 
				case, do not ignore any criteria which are marked Partially met 
				or Not met for the planning, teaching and the post-lesson 
				reflection and evaluation but your focus will, obviously, be on 
				the essay.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the second and third cases, do not be complacent.&nbsp; It is 
			perfectly possible for you to reverse the grades and still fail a 
			referral assignment!<br />
			In a referral assignment, you need to pass both parts to be sure of 
			getting the qualification.</p>
			<p>In what follows, the assumptions are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>That you have the report from Cambridge on the external 
				assessment in front of you.</li>
				<li>That you are now starting to plan the referral assignment 
				with the intention of getting it right this time.</li>

			<p>Before you do anything else, sit with your essay and the 
			Cambridge report side by side.&nbsp; Each time you come across a 
			criticism in the report with a criterion which is not fully met, 
			make a note on your essay, highlighting the section if it helps, and 
			identify why the assessor criticised it.</p>
			<p>Now is a good time to remind yourself of the criteria and what 
			they mean.&nbsp; There is no detailed gloss available from Cambridge English 
			concerning the criteria for the assessment of the Background Essay 
			so <strong><span class="orange">ELT</span> Concourse</strong> has produced one.&nbsp;

			</table>
			<p>There are three guides on this site concerned with writing a good 
			essay.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="essay_writing.html" target="_blank">How to write a background 
					essay</a><br />
				This guide is concerned with the nuts and bolts of writing an 
				essay.&nbsp; It is mostly about referencing, style and essay 
				structure (i.e., coherence).<br />
				If any of the following criteria are marked as Not or Partially 
				Met, you need to look at this guide (again) carefully.<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>1a)<br />
					If this is not fully met, it means that the essay is not 
					written in language which is clear, accurate, easy to follow 
					and is cohesive and clearly ordered.&nbsp; The report may 
					tell you which of these things were weaknesses.&nbsp; 
					Usually the criticism is that your essay contains too many 
					slips and errors of grammar, spelling, punctuation of word 
					choice.&nbsp; It may also be the case that the essay was not 
					properly orderly and easily followed.<br />
					This is quite straightforward to fix.&nbsp; If the ordering 
					and cohesiveness of the text is the problem, here's the 
					diagram for how it should have been done:<br />
					<img alt="essay structure image" height="261" src="../delta_images/essay_structure.png" width="465" /><br />
					Compare this with what you did.<br />
					If 1a) is not fully met for other reasons, make sure you 
					proofread the next essay very carefully indeed.&nbsp; Make 
					sure that subheadings are used intelligently to help the 
					reader and that what follows them reflects their nature.</li>
					<li>1b)<br />
					This usually means that your use of terminology was faulty 
					or that you failed to define or exemplify terms that you 
					used.&nbsp; Again, this is quite easy to fix so check that 
					you know what terms mean and that you define and/or 
					exemplify any terms to show that you know what they mean.</li>
					<li>1c)<br />
					It is quite rare for this to be Not met but it is often 
					Partially met in essays where you assert things without 
					reference to authority or simply string together references 
					without showing that you know what the citations mean.&nbsp; 
					Read the bit in this guide about how to integrate citation 
					into your text.</li>
					<li>1d)<br />
					If this is not fully met, you need to look again at this 
					guide and check that the way you reference, both in the text 
					and in the bibliography is conventional and consistent.</li>
					<li>1e)<br />
					The word limit is between 2000 and 2500 words.&nbsp; Make 
					sure you keep close to the top end of this range and 
					remember that words in tables, diagrams and so on count 
					towards the total.</li>
					<li>2d)<br />
					If this criterion is not fully met, it means that some of 
					what you have written is not relevant to the topic and you 
					have failed to be coherent.&nbsp; If, for example, you 
					limited yourself to a certain level or skill, it may mean 
					that some of your exemplification, analysis or suggestions 
					for teaching fell outside your scope.&nbsp; Don't let this 
					happen again.</li>
					<li>2e) and/or 4c)<br />
					A failure to meet either or both of these criteria fully 
					usually means that the final section (on suggestions for 
					teaching solutions) does not link closely enough to your 
					analysis and identification of teaching and learning 
					problems.&nbsp; That's easy to fix if you number the issues 
					and then refer explicitly to them in the section on 
					suggestions for teaching.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><a href="delta_essay_1.html" target="_blank">writing your first Delta 
					essay</a><br />
				This is the guide to writing the first essay which takes each 
				section in turn and gives you some examples of what to include.<br />
				Compare the advice here to the essay you submitted and look for 
				discrepancies.</li>
				<li><a href="meeting_essay_criteria.html" target="_blank">getting a Distinction for an essay</a><br />
				This is the guide you need to read very carefully because it 
				takes the criteria one by one and explains how to meet them 
				above Pass level.&nbsp; As you read this guide, refer to the 
				report you have from Cambridge and focus on the criteria which 
				were criticised in that.<br />
				If 3a) or 3b) were not fully met for your essay, look again at 
				either <a href="analysis_be_skills.html" target="_blank">the guide to analysing 
				skills</a> or <a href="analysis_be_systems.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
				analysing systems</a>.<br />
				If any of the criteria in section 4 are marked as Not or 
				Partially met, the usual reasons are:<ol class="auto-style7">
					<li>You have not explained your ideas in adequate detail to 
					convince the reader that you are familiar with the classroom 
					procedures and drawing on your experience.&nbsp; Remember 
					that appendices are extra support and your suggestion should 
					be understandable without referring to the appendix at all.</li>
					<li>You have not evaluated adequately saying what the 
					suggestion targets, how well it works, why it works and 
					whether there are any drawbacks.</li>
					<li>You have not linked the suggestions explicitly to the 
					issues you identified earlier.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="plan" height="166" src="../../../images/plan_blueprint250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style6">
					<h2>The plan</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are eleven criteria which apply to the plan and assessors 
			judge each one.&nbsp; Your report will show which ones were Met, 
			which Partially met and which Not met.&nbsp; With luck, the report 
			will also tell you why.<br />
			Obviously, now your focus should be on getting Met next to all 
			eleven criteria.</p>
			<p>The guide to <a href="planning_delta.html" target="_blank">planning for a Delta 
			lesson</a> is the place to go now.&nbsp; That guide takes the 
			criteria one by one and suggests reasons why you may not have fully 
			met any of them.<br />
			Sit down with your plan and the report and match the assessor's 
			comments against the advice in the guide.<br />
			In particular, look for:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Aims that were either too challenging or not challenging 
				enough.</li>
				<li>Analysis which was copied across from the essay or failed to 
				analyse some of the lesson's content.</li>
				<li>Problems which are identified but not addressed with 
				solutions.</li>
				<li>Procedures which do not contribute to the overall aims or 
				which are not logically sequenced.</li>
				<li>Materials which contained errors or which did not do what 
				you said they would do.</li>
				<li>Timing which was overambitious or too precise.</li>
				<li>A commentary which:<ol class="auto-style7">
					<li>describes rather than explains and justifies the lesson</li>
					<li>does not explain the overall structure of the lesson</li>
					<li>is not linked to the background reading and the essay</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

			good one</a> takes each in turn and suggests how to avoid the most 
			frequent negative assessor comments.<br />
			Look again at what you wrote, read the assessor's comments and 
			compare both documents to the advice given in the guide.</p>
			<p>After your referral lesson, repeat the exercise and write the 
			document carefully to avoid the same criticisms occurring again.</p>
