			<h1><span class="deltablue">Delta</span>: choosing an assignment topic</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="choice" height="207" src="../../../images/selection_sweets310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This short guide is not concerned with writing an essay or 
			planning a lesson.&nbsp; It is about how to choose a topic for your 
			assignment overall which allows three things to happen:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Gives you enough scope to show a breadth of knowledge</li>
				<li>Gives you enough precision and limitation to show a depth of 
				knowledge</li>
				<li>Allows you to select an aspect of the topic to focus on for 
				a lesson</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is important because tutors and assessors often comment to 
			the effect that, for example:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate's 
			choice of topic was too amorphous to allow for sensible analysis in 
			the essay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate attempted too much in the lesson and overloaded 
			the learners as well as running out of time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a poor choice of topic which did not permit any real 
			depth of analysis<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In trying to focus too tightly on a particular subskill, the 
			candidate was unable to set the skill in context<br />
			</em></span>and so on.<br />
			What follows is an attempt to help you avoid such criticisms.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<h2>The rules</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Cambridge have laid down some explicit rules for the teaching 
			assignments in Module Two that you would be foolish to ignore.&nbsp; 
			In the worst cases, having the wrong mix of assignment topics will 
			mean that you cannot pass Module Two however well you write and 
			however excellent is your teaching.&nbsp; Here's a run-down of the 
			regulations:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You must complete four Language Skills / Language Systems 
				Assignments (hereafter LSAs).</li>
				<li>One of the assignments is wholly assessed by an external 
				assessor appointed by Cambridge English Assessment and the other 
				three (usually the first three) are internally assessed by your 
				centre tutors or local mentors.</li>
				<li>Two assignment must focus on language skills and two on 
				language systems.</li>
				<li>The two skills LSAs must be split between receptive 
				(listening and reading) and productive (writing and speaking) 
				skills.&nbsp; This means you must focus on listening or reading 
				for one LSA and on speaking or writing for the other skills LSA.</li>
				<li>The two systems assignments must focus on different areas of 
				the systems of English: grammar, discourse, phonology, lexis.<br />
				(The four areas are not, of course, confined to their own 
				watertight compartments and you will need to show that you are 
				aware of how, for example, discourse affects pronunciation and 
				meaning considerations affect syntactical choices.&nbsp; For 
				more on the latter connection, see
				<a href="../../lexicogrammar/lexicogrammar.html" target="_blank">
				the guide to lexicogrammar</a>, new tab.)</li>
			</ol>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<img alt="dominoes" height="133" src="../../../images/dominoes_a200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h3>The implications</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Your choice of what to cover in 
			LSA 1 will affect what you can do later.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbullet">If you feel happy 
				writing about and teaching lexis, for example, and you choose to 
				do that for your first assignment, it means that you can't use 
				that area for the externally assessed assignment (usually the 
				last of the four).</li>
				<li class="redbullet">In the same way, if you focus on a 
				receptive skill for one of your assignments, the second skills 
				assignment will have to be on speaking or writing.</li>
				<li class="redbullet">If you do two systems assignments 
				during your course, the externally assessed assignment must be 
				on skills and, of course, <em>vice versa</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is important that you think about your choice for the topic of 
			each assignment carefully.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h3>What is not allowed</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Centres vary slightly in how they interpret the regulations and 
			some tutors are not wholly up to speed in this respect.&nbsp; It is 
			up to you, therefore, to realise that what is not expressly allowed 
			is forbidden.&nbsp; The following topic choices are, therefore, not 
			acceptable so do not be tempted to start with anything like these as 
			a title:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Learner training</li>
				<li>Implementing a communicative (or any other) approach</li>
				<li>Using noticing</li>
				<li>Exploiting the Zone of Proximal Development</li>
				<li>Using drama</li>
				<li>Dictionary skills</li>
				<li>The interactive whiteboard</li>
				<li>Preparing for the First Certificate Examination</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.<br />
			All these titles and many more like them focus on methodology, 
			materials or technique / procedure and are unsuitable as a focus for 
			any LSA.&nbsp; You cannot, of course, ignore methodology, materials, 
			procedures or techniques but the place to discuss them is in section 
			4 of the background essay (teaching suggestions) and in the planning 
			of the lesson (where you also need to explain the rationale for your 
			choice of approach and lesson design in the commentary).<br />
			The Professional Development Assignment is also a place to flex your 
			methodological muscles, of course, and there are guides to the 
			various parts of that linked from the Delta index.</p>

			<p>This is the critical issue.</p>
			<p>If you choose a topic which is too narrow:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>you will be unable to show your knowledge of the big picture</li>
				<li>your essay will become an extended commentary on the lesson</li>
				<li>your discussion of learning issues and teaching suggestions 
				will be too limited</li>
				<li>your topic will be a lesson aim, not background research</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If, on the other hand, you choose a topic which is too broad:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>your analysis will be too shallow</li>
				<li>your identification of problematic issues for learners will 
				be too generalised</li>
				<li>your teaching suggestions will be unfocused</li>
				<li>your planning will need to happen virtually from scratch

			<p>The range of possible topics that you may decide to focus on for 
			your LSAs is very large but you should remember that the title of an 
			assignment is not set in stone.&nbsp; You can return to it as you do 
			the research and start to plan and write as often as you like.<br />
			For example, if you find that the title you invented fails to give 
			you enough scope to analyse broadly enough, you can extend the scope 
			in the title.<br />
			On the other hand, if you find that the title leads you to having 
			too much to analyse and comment on in terms of analysis, problems 
			for learners and teaching suggestions, you can revisit the title and 
			add some limitations (by level, aspect of the topic, skill use and 
			so on) and then remove the irrelevant.<br />
			The introductory paragraph of the essay is where you explain what 
			the title means and justify its choice with reference to your 
			experience <strong>and</strong> your reading and research.&nbsp; 
			Be prepared to re-write that paragraph as you 
			develop the discussion in the body of the essay.<br />
			You are in charge of the process until you hand in the completed 
			essay and plan.</p>

			<p>The lesson is part of the assignment overall so needs to focus on 
			an aspect of the area you have chosen to research.&nbsp; The 
			research area will be much wider than the focus of the lesson,

			<p>Purists might aver that you need first to settle on the overall 
			topic of the assignment and then design an appropriate and necessary 
			(for the learners) lesson which fits within it.&nbsp; That is not 
			necessary but it is a sensible way to approach an assignment.<br />
			On the other hand, you may have a lesson in mind which focuses on an area 
			of systems or skills that you recognise your learners need to learn 
			about or develop.&nbsp; If you have, you can work backwards from 
			there to the general title of the assignment in which the lesson can 
			be embedded.<br />
			Some examples may help:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>My learners need a lesson on the verb </strong><em>
				<strong>get</strong></em><strong> used in a passive-voice 
				structure</strong></dt>
				<dd>so my assignment title will be<em><span class="style_black"><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Helping B1 learners with the appropriate use of passive 
				voice structures<br />
				</span> </em>and the essay will focus on how and 
				why the passive voice is used and in particular on dynamic and 
				stative passive structures in English.&nbsp; This will allow me 
				to analyse the passive voice in English and refer to the ways 
				other languages encode the meaning as well as identifying the 
				main causes of problems for learners (see the guide to the 
				passive on this site for more).<br />
				My lesson on the ability to use:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car got damaged in the storm</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car was damaged by his brother</em><br />
				vs.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car was damaged so he didn't want to 
				buy it</em><br />
				for example, will fit well inside that overall area.</dd>
				<dt><strong>I want to research the area of how English makes 
				negative clauses because it interests me</strong></dt>
				<dd>so I will research the area and, while doing so, look out 
				for particular aspects of use (transferred negation, assertive 
				and non-assertive forms etc.) which can form the aims and focus 
				of a 60-minute lesson in the area for my B2-level learners.&nbsp; 
				My assignment title will be<em><span class="style_black"><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helping B2 learners with negative formulations in English syntax<br />
				</span> 
				</em>and the lesson itself will focus on sounding natural by using 
				transferred negation in English to express opinion as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't expect he's going to come</em><br />
				instead of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect he won't come.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>My learners have asked for more speaking practice 
				because they feel they have trouble making small talk with 
				native speakers</strong></dt>
				<dd>so, I want to do a lesson on how to manipulate IRF sequences 
				by making sure that each Response turn also includes an 
				Initiation to keep the ball rolling in interactions.&nbsp; My 
				assignment title will be<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helping 
				B1 learners recognise and use Initiation-Response-Follow-up 
				sequences naturally<br />
				</em></span>and the lesson on the four main 
				types of Initiation which can be included in Response turns will 
				fit neatly within that overall picture.</dd>
				<dt><strong>I have learners who need to access academic texts 
				but this is a huge area</strong></dt>
				<dd>so, for an assignment, I will narrow my focus to either<span class="style_black"><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helping C1 learners decode and 
				produce complex nominalisation in academic writing<br />
				</em></span>or<span class="style_black"><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helping C1 learners identify 
				and express angle and viewpoint through modal expressions in 
				academic writing</em></span><br />
				Then I can plan a lesson on 
				just one aspect of the skills / systems such as nominalised 
				subject noun phrases or understanding the use of epistemic modal 
				auxiliary verb forms in a piece of academic writing.</dd>

			<p>There are a number of ways to get the focus of an assignment 
			wrong and if you do that, the lesson and the assignment will not fit 
			together properly or it will be inappropriate.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Starting from the identification of a topic you know about.<br />
				Just because you happen to know rather a lot about teaching 
				reading or the tense structures of English does not mean that 
				these are suitable topics for an assignment.&nbsp; They may be 
				but it does not always follow logically that they are.&nbsp; If 
				you do this, you may be in danger of:<ol class="auto-style35">
					<li>writing an essay in which you fail to do enough research 
					because you are depending on your memory of the topic and 
					setting out what you already know</li>
					<li>teaching a lesson which is inappropriate because you 
					have started from your concerns, not those of your learners</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Starting by wanting to teach a lesson you are familiar with 
				and which always seems to be successful (whatever you mean by 
				that).&nbsp; Such a lesson <em>may</em> be appropriate for your 
				learners but you run the risk of:<ol class="auto-style35">
					<li>shoehorning your lesson topic into the essay and 
					focusing too narrowly on its concerns</li>
					<li>teaching a lesson which is driven by activities which 
					are engaging rather than those which help to develop your 
					learners' knowledge, skills and communicative abilities</li>
					<li>over- or under-challenging your learners (there is no 
					one-size-fits-all lesson plan)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Starting from a focus which is neither a proper system nor a 
				skill such as the multiple meanings of <em>get</em> or the 
				problems learners have with <em>so</em> and <em>such</em>.&nbsp; 
				If you do this, you run the risks of:<ol class="auto-style35">
					<li>producing a scatter-shot essay which covers lots of 
					unconnected issues to do with the item(s) you have in mind</li>
					<li>being unable to focus either in the essay or the lesson 
					plan on something which is consistent and logically 
					connected</li>
					<li>teaching a lesson which has only tangential 
					appropriateness for the learners</li>
