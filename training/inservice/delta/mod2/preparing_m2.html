			<p>Module Two is the only part of Delta for which you have to take a 
			course with a recognised and accredited centre.&nbsp; There is, 
			therefore, no course as such on this site to prepare you for the 
			Module.&nbsp; That does not mean that help is not at hand, of 
			course.<br />
			Many courses preparing for Module Two are expensive and all are demanding and 
			stressful.&nbsp; Anything you can do, therefore, to ease the way 
			before you take a course will pay dividends later.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

			<p>However you are taking a course for Delta Module Two, by distance 
			learning, intensively over 8 weeks, semi-intensively or spread over 
			months and months, you will find that you do not have time to learn 
			all you need to know from scratch.&nbsp; Anything, therefore, that 
			you can do before the course begins will allow you to focus during 
			the course on things you need to know and learn to do rather than 
			things you should already know.&nbsp; It will also mean you can 
			spend more time on research, writing, lesson preparation and your 
			own development as a teacher.<br />
			The following applies whether you are taking a full-time intensive course, 
			which, as the name implies, require you to do a lot of reading, 
			writing and research in a short time, or a less intensive programme 
			spread over many months, in which you will need to manage your study 
			time around work and other commitments.</p>
			<p>Over the course of a programme for Module Two, you will be required 
			to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Research and write four Language Systems / Skills 
				assignments.&nbsp; Each of these has a Background Essay of 2500 
				words, a Lesson Plan usually about the same length (often 
				longer) and a Post-lesson Evaluation of 500 words.<br />
				That's a total of at least 22,000 words.</li>
				<li>Complete the Professional Development Assignment involving 
				planning and teaching an unassessed, diagnostic lesson, 
				completing the remaining three stages of a Research and Action 
				programme and researching and writing an essay for, as well as 
				planning, an Experimental Practice lesson.<br />
				That a total of roughly 3,800 words.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So, for this Module, you are going to write something like 26,000 
			words in clear, well-researched and accurate English.&nbsp; For a 
			comparison, the average novel contains around 90,000 words and most 
			Master's degree dissertations around 10,000 to 15,000 words.&nbsp; 
			In other words, you are expected to produce one third of a novel or 
			two MA dissertations on a course.<br />
			You will be busy.</p>
			<p>Good providers will send you advice about preparing for course 
			before you begin and you should follow that.&nbsp; If a centre does 
			not do that, you need to ask whether it's the right one for you.<br />
			This guide is intended to help in a more general way and cover the 
			inevitable gaps.</p>

			<p>Good Delta centres will usually require you to complete a 
			pre-course task of some kind.&nbsp; How long, how useful and how 
			demanding such tasks are is variable but you would be foolish not to 
			do what is asked of you.&nbsp; Often, parts of the course you take 
			will depend to some extent on the assumption that you have completed 
			the pre-course task and not doing it will place you at an immediate 
			disadvantage <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em> your peers.<br />
			What follows does not take the place of your course provider's 
			pre-course tasks &ndash; it is intended to supplement them and help 
			you be even better prepared.</p>

			<p>This is about prioritising your time.&nbsp; Nobody else is

			<p>Any area which you scored as three or less deserves your 
			attention.&nbsp; Use the menu on the left to go to the area of most 
			concern to you.</p>
			<p>The next thing to do is to write a list of the strengths and 
			weaknesses in your teaching.&nbsp; No teacher is perfect so do not 
			be afraid of being critical.<br />
			If you would like the checklist which follows as a PDF document on which you 
			can score yourself, <a href="../delta_documents/ELT_Concourse_Delta_Module_Two_Check-list.pdf" target="_blank">click 
			here</a>.<br />
			Consider:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Your relationships with your learners:</dt>
				<dd>Do you treat people equally?<br />
				Are you approachable yet an authority?<br />
				Do you tend to favour the outgoing and contributive more than 
				the shy and silent?<br />
				Do you know all your learners' names and use them to make sure 
				everyone is treated fairly?</dd>
				<dt>Your own language:</dt>
				<dd>Are you always understood first time?<br />
				Do you use pidgin English?<br />
				Do you mumble and mutter?<br />
				Is it clear from your voice tone what you intend?</dd>
				<dt>Giving information:</dt>
				<dd>Do you always give the right information about language?<br />
				Do you always give the right information about skills?<br />
				Do you listen closely to what your learners produce and correct 
				when necessary?<br />
				Are you confident that you have analysed what you teach?</dd>
				<dt>Managing the classroom:</dt>
				<dd>Do you have to repeat and repair your instructions?<br />
				Do you know why you are monitoring activities?<br />
				Do you often run out of time?<br />
				Can you confidently handle all the technological support 
				available to you?</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Now identify three of the most obvious weaknesses and write down 
			what you are going to do about them and how you believe the Delta 
			Module Two course will help you.</p>

			<p>This seems obvious but it is surprising how many people come to 
			Delta Module Two without having a good understanding of what they 
			will need to do on the course.&nbsp; This means they waste time 
			trying to understand the differences between Reflection and 
			Evaluation, Reflection and Action, Experimental Practice and the 
			Professional Development Assignment and a skills-focused <em>vs</em>. a 
			systems-focused teaching assignment.<br />
			Go to <a href="../delta_overview.html#m2" target="_blank">the overview of the Delta</a> on 
			this site for slightly more detail but here's the summary to keep with 
			you:</p>
			<p>
		<img alt="M2" height="321" src="../delta_images/m2.png" width="700" /></p>
			<p>In sum, you will need to produce 21 separate documents during 
			the course.&nbsp; That does not include any pre-course tasks 
			your centre may ask you to complete.<br />
			Don't let any of that come as a surprise to you.&nbsp; If you know

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The absolute minimum set by Cambridge is that you must observe 
			other teachers for 10 hours.<br />
			On some courses, these observations will happen during the course, 
			on others, you will be expected to arrange them for yourself.&nbsp; 
			Some courses, too, have access to video recordings of teaching and they 
			can be used for these hours.<br />
			You will save yourself a good deal of time and energy if you can do 
			some observations of others before the course starts and keep a 
			record of what you have done.<br />
			In particular, you should try to observe people teaching at levels 
			with which you are less familiar and using approaches which are not 
			the ones you use.&nbsp; One of the purposes of the Delta course is 
			to get you to re-examine your own beliefs about teaching in the 
			light of your experience and reading.&nbsp; Observing others is a 
			good stimulus for thought.<br />
			For more on ways to observe, see <a href="observing_teaching.html" target="_blank">
			the guide to observing others</a> on this site.</p>
			<p>Now is also a good time, especially if you aren't regularly (or 
			ever) observed teaching to get yourself accustomed to the feeling of 
			having other people in your classroom watching what goes on.<br />
			For some people, who teach in organisations where ongoing support 
			and observation are not major priorities, being observed comes as 
			something of a shock to the system.<br />
			Now is a good time to make sure that doesn't happen to you.</p>

			<p>Delta courses are not aimed at beginners who need to learn the 
			basic nuts and bolts of teaching.&nbsp; You wouldn't be on a course 
			if you didn't know those.&nbsp; The central concern of all courses for 
			Delta Module Two is to aid you in refining, reflecting on and 
			developing your skills in the classroom and in planning and 
			preparing to teach.<br />
			If you scored less than 4 for statements 5. and 6. on the strengths 
			and weaknesses task above, this is certainly an area you should 
			consider carefully now.<br />
			A major section of this site is devoted to helping people to reflect

			<p>Most Delta candidates have taken some tertiary qualification such 
			as a university degree or a diploma at the same sort of level.&nbsp; 
			That may, however, have been in an unconnected subject area or some 
			time ago.<br />
			In either case, it will help you considerably to look at the style 
			guide on this site and work your way through it.&nbsp; It will also 
			pay dividends if you re-visit it from time to time, especially when 
			you are preparing to write your first Background Essay.<br />

			there</a> or
			<a href="../delta_documents/ELT_Concourse_Delta_style_guide.pdf" target="_blank">
			here to download a PDF file</a> to keep beside you.</p>
			<p>When you have looked at that (or right now, if you prefer)
			<a href="writing_deltahp.htm">try this little test </a>to see what 
			you know.</p>
			<p>There are, of course, guides on this site in the Delta section to 
			writing Delta Module Two essay for teaching assignments and to 
			writing plans and post-lesson reflection and evaluation documents.<br />
			There are also guides to the various parts of the Professional 
			development Assignment covering purposes, style and content.<br />
			You can find them all from the Delta index.</p>
			<p>Briefly, however, you should be aware now that essays for Delta 
			Language Systems and Skills assignments should follow a recognised 
			generic format.&nbsp; They are Information reports with, usually, an 
			embedded discussion or two setting out the pros and cons of an 
			issue.<br />
			They are not expositions because you aren't trying to persuade 
			anyone that you are right.&nbsp; What you are trying to do is 
			persuade the reader that you know what you are talking about and can 
			analyse and discuss things at a suitable level.<br />
			Very briefly, there are four parts to all essays:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Identification of and justification for the choice of area<br />
				You need to be clear about your scope and say why, drawing on 
				your reading and research <strong>and</strong> your own 
				experience, you have selected this area of concern.</li>
				<li>Analysis<br />
				Here you get to grips with the system or skill which is your 
				topic exemplifying everything as you go along.&nbsp; You will 
				draw on your reading and research, of course, but include your 
				intuitions and understanding as you go along.&nbsp; In this 
				section, you need to make it clear that you understand what you 
				have read.</li>
				<li>Issues for learning and Teaching<br />
				You can choose to combine this section with the analysis to keep 
				you on track and make sure you cover what you have analysed and 
				identify issues for all the key points you have made.<br />
				Here, you need to think very carefully about the possible 
				problems learners <strong>from a range of contexts and settings
				</strong>will have with your topic area.&nbsp; You also need to 
				discuss any teaching issues that are present.</li>
				<li>Teaching suggestions and solutions<br />
				In this part you <strong>must</strong> link your ideas for what 
				to do in the classroom and what techniques and materials to use 
				to the issues you have raised and the analysis you have done.&nbsp; 
				This is part of your essay, not a parachuted in section.<br />
				In this section, you need to show you have thought about the 
				ideas you present and can see any disadvantages as well as 
				benefits.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For much more detail, start with the guide to writing an essay,

			<p>Cambridge and most centres require documents you submit to be in 
			a certain format, containing standardised data.&nbsp; In particular, 
			you need to know:</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>How to insert a running footer into a 
				document with page numbers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most centres require your name, your candidate number and the

				<li>How to use styles to make headings and subheading consistent 
				across a document<br />

			<p>Oddly, some say perversely, the ability to transcribe spoken 
			English in phonemic script is not on the Delta syllabus.&nbsp; 
			However, if you are unable adequately to transcribe what you hear and what you 
			intend to teach and research, you will be at 
			a severe disadvantage and unable to analyse spoken language 
			successfully or, probably, to teach it well.<br />

					Start to think about aims and objectives</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>An area that causes even experienced teachers considerable 
			difficulty on Delta courses is matching aims to procedures and 
			devising and expressing overall objectives for lessons.<br />
			The time to think about these things is now, not during a course.<br />
			You need now to acquire the habit of thinking at the planning stages 
			not just about what will happen in the lesson and what materials you 
			will need but about what the purposes of the lesson are.<br />
			Here are some places to start:</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>What language or skill is the main aim of this lesson?</li>
				<li>What secondary aims does the lesson have?</li>
				<li>What do I hope the learners will be able to do by the end 
				that they can't do now?</li>
				<li>For each stage of the lesson:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>what is the purpose of the stage?</li>
					<li>which part of the main aim does the stage target?</li>
					<li>which secondary aim is served by this procedure?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>How will I check the aims and objectives have been achieved?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is <a href="../../../initial/teaching/planning.html" target="_blank">a general 
			guide to planning</a> on the site and a detailed one to
			<a href="planning_delta.html" target="_blank">how to write a Delta lesson plan</a>.</p>

					Timing</h2>

			</table>
			<p>This is an allied issue.<br />
			At first, and sometimes throughout Delta courses, many people find 
			it challenging to estimate accurately how long things will take and 
			what they can sensibly try to do in the time available.&nbsp; This 
			is especially the case for people who do not usually teach in 
			self-contained sessions between 40 and 60 minutes (as the Delta 
			course requires).<br />
			In the weeks before you start a course, note down how long you think 
			stages of a lesson will take and then, after the lesson, write down how long the stages actually took.&nbsp; If there is a 
			disparity, you have a timing issue and that is not trivial.&nbsp; 
			Ask yourself why the timings are different.&nbsp; For example, did 
			you:</p>
			<ul class="deltabluebullet">
				<li>Forget to include the time for setting up and getting 
				feedback from an activity?</li>
				<li>Get sidetracked unnecessarily?</li>
				<li>Get sidetracked usefully?</li>
				<li>Allow things to drift?</li>
				<li>Usefully respond to learners' needs and the language they 
				were producing?</li>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is important, especially if, like many teachers, you limit 
			yourself day to day to the materials and course books with which you 
			are familiar.<br />
			Delta courses require you to carefully match the objectives of your 
			teaching to materials which are fit for the purpose.&nbsp; This 
			requires a good deal of knowledge of what is available and what will 
			serve your purposes.&nbsp; If you are spending time on a Delta 
			course hunting around for materials, then you are using up time that 
			could be spent on something more productive such as planning and 
			researching the area you are going to teach.<br />
			Now is the time to broaden your horizons and do the research so you 
			can build up a small database of published materials to use in your 
			assessed lessons.<br />
			Look at a range of course and supplementary materials, especially 
			those which claim to be using a methodology with which you are less 
			familiar such as a task-based approach.<br />
			Read the introductions to the teacher's books (if any) and see what 
			the authors think they are doing.<br />
			Try some of the materials out now (when it doesn't matter too much 
			if it all goes hideously wrong).</p>

			</table>
			<p>Now is also a good time to do some serious self-evaluation of 
			what you know, half know or don't know at all.&nbsp; If any of the 
			following are unfamiliar to you, take some time before the course to 
			visit the links and brush up or extend your knowledge.<br />
			The acid test of familiarity is to ask yourself if you would be 
			happy explaining the area <strong>right now</strong> on a 
			pre-service training course such as CELTA.<br />
			If the answer is <em>No</em> or <em>Not really</em>, you need to investigate the area.</p>
