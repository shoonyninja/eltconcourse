			<h1>What to avoid in the classroom (especially on a

			<p>
			<img alt="avoid" height="207" src="../../../images/woman_shark310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Nobody (whatever their 
			claims to pedagogic omniscience) has a monopoly on 'the right way' to 
			teach English or any other language.<br />
			However, although there may be lots of the right ways to do things, 
			there are almost infinitely more ways for things to go wrong.</p>
			<p>This guide is not linked explicitly to the teaching criteria and 
			how to meet them (for that,
			<a href="meeting_delta_teaching_criteria/meeting_delta_criteria_index.html" target="_blank">start at 
			the index page for that set of guides</a>).<br />
			This guide is concerned with some of 
			the behaviours which <strong>underlie</strong> the ability to achieve 
			the 
			teaching criteria.</p>
			<p>The following is drawn from comments made by tutors and assessors 
			concerning the most irritating and dysfunctional classroom 
			behaviours that it is well worth avoiding if only for the sake of 
			the assessor's and the learners' sanity.</p>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>All groups of learners contain people with various degrees of 
			willingness to contribute.&nbsp; While the most voluble learners can 
			be of benefit to a lesson because they mean that the lesson's pace 
			and dynamic is maintained, avoiding silences which may embarrass, we 
			need to make sure that everyone has an equal chance to speak, ask 
			questions and make contributions.<br />
			It is also true that all groups of learners contain stronger 
			students and weaker students.&nbsp; No group can ever be entirely 
			homogenous in terms of ability in any one skill or in 
			terms of their strengths across various skills.<br />
			If you rely on the loudest, the&nbsp;most forthcoming or the 
			strongest learners in much of the lesson, you will be criticised for 
			one of the following:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li>not teaching with sensitivity to the learners’ needs</li>
				<li>not providing equal opportunities for participation</li>
				<li>not engaging and involving <strong>all </strong>the<strong>

			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Know your learners.&nbsp; Make a list of all the learners by 
				name and score them in terms of strengths across all four skills 
				and language and in terms of their willingness to contribute.</li>
				<li>Make sure you know who the most outspoken members of the 
				class are and have a plan to deal with them gently while 
				allowing them to contribute usefully.</li>
				<li>Make sure you direct the most difficult prompts to the 
				strongest and the easiest questions to the weakest.</li>
				<li>Nominate learners by name.</li>
				<li>Use more wait time.&nbsp; Ask a question or invite a 
				contribution but make sure you wait in silence for 15 seconds or 
				so before nominating who is to answer.&nbsp; That way, everybody 
				has the time to consider a response before they are asked to 
				contribute.&nbsp; Do not let people shout out an answer except 
				by invitation.</li>
				<li>Differentiate.&nbsp; Make sure that you have follow-up tasks 
				for the strong learners who finish quickly so that they are not 
				sitting idly.</li>
				<li>Be demanding.&nbsp; Most classes contain some learners for 
				whom finishing a task quickly is more important than getting 
				everything right.&nbsp; If this describes some of your learners, 
				make sure you have the space to go to them during tasks and ask 
				a bit more of them than just completing a task.</li>

			<p>Nobody likes to be patronised.&nbsp; Avoid foreigner-speak and 
			pidgin English at all costs.<br />
			Some students are elementary learners, but that does not mean they 
			are elementary thinkers.<br />
			It is, in fact, easier to understand properly formed language, 
			albeit spoken more slowly and simplified in terms of structure and 
			lexis, than it is to understand non-standard pidgin English.<br />
			The same is true of the temptation to use something akin to 
			carer-speak with over-enthusiastic intonation patterns more suitable 
			(possibly) to a primary school.</p>
			<p>If you talk down or use pidgin English, will be criticised for 
			one of the following:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li>not teaching with sensitivity to the learners’ backgrounds</li>
				<li>not using language which is accurate and appropriate for the 
				teaching and learning context</li>
				<li>not adapting your use of language to the level of the group 
				and individuals in the group</li>

				use and pronunciation</li>

			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Use natural English, including contractions and weak forms, 
				but be careful to keep the lexical content and grammatical 
				structures within your learners' competence.&nbsp; This may well 
				mean scripting your instructions and explanations at the 
				lesson-planning stage for lower-level groups.</li>
				<li>Exploit redundancy.&nbsp; Make your language accessible by 
				sending multiple signals.&nbsp; If, for example, you have a 
				class of elementary learners who are unlikely to understand:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When did he go?</em><br />
				because they don't yet understand past-tense questions, rephrase 
				it as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he go yesterday or is he going today?</em><br />
				The words <em>yesterday</em> and <em>today</em> make the tense 
				forms redundant because they signal the time of the action.&nbsp; 
				They are easy to understand and don't require learners to unpack 
				the grammar.<br />
				You have, in other words, maintained naturalness and accuracy 
				but still got the meaning across and that is very much better 
				than:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he go?</em><br />
				which may be comprehensible but is hardly a good model for your 
				learners.</li>
				<li>Although you will, at almost all levels, need to simplify your 
				output to some extent, especially for key ideas and instructions, there is no 
				need to overdo this.&nbsp; In context, even language ostensibly 
				beyond the learners' ability may be easily comprehended 
				providing you accompany it with lots of context, demonstration 
				of tasks and some 
				gesturing.</li>
				<li>When demonstration of a task is a viable alternative to 
				explaining it, do that instead of trying to explain something 
				complicated when you have a limited language range at your 
				disposal.</li>

			<p>When you are nervous and stressed (as most teachers are when they 
			are being assessed), there is a natural tendency to talk to yourself 
			and give some kind of commentary on what is going on.&nbsp; For 
			example, people have been observed saying things like:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li class="style_black"><em>Right, now, I need to move on to the practice stage</em></li>
				<li class="style_black"><em>I need to give out this worksheet now</em></li>

				<li class="style_black"><em>I hope everyone's on task.&nbsp; Let's see ...</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.<br />
			All of this is unnecessary teacher speak and may actually serve to 
			raise the level of ambiguity in the room because learners will be 
			tempted to try to understand everything the teacher says, whether it 
			is relevant or not.&nbsp; You may know that something you have said 
			is not something the learners need to know but they may well be 
			asking themselves:<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black">&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;How do I know if I need to know this until I know what 
			this is?</em></span></p>
			<p>If you pepper your teacher talk with comments on what's happening 
			and asides to yourself, you will be criticised for:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style3">

					criticised and it is true that the more the teacher talks, 
					the less the students can say.&nbsp; However, the quality of

					<li><strong>E</strong>xplicit: learners need to be aware of

					saying):<br />
					<span class="style_black">
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this an instruction, some information or just a chat?</em></span><br />
					then the teacher talk has not been explicit.<br />
					Developing tones to make intention clear is a key skill so 
					that the learners are aware by your tone of voice what your 
					intentions are.<br />
					Don't mix intentions in the same utterance.&nbsp; Don't say:<br />
					<span class="style_black">
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's really good, isn't it but you need to write it on

					this word, please. [Pause for student response] Now go and 
					write it on the board, please.</em></span></li>
					<li><strong>A</strong>ppropriate: teacher talk should 
					tell learners what they need to know and no more.&nbsp; You may

					adjective but your learners may not want or need to be 
					burdened with this knowledge right now because it has 
					nothing to do with the lesson focus.</li>
					<li><strong>R</strong>elevant: this just means maintaining

			<p>(If you are unfamiliar with the phrase <em>a red herring</em>, 
			you may like to know that it means a misleading or distracting piece 
			of information.)<br />
			Life, as John Lennon pointed out (not very originally), is what 
			happens while you are busy making other plans.<br />
			The best laid plans can go wrong and even when they don't go wrong, 
			they usually need some sort of amendment to take into account what 
			is happening in the classroom.<br />
			What happens in the classroom and what your learners need <strong>right 
			now</strong> is infinitely more important than the smooth 
			running of the plan.&nbsp; Deviate from the plan when your learners 
			need you to, not when you want to chase a red herring.</p>

				<h3>The sunk-cost fallacy</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>
			The sunk-cost fallacy is a term drawn from economics and refers to humans' reluctance to cut their 
			losses.&nbsp; Briefly put, it describes the error of valuing the 
			investment already made over the benefits of abandoning something 
			that is not working.<br />
			For example, organisations and governments around the world are reluctant to 
			abandon vast infrastructure projects, the costs of which are 
			ballooning out of control and whose utility is, in any case, 
			doubtful, for two connected reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The amount already invested will be lost if the project is 
				abandoned and that is seen as an unacceptable cost even if the 
				cost of continuing will be greater than the loss.</li>
				<li>Cancelling a project implies that you have made a 
				poor decision and going back on it will be seen as losing face.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Less grandly, the syndrome is observable in, for example, staying 
			to the end of a film you hate because you have invested in a cinema 
			ticket, going to an event you are not interested in because you have 
			acquired a ticket, continuing to invest money in an old vehicle you know 
			should be sold and replaced and so on.</p>
			<p>In the classroom, the same fallacy is often observable and 
			involves the teacher sticking with an activity, text or set of 
			materials which is patently not working and not contributing to the 
			learning that was intended.&nbsp; It may even be operating 
			counterproductively and producing error.&nbsp; There are many reasons why things 
			are not doing what they were planned to do, for example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The material is too easy or too difficult so the learners 
				are operating outside the optimum learning zone.&nbsp; They will 
				either be over challenged by the material, become anxious and gain little or 
				under challenged, gain nothing and be bored.</li>
				<li>The material is flawed in terms of the language or skill it 
				should targeting and not actually evincing what it should.</li>
				<li>The learners are approaching the materials or tasks in a way 
				you did not intend and not gaining what you thought they would 
				gain.</li>
				<li>The material is actually producing errors in language or 
				making the learners produce language which is inappropriate.</li>
				<li>The materials are not forcing the learners to use the 
				subskills which were the intended targets of the lesson.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			There is a great temptation to look on the bright side and think,<em><span class="style_black"><br />
			</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">Well, it's not 
			working but I'll stick with it because it might get better</span></em>.<br />
			when you know it won't,
			or<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took ages to 
			prepare all this stuff and my time will have been wasted if I stop 
			the activity now.</em></span><br />
			and so on.<br />
			And these are not very good reasons to spend time in a classroom 
			doing something that isn't helping.</p>
			<p>
			Bite the bullet, cut your losses and do something useful.</p>
			<p>If you don't adapt your plan to take into account emerging needs 
			or you deviate from the plan unnecessarily, you will be criticised 
			for:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li>not monitoring, checking learning and responding 
				appropriately</li>
				<li>not noticing and exploiting learners’ output</li>

			<h2>Not checking</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>One of the skills that comes hard on an initial training course 
			is formulating, using and following up on instruction-checking 
			questions (ICQs) and concept-checking questions (CCQs).<br />
			By the time people get to a Delta-level qualification, the art has 
			generally been mastered but the stress of being in an assessed 
			observation can do funny things to people and the hard-won skill of 
			making concepts and instructions transparently clear is often 
			forgotten.<br />
			Assessors often note, critically, that concepts or instructions were 
			inadequately or not checked.<br />
			To avoid this criticism, you should do two things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Follow the guide in the initial plus section of the site to 
				how to construct and use both instruction- and concept-checking 
				questions.&nbsp; It shouldn't take you long and it may remind 
				you of some essential ideas.<br />
				The guide is linked below or you can open it in a new tab by
				<a href="../../../initial/teaching/checking_questions.html" target="_blank">
				clicking here</a>.</li>
				<li>Make sure for an assessed lesson that you write down the 
				questions you are going to use to make concepts clear, lead 
				people to noticing key concepts and doing the tasks the way you 
				want them done.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Missing out on these areas will often result in not meeting some 
			key teaching criteria, in particular those to do with focusing 
			learners, managing activities and supplying the right information 
			about language and skills at the right time.</p>
