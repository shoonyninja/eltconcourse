				<li><strong>The class profile</strong><br />
				<img alt="profile" height="133" src="../../../images/man_profile200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				In addition to<span class="style_black"><em><br />
				a brief general overview of the 
				group of learners and the course</em></span>,<br />
				this part of the plan requires you to provide<span class="style_black"><em><br />
				information about individual 
				learners <strong>relevant to the lesson</strong></em></span><br />
				and it is the last four words which are important.<br />
				Your overview (usually set out as a grid) will mention things 
				like motivation, preferred learning activities, interests, 
				special needs, classroom behaviours and so on which will, of 
				course, be relevant to the lesson and its topic.&nbsp; You 
				should also have a column headed something like
				<span class="style_black"><em>For this lesson</em></span> in 
				which you comment (briefly) on the individual learners' 
				knowledge and ability to use the language system(s) you are targeting.&nbsp; Do not be vague 
				here and make sweeping generalisations along the lines of <br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has difficulty with grammar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is reluctant to records vocabulary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finds pronunciation work challenging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writes accurately but with little understanding of style</em></span><br />
				etc.<br />
				These are valid statements to make but you need to address the 
				specific system(s) that your lesson targets.&nbsp; Here are some 
				examples of better expressed profile sections:<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has expressed an interest in 
				learning the vocabulary he needs for travel and tourism so this 
				lesson on multi-word verbs to do with the topic will appeal to 
				him.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finds selecting the right tense to talk about past habits and 
				routines challenging because Mandarin does not mark tense in 
				verb forms.&nbsp; She 
				should be alerted by today's focus on </em>used to<em> to the 
				need to use the form for past habits now discontinued.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is often confused by the difference between conjuncts and 
				conjunctions so this lesson's focus on causal connections in 
				written texts should help her to distinguish the nature of these.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intends to start an undergraduate course in the USA next 
				September and will need to write reports in English.&nbsp; The 
				focus on the passive will help him to write more confidently in 
				an appropriate style.</em></span><br />
				Assessor complaints 
				to avoid:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The profiles of 
				learners are helpful in a general way but say nothing about the 
				learners' needs for this structure / lexis / pronunciation 
				training.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The individual profiles refer only to general language 
				ability, not to the learners' grammatical accuracy with regard 
				to past tense forms</em></span>.<br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li><strong>Aims and objectives</strong><em><br />
				<img alt="aim" height="133" src="../../../images/aim_snooker200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</em>This part specifically requires you to have<em><span class="auto-style3"><br />
				clear and appropriate overall aims and 
				learning outcomes for the lesson <strong>in relation to language systems and/or language skills</strong> and learner needs</span></em><br />
				 The critical part here is <strong>and/or</strong>.&nbsp;
				 Clearly for a systems-focused lesson, you will need an explicit 
				and clear statement of what system the learners will be able 
				to use or use better by the end of the lesson.&nbsp; However, no 
				lesson is likely to be without the need to employ a language 
				skills such as reading, listening, writing or speaking.&nbsp; Do not lose sight of 
				the need to have a subsidiary aim which focuses on language 
				skills at least partially.<br />
				Here are two examples of how to meet this criterion for a 
				grammar-based or lexis-based 
				lesson:<br />
				<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of this 
				lesson, the learners will be better able to use tenses which 
				express a finished action (perfective forms) such as the past 
				simple and those in which the event or action is incomplete 
				(such as non-finite -ing forms).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsidiary objective: the learners will be able to use these 
				tense forms appropriately in writing a short narrative in an 
				email to a friend with a suitable sensitivity to informal style.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of the lesson, learners will be able to recognise, 
				understand and use lexis relating to factory work including the 
				listed verbs and adjectives.&nbsp; In additions they will have 
				recycled and reinforced their understanding of expressions to 
				describe workplace roles and relationships.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsidiary objective: the learners will be able to use the 
				language learned orally to describe accurately their and others' 
				jobs and what they involve<br />
				</em><span class="style_blue">Assessor complaints 
				to avoid:</span><em class="style_brown"><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aims set 
				out what is to be achieved but not how or in what setting the 
				structures are to be used.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate has not set out in adequate detail which 
				items of lexis concerning ... she is targeting.</em></span><br />
				</em><span class="style_black">
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate has failed to include the 
				extensive amount of written skills work which was involved in the 
				lesson</em></span>.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">and so on.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Analysis</strong><em><br />
				</em>
				<img alt="analysis" height="133" src="../../../images/analyse_microscope200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				You are required to analyse your target language
				<span class="style_black"><em><span class="auto-style3">in terms 
				of form, meaning/use and phonology</span></em></span>.<br />
				You will find a fuller guide to
				<a href="analysis_be_systems.html" target="_blank">analysing 
				systems for a Background Essay</a> in this section of the site.&nbsp; 
				From that analysis, you need to extract only what is relevant to 
				this lesson.&nbsp; Do not be tempted to cut and paste because 
				that betrays an inability to select what is relevant.<br />
				Your analysis should be only of the language which form the 
				targets of your lesson and should be exemplified through the 
				materials you intend to use.&nbsp; This is not the place to 
				analyse entire systems.<br />
				There are three elements:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>form</em></span>: what are 
				the formal linguistic features of the targets of the lesson?&nbsp; 
				Include here only those features you are going to teach.<br />
				This might include grammatical function, , word class, negative 
				and interrogative forms, collocation, colligation, transitivity, 
				separability and so on.<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>meaning / use</em></span>: here 
				you need to get away from usage and focus on how the forms are 
				used in communication and whether, for example, they are typical 
				of certain styles or registers, whether they are unusual or 
				frequent and so on.<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>phonology</em></span>: even if you 
				are focused on the use of language in written texts or purely 
				for receptive purposes (unlikely), you are almost certainly 
				going to have to say things aloud and elicit forms from your 
				learners.&nbsp; Therefore, both you and they need to be prepared 
				in terms of pronunciation, stress and other prosodic features.&nbsp; 
				A lesson on questions forms, for example, would be severely 
				criticised with no focus on intonation.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">Assessor complaints 
				to avoid:</span><em class="style_brown"><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no 
				analysis of the phonological features of the phrasal verbs which 
				form the bulk of the objectives.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The analysis lacks detail concerning how the verbs differ in 
				terms of style and colligational characteristics (including 
				transitivity).</em></span><br />
				</em><span class="style_black">
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate has failed to analyse the 
				ways on which the target tense forms may be used to express 
				unfulfilled past intentions</em></span>.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">and so on.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Timetable fit</strong><br />
				<img alt="jigsaw" height="133" src="../../../images/jigsaw_missing200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Focus on the systems development programme for the group, not on 
				everything they have done / will do next.<br />
				This means setting out quite clearly what allied work 
				they have done and what is planned.&nbsp; For example, if your 
				lesson targets a specific tense form, you need to say 
				what other tense forms they have worked on which are related and 
				how that 
				links with what you are doing.&nbsp; You then need to say what 
				comes next in terms of consolidation and extension.<br />
				Most systems lessons also have a skills requirement of some sort (see 
				under aims and objectives).&nbsp; Do not forget to include these 
				in the timetable fit in terms of what skills the learners are 
				able to use adequately for the purposes of this lesson.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">Assessor complaints 
				to avoid:</span><em class="style_brown"><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate 
				has outlined in general terms what the tense forms the class 
				have encountered but has not made specific reference to complex 
				tense forms used in this lesson.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate has failed to explain how this form of modality will be 
				consolidated in future.</em></span><br />
				</em><span class="style_black">
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no mention of any previous work 
				which has been done concerning the lexis in this register</em></span>.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">and so on.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Assumptions, anticipated problems and solutions</strong><br />
				<img alt="problem" height="133" src="../../../images/problem_serious_hands200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				You are obliged here to identify what assumptions you are 
				making:<br />
				<span class="auto-style3">relevant to the aims and learning 
				outcomes of the lesson</span><br />
				so make sure that you are focused on the systems you are targeting.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What level of mastery of the system are you anticipating that 
				the learners already have, if any?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What concepts, if any, that the learners already have 
				encountered with other forms can be 
				transferred to your lesson targets?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you assuming that the learners will be able to handle the 
				skills content of the lesson as well as the system 
				objectives?<br />
				You are also asked to<br />
				<span class="style_black">anticipate and explain potential 
				problems</span><br />
				and<br />
				<span class="style_black">suggest appropriate solutions to the 
				problems outlined</span><br />
				The problems and solutions you focus on here should primarily 
				not focus on the lesson aims (obviously) but should refer to the 
				system in general and any difficulties you perceive concerning 
				the concepts the language encodes or particular styles in which 
				it is used (as well as the general issues 
				outlined in the overall guide to planning at Delta level).<br />
				<span class="style_blue">Assessor complaints 
				to avoid:</span><em class="style_brown"><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate 
				has not addressed the issue of how well the learners can already 
				talk about finished past events.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate has failed to explain how he will address the 
				issue of the conceptual difficulties the present perfect 
				progressive presents for learners with this class's language 
				backgrounds.</em></span><br />
				</em><span class="style_black">
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no mention of a viable solution to the 
				learners' tendency to avoid using causative forms in favour of 
				simpler language</em></span>.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">and so on.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Procedures and materials</strong><br />
				<img alt="materials" height="133" src="../../../images/materials_paint200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The first issue is to make sure that you plan in a section of 
				the lesson in which the system can be <strong>explicitly</strong> 
				described and understood by the learners.&nbsp; You are not 
				smuggling in work on language, you need at some point in the 
				lesson to have a phase in which the learners are seen to be 
				aware of what exactly how the system you are targeting will 
				enable them to communicate more effectively.<br />
				At this stage, you need to look carefully at the amount of time 
				you have allocated to controlled and free practice of the 
				targets of the lesson.<br />
				It is easier to cut short controlled practice if you perceive 
				that an adequate command has been achieved and extend the freer 
				practice in a communicative phase than it is to extend the 
				controlled practice and thus cut down on the opportunity to use 
				the language for a communicative end.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">Assessor complaints 
				to avoid:</span><em class="style_brown"><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an 
				inadequate 
				stage of the procedure in which the focus on the formal 
				characteristics of the system allows for the learners to absorb 
				the complications inherent in it.&nbsp; The final freer practice 
				phase was marked by inaccuracy of form.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate planned the lesson so that there was 
				insufficient time at the end for the target language to be 
				applied in freer communication so achievement cannot be demonstrated 
				above the level of mastery of the form.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials 
				and the final task did not evince the target structures.</em></span><br />
				</em><span class="style_blue">and so on.</span></li>
				<li><strong>The commentary</strong><br />
				<img alt="commentators" height="133" src="../../../images/commentators200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Here you need to focus on the system(s) you are targeting, 
				obviously, and you need to make it clear how your planned lesson 
				will allow for the learners to master the form, meaning, use and 
				pronunciation of your targets.<br />
				<span class="style_blue">Assessor complaint 
				to avoid:</span><em class="style_brown"><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commentary 
				makes clear why this lesson structure has been chosen and why 
				the topic should appeal to the learners but the candidate makes 
				no mention of how meaning and concepts inherent in the lexis

			<p>Most of the assessment criteria for teaching are generalisable to 
			any lesson (they have to be) so for detailed advice concerning how 
			to meet them, you should refer to
			<a href="meeting_delta_teaching_criteria/meeting_delta_criteria_index.html">the 
			guides to meeting the teaching criteria</a>.<br />
			Here we will look at meeting the criteria in a systems-focused lesson, in 
			particular, and that mostly concerns certain criteria only.<br />
			We'll take each category in turn:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">Category 6 of the criteria: relationships with the 
				learners<br />
				<img alt="relationship" height="133" src="../../../images/animals_relationship_bears200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				There is some advice 
				concerning how to meet the four assessment criteria in the 
				section in the guides linked above.<br />All that needs to be added here is that for a 
				systems lesson, you 
				need to be alert to whether you are making sure that everyone 
				has an equal opportunity to understand the concepts, master the 
				form and pronounce the targets adequately.<br />For example:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>If you are teaching a grammar lesson focused on the 
					verbal processes which occur routinely in narratives, have you allowed for 
				the learners to grasp which tense forms are absolute and which 
					relative?</li>
					<li>If you are teaching lexis, have you made sure that any 
					freer practice you plan actually demands the use of the 
					target items?</li>
					<li>If you are teaching pronunciation, have you ensured that the 
				material is equally accessible everywhere and for everybody.&nbsp; 
				If it is recorded, for example, is it equally clear everywhere 
				in the room?</li>
					<li>If you are teaching and aspect of modality, have you set 
					the context in such a way that the intentions of the 
					speakers / writers are entirely clear?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Category 7: language models and information<br />
				<img alt="model" height="133" src="../../../images/woman_model200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This includes how well you exploit and 
				build on what the learners supply.<br />
				In a systems lesson, in 
				particular, you need to focus on criteria on 7c, 7d and 7e.</li>
				<li>7c requires that you give <span class="style_black">accurate 
				and appropriate models of language form, meaning / use and 
				pronunciation</span> so you have to be entirely certain that 
				what you are saying about these three factors is accurate, 
				intelligible and clear.<br />
				You will be very heavily criticised for teaching something which 
				is not accurate or conventional in the language.</li>
				<li>7d asks you to give<span class="style_black"> accurate and appropriate 
				information</span>.&nbsp; The key here is in the word 
				appropriate.&nbsp; You, almost by definition, know more than the 
				learners will need to know about the target language so your job 
				is to edit the data so that the learners can absorb it.&nbsp; Do 
				not be tempted to provide information which is peripheral or 
				unnecessary at this stage of learning simply because you know 
				it.</li>
				<li>7e asks you to <span class="style_black">notice and 
				judiciously exploit learners’ language output</span>.&nbsp; You will not meet this criterion if 
				you are not alert to what the learners are providing so that you 
				can shape their language and move from partial to full mastery 
				of the targets.&nbsp; Do not accept false production of the 
				targets.</li>
				<li>Category 8: procedures and monitoring<br />
				<img alt="monitor" height="133" src="../../../images/monitoring200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				With a systems lesson, you need to be alert concerning the need 
				to focus on <strong>form, meaning and use and pronunciation</strong>.&nbsp; 
				When you planned the lesson, you were aware of this but when 
				teaching it, it is easy to lose track of what each phase of the 
				lesson is aimed at and that may allow you to wander off track 
				and begin responding to irrelevant learner output.<br />
				If, as is quite common with anything complex, the initial phases 
				are focused on form, be alert when monitoring tasks and getting 
				feedback to the fact that form rather than meaning is your aim 
				here.&nbsp; The same applies to phases concerned with meaning 
				and use and pronunciation.&nbsp; It usually helps learners not 
				to combine all three objectives in single exercises until the 
				end of the lesson when they have been mastered.<br />
				Monitoring involves listening and responding.<br />
				When you monitor, there are two purposes:<ol class="auto-style27">
					<li>check monitoring involves making sure quickly that 
					everyone in the room is on-track and doing what you asked 
					them to do.&nbsp; For example:<ol class="greybulletlist">
						<li>If you are keen to promote the noticing of 
						highlighted item in a text, make sure that the learners 
						are focused on the highlighted items and not getting 
						distracted by other matters</li>
						<li>If you want people to make select correct items for 
						a list of alternatives, is that what they are actually 
						doing?</li>
						<li>If you want people to monitor a listening text for 
						target structures, make sure they know what they are 
						listening out for and that they are not simply trying to 
						understand everything they hear</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>support monitoring involves making sure that you are on 
					hand when needed to help and support the learners.&nbsp; By 
					definition, the targets of your teaching will be unfamiliar 
					to your learners so they may need considerable help to 
					notice them, pronounce them and form them acceptably.<br />
					For example:<ol class="greybulletlist">
						<li>If you are targeting the meaning and conceptual 
						implication of a certain form, you may need to nudge 
						learners by presenting them with an either-or 
						distinction rather than an open-ended choice</li>
						<li>If you want people to select the right modal 
						expression to communicate their view of, say, the 
						necessity of doing something, you may need to 
						interrogate them a little when they are doing this to 
						make sure that they have the concept and relative 
						strength of expressions right.</li>
						<li>If you want people to work on lexis, you may well 
						find that a nudge in the direction of word class is 
						helpful or, with verbs, a hint about transitivity will 
						often be enough to get the learners thinking along the 
						right lines</li>

				Two critical criteria here for a systems lesson concern adapting 
				the plan to emerging needs and ensuring learners remain focused.<ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li>With systems lessons, especially those focused on lexis 
					and modality, it is often hard to judge how well a concept 
					has been grasped so you must remain alert to the need to 
					stop, rewind and provide alternative exemplification and 
					explanation.&nbsp; Do not be tempted to carry on even though 
					you know that some of the learners have not fully grasped 
					the meaning of the language because that will undermine all 
					that follows.</li>
					<li>Equally, it is often easy for learners to wander off 
					track and use language they already know rather than the 
					language which forms the lesson's targets.&nbsp; You need to 
					be alert to keeping them focused.&nbsp; This usually means 
					asking checking questions frequently to help them stay on 
					course.&nbsp; You may want to ask, for example:<ol class="smallgreybulletlist">
						<li><em>Which verbs do you need from today's lesson to talk 
					about how likely you think something is?<br />Which ones do you need to talk about how necessary something 
					is?<br />Which ones do you need to talk about how happy you are to do 
					something?</em></li>
						<li><em>Which verb can you use with the first two nouns in 
					the list of today's words?<br />Which verbs take an object?<br />Can any of them take two objects?</em></li>
						<li><em>Which expressions refer to place and which ones 
					refer to time?<br />Which of the prepositions can you use to link 
						</em>I walked
					<em>and </em>the road<em>?<br />Which prepositions will you use to say when something 
					happened?</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
