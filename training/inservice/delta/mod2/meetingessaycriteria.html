			<p>This is how to get a Distinction for a Background Essay on a 
			Delta course.&nbsp; There's no warranty about this, of course, 
			implied or otherwise.<br />
			This guide is written by someone with many years of experience as an 
			assessor and tutor who has read and assessed hundreds of Delta 
			essays.&nbsp; It is not written by someone who has just finished a 
			Delta course and claims to know it all.</p>
			<p>Before following this guide, make sure you have done
			<a href="essaywriting.html">the one to writing a Delta essay</a>.</p>
			<p>The first thing to do is to
			<a href="../documents/ELT_Concourse_Delta_criteria_Background_Essay_explained.pdf" target="_blank">
			download the PDF document </a>which explains each of the 15 criteria 
			for the Background Essay.</p>

			<p>Not even your tutors on a Delta course can magically transfer

			The purpose of the Background Essay is for you to acquire and then 
			demonstrate your knowledge of language systems and skills and your 
			understanding of appropriate methodological approaches to teaching 
			your selected area.<br />
			Only you can acquire the knowledge you need although your tutors and 
			this website can help you map out what you need to know.<br />
			All the following is premised on your willingness to do the thorough 
			research and reading which is required at this level.</p>
			<p>There are related links at the end of this guide to help you do 
			that.</p>

				<a href="../thingstoavoid.html" target="_blank">10 things not to 
				write</a> in Delta essays.<br />
				</li><li>  Use terminology<ol class="redbulletlist">
					<li>Do not be satisfied with saying, 
					e.g.,<span class="style_black"><em><br />
					We use </em>more<em> and
					</em>most<em> with longer adjectives when comparing or 
					stating a superlative.</em></span><br />
					The correct term 
					for this is
					the periphrastic construction so use it and then exemplify 
					so that it is clear that you understand it.</li>
					<li>Use terminology accurately.&nbsp; Readers will be deeply 
					unimpressed if it is clear that you don't understand a term 
					you are using.&nbsp; For example, if you use a term which is 
					used more technically in ELT than it is in ordinary life 
					(such as genre), make it clear that you understand what it 
					means.<br />
					There is a 100-item test on terminology in this section 
					which you may like to do when you have finished this.&nbsp; 
					There's a link at the end.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Referenced and knowledgeable<br />
				There is a guide to how to reference conventionally in the 
				general section on essay writing for Delta and none of that will 
				be repeated here.&nbsp; This part is devoted to what you should
				<strong>do</strong> with the references you make.<ol class="redbulletlist">
					<li>Don't cite people for the sake of it.&nbsp; If you 
					include a quotation, properly referenced, from an authority, 
					comment on it so that the reader can see that you have 
					understood the point.</li>
					<li>Reference what you assert.&nbsp; If, for example, you 
					want to state that other languages do not have a perfect 
					aspect form (or, if they have, that it is differently used), 
					then say where you got that information.</li>
					<li>Look for opposing views.&nbsp; Readers will be more 
					impressed if you can cite two views which differ on the 
					topic you are discussing.&nbsp; You can then draw on 
					experience to decide which one you feel is the most helpful.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Do not leave yourself open to accusations of plagiarism.&nbsp; 
				A plagiarised essay will automatically fail.&nbsp; Follow a 
				conventional referencing system and never assume that because 
				you have re-phrased a thought or idea that you do not need to 
				reference it.&nbsp; You do.</li>
				<li>Word limits are not flexible.&nbsp; Your essay must be 
				between 2000 and 2500 words.&nbsp; If it is near the lower end 
				of that, you haven't covered things in adequate depth.&nbsp; Do 
				not be tempted to cheat on word limits by inserting tables as 
				images or by putting analysis and discussion in appendices which 
				belong in the main text.</li>

				<li>The introduction<br />
				In <a href="essaywriting.html">the guide to essay writing</a>, 
				the introduction is dealt with in some depth and examples are 
				given there of what to write.&nbsp; The purpose of the 
				introduction is set out what you are going to discuss and why 
				you think it's important enough to do this.&nbsp; Here is a way to 
				specify the scope of what you intend for two types of 
				assignments.&nbsp; It's a suggestion, not an exhaustive list.<br />
				<img alt="scope limitation " height="333" src="../images/scope.png" width="250" /><br />
				So, for example:<br />
				You could narrow down a subject such as modal verbs to those 
				needed at B1 level, for a limited range of functions such as 
				expressing obligation and logical deduction (deontic and 
				epistemic modality to be more precise).<br />
				You could narrow down the skill of reading by considering a 
				particular genre, for a purpose such as general comprehension 
				for learners at A2 level.<br />
				If you apply all four criteria, you will make the focus too 
				narrow so one or two would be adequate.<br />
				Be careful not to:<ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li class="greybulletlist">discuss learner problems &ndash; 
					that comes later and you do not have space to repeat 
					yourself</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">analyse the area &ndash; that 
					comes later</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">make sweeping and unsupported 
					statements such as <em>This area is problematic for all 
					learners of English</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li >Explaining why you have chosen the area is important.&nbsp; 
				You need to draw on research, reading <strong>and</strong> your 
				experience to state your reasons for focusing on the topic.&nbsp; 
				See the guide to essay writing for some examples of how to do 
				this.</li>
				<li >Stay relevant<ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li >Analysis<br />
					If you are focused on a certain level, does your analysis 
					stray into higher or lower-level systems or skills?<br />
					If you are focused on a specific skill or subskill, does 
					your analysis stray into other areas?</li>
					<li >Exemplification<br />
					Every time you give an example, stop and think 
					about its relevance:<ol class="smallgreybulletlist">
						<li >Is it a written or spoken example?&nbsp; If your assignment, 
					for example, is focused on writing, do not give examples of 
					learners' problems in speaking.</li>
						<li >Is it at the right level?&nbsp; If your assignment concerns 
					higher-level learners, for example, do not give examples of 
					lower-level items, skills and errors.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li >Teaching suggestions<br />
					Every time you write about a teaching idea, do the same:<ol class="smallgreybulletlist">
						<li >Which problem for learners which I have identified does this 
					idea target?</li>
						<li >Is the idea at the right level?</li>
						<li >Does the idea focus on the right medium (written or spoken)?</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li >Linkage<br />
				Number every part of your analysis and identification of issues 
				clearly.<br />
				Then make sure that the identification of issues for learners 
				and teachers is explicitly referenced to a number of a section 
				in the analysis.<br />
				Then make sure that all the teaching suggestions refer 
				explicitly to the number of the section in the issues for 
				learners.<br />
				Never, ever:<ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li >Provide commentary on a learning issue for something you haven't 
				analysed</li>
					<li >Provide a teaching solution for a problem you have not 
				identified and exemplified.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Graphically, the linkage should look something like this for 
				whatever focus of essay you have (systems or skills).&nbsp; 
				<strong>Notice the direction of the arrows.</strong>&nbsp; Analysis feeds into 
				the identification of issues and teaching solutions refer 
				directly back to them.</p>

			<p>There are only two criteria here:</p>
			<p class="auto-style20"><em>Successful candidates can effectively 
			demonstrate an understanding of the specific area by:<br />
			a) analysing the specific area with accuracy, identifying key points<br />
			b) showing awareness of a range of learning and teaching problems 
			occurring in a range of learning contexts.</em></p>
			<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li>This is where the guides on this site are intended to help.&nbsp; 
				This is especially true for language systems areas but there are 
				lots of guides to things like inferencing, teaching skills and 
				so on.<br />
				This site is not a substitute for research; it is <strong>part</strong> 
				of your research.<br />
				The guide to essay writing explains how to structure this 
				section of your essay but here are some general points:<ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li>Do not rely on references intended for learners.<br />
					They 
				are not written with you in mind and often oversimplify to the 
				point of inaccuracy.&nbsp; There are two lists on this site that 
					may help:<br />
					<a href="../../../grammarreference.html">Grammar references</a><br />
					<a href="../../../skillsreference.html">Skills references</a></li>
					<li>Make sure you analyse accurately.<br />
					Do not rely on 
					half-truths intended for learners.&nbsp; Every effort is 
					made to ensure that guides on this site are accurate but 
					some, especially in the section intended for people on 
					initial courses, have been simplified.</li>
					<li>Analyse in depth.<br />
					If you find you are leaving out 
					important and relevant discussion to keep within the word 
					limit, re-visit the title and the introduction to narrow 
					your scope and keep the analysis at the right depth.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The word <em>range</em> occurs twice in criterion 3b.&nbsp; The word 
				<em>teaching</em> also occurs so do not limit yourself to learners in a 
				specific setting or leave out issues for teaching.&nbsp; 
				Consider:<br />
				<img alt="issues" height="402" src="../images/issues.png" width="250" /><br />
				For the teaching issues, you may find that reference to the 
				guide on this site to 
				<a href="../../teaching/teacher_induced_error.html">teacher-induced error</a> is of some 
				assistance.<br />
				Do not focus only on your class or your learners.&nbsp; Do some 
				research.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 class="auto-style21"><strong>Areas to consider in addressing 
			criterion 3b.</strong></h3>
			<p class="auto-style21">Often, weak essays simply focus on the kinds 
			of learner errors that occur when addressing the system or skill 
			which is at the heart of the essay without explaining why the errors 
			occur or what their effect on communicative effectiveness is.&nbsp; 
			To get a Distinction grade (or even a Merit) you need to analyse in 
			more depth than only saying, for example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">My learners, I have noticed, often produce:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he's not here<br />
			when the natural utterance for native speakers might be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think he's here.<br />
			This often makes them sound unnatural and can also lead to errors 
			such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I think it's not<br />
			rather than the more natural and accurate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think so</p>
			<p class="auto-style21">This is probably true as far as it goes but 
			then you need to go on with something like:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The reason for this is at least twofold:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style22">
				<li>
				In many European languages, the unmarked 
				form is to negate the subordinate clause (as in the example 
				above) but in English the reverse is the case.&nbsp; The 
				unmarked form in English exhibits transferred negation so the 
				verb in the first clause is negated.&nbsp; Learners may well 
				find this illogical, and it frequently is as the insertion of a 
				question tag demonstrates.&nbsp; The tag question refers to the 
				subordinate clause (so that, mentally, is what is being 
				negated).&nbsp; We have, therefore:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I don't think she's coming, is she?</em><br />
				and not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I don't think she's coming, do I?<br />
				</em>Many languages (such as Italic and Scandinavian languages) 
				reserve the transferred negation on the initial clause to signal 
				contradiction or disagreement.&nbsp; English, as the example above 
				shows, marks the negation of the subordinate clause for the same 
				kind of effect.</li>
				<li>
				Other languages, including Thai and other 
				South-East Asian and Pacific Rim languages, do not allow 
				transferred negation at all so for speakers of these languages 
				it seems wholly non-intuitive to insert the negation on the 
				first verb rather than the verb in the subordinate clause.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style21">Depending on the structure of your essay, 
			some of this analysis will already have been done in the previous 
			section, so you need only refer to it rather than repeat it here, but if you choose to conflate analysis with the 
			identification of issues for learners and teachers, this would be 
			appropriate.<br />
			You have not only said what the error is, you 
			have explained, using accurate and properly sophisticated 
			terminology (such as <em>markedness </em>and <em>transferred 
			negation</em>), why the error occurs.<br />
			That's how you get a Distinction grade for this criterion.</p>
