			<h1><span class="deltablue">Delta </span>Module Two: analysing language systems in the background essay</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="analysis" height="207" src="../../../images/analyse_microscope310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide concerns meeting the criteria for a Delta essay in 
			section 3.&nbsp; The two criteria are:</p>
			<p class="auto-style2">Successful candidates can effectively 
			demonstrate an understanding of the specific area by:</p>
			<ol class="indent">
				<li><em>analysing the specific area with accuracy, identifying 
				key points</em></li>
				<li><em>showing awareness of a range of learning and teaching 
				problems occurring in a range of learning contexts</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The regulations for Delta state that you must prepare two 
			assignments focusing on systems rather than skills and they provide 
			you with the following choices: grammar, lexis, phonology or 
			discourse.<br />
			This is slightly bewildering for some who have been led to believe 
			by their reading that the systems are intertwined and much syntax is 
			affected by lexical meaning and phonology by issues of discourse and 
			so on.&nbsp; However, that is the way it is so your first step is to 
			identify into which of the four areas your assignment falls and make 
			that clear in the title.<br />
			In your analysis, you still need to be aware and show that you are 
			aware that the four areas singled out by Cambridge are not in 
			watertight compartments.<br />
			If you would like to consider a little more how issues of meaning 
			impact on syntax, try
			<a href="../../lexicogrammar/lexicogrammar.html" target="_blank">the 
			guide to lexicogrammar</a> (new tab).</p>
			<p>This is a guide with examples, not a model.<br />
			There are a number of reasons why it is not possible to provide a 
			model analysis:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>When you select your topic area for a Language Systems 
				Assignment, you will, naturally, focus on an area which your 
				class needs to master.&nbsp; What that might be for you in your 
				setting is unpredictable and any model analysis will almost 
				certainly not be relevant in whole or in part.</li>
				<li>Once you have decided on your topic area, you will have to 
				narrow down your focus by the level of learners you have in mind 
				or by excluding some areas so that your analysis will be in 
				adequate depth and not a low-level, superficial survey of the 
				whole area.&nbsp; How you will do that is, again, not 
				predictable, because it will depend on the nature of your 
				students (past or present) and the focus of the lesson which you 
				have in mind.</li>
				<li>No analysis, here or anywhere else, can be a complete model 
				because the word count for Delta essays is severely limited to 
				2500 words overall and the analysis part of your essay is 
				probably going to be around 1000 to 1500 words to allow you space 
				to address all the other issues in the essay (introduction, 
				scope identification, definitions, 
				teaching suggestions etc.).&nbsp; This means that you will, 
				perforce, have to leave out some interesting areas of the 
				analysis which others might decide to include.&nbsp; What 
				follows is, therefore, deliberately selective and incomplete but 
				serves to demonstrate the level of depth and precision which is 
				needed for Delta.</li>
				<li>It is a matter, often, of personal preference whether you:<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li>address the criteria individually by doing the analysis 
					in a dedicated section and then linking the discussion to 
					the difficulties learners and teachers have with the topic 
					in a following section or</li>
					<li>combine the analysis with the discussion of learning and 
					teaching problems as you go along.&nbsp;
					What follows takes a separated approach for the sake of 
					clarity and cannot, 
					therefore, stand as any kind of model for a combined 
					approach.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In this guide, we will be presenting models of analysis 
				drawn from a range of disparate language system areas so there 
				will be little sense, if any, of a coherent and cohesive 
				discussion.&nbsp; We will, whenever it seems relevant, give 
				examples of grammar areas, lexical system areas and functional 
				areas.<br />
				You, naturally, will make every effort to keep your analysis and 
				discussion of problems consistently relevant to your essay title 
				and to the limitations of the scope that you set out in the 
				introduction.</li>
				<li>Finally, this site takes a dim view of plagiarism, as does 
				Cambridge English and all Delta centres.&nbsp; There is no 
				intention here, then, to produce an analysis which can simply be 
				copied and pasted into an essay.&nbsp; Try that and you will be 
				found out.</li>

					<h2>The three strands of the analysis</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>For any systems background essay analysis, you need to consider 
			three important, connected areas:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Form:<br />
				The formal characteristics of the structure / grammar or lexical 
				system that you 
				are analysing.&nbsp; For this part of the analysis, you will 
				need to go beyond references intended for learners, of course, 
				or your discussion will lack depth, comprehensiveness and 
				detail.</li>
				<li>Meaning and Use:<br />
				The previous section is where you are discussing usage with a 
				focus on form.&nbsp; Here, you need to focus on what the system 
				does in terms of communication.</li>
				<li>Pronunciation:<br />
				This may be the central focus of your assignment.&nbsp; In that 
				case, it becomes number 1 on this list.&nbsp; For most essays, 
				however, this is the third strand to the analysis.<br />
				This area may not be relevant at all if you are focused on the 
				comprehension or production of written texts only.&nbsp; If that 
				is your sole concern:<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li>make sure you have justified not considering 
					pronunciation in the introduction 
					(perhaps because the system is almost wholly confined to 
					written texts, for example, or because you are focusing only 
					on learners' needs to comprehend and/or produce written 
					texts)</li>
					<li>be careful to keep your focus on a system and do not 
					stray into analysing listening or writing skills.&nbsp; That 
					will mean you lose relevance and the readers lose patience.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" >

					<img alt="form" height="166" src="../../../images/form_waterdrop250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Form</h2>
					<h3>structure and lexis</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is, of course, the central starting point for any analysis 
			of structure.&nbsp; If your focus is phonological, then 
			pronunciation will be the first strand of the analysis to consider.&nbsp; 
			It is, in other words, the form.<br />
			Here, there are the matters of depth and detail to consider.&nbsp; 
			At Delta level, you need more of both than you may be accustomed to 
			considering on whatever pre-service course you have taken.<br />
			Here are two examples, one of inadequate depth but superficially 
			accurate analysis, the other of more depth and detail.&nbsp; It's 
			not too hard to pick which is which.</p>
			<p><strong>Accurate but inadequate:</strong></p>
			<p class="style_black"><span class="style_black">The -</span><em>ing</em> 
			form of a verb can function in three ways in English:</p>
			<ol class="indent">
				<li>as part of a continuous tense form, for example,<br /><em>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is <span class="style_underline">taking</span> the train</em></li>
				<li>as a gerund, for example,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She likes <span class="style_underline">reading</span></em></li>
				<li>as an adjective, for example,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thinks he is <span class="style_underline">interesting</span></em></li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>In a bit more depth with more detail:</strong></p>
			<p class="style_black"><span class="style_black">The non-finite -</span><em>ing</em> 
			form of a verb can function in three ways in English:</p>
			<ol class="indent">
				<li>as part of a continuous tense form, for example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She is taking the train<br />
				</em>In this case, the aspect can be continuous, progressive or 
				iterative.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shh! She's sleeping.</em><br />
				is progressive, denoting something currently in progress<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm taking the train to work these days</em><br />
				is continuous because it refers to a background action which may 
				not, in fact, currently be happening (the speaker may not be on 
				the train)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone has been stealing food from the kitchen</em><br />
				indicates a repeated action (iterative) which has been occurring for some 
				time and is affecting the present.</li>
				<li>as a gerund, for example, <em>She likes reading</em><br />
				This is a traditional analysis but, in fact, there is a cline 
				from purely verbal uses such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched him painting the picture</em><br />
				through semi-verbal, non-finite uses (verbal nouns) such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Describing the events was difficult for her</em><br />
				to purely nominal uses (deverbal nouns) such as:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She loves the buildings</em></li>
				<li>as an adjective, for example, <em>She thinks he is 
				interesting.</em><br />
				The difficulty here is that adjectival uses are sometimes 
				difficult to distinguish from purely verbal uses.&nbsp; An 
				adjectival use, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The film was exciting</em><br />
				with the copular <em>be</em> linking the subject and the adjective is 
				clear.<br />
				But, semi-verbal, non-finite uses such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flight was frightening</em><br />
				may be analysed as a verb and could be 
				 rephrased as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People were frightened by the flight</em><br />
				or as an adjective because it can be modified by an amplifying 
				adverb as in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flight was extremely frightening<br />
				</em>In some cases, no verb is actually available so only an 
				adjective can be the analysis, e.g.,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The book was uninspiring</em><br />
				where the adjective appears to be derived from a verb but for 
				which there is no verb, <em>uninspire</em>.<br />
				On the other hand, adding an object noun phrase results in only the verbal use 
				being considered as in, e.g.,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The film was frightening the children</em><br />
				in which no amplifying adverbial is allowable:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The film was very frightening the children.</em></li>
				<li>Care also needs to be taken, especially at lower levels, to 
				distinguish between the communicative function of <em>-ing </em>
				adjectives formed from verbs and<em> -ed </em>adjectives formed 
				in the same way.<br />
				Thus, the rule needs to be consolidated that:<br />
				-<em>ing</em> adjectives refer to what a thing or a person is 
				and -<em>ed</em> adjectives refer to how someone feels.<br />
				We can refer to what something was (<em>the flight was 
				frightening</em>) or to how someone felt (<em>I was frightened</em>).<br />
				Considerations of the real difficulty in distinguishing between 
				verbal uses of the -<em>ed</em> ending and non-verbal adjectival 
				uses are beyond the scope of this analysis.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Nothing in the first example is actually wrong but the analysis 
			is at the level of a grammar book for learners and leaves out far 
			too much.<br />
			In the second example, there is greater use of terminology (to be 
			precise), greater depth of analysis (to point out the grey areas) 
			and better exemplification (to add detail).</p>
			<p>The <strong>moral</strong> for Delta essays is:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Use terminology accurately and appropriately and do not be 
				satisfied with calling something simply an -<em>ing</em> form or 
				whatever but notify the reader that you can handle concepts such 
				as non-finite forms.&nbsp; This allows the analysis to be 
				precise.</li>
				<li>Strive for more depth so it is clear to the reader that you 
				are aware of the issues in the analysis and have researched 
				beyond the level of pedagogic grammars.&nbsp; This will 
				contribute to a sense of your having done proper research.</li>
				<li>Exemplify what you say clearly and comment on your examples 
				to make it clear to the reader that you understand what you are 
				saying.&nbsp; This contributes to the amount of detail you can 
				provide.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here are two more examples focusing on a lexical systems issue to 
			see how the addition of precision, depth and detail is achieved.&nbsp; 
			The first paragraph is accurate but lacks adequate depth, precision 
			and detail.&nbsp; What follows exemplifies what is required at Delta 
			level.</p>
			<p><span class="style_black">Collocation refers to the 
			greater-than-chance occurrences of words in certain combinations.&nbsp; 
			For example, a noun such as <em>rain</em> will collocate with a range of 
			adjectives including<em> light, heavy, unpleasant, thin </em>and so on but 
			not with other common adjectives such as <em>strong</em> or <em>narrow</em> which are 
			superficially synonymous with some of those which do collocate with
			<em>rain</em>.</span></p>
			<hr /><br />
			<p class="auto-style4">Two-part adjective-noun collocations in 
			English are exceptionally frequent (reference here).&nbsp; They 
			vary, however, in opacity, fixedness and strength.&nbsp; We can 
			have, therefore,</p>
			<ol class="auto-style2">
				<li><span class="auto-style42">Strong but transparent and not fixed.</span><br /><em>winding road<br />
				precipitous cliffs</em><br />
				<span class="auto-style42">which are examples of reasonably strong collocations although a 
				number of other adjectives and nouns can be inserted into the 
				slots to get, e.g.:</span><br />
				<em>twisting / curving road<br />
				winding path / lane<br />
				sheer / steep cliffs<br />
				precipitous mountainside / drop</em><br />
				<span class="auto-style42">etc.<br />
				While these combinations are quite flexible, the number of nouns 
				and adjectives which can be inserted is limited in a way that 
				combinations with adjectives such as </span> <em>heavy</em><span class="auto-style42"> or 
				</span> <em>
				interesting</em><span class="auto-style42"> or with nouns such as 
				</span> <em>table</em><span class="auto-style42"> or </span> <em>
				house</em><span class="auto-style42"> are not.</span></li>
				<li><span class="auto-style42">Semi-fixed, semi-transparent strong collocations.</span><br /><em>breathtaking stupidity<br />
				deafening silence</em><br />
				<span class="auto-style42">which are semi-fixed collocations with a metaphorical and 
				extended use of the meaning of </span> <em>breathtaking</em> 
				<span class="auto-style42">and</span> <em>
				deafening.<br />
				</em><span class="auto-style42">In these cases, no other combination is possible if the 
				meaning is to be retained.&nbsp; So, while:</span><br />
				<em>heart-stopping stupidity<br />
				stunning stupidity</em><br />
				<span class="auto-style42">are both possible and</span><br />
				<em>total silence<br />
				utter silence</em><br />
				<span class="auto-style42">are also possible, none carries the same sense as the original 
				cliché.&nbsp; Neither of these combinations is purely 
				transparent in meaning even if the items themselves are known 
				because the adjectives are used metaphorically.</span></li>
				<li><span class="auto-style42">Fixed, opaque collocations.</span><br />
				<span class="auto-style42">Many of these are fixed expressions in English and have elements 
				which occur only in this combination.&nbsp; They can be idioms, 
				bi- or tri-nomials and a range of other chunks.</span><br />
				<em>to and fro<br />
				hook, line and sinker<br />
				the black sheep (of the family)<br />
				a whale of a time</em><br />
				<span class="auto-style42">etc.<br />
				These sorts of collocation exhibit true non-compositionality 
				because they cannot be understood by knowing the meaning of the 
				items which make them up.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>You would also, of course, especially with a focus on 
			adjective-noun collocations be expected to say something accurate if 
			not original about the fact that the relationship is rarely 
			reciprocal.&nbsp; Some adjective attach naturally to a very limited 
			range of nouns and <em>vice versa.</em></p>

			<p>This is the second strand of the analysis, whatever your focus.&nbsp; 
			It is here that you demonstrate that you understand the difference 
			between use (which focuses on the communicative <strong>value</strong> of the language) and usage 
			(which focuses only on its semantic <strong>significance</strong>).<br />
			Here, again, are two examples, the first drawing on pedagogical grammars

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Have you seen the film?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I haven't ever spoken to her</em></li>
				<li>It refers to an action (or its absence) in the recent past.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have only just arrived<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Have you really finished?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She hasn't spoken yet</em></li>
				<li>It refers to an action or event (or its absence) which 
				continues into the present and may continue into the future.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lived here for 10 years<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Have you worked there long?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He hasn't lived in the new house yet</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There's not much wrong with this analysis, so far as it goes but 
			at Delta level, we need more precision and to demonstrate more 
			awareness.&nbsp; Here's what's meant:</p>
			<p><span class="style_black">The present perfect simple tense can 
			(following Lock <em>et al</em>) be described as a relational rather than an 
			absolute tense.&nbsp; In this respect, for example, the difference 
			between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ate the fish</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have eaten the fish</em><br />
			can be explained by the first having the capacity to be referenced 
			to an explicit past time so we can also have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ate the fish at nine o'clock / last month / 
			in the restaurant yesterday</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			A tense in the perfect aspect, however, relates one time to another 
			and does not refer to an absolute time but links two times together 
			so we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have eaten the fish</em> (before now) <em>
			and don't recommend it </em>(now)<br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have eaten the fish last week.<br />
			</em>The present perfect can refer to the perfective and 
			imperfective state of actions, states and events so we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have given up sugar </em>(<em>so please 
			don't give me any</em>)<br />
			which refers to a perfective action that is completed but still 
			related to the present<br />
			and we can have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lived here for years</em> (<em>so I 
			know my way around</em>)<br />
			which refers to an imperfective state that is not complete but still 
			relates the state to the present.<br />
			The present perfect always carries the sense of a past event, state 
			or action having consequences for the present, often enabling the 
			present in fact, and should properly be 
			described as a present tense, making reference to the past, rather 
			than a past tense making reference to the present, therefore, hence 
			its name.&nbsp; The tense <strong>embeds</strong> the past event in 
			the present.<br />
			The two phenomena, that the form is relational in meaning and that 
			it can apply to perfective and imperfective conditions explain the 
			three main uses which are often taught as separate and discrete 
			concepts.</span></p>
			<p>And this analysis is far better in terms of precision, depth and 
			detail.&nbsp; It draws on reading and research, is above the level 
			of a pedagogic grammar or other texts and shows awareness of 
			subtleties of use.</p>

			<p>Unless you are focused only on written forms of the language and 
			have justified this limitation carefully in your introduction, this 
			is the third strand of your analysis.<br />
			At this level, you will be expected to use the phonemic script and 
			to have developed some system for representing intonation contours and 
			stress.&nbsp; For individual sounds and features of connected 
			speech, there is a clear, conventional system (although details may 
			vary) and you should use it.&nbsp; For intonation and stress, there 
			are no profession-wide conventions so you need to develop something 
			you are comfortable using and which enables you to analyse and 
			exemplify what you are describing.</p>
			<p>This site uses a variety and elsewhere in the relevant sections, 
			you will find, for example:<br />
			<img alt="contour" height="32" src="../../../imagesgraphics/contour.gif" width="448" /><br />
			which shows the intonation contour on a non-defining relative

			<img alt="intonation" src="../../../imagesgraphics/intonation.png" /><br />
			which show the six frequently identified intonation patterns in 
			English.<br />
			And so on.</p>
			<p>Again, we'll contrast a pre-Delta level example with what you need 
			to do at this level.</p>
		
		<p class="style_black">At the borders between words a number of things can happen:</p>
		<ul class="auto-style54">
			<li><span class="style_black">sounds can change.&nbsp; For example:</span><ul class="greenbullet">
				<li class="bluebullet">if you say  
				<em>when possible</em> quickly, 
			the '<em>n</em>' at the end of <em>when</em> can sound like a '<em>m</em>' 
			because your lips are already moving to make the sound of '<em>p</em>'</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>sounds can move.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><span class="bluebullet">when you say 
			 <em>an apple</em> quickly, it 
			can sound like <em>a napple</em></span>.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>sounds can disappear.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><span class="bluebullet">when you say 
				 <em>a clothes line</em> 
				quickly, it usually sounds like <em>a close line</em></span>.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			sounds can appear.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li class="style_black"><span class="bluebullet">when you say 
			    <em>law and order</em> 
			quickly, it sounds like there is a '<em>r</em>' sound before the 
			word <em>and</em>.</span></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
			<p>Again, there is nothing in the above which is actually wrong.&nbsp; 
			It lacks, however, very much rigour and is non-technical.&nbsp; The 
			analysis at Delta level would probably only be focusing on one or 
			two of these phenomena, your selection having been made and 
			justified in terms of key aspects of the form you have been 
			analysing up to now.<br />
			If, however, your focus is connected 
			speech features in English, then you will certainly need to cover 
			all these phenomena and more.&nbsp; Here's how it might be done with 
			a bit more academic credibility at Delta level (taken mostly from 
			the in-service guide to features of connected speech).&nbsp; We will 
			only consider the first of the points above (assimilation) but the principle 
			and the depth of analysis will be the same at Delta level for the 
			other three.</p>
			<h3 class="style_black"><strong>Assimilation</strong></h3>
			<p><span class="style_black">This occurs when a sound is altered because the speaker is 
			anticipating the following sound or influenced by a previous one (or 
			both).<br />
			There are three possibilities:</span></p>
			<ol class="style_black">
				<li>Regressive or anticipatory assimilation:<br />
				For example,<br />
				<em>ten bottles</em> (which is transcribed as /ten ˈbɒt.əlz/ in 
				careful or citation forms)<br />
				sounds like<br />
				<em>tem bottles</em> (which is transcribed as /tem ˈbɒt.əlz/)<br />
				because the speaker is anticipating the bilabial voiced 
				consonant /b/ and changes the alveolar nasal /n/ to the bilabial 
				/m/ to make pronouncing the /b/ easier.<br />
				And in, for example:<br />
				<em>his son and his daughter</em><br />
				the phrase, when spoken quickly is transcribed as<br />
				/hɪz sʌn ndɪs ˈdɔː.tə/<br />
				because the 's' in <em>his daughter</em> is not voiced as it is in <em>
				his son</em>.<br />
				Within this example, too, is a case of elision of the /h/ on the 
				second occurrence of <em>his</em>.</li>
				<li>Progressive assimilation:<br />
				Sounds may change because the speaker is influenced by the 
				preceding sound.&nbsp; For example, <br />
				<em>There's not much cider left<br />
				</em>said quickly.<br />
				Normally, the 'c' in cider is pronounced /s/ in careful or 
				citation form (/ˈsaɪ.də/).<br />
				However, in this environment, the influence of the /tʃ/ at the 
				end of <em>much</em> means that the 'c' in cider is pronounced 
				as /ʃ/.</li>
				<li>Reciprocal or coalescent assimilation:<br />
				Here, sounds influence each other and may fuse together.&nbsp; For 
				example,<br />
				<em>Won't you come with us</em>?<br />
				When this clause is
				spoken quickly, <em>won't you</em> is not pronounced as /wəʊnt ju/ as it 
				would be in slow careful speech but is pronounced /wəʊntʃu/.<br />
				The /t/ and /j/ sounds have coalesced 
				to make the /tʃ/ sound.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><span class="style_black">Assimilation also explains the tendency in English to change 
			prefixes, using '<em>im</em>-' before words beginning with bilabials (so we 
			have <em>impossible, impolite, immobile</em> etc. rather than <em>*inpossible, *inpolite, 
			*inmobile</em>).</span></p>

			<p>We are going to belabour this point because at this level of 
			training, it is crucial.&nbsp; At initial training levels, say on a 
			CELTA or Trinity TESOL course, most analysis of language starts and 
			stops at structure (including some phonology) and a bit on meaning.&nbsp; That is not good 
			enough now, although it still needs to be done, of course.</p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">For our example, we are going to look at 
			this question from an on-line, ask-me-anything site designed for 
			people to help other people get things right.&nbsp; Sometimes such 
			things work well.&nbsp; Here's the question:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>How do I analyse a sentence such as <em>It may be that 
			you are right</em>?</strong></p>
			<p class="nomargintop">Well, how will you?&nbsp; Think for a moment 
			and then click here
			<img alt="eye" class="auto-style53" height="16" src="../../../../gfx/eyeopen.gif" width="16" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'hide',0,'style.visibility','visible')" />.</p>
			<div id="hide" style="visibility:hidden">
			
			<p>And here's an answer.</p>
			
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Grammatically / formally</strong>: purely in terms of 
				clause structure and structural linguistics, we have:</dt>
				<dd>
				<ol class="auto-style41">
				<li>
				<em>It </em>&ndash; the neutral subject 
				pronoun (3rd person singular)</li>
				<li>
				<em>may</em> &ndash; the finite modal auxiliary verb</li>
				<li>
				<em>be</em> &ndash; the bare non-finite infinitive 
				verb</li>
				<li>
				<em>that</em> &ndash; a subordinating conjunction 
				which links to hypotheses or propositions</li>
				<li>
				<em>you</em> &ndash; the personal subject pronoun 
				(2nd person)</li>
				<li>
				<em>are</em> &ndash; the finite 2nd-person form of
				<em>be</em></li>
				<li>
				<em>right</em> &ndash; the adjective 
				complement phrase of that verb<br />
					</li>
				
			</ol>
			a. is the first noun phrase<br />
			b. and c. form the first verb phrase<br />
			d., e., f. and g. form the complement of the first verb phrase (not 
			the object).<br />And so on.<br />
			OK?<br />
			We can make any number of parallel sentences following this pattern 
			in English such as:<br />
			<em>It will transpire that you are fishy</em> <br />
			and millions more and some may even mean something useful.&nbsp; We 
			know that, by the rules of English syntax, they will all be well 
			formed.<br />
				We can also go on here to look at the pronunciation, including 
				intonation, stress and other prosodic features but that would 
				try your patience.<br />
			Just because you can do that, does not mean you are a user of 
			English, however (although it obviously helps a bit).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Semantically</strong>: if by ‘real’, you refer to the meaning of the 
				clauses &ndash; its semantic content &ndash; then we need a different sort 
				of analysis to get at what you want to know about ‘structure’ 
				rather than grammar, <em>per se</em>.</dt>
				<ol class="auto-style51">
				<li>
				<em>It </em>&ndash; is a dummy subject with no referent 
				(antecedent) and is used merely to state that something or some 
				proposition / hypothesis exists.</li>
				<li>
				The dummy subject is connected to the predicate by the copular 
				verb <em>be</em> 
				which is modified for the expression of epistemic modality 
				(likelihood of truth) by the modal auxiliary verb <em>may.</em></li>
				<li>
				the rest of the sentence is the complement of that verb and is 
				nominalised (made into a noun).<br />
			It could be fronted and retain the core meaning so we could have:<br />
				<em>That you are right may be</em> (the case)<br />
				It refers to a proposition and could be encapsulated in a shell 
			noun such as <em>idea</em> or <em>assumption</em>.</li>
				
			</ol>
				<p class="auto-style52">We are analysing only the <strong>significance</strong> of the language here and make no attempt to look at its communicative 
				<strong>value</strong> in any kind of exchange between users of language.<br />
				That is, of course, completely artificial and context free but is the way many teachers might explain things (and, far too often, when they stop explaining).</p>
				
					
					<dl>
						<dt><strong>Pragmatically / functionally</strong>, we can have another 
						look.</dt>
						<dd>
				<ol class="auto-style41">
				<li>
				In functional terms, the sentence represents what is called
				<strong>ideational meaning</strong> &ndash; the representation of a 
				proposition or truth.<br />
			Language is used for many other purposes, often dependent on the 
			verb nature, such as behavioural meanings (<em>go, sneeze</em>), material 
			actions (<em>break, explode</em>), mental processes (<em>think, believe</em>) and 
			verbal processes (<em>say, explain</em>).<br />
			In this case, we have an <strong>existential</strong> meaning (something exists 
			in the first clause) and a <em>relational</em> meaning (something is the 
			same as it in the second clause).&nbsp; The verb of choice here is 
				<em>be</em>.</li>
				<li>
				Here, the Field of discourse is called <strong>experiential</strong> 
				because we are dealing with the exchange of information between 
				(probably) speakers (but it would not matter if it were 
				written).</li>
				<li>
				The Tenor is interpersonal revealed by the use of <em>may</em>.&nbsp; 
				Such verbs are used between people socially.</li>
					<li>
					The Mode is probably oral-aural, face-to-face but might not be.</li>
					<li>
					The speaker has selected the pronoun <em>it</em> as the
					<strong>Theme</strong> of the sentence and it’s jumping-off 
					point.&nbsp; All that follows is the <strong>Rheme</strong>.&nbsp; 
					The reason for this is that he/she wishes to make it clear 
					that it is communicatively important to repeat the Theme 
					later.&nbsp; Thinking ahead is part of language production.</li>
					<li>
					Within the Rheme, we have <em>that you are right</em> and 
					that lies in apposition to the pronoun <em>it</em> (i.e., 
					they are co-referential).<br />
			People do not usually repeat such things randomly so we are looking 
			for the communicative value of doing this.</li>
					<li>
					And, Lo!, we will probably find it in an exchange between 
					cooperative speakers because the next contribution will more 
					than likely be something like:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, thanks, so what do we do about it 
					(the fact that I’m right)?</em><br />
			or something like:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … and if so, we need to do something about it, don’t 
					we?</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			We cannot, of course, predict what will follow or even who will 
			contribute but it will almost certainly not be:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;The current temperature of sensor c. on the James Webb Telescope is 
			6 degrees Kelvin</em></li>
				
			</ol>
						</dd>
					</dl>
					
					
				</dl>
			
			<p>All of this, and all other attempts to analyse language are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Arguable and amendable in the light of better research and better 
			thinking.</li>
				<li>Necessary for a better understanding of a devilishly complicated 
			phenomenon that we all use almost unconsciously all our waking 
			lives.</li>
				<li>Not the end of the story.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, it is not the case that you have to do all of these sorts of 
			analyses (but you do have to do some good analysis) or that you 
			can't entwine the analysis carefully to make connections between 
			semantic, structural and pragmatic intention clear.<br />
			What you most certainly do have to do is consider the levels and 
			types of analyses which will best suit your concerns both in the 
			essay and in the lesson.<br />
			Much of what you do here will be paralleled (no, not repeated) in 
			the language analysis you do in the plan for the targets of the 
			lesson.</p></div>

			<h3><a name="skip"></a>Learning and Teaching problems with systems</h3>
			<p>You may, as was noted above, choose to consider problems for 
			learning and teaching simultaneously with the analysis and that is a 
			legitimate approach.&nbsp; For clarity's sake here, however, we 
			shall consider them separately but use some of the same examples that we 
			have used so far for analysis.<br />
			When you come to discuss learning and teaching problems, you need to 
			do three connected things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Consider your own setting and then</li>
				<li>Think outside your own setting to show that you are aware of 
				other possibilities</li>
				<li>Know how other languages work both in terms of systems 
				and skills. Do not only focus on the 1st languages of your own 
				students.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Additionally, if you have restricted your focus by level of 
			learners, you need constantly to refer to this restriction and make 
			sure that you don't stray into areas which are clearly too difficult 
			or too easy.<br />
			Here are some examples and, again, they are just that, not models 
			for all the reasons explained above.</p>

					<h3>Problems with form</h3>
					<h3>the -<em>ing</em> forms</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<ol>
				<li>Positively, there are in English no irregular forms of the -<em>ing</em> 
				verb so learners have little difficulty with the mechanics of 
				the structure once the issue of 'e'-dropping (shave &gt; shaving) 
				has been mastered.&nbsp; It can, indeed, lead to its overuse 
				(see below).</li>
				<li>I have noted that problems with the -<em>ing</em> form used 
				as a noun occur regular at lower levels in particular because 
				many languages do not have equivalent forms or use the forms 
				differently.&nbsp; Compounding the problem is the fact that 
				English has an identical form for all three grammatical 
				functions (progressive aspect, noun and adjective).&nbsp; For 
				example:<ol class="auto-style41">
					<li>while German has a gerund form it is much more rarely 
					used so, for example,<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like walking</em><br />
					would usually be expressed verbally rather than with a noun 
					as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ich laufe gern</em> [literally, <em>I walk willingly</em>]<br />
					This can lead to errors such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I enjoy walk</em></li>
					<li>French-speaking learners and others with Romance first 
					languages also encounter difficulties with the form because 
					the infinitive form of the verb is used to perform the 
					nominal function so learners will often be tempted to 
					produce<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy to walk</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy walk</em><br />
					by analogy with, e.g., the French form<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J'aime marcher</em></li>
					<li>Italian or Greek speakers may occasionally produce<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walk pleases me</em><br />
					by analogy with:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mi piace camminare<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Μου αρέσει το περπάτημα [mou aresi to perpatisma]<br />
					</em>both of which translate as something akin to<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					It pleases me the walking</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>These issues carry over into the use of the form as a 
				progressive, which is something many languages do not exhibit, 
				using the same form of the verb to express both simple and 
				progressive aspect.&nbsp; This can lead to avoidance of the form 
				altogether and errors such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I travel to work by bus this week<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*I watched TV when he called</em><br />
				Speakers from a variety of languages both European and East Asian 
				will have difficulties knowing when to use the -<em>ing</em> 
				form for background, continuous, iterative or progressive 
				events.</li>
				<li>Because the form is regular and simple in English some 
				learners may be tempted to overuse it.&nbsp; Its use avoids 
				forming an irregular past of which, at lower levels, they may 
				not be sure.&nbsp; This can lead to errors such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was eating lunch in the canteen when I was at school</em></li>
				<li>Distinguishing between adjectival and verbal uses of the 
				form is often not necessary (even when it can be definitively 
				achieved) but at times the distinction needs to be clear or 
				errors such as the use of a dynamic verb form with a modifier 
				can occur, such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is very explaining</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is extremely helping</em><br />
				by analogy with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is very boring</em></li>

					<h3>Problems with meaning and use</h3>
					<h3>the present perfect simple</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<ol>
				<li>The primary problem with the form in terms of meaning and 
				use stems from the fact that very few languages make the 
				aspectual distinctions that English does or, if they do 
				distinguish perfect vs. simple aspects, do so in a way that is 
				clearly not parallelled in English.&nbsp; For example:<ol class="auto-style41">
					<li>Languages with parallel forms such as German and Dutch 
					do not make a difference in meaning so, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have loved</em><br />
					can be translated as either<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ich liebte</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ich habe geliebt</em><br />
					with no real distinction in meaning.<br />
					Speakers of other Germanic languages (including 
					Scandinavian languages) may therefore produce almost random 
					errors such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have eaten lunch at one o'clock<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*I didn't go to university yet</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>Greek, too, has a parallel structure with an emphasis on 
					the immediate effect of a previous action (like English) so 
					the implication of, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have booked</em><br />
					is
					that <em>I now want to claim my room</em><br />
					will not be difficult.<br />
					However, the language does not use this form for the sense 
					of 'in my life up to now' when a simple form is preferred so 
					Greek speakers may produce errors such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent the money already.</em></li>
					<li>Speakers of Romance languages such as French may make 
					similar errors because the translation of both<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spent</em><br />
					will often be simply<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J'ai dépensé</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Error can also be produced by materials which emphasise the 
				forms of time adjuncts which are used with simple and perfect 
				aspects rather than concept of the tense form itself so a 
				learners who has been told, e.g., that <span class="style_black">
				"We use for + a time period with the present perfect simple"</span> 
				may, understandably, produce:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have lived in Germany for two years and then I have moved 
				to England</em><br />
				in which the simple form of the tense would be more appropriate.<br />
				In teaching, therefore, it is important to tackle the issue from 
				the point of view that it is the meaning of the form which 
				determines the appropriate time adjuncts to use and not the 
				other way around.</li>
				<li>The fact that the present impact of the event or state being 
				described is the paramount consideration may also be lost on 
				learners who have been trained in using the form purely for the 
				three uses analysed above.&nbsp; The key issue here is to make 
				it clear in the teaching process that there is a distinction in 
				English between an absolute tense, such as the past simple, and 
				a relational tense form such as the past, present and future perfect.&nbsp; Absolute tense forms situate an event, action or 
				state in time; relational tense forms connect times.</li>
				<li>In terms of teaching problems, the provision of a clear 
				context is not too challenging but it is much more challenging 
				to impress on learners that the perfect form implies that the 
				speaker sees an event as currently significant even when it is 
				clearly perfective in nature and completed.&nbsp; This is 
				especially true for learners who have been told that the tense 
				form solely expresses the idea of 'up to now'.&nbsp; This can 
				lead to error comprehending and producing the difference for 
				example, between:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have learned French</em> (<em>so can speak some</em>)<br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I learnt French at school </em>(<em>but have forgotten it</em>)</li>

					<h3>Problems with pronunciation</h3>
					<h3>assimilation</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is an area where it makes eminent sense to consider learning 
			and teaching problems in tandem with each section of the analysis 
			because reference back to the analysis is less easy to achieve 
			clearly.&nbsp; Here are some examples of the sorts of things that 
			should be considered in these inserted points.</p>
			<p>Two types of problem arise in terms of pronunciation:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Problems of comprehension<ol class="auto-style41">
					<li>Learners who have been taught the pronunciation of items 
					in isolation may well not recognise the forms when they are 
					spoken rapidly.<br />
					Progressive assimilation, in particular can cause learners 
					to misinterpret or simply not recognise that, e.g.:<br />
					<em>The captain will be here later</em><br />
					when it is pronounced as<br />
					/ðə ˈkæp.m wl bi hɪə ˈleɪ.tə/<br />
					rather than as<br />
					/ðə ˈkæp.tɪn wəl bi hɪə ˈleɪ.tə/</li>
					<li>Coalescent assimilation will often result in 
					non-comprehension, especially at lower levels because, as we 
					saw, <em>won't you</em> can often be rendered as /wəʊntʃu/.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Problems of production<br />
				In this area there is little chance that learners will be 
				misunderstood by even an intolerant native speaker.&nbsp; 
				However, the non-production of assimilating sounds will 
				frequently make a learner sound unnaturally formal and careful 
				in speech as well as having the effect of slowing his or her 
				production, often to an unacceptable extent.&nbsp; Producing, 
				for example, for the phrase <em>bad beer</em>:<br />
				/bæd ˈbɪə/<br />
				instead of<br />
				/bæb ˈbɪə/<br />
				not only takes longer and is more difficult, it makes the 
				speaker sound unnatural.</li>
