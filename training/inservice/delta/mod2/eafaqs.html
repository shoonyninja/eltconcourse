			<p>Here are a few of the usual questions following the 
			<span class="style_black"> <em>What 
			happens if ...</em></span>:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt class="style_black"><em>I need to change the date or time of the assessment?</em></dt>
				<dd>This shouldn't happen and can be a real problem if the 
				assessor is travelling a long way to see you.&nbsp; If it is 
				unavoidable, you must go through the centre to make a new 
				arrangement and you must do this as soon as you can.&nbsp; If 
				you know another candidate who is being assessed in the same 
				session and swapping times would solve the problem, suggest this 
				to the centre but do not just do it!</dd>
				<dt class="style_black"> <em>I don't have enough learners in the group?</em></dt>
				<dd>The minimum number is five (there is no maximum).&nbsp; If 
				this number is not present at the beginning, the assessor can 
				wait 15 minutes for more to arrive (or be found from other 
				groups).<br />There may be exceptional circumstances, such as industrial 
				action, cancelled public transport, terror alerts, unusually 
				severe weather and so on, and the assessor has the discretion to 
				go ahead with the assessment in any case.&nbsp; Note that a learner being ill or unable to attend because of work 
				commitments etc. does not count as an exceptional circumstance.</dd>
				<dt class="style_black"> <em>I need to cancel the assessment and rearrange it for 
				another time / session?</em></dt>
				<dd>This will incur a cost and you will be liable for it.</dd>
				<dt class="style_black"> <em>my lesson overruns?</em></dt>
				<dd>The assessor may be able to stay up to 15 minutes beyond the 
				scheduled end time but not if there is another assessment to 
				follow on, of course.&nbsp; Making sure it doesn't happen is a 
				better way forward.</dd>
				<dt class="style_black"> <em>my lesson for the assessment forms part of a longer 
				session so I want to do the introductory, scene-setting work and 
				the follow-up free practice before the assessor arrives and 
				after she leaves?</em></dt>
				<dd>Do not do this.&nbsp; The assessor has to see a complete and 
				self-contained teaching unit.&nbsp; It is sometimes an unnatural 
				constraint but that's how it is.</dd>
				<dt class="style_black"> <em>I want the assessor to tell me if it was all OK?</em></dt>
				<dd>Don't ask.&nbsp; Assessors may not discuss the lesson with 
				you at all.</dd>
				<dt class="style_black"> <em>I want to comment on the assessor's behaviour?</em></dt>
				<dd>There's a form for this which your centre can let you have.&nbsp; 
				The centre tutor needs to countersign it and send it to 
				Cambridge.</dd>
				<dt class="style_black"> <em>I have noticed a silly error in my materials / the 
				lesson plan / the background essay and want to give the assessor 
				a revised version after the lesson?</em></dt>
				<dd>You can't.&nbsp; The assessor is required only 
				to accept materials given in <strong>before</strong> the lesson.&nbsp; 
				Don't let it happen.</dd>
				<dt class="style_black"> <em>the assessor has asked that an assessor-in-training 
				accompany him or her?</em></dt>
				<dd>You can, if you want to, refuse to allow this.</dd>
				<dt class="style_black"> <em>I do not want the assessor to use a 
				laptop during the lesson</em></dt>
				<dd>You have to notify the centre of your wishes and these will 
				be respected.</dd>
				<dt><span class="style_black"> <em>I want to contact the assessor?</em></span></dt>
				<dd>Don't even try.&nbsp; It's not allowed.&nbsp; All contacts with 
				assessors are the centre's responsibility.</dd>
				<dt><span class="style_black"> <em>I have a potentially disruptive student in the group 
				and I want to explain the problem to the assessor?</em></span></dt>
				<dd>This should be in your lesson plan both under the profiles 
				of the learners and the group and in your anticipated problems 
				and solutions section.</dd>
				<dt class="style_black"><em> I was not feeling well on the day of the assessment 
				and think this may have affected my performance?</em></dt>
				<dd>The centre (not you) can send a notification of Special 
				Circumstances to Cambridge and it will be considered.&nbsp; The assessor will not take this into account.&nbsp; 
				You will need some medical evidence, ideally.</dd>

			<p>All the paperwork ends up in Cambridge Assessment's swanky new building in Cambridge.&nbsp; It

			</table>
			<p>It depends slightly on when you take the external assessment.</p>
			<p>Moderation of Module Two results happens three times a year only 
			because it is impractical for Moderators to work together more 
			frequently than that.<br />
			This means that reports from external assessors are held until the 
			next Moderation meeting and you may be unlucky to fall just after 
			one so there will be a delay.<br />
			Quite a lot has to happen at Moderation and lots of effort is put in to making sure 
			the result is the right one and truly reflects your performance.<br />
			It's worth the&nbsp;wait.</p>
