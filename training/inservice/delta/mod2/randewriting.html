	<h1>How to write a good Reflection and Evaluation</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="reflection" height="207" src="../../../images/reflection_tree310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<h2>Is the Reflection and Evaluation important?</h2>
		<p>Yes!&nbsp; The ability to evaluate what happened in the classroom and 
		why is critical.<br />
		A failed lesson may be rescued by a good Reflection and Evaluation 
		because it shows insight and honest reflection.&nbsp; A Pass lesson may 
		be considered a Merit or better for the same reason.<br />
		Your role at this stage of the assignment is reflector not planner, 
		justifier or assessor.</p>
		<p>The criteria for this section are:</p>
			<p class="style_black">Successful candidates demonstrate that they can effectively:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style21">
			<li>reflect on and evaluate their own 
			planning, teaching and the learnersâ€™ progress as evidenced in this 
			lesson</li>
			<li>identify key strengths and weaknesses 
			in planning and execution</li>
			<li>explain how they will/would 
			consolidate/follow on from the learning achieved in the lesson</li>
		</ol>
			<p>Don't be tempted to refer in general to your teaching abilities.&nbsp; This document is about <strong>this</strong> lesson.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="assessorssay" height="72" src="../images/assessorssay.jpg" width="80" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style20"><span class="style_red"><strong>
					What assessors sometimes say on 10a</strong>:</span><br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>The candidate reflects on the 
					lesson and some of its main strengths and weaknesses but 
					makes no comment on her planning (as it turned out, a key 
					issue in terms of timing and challenge).<br />
					Much of what is written here concerns the candidate's own 
					progress and professional development.&nbsp; Very little is 
					said about what the learners achieved.<br />The candidate has failed to identify any evidence to support 
					her assertions concerning strengths and weaknesses and their 
					effects on learning.</em></span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
		<p>This criterion addresses three areas:</p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li class="redbulletlist"><strong>The plan</strong><br />
			You must refer to how the plan worked out in practice.&nbsp; 
			Think about:<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li class="greybulletlist">Timing:<br />
				<em>Did you allow enough / too 
				much time for everything?<br />
				What effect on learning did any 
				weaknesses here have?</em></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist">Challenge:<br />
				<em>Was this about right?<br />
				What effect on learning did any weaknesses here have?</em><br />
				For example:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>The most important weakness in this 
			lesson has its roots in the plan.&nbsp; I had not allowed for 
			sufficient practice and preparation time before the students were 
			asked to re-tell the stories.&nbsp; As a result, they were not 
			consistently using the target exponents although there was evidence 
				from the writing stage which I monitored that they had acquired many of them actively and all of them 
			passively.<br />
			The lesson's most obvious strength, that the learners were engaged 
			and motivated throughout, also had its roots in my planning.&nbsp; 
				Judging from their responses, I 
			had chosen a topic of interest to them and a set of procedures which 
			allowed them to engage with the materials.&nbsp; As a result, my two 
			main learning objectives were achieved.</em></span></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist">Make explicit reference to any changes to the plan and say<br />
				a) 
			why you made the change<br />
				and<br />
				b) what effect it had.<br />
				For example:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>Pressure of time, and the need to get 
			on to stage 8, which provided for important consolidation and gave 
			the learners a record of the language, meant that the pronunciation 
			practice was cut short.&nbsp; This impacted on the learners' ability 
			to produce the target items successfully in Stage 9, however, and 
			will need to be remedied in a future lesson.</em></span></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li class="redbulletlist"><strong>The lesson</strong><br />
			You need to reflect on the lesson as a whole.&nbsp; Think about:<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li class="greybulletlist">Purposefulness:<br />
				<em>Was the lesson 
				coherent and did it show clear development?</em><br />
				For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Because I wanted the lesson to be 
				purposeful and engaging, I deliberately set quite a fast pace.&nbsp; 
				This did not affect learning outcomes for the majority although 
				I saw that Javier and Monica found it challenging.&nbsp; I'll check their 
				homework carefully to see if it affected their learning.</em></span></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist">Variety:<br />
				<em>Was there an adequate variety 
				of interactions and activity types to keep the learners engaged?</em><br />
				For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>The variations in interaction 
				patterns (in particular, the pyramid grouping) worked as I 
				planned to provide engagement and commitment to the tasks.</em></span></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li class="redbulletlist"><strong>The learners' progress</strong><br />
			This is the key area.&nbsp; Ask yourself:<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>What could the learners do by the end 
				of the lesson that they couldn't have done at the beginning?</em><br />
				For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>The final role play demonstrated 
				to me and the learners that they had grasped the key intonation 
				contours and sentence stress patterns which formed the main 
				objectives for them.&nbsp; More work on meaning and style of the 
				lexis will still be needed.</em></span></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>Did they </em> <strong><em>all</em></strong><em> achieve 
				what you set out to help them to achieve?</em><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Only Marjorie is still unable to 
				get to grips with the structure, unfortunately, and this lesson 
				confirmed my belief that she has been placed above her level.&nbsp; 
				I will act on this with the Academic Manager.</em></span></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>Did the materials engage and 
				motivate?</em><br />
				For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>I was pleased that the topic was 
				clearly engaging for the whole class (unsurprisingly, as it is a 
				theme close to their own experiences).&nbsp; My observation was 
				that the learners found the poster-design task engaging and the 
				outcomes were better than I predicted.</em></span></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>If I assert that, e.g., 
				</em> 
				<span class="style_black"> <em>my aims 
				were achieved</em></span><em>, do I refer to any evidence from the lesson 
				to back this up?<br />
				For example:</em><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>The final round-up and re-cap 
				stage demonstrated to me that the essentials of this use of the 
				tense form had been grasped and that the learners are aware of 
				its use.&nbsp; Revision will be needed because there were some 
				persistent errors in the final dialogue-building tasks.</em></span></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="assessorssay" height="72" src="../images/assessorssay.jpg" width="80" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style20"><span class="style_red"><strong>
					What assessors sometimes say on 10b</strong>:</span><br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>The candidate identifies a 
					number of strengths and weaknesses but has not prioritised 
					these in terms of effect on learning outcomes.<br />
					The candidate's view of the lesson is overly positive with 
					only strengths identified.<br />
					The candidate has failed to note the most important weakness 
					(i.e., the level of challenge).<br />
					The candidate focuses only on weaknesses and has not 
					identified the high levels of engagement and motivation she 
					managed to evince.</em></span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
		<p>There are two areas to focus on:</p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li><strong>Priorities</strong>: note the word '<strong>key</strong>' in the 
			criterion and think about effects on learning.&nbsp; Don't just list strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; You must <strong>
			prioritise</strong> 
			them by thinking about which ones had the most impact on the 
			learning that took place (or didn't).<br />
			Just because you thought that the error you made on the whiteboard 
			was important, that doesn't mean it was.&nbsp; What effect (if any) 
			did it have on learning?&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>The most important weaknesses in this 
			lesson were .... because their effects on learning were ... which 
			was shown by ...<br />
			The most important strengths in the lesson were ... because this 
			allowed the learners to ... as was evidenced in ...</em></span></li>
			<li><strong>Coverage</strong>: make sure you include strengths and weaknesses in the 
			planning as well as the execution.</li>
		</ul>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="assessorssay" height="72" src="../images/assessorssay.jpg" width="80" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style20"><span class="style_red"><strong>
					What assessors sometimes say on 10c</strong>:</span><br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>The candidate has a number of 
					suggestions for her own development but does not say how she 
					would follow up on this lesson.<br />
					The candidate has suggested a way forward but it is too 
					vague to be clear and simply suggests more of the same.<br />
					The candidate suggests a follow-up procedure but it is not 
					clear how this is based on what happened in this lesson.</em></span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
		<p>Even if you are never going to see the class again, you still need to 
		focus on this area.&nbsp; Remember:</p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li>This is <strong>not about you</strong>; it is about the learners and their 
			progress.</li>
			<li><strong>Be precise</strong>: do not talk in vague terms about, e.g., <em>going on 
			to practise more reading subskills</em> or <em>extending the 
			learners knowledge of the structures</em>.&nbsp; Say which ones, why 
			(based on the outcomes of this lesson) and how.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>Following on from the comment 
			regarding Stage 7, I need to revisit the intonation patterns which 
			were sub-aims in terms of learning outcomes in this lesson.&nbsp; I shall 
			do this by setting up a parallel role play, this time recounting an 
			anecdote about children (a topic close to most of my learners' 
			hearts) and thoroughly practising the feedback routines (especially </em>
			Really?!, Wow! <em>and </em>Go on<em>., all of which were poorly 
			produced in this lesson).</em></span></li>
		</ul>
		<hr />
			
		<p>Here's a summary of what should go in the Reflection and Evaluation.&nbsp; 
		Keep it by you as you write.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="summary" height="298" src="../images/randesummary.png" width="500" /></p>
		<p>You only have a maximum of 500 words to expend so use them 
		wisely.&nbsp; Be succinct and stay relevant.<br />
		Not everything in the diagram above will be relevant to all lessons.&nbsp; 
		You need to select the points in each section which are most crucial to 
		your lesson.<br />
		Use 300 to 350 words to reflect and identify the key issues and reserve around 150 words to set 
		out your future action(s).</p>
