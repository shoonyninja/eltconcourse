			<p>This short guide is concerned with meeting the Delta criterion

			<p class="indentpara">awareness of a range of learning and teaching 
			problems occurring in a range of learning contexts</p>
			<p>Actually, you have to do a bit more than <em>show awareness</em>, 
			you have to be able to describe, and propose solutions (later) for, 
			a <strong>range</strong> of problems in a <strong>range</strong> of 
			contexts.<br />
			<a href="../delta_documents/ELT_Concourse_Delta_criteria_Background_Essay_explained.pdf" target="_blank">

				<li><em>Think outside your own setting to show that you are

					This is not, however, the case elsewhere and opportunities 
					for practice are concomitantly lower.&nbsp; However, even 
					learners in non-native-English speaking environments may 
					often need to interact with other first- or second-language 
					speakers of English (for example, in countries where English 
					is an official or de facto national language such as it is 
					in many African states).&nbsp; The ability, therefore to 
					recognise when to combine a Response with an Initiation is 
					still something that needs to be taught rather than assumed.</em></td>

					never taught in the settings you mention, the fact that you 
					have considered them rationally is a strong point to make.</td>
