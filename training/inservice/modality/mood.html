		<p>
		Mood has been variously defined and is very variable across languages.&nbsp; 
		In English, however, the system is reasonably straightforward.&nbsp; So 
		much so that many grammars ignore the category altogether and it rarely 
		makes an appearance in materials for learners.&nbsp; However, if you are 
		learning a range of other languages, mood is a very important aspect of 
		the verb to consider.</p>
			<p>
			Mood is closely related to modality in the same way that it can 
			be said that time is related to tense.&nbsp; Mood and tense are 
			grammatical or syntactical categories but time and modality are semantic categories 
			to do with the meaning of the language we select.<br />
			You can visualise the relationship like this:<br />
			<img alt="categories" height="393" src="../../imagesgraphics/mood_modality.png" width="475" /><br />
			Just as there is no one-to-one relationship between time and tense 
			(with many tense forms indicating times other than their grammatical 
			forms would imply) so the relationship between mood and modality is 
			complex and often unpredictable.&nbsp; For much more, you should 
			consult the guides to the various types of modality, linked in the 
			list of related guides at the end.</p>
			<p>
			A strict definition of mood refers to the fact that it is indicated 
			by morphological changes to verb forms.&nbsp; This means, for 
			example, that English has no conditional mood <em>per se</em> 
			because the conditional is signalled by a periphrastic structure.&nbsp; 
			In English, therefore, we encounter:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John <strong>would stay </strong>if you needed him</em><br />
			and the conditional mood is represented by the structure <em>would 
			stay</em>.&nbsp; In other languages, such as German, both a 
			periphrastic form similar to English and a change to the verb form 
			itself can be used so that sentence can be translated as either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John </em><strong><em>würde bleiben</em></strong><em>,
			</em><em>wenn du ihn brauchst</em><br />
			or as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John </em><strong><em>bliebe</em></strong><em>, 
			wenn du ihn brauchst</em><br />
			In most European languages, the conditional mood takes the same form 
			as the subjunctive (see below) but not in all.<br />
			That sentence in French, for example, translates as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John </em><strong><em>resterait</em></strong>
			<em>si tu avais besoin de lui</em><br />
			and in Portuguese as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John </em><strong><em>ficaria</em></strong><em> 
			se você precisasse dele</em><br />
			and in both cases the conditional mood is represented by the changes 
			to the form of the verb in <strong>bold</strong> here).<br />
			There is a little more on this below with some other examples.</p>
			<p>
			If we take this strict definition of mood to involve a change to the 
			verb form, we conclude that English signals only three moods.</p>

				<h2>Three moods in English</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>
			Although theoretical grammars will identify a considerable (and 
			confusing) number of possible moods by referring to languages other 
			than English (of which a little more later), in English grammar 
			three moods are identifiable.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>The indicative mood</strong><br />
				is used to discuss real events either in declarative (positive 
				and negative) or interrogative clauses.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She made the cake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have the time?</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She is not my sister</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't you know the answer?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Declarative, negative and interrogative clauses are signalled by 
				verbal inflexions in English, for example, the -<em>s</em> 
				ending on singular, third-person, present simple verb forms and 
				the other changes that are made to verbs to show past tense.<br />
				Negative and interrogative clauses are also signalled in some 
				tense forms by the operator <em>do</em>.&nbsp; In other tense 
				forms and with auxiliary verbs, the interrogative is signalled 
				by word order changes, as it is in many languages.<br />
				The interrogative is sometimes considered a distinct subcategory 
				of the indicative and that is the line taken in the summary on 
				this page.<br />
				The indicative mood is sometimes called a <strong>realis</strong> mood, 
				because it denotes that the speaker is concerned with addressing 
				facts, not hypotheses or possibilities.<br />
				Some languages retain a special form of the indicative to 
				express general truths rather than truths at the time of 
				speaking.&nbsp; English does not except in its use of the 
				present simple verb form for that kind of indication.<br />
				Other moods, discussed below are called <strong>irrealis</strong> 
				moods.</li>
				<li><strong>The Imperative mood</strong><br />
				In English, the form of the verb used in imperative sentences is 
				the simple base form as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come here!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't do that!</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please go to the manager's office</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				The imperative expresses commands, prohibitions, and requests.&nbsp; 
				In English, there is only one pure form of the imperative, the bare 
				stem of the verb, but other languages may have a special 
				morphological change to the verb to show imperative mood.&nbsp; 
				English, too, has ways of softening imperatives that do not use 
				the base stem of the verb so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why don't we try a bit harder?</em><br />
				can be considered an imperative rather than a suggestion 
				depending on who is talking to whom.&nbsp; Between equals, it is 
				a suggestion but from a teacher to a child it is clearly an 
				imperative.<br />
				The distinction being made here is between a command and a 
				hortation: an order and an attempt to persuade.<br />
				In many languages, too, there is a first-person plural form of 
				the imperative which does not exist in English.&nbsp; So, for 
				example, in French:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allons à la maison</em><br />
				means:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's go home.</em><br />
				Learners from language backgrounds which have the first-person 
				plural imperative may struggle to express the thought in English 
				and neglect to use the correct form of <em>let</em>, which, 
				often and confusingly, means <em>allow</em>.<br />
				English is slightly unusual in allowing a progressive aspect 
				form of the verb in imperative mood clauses so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be standing near the post office</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't be working too hard</em><br />
				are both possible, if slightly rare.<br />
				There is another distinction here which is not immediately 
				obvious because the form is shared although the function is 
				quite different.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to bed</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come here</em><br />
				are clearly imperative mood statements requiring action but:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep well</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Go home safely</em><br />
				although they look the same in terms of structure are optative 
				(i.e., expresses a wish) rather than imperative.<br />
				There's a slightly grey area here because an utterance such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoy your evening</em><br />
				could be interpreted as an imperative to mean:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please try to enjoy your evening</em><br />
				or as an optative statement meaning:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you enjoy your evening.<br />
				</em>In English, there is no way to separate the meanings but 
				other languages would have a different verb form for the two 
				statements.<br />
				In some languages, such as Modern Greek the negative imperative 
				mood differs structurally from the positive so there is a 
				difference between:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go and ask him</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't go and ask him</em><br />
				signalled by the form of the verb or a particle.</li>
				<li><strong>The subjunctive mood</strong><br />
				is used rarely in English because the language usually prefers to 
				express meanings of doubt, uncertainty, hypothetical states and 
				likelihoods with its range of central, semi- and marginal modal 
				auxiliary verbs.<br />
				The subjunctive, widely used and marked by changes to the verb 
				in many languages, refers to the wished for, hypothetical or 
				mandatory.<br />
				For this reason, some grammars consider the conditional in 
				English to be a mood in itself.&nbsp; The use of <em>would</em> 
				in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I hadn't been so tired, I would have 
				been able to finish</em><br />
				is derived from the old subjunctive form of the verb <em>will</em>.<br />
				There are two forms of the subjunctive in English:<ol class="auto-style12">
					<li>The stem of the verb, often appearing in <em>that</em>-clauses, 
					as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is necessary that he be the leader<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I demanded that she re-do the paper<br />
					</em>Some fixed expressions left over from earlier forms of 
					English such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So be it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaven be praised<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will do the work, come what may<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If need be, I'll help</em></li>
					<li><em>were</em>, the past subjunctive of <em>be</em>.<br />
					Examples are:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I were you, I wouldn't do that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I were a rich man</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the above, we have considered declarative and interrogative 
			moods as just types of the indicative mood.<br />
			In some analyses, indicative and declarative are treated as 
			synonyms.</p>
			<p>Here is a cut-out-and-keep summary with some examples only of the 
			three moods recognised in English in most traditional grammars.</p>

		<p>Other languages make much greater use of mood and often rely on 
		changes to the verbs or affixation to signal what in English will 
		usually be expressed via the use of modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; This is 
		the root of a good deal of error because adult learners, in particular, 
		will often expect the language they are learning to have parallel 
		structures to their first languages.<br />
		In what follows, there is some overlap because different languages are 
		described in different ways using overlapping terminology in many cases.</p>
			<p>A range of other moods is evident in these languages.&nbsp; For 
			example:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>The conditional<br />
			<img alt="thoughtful" height="133" src="../../images/woman_thoughtful_profile200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			</strong>English conditional forms rely on modal auxiliary verbs, 
			notably <em>will, would, could, may</em> and <em>might</em>, to 
			express the hypothetical nature of a situation so we have, for 
			example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you come early you will get a good seat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you were to do that it would be a mistake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could help if you like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help me with this and I'll buy you dinner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the snow gets worse the roads might be blocked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you ask him, you may be able to get a straight answer</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			In many other languages, the conditional forms an identifiable mood 
			in itself, signalled by changes to the form of the verb.&nbsp; 
			Learners who look for such changes in English will look in vain.<br />
			Most Romance languages (French, Italian, Spanish etc.) make full use 
			of the subjunctive forms of verbs in conditional sentences and 
			German, too, has both a present and past form of the subjunctive 
			(but that is often replaced by a periphrastic form akin to English).&nbsp; 
			For example, the sentence:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I will walk if I have time<br />
			</em>is:<br />
			In French: <em>Je marcherai si j'ai le temps</em><br />
			In German:<em> Ich ginge (zu Fuss) wenn ich Zeit habe</em><br />
			In Spanish: <em>Caminaré si tengo tiempo</em><br />
			etc. and the form of the verb expresses the conditional or 
			hypothetical nature of the situation in each case.<br />
			That English does not have a single verb form to do this, is a 
			source of a good deal of error.<br />
			In a few languages, a distinction is made between conditional forms 
			referring to possibilities and those which are purely hypothetical.&nbsp; 
			The hypothetical mood may be signalled by a specific verbal 
			inflexion in these languages.</li>
			<li><strong>The optative</strong><br />
			<img alt="wish" height="133" src="../../images/woman_wish200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			There is a guide on this site to suasion (linked below) which 
			includes consideration of the optative.<br />
			Briefly, the mood mostly expresses hopes and wishes (and sometimes 
			overlaps with commands and imperatives).&nbsp; Examples in English 
			are:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I wish it would get warmer </em>(a probably hopeless desire)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him try!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish you would listen </em>(an imperative)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I had studied harder</em> (a conditional form)<br />Some languages reserve a particular verb form for optative 
			expressions but English relies mostly on modal auxiliary verbs or 
			subjunctive forms as the examples show.<br />
			In most languages, the optative form is the same as the subjunctive 
			form used for conditional clauses but some languages, including 
			Albanian, Kazakh, Japanese, Finnish and Nepali reserve a distinct 
			optative form.<br />
			One language, Turkish, also has a negative optative mood called the 
			imprecative which is reserved for wishing for something bad to 
			happen to someone.</li>
			<li><strong>The jussive mood</strong><br />
			<img alt="listen" height="133" src="../../images/listen_intensive200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			This mood simply does not exist in English and needs to be expressed 
			on a wholly different way.&nbsp; However, in Arabic, for example, 
			there is a distinct verb form for an imperative aimed not at the 
			hearer but at a third person who may or may not be present.&nbsp; 
			That's what is meant by the jussive.&nbsp; An example in English is<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish he would work more</em><br />
			in which the wish is expressed concerning another person.</li>
			<li><strong>The potential mood</strong><br />
			<img alt="order" height="133" src="../../images/make_it_so200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			This mood expresses degrees of probability which in English are 
			expressed through modal auxiliary verbs as in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ought to be here soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That should be the train we want<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He must have been crazy to spend so much on a coat</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			This mood exists as a distinct verb form in, for example, Japanese 
			and Finnish.&nbsp; In the former, it is often described as the 
			tentative mood because it expresses the ability to do something 
			which may not, in fact, have been done.&nbsp; In English, an example 
			is:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't need to call her</em><br />
			which expresses the tentative nature of the proposition and probably 
			means either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called her but it was unnecessary (as it 
			turned out)</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no need to call her (so I didn't)<br />
			</em>The situation is made more complex in English by having an 
			alternative form:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I needn't have called her</em><br />
			which <strong>only</strong> means<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not necessary to call her (but I did)</em></li>
			<li><strong>The inferential mood</strong><br />
			<img alt="guess" height="133" src="../../images/child_guess_blind200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			is almost impossible to translate into English but in languages such 
			as Bulgarian and Turkish, it is a form of the verb which 
			distinguishes between an event that the speaker witnessed and one 
			which is inferred, either because the speaker was not present or 
			because the event occurred a very long time ago.<br />
			The mood has various names depending on which language is being 
			discussed but it exists in many Balkan languages and Estonian (in 
			which it is usually called the oblique mood).<br />
			In English, the mood may be expressed using a modal auxiliary verb 
			such as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She must have left (although I did not see 
			her leave)</em><br />
			or in indicative forms such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I presume she has left</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said / I have heard that she has left</em></li>

			<p>One would rarely set out to teach mood in English but a knowledge 
			of how other people's languages deal with the area and what moods 
			are expressible in them is important if the topic of modal auxiliary 
			verbs (of any sort) is to be effectively handled.</p>
			<p>In particular:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Expressing moods in English relies much more on modal 
				auxiliary verbs than it does in the majority of languages.&nbsp; 
				This means that English is rich in these verbs and capable of 
				expressing subtle differences such as the one between:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I needn't have done it</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't need to do it</em><br />
				or between:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shouldn't be so rude</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She oughtn't to be so rude</em><br />
				Teaching modal auxiliary verbs needs to be carefully planned and 
				they need to be categorised.&nbsp; For a way to do that, see the 
				guides to modality.</li>
				<li>Teaching needs to focus on how mood is expressed in a way 
				that makes sense to speakers of other languages.<br />
				This applies particularly to the optative (which has many 
				confusing forms in English) and the conditional which has a 
				special periphrastic structure not parallelled in many languages.</li>
