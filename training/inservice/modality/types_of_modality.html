			<h1>Types of modality</h1>
			<img alt="more" height="207" src="../../images/meditation310.jpg" width="310" /><p>
			There is a simpler and much abbreviated
			<a href="../../initial/grammar_essentials/modality_essentials.html" target="_blank">essential guide to modality</a> 
			in the pre-service, initial plus section of this site and
			one to<a href="central_modal_verbs.html" target="_blank"> central modal auxiliary verbs</a>.&nbsp; Both those links will open in new tabs.</p>
			<p>
			What follows is an analysis which can be used when planning to teach 
			modal auxiliary verbs, modal adjectives, adverbs and nouns in English.&nbsp; It is based on some fundamental 
			concepts in logic and the theory is that the categories of modality 
			mirror the categories of human thought, making concepts clearer and 
			more teachable.</p>

			<h2>Propositions and Modality distinguished</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			At the outset, we need to distinguish between <strong>propositions</strong> 
			and <strong>modality</strong> because that will help us to define 
			what we are talking about.</p>
			<p>
			If, for example, I say:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The door is red</em><br />
			I am not implying any sense of whether it should be red, must 
			be red, can't be black or whatever.&nbsp; I am simply stating a 
			proposition and the hearers will make of it what they will.<br />
			If, however, I say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to use the red door</em><br />
			I am stating something very different.&nbsp; In effect, I am saying 
			that there is some kind of obligation or duty on the hearer to use 
			one door rather than another.&nbsp; In other words, I am stating my 
			perception of the situation rather than stating a fact.<br />
			This guide is concerned with how English speakers express their 
			feelings about events and states.</p>
			<p>
			This is an important area because it is impossible to speak any 
			language properly without knowing how to encode your feelings about 
			events and states.&nbsp; Confining yourself to statements about the 
			world only is akin to trying to write a novel without using the 
			letter 'e' and is communicatively crippling.<br />
			Unfortunately, it's also a complex area and the complications are 
			often underestimated.</p>
			<p>
			There is, to muddy the water slightly, a distinction sometimes made 
			between event modality and propositional 
			modality.&nbsp; Luckily, the two types of modality can be simply 
			explained:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>Event modality refers to the perceived benefit of an event 
			occurring.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This work 
				must be completed by August<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important that the staff are kept informed</em><br />which both refer to how the speaker / writer perceives a benefit 
			from an event.</li>
				<li>Propositional modality refers to the speaker / writer's view of 
			likelihood of a proposition being true.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's obviously his sister<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She should be in Paris by now</em><br />
				which
			both refer to how likely the speaker perceives a proposition is 
			true.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the analysis used on this site, event modality concerns deontic 
			modality and propositional modality concerns epistemic modality.&nbsp; 
			For an explanation of those two terms, read on.</p>
			<p>
			Modality lies in the realms of interpersonal meanings and expresses 
			how the speaker / writer feels about a state or event: whether it 
			is true, necessary, inevitable, possible, desirable and so on.&nbsp; 
			Modality is a semantic phenomenon rather than a 
			syntactical one because it is concerned with meaning and meaning can 
			be realised through a wide range of structures.<br />
			All of the 
			following are, therefore, expressions of modality of one kind or 
			another:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style55">
				<tr>
					<td>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>I need something to eat</em></li>
				<li><em>That is a necessary conclusion</em></li>
				<li><em>We are unable to help</em></li>
				<li><em>Water freezes at 0&deg; Celsius</em></li>
				<li><em>I have no obligation to pay the money</em></li>
				<li><em>I am willing to help</em></li>
				<li><em>They can't be late</em></li>
				<li><em>I shouldn't have said that</em></li>
				<li><em>Pass the salt</em></li>
			</ul>
					</td>
					<td class="bluebullet">
					<ul>
						<li><em>My conclusion is that she doesn't like me</em></li>
						<li><em>You can't be serious</em></li>
						<li><em>We must go</em></li>
						<li><em>That is probably true</em></li>
						<li><em>She is definitely related to Mary</em></li>
						<li><em>Will you marry me?</em></li>
						<li><em>I expect to arrive about 6</em></li>
						<li><em>I managed to get it done</em></li>
						<li><em>Catching that flight means getting up very early</em></li>
					</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>You will see that only six of those examples contain a modal 
			auxiliary verb (<em>need, must, can </em>(twice)<em>, should, will</em>).&nbsp; In 
			what follows, many examples of modal auxiliary verbs are used to 
			exemplify the concepts but you should not assume that such verbs are 
			the only way of expressing modality.&nbsp; The other examples above 
			contain modal adjectives (<em>necessary, willing, unable</em>), 
			modal nouns (<em>conclusion, obligation</em>), modal adverbs (<em>probably, 
			definitely</em>), and lexical or main verbs used to express modality (<em>freeze, 
			expect, manage, pass, mean</em>).</p>

			<p>Traditionally, modality is taught in two main ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>By taking modal auxiliary verbs or other expressions of 
				modality and seeing what kinds of meaning they carry.&nbsp; This 
				is a common analysis (used elsewhere on this site in the 
				consideration of modal auxiliary verbs) taking each verb in turn 
				and itemising and explaining what functions they can perform.&nbsp; 
				For example, with the modal auxiliary verb <em>might</em> and 
				other ways to express the meanings it can realise we get:<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style59" style="width: 126px"><strong>Function</strong></td>
				<td class="auto-style56"><strong>Example</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style60" style="width: 126px">present possibility</td>
				<td class="auto-style57"><em>Careful.&nbsp; There might be a 
				snake in the hall.<br />
				I think it's possible there is a snake in the hall</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style60" style="width: 126px">future possibility</td>
				<td class="auto-style57"><em>It might rain tomorrow.<br />
				The weather forecast is for rain tomorrow.</em></td>

				<td class="auto-style60" style="width: 126px">past possibility</td>
				<td class="auto-style57"><em>He might have telephoned while I was

				It's possible he telephoned while I was out.</em></td>

			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style60" style="width: 126px">suggestion</td>
				<td class="auto-style57"><em>You might try taking an aspirin.<br />
				Perhaps an aspirin helps.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style60" style="width: 126px">permission</td>
				<td class="auto-style57"><em>Might I talk to you?<br />
				Do you have a little time to talk to me?</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style58" style="width: 126px">complaint</td>
				<td class="auto-style62"><em>You might have warned me!<br />
				It is regrettable that you didn't warn me.</em></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
				</li>
				<li>By looking at some ways of describing modality and see how 
				we can realise the meanings in English.&nbsp; This means looking 
				at concepts such as:<br />
				Ability:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am able to go</em><br />
				Permission:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I allow you to go</em><br />
				Advice:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going is advisable</em><br />
				Obligation:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They must go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are required to go</em><br />
				Possibility:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They might go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps going is what they will do</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>However, both these approaches have drawbacks.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Approach 1.</dt>
				<dd>can easily overwhelm learners because a single verb (<em>might</em> 
				in this case) 
			can express six different and unconnected meanings and other modal 
			auxiliary verbs suffer from the same polysemous state so verbs like
			<em>can</em> and <em>should</em> are used in English to represent 
			many meanings (ability, permission, deduction etc.) and there is no one-to-one relationship between the 
			verb and its meaning.</dd>
				<dt>Approach 2.</dt>
				<dd>is unfortunately too loose because the categories do not 
			lead to any sensible decisions about what they mean and they 
			overlap.<br />
				For example, does:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Off you go!</em><br />
			express permission or obligation?<br />
			Does:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can do that for you</em><br />
			express ability or possibility?<br />
			Does:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He should be there</em><br />
			represent a deduction about a possibility or some advice?<br />
			Does:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You must try some of this chocolate cake</em><br />
			mean I am giving advice or obliging you to do something?<br />
			and so on.</dd>

			<h3>A different view</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The traditional views have the advantage of being familiar and 
			using terms readily understood by everyone but, for teaching purposes, 
			they are 
			flawed ways to do the analysis.&nbsp; Speakers of the language do 
			not proceed from a consideration of the various functions of the 
			verb, adjective, noun or adverb and then make meaning using it.&nbsp; What they do is to 
			conceive a meaning and then select a modal expression which suits 
			their purposes.</p>
			<p>We need a better representation of modality which does 
			two things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Avoids the overlapping, loosely defined categories</li>
				<li>Represents types of modality which bear a greater 
				resemblance to how people think</li>
			</ol>
			<p>With this in mind, we can try an alternative way to represent the 
			diversity of modal auxiliary verbs and other modal expressions using 
			adverbs, nouns, lexical verbs and adjectives in English.</p>
			<p>For example, I may have in mind the fact that I do not believe 
			Mary when she says:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, I saw a unicorn on my way back from the pub last night!</em><br />
			For my purposes, I might select any number of expressions of 
			modality depending on my degree of certainty, formality, the setting, 
			how well I know Mary, whether I owe her obedience and 
			so on.<br />
			I may consider, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's an impossibility that you saw a unicorn<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			You can't have seen a unicorn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you say so, it must be true<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It is impossible that you saw a unicorn<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I suppose you might have seen a unicorn, but I doubt it<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			You couldn't have seen a unicorn; they don't come round here<br />
			</em>and so on.</p>
			<p>These examples are forms of epistemic modality (i.e., to 
			do with the speaker's view of the truth of a proposition) although 
			the verbs and expressions themselves can be used to express other 
			types of modality.&nbsp; They all express a degree of certainty 
			about the central proposition.</p>

			<h2>4 shades of modality</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>epistemic modality</strong></dt>
				<dd>Epistemology is the study of theories of knowledge and the 
				word <em>epistemic</em> means <em>relating to knowledge</em>.<br />
				This kind of modality is to do with the speaker's perception of 
				the truth or otherwise of a proposition.&nbsp; In the loose 
				traditional terms, it's to do with (im)possibility, 
				(un)likelihood, (un)certainty etc.<br />
				So, for example, 
				on hearing a knock at the door, the use of <em>will</em> in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will be the postman</em><br />
				signals the speaker's certainty about the proposition.<br />
				Equally:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That can't be the postman<br />
				</em>signals the speaker's certainty of untruth and the use of
				<em>might</em> in<em>:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				That might be the postman</em><br />
				signals the speaker's uncertainty.<br />
				Modal auxiliary verbs of deduction fall into this category (<em>should, 
				must, can, ought </em>and more)<em>,</em> as 
				do expressions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that's the postman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't believe that's the postman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you reckon that's the postman?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My feeling is that that's the postman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's impossible that it's the postman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose it's the postman</em><br />
				and so on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>deontic modality</strong></dt>
				<dd>Deontology is the study of duty and <em>deontic</em> means 
				<em>relating to obligation and duty (or its lack)</em>.&nbsp; In 
				the loose traditional terms, it's to do with obligation, lack of 
				obligation, advice, duty, prohibition, necessity etc.<br />
				For example, the use of
				<em>ought to</em> in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You ought to write to your mother<br />
				</em>expresses the speaker's perception that it is the hearer's 
				duty to write and the use of <em>must</em> in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must not write like that<br />
				</em>expresses the speaker's view that the hearer is obliged not 
				to write in that way.<br />
				The use of <em>may</em> in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may go</em><br />
				expresses the speaker's view that there is no longer a duty or 
				obligation to stay.<br />
				Modal auxiliary verbs expressing any sense of obligation or its lack 
				(<em>should, must, can, may, might, ought </em>and more), 
				prohibition 
				and advice fall 
				into this category as do expressions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your mother will be expecting a letter 
				from you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's your duty to write<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing like that is unwise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm telling you not to write like that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go if you like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not necessary to stay</em><br />
				and so on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>dynamic modality</strong></dt>
				<dd>The term <em>dynamic</em> needs no explanation but here it 
				refers to the fact that the modality is centred on the subject 
				and encompasses ability and willingness.&nbsp; 
				In the loose traditional term, it's to do with ability but the 
				willingness aspect is often ignored or put into considerations 
				of talking about the future (where it does not belong and has 
				served to confuse and bewilder generations of learners and, 
				alas, some teachers).<br />
				For example, the use of <em>could</em> in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could swim well as a child<br />
				</em>refers to the subject's own ability and not to externally 
				imposed obligations or duties or any sense of likelihood or 
				impossibility and the use of <em>can</em> in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you understand this?<br />
				</em>refers to the hearer's ability alone and:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll get it for you</em><br />
				refers to the speaker's willingness to do something (volition).&nbsp; 
				It is not, incidentally, a future tense form and does not 
				necessarily refer to the future at all; it is an expression of 
				current willingness to do something.&nbsp; The modal auxiliary 
				verbs expressing ability or willingness (<em>will, would</em> 
				and <em>can </em>mostly) fall into this category 
				as do expressions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the ability to swim well as a child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to swim well as a child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you going to help me with this?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need some help with this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm willing to get it for you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me get it</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				Dynamic modality is sometimes called personal modality because 
				it applies, in most cases, to people's abilities and 
				willingness.</dd>
				<dt><strong>alethic modality</strong></dt>
				<dd>This term derives from the Greek word for <em>truth</em> 
				[<em>αλήθεια, aleethia</em>] and refers to <em>logical necessity </em>(rather than 
				deduction which concerns epistemic modality).&nbsp; For example, the use of <em>must</em> in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A square must have four sides<br />
				</em>refers not to the speaker's perception and not to any form 
				of obligation, ability or deduction but to the fact that one of the 
				necessary conditions of being a square is to have four sides and 
				the use of <em>can't</em> in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parallel lines can't meet</em><br />
				equally represents the truth of a proposition, failing which the 
				lines cannot be parallel.&nbsp; A few modal auxiliary verbs&nbsp; 
				(<em>must, can't, will, mustn't
				</em>and <em>need</em> mostly) fall 
				into this category as does the present simple tense form of the verb 
				and other expressions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A defining characteristic of squares is 
				that they have four equal sides<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lines which are parallel never meet<br />
				</em>In a sense, this form of modality is the odd one out 
				because it does not rely on the speaker's view of an event or 
				state.&nbsp; Alethic modality is concerned with what is 
				universally true in 
				all cases independent of the setting.</dd>

			<p>This area of study is infested with a menagerie of terminology, 
			some of which is concerned with quite subtle levels of analysis.<br />
			So, if you come across alternative expressions, here's a very short 
			guide:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Epistemic modality is often singled out as being views of 
				the truth based solely on the evidence available to the speaker 
				and separated in that way from alethic modality which is not 
				contingent on the speaker's setting but expresses truths in all 
				possible worlds.&nbsp; We make a distinction between the two 
				types here, too, but should bear in mind that they overlap 
				slightly so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This must be the answer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That can't be right</em><br />
				can express the speaker's certainty that it is correct or not or 
				that the truth is an inevitable outcome of the laws of 
				mathematics depending on the situation referred to.<br />
				Epistemic modality is sometimes further broken down, e.g., by 
				Palmer, 2001, into:<ul class="smallbluebullet">
					<li>judgemental or speculative modality: referring to the 
					speaker's judgement or understanding.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that's too much<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That might not be enough</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>deductive or evidential modality: referring to the 
					speaker's view as influenced by evidence.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might rain later<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's going to be a difficult job</em></li>
					<li>assumptive modality: expressing the speaker's view of 
					the truth based on previous experience.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She'll be at work at this time of the 
					morning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't call now.&nbsp; They'll be having dinner.</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Deontic modality is sometimes distinguished from or broken 
				down further as:<ul class="smallbluebullet">
					<li>boulemic modality: that which is necessary given a person's wants and 
				desires.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must go now and get something to eat<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must not stay if you have work to do<br />
					</em>etc<em>.</em></li>
					<li>jussive modality: an obligation placed on a third 
				person.&nbsp; The jussive mood is also used in some languages 
				with a distinctive verb form to express wishes about the actions 
				of a third person.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He really should try to be more 
					patient with the children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary has to be the one to do it<br />
					</em>etc.</li>
					<li>commissive modality: an obligation placed on the speaker 
					by the speaker.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will pay tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll get it done; promise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to thank you</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>imperative or directive modality: an obligation placed 
					on the hearer.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should get some rest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has to be done before we can go</em></li>
					<li>teleological modality: that which is necessary to 
				achieve an aim as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to get into university you need to study hard<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must leave now or we'll miss the train</em><br />This form of modality is often expressed with conditional 
				structures as above.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Dynamic modality is often referred to as <strong>ability or personal modality</strong> 
				(because that is what is mostly concerns).&nbsp; That is not 
				compatible with the view taken in these sections of the site 
				because we also consider expressions of willingness as falling 
				into this category.</li>
				<li>Alethic modality is sometimes referred to as <strong>circumstantial 
				modality</strong> because it derives from the circumstances of the 
				universe and expresses universal truths (which epistemic 
				modality does not).&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paper will spontaneously ignite at 233° C</em><br />
				which is true wherever you are and not dependent on when or 
				where you state it.<br />
				For obscure reasons, you may also see this type of modality 
				described as root modality but not on this site.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For teaching purposes and for the analysis of language for 
			planning, these subtleties are probably unnecessary, although some languages 
			deal with the categories differently, using a variety of means, 
			often the subjunctive or other forms of verbs.&nbsp; However, if you 
			are interested in the philosophy of language, they have some 
			utility.<br />
			That said, for single lessons, it is often wise to take just one or 
			two sub-sections of the main types of epistemic and deontic modality 
			to keep the focus and help learners acquire the concepts.&nbsp; It 
			also makes some sense to handle volition and ability separately when 
			considering dynamic modality.</p>

			<p>On many training courses, attention is given to what are, rather 
			loosely called modal verbs or, even more loosely, just modals.&nbsp; The 
			most obvious problem is that there is little consistency in the 
			literature (or in teachers rooms) concerning what should be analysed 
			as what.</p>
			<p>Elsewhere on this site, ten pure modal auxiliary verbs are 
			recognised:<br />
		<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can | could | may | 
			might | must | shall | should | will | would| ought to</strong></span><br />
			and the expression <em>had better</em>
			can be added to that list because it behaves much like a central 
			modal auxiliary verb.<br />
			In addition, there are some less pure verbs such as<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be able | be 
			going |</strong></span>
			<span class="style_black"><strong>have |</strong></span><br />
			along with semi-modal auxiliary verbs including<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need | used 
			| dare</strong></span><br />
			Added to the mix are marginal modal auxiliary verbs such as<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; be supposed | tend | 
			care</strong></span><br />
			and many more.<br />
			Other lexical or main verbs such as<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; let | prohibit | ban | 
			forbid | allow | follow | mean | involve</strong></span><br />
			and so on also express modality of one kind or another (sometimes 
			more than one).</p>
			<p>All these verbs are considered on this site and can be tracked 
			down from the general index of modality linked in the list at the 
			end.</p>

			<p>The verb <em>need </em>can also imply alethic modality as in,

			negated in standard English as <em>can't</em> or <em>couldn't</em> 
			(as it is for epistemic modality).&nbsp; In some dialect forms, 
			however, <em>mustn't</em> is used to express impossibility rather 
			than negative obligation.&nbsp; So we can encounter:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That mustn't be the right number</em><br />
			which for most speakers suggests deontic modality, instead of the 
			standard:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That can't be the right number</em><br />
			The verb <em>can</em> is not used in the positive for this meaning 
			as it implies epistemic, deontic or dynamic modality in that form.<br />
			The verb <em>need</em> is somewhat rarer in this sense but does 
			occur in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The temperature needs to be over 40&deg;C for this 
			to work<br />
			</em>It is not used in the negative in this sense.</p>
			<p>It is also quite rare for alethic modality to be expressed in the 
			past because, obviously, it usually refers to timeless facts which 
			are independent of the speaker's existence.&nbsp; 
			It is occasionally encountered when a fact has been superseded and 
			is no longer true, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time a battle had to be fought on foot.</em><br />
			in such cases, the normal rule of replacing <em>must</em> with <em>
			have to</em> and <em>can't</em> with <em>couldn't</em> applies.<br />
			However, the verb <em>need</em> is not negated in the past when it 
			is used to express alethic modality, so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time armies needed to move solely on foot</em><br />
			cannot be negated as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time armies didn't need to move solely on foot</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time armies needn't have moved solely 
			on foot</em><br />
			because that implies a lack of obligation rather than a negative 
			fact.</p>
			<p>The guide to expressing degrees 
			of likelihood, linked below, includes considerations of alethic modality and 
			considers the overlap between it and epistemic modality.</p>

			<p>It is possible, in all languages, to combine modalities in single 
			utterances such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She should be able to do that </em>
			(combining epistemic and dynamic modalities)<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They may have to see a doctor </em>(combining epistemic and 
			deontic modalities)<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter might be allowed to go home early</em> (combining 
			epistemic and deontic modalities)<br />
			and so on.<br />
			The issue in English in particular is that the rules of the 
			language's syntax do not allow the co-occurrence of pure or central modal 
			auxiliary verbs so we cannot have, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She must can come with us</em><br />
			as we may in many other languages.<br />
			There are a number of workarounds for this problem in English which 
			are discussed in the guide to multiple modalities, linked below, and 
			many concern the use of semi- and marginal-modal verbs as well as 
			modal nouns, lexical or main verbs, adjectives and adverbs.</p>

					<h2>Entailment</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is a term dealt with in more detail in the guide on this 
			site to pragmatics, linked below, and it follows on from ideas of 
			multiple modalities.</p>
			<p>Entailment concerns the understanding of truth and therefore 
			falls into the realm of epistemic modality so, for example, if 
			someone proposes:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John saw a kangaroo while he was on holiday 
			in Australia</em><br />
			Then we know not only that the statement appears to be true but also 
			that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>It is possible to see kangaroos in Australia </em>
				(epistemic modality)</li>
				<li><em>John must have been in Australia </em>(epistemic modality)</li>
				<li><em>John was certainly on holiday </em>(epistemic modality)</li>
				<li><em>Kangaroos are visible </em>(alethic modality)</li>
				<li><em>John must be able to see</em> (epistemic and dynamic modality)<br />
				but not</li>
				<li><em>John was certainly not in Australia</em></li>
				<li><em>There are no kangaroos in Australia</em></li>
				<li><em>John cannot see</em></li>
				<li><em>Kangaroos must be invisible</em></li>
				<li><em>John never has a holiday</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The last five propositions are automatically disallowed by the 
			proposition we began with and are not expressive of any form of 
			modality but the first five are entailed in the comment.</p>
			<p>In terms of modality, entailment is a useful concept because, for 
			example:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>I can help with that</em><br />
				is probably an example of dynamic modality expressing 
				willingness, but it also entails another form of dynamic 
				modality expressing ability.&nbsp; It may, in fact, be an 
				example of an expression of ability but it is unlikely to be 
				said if that, too, did not entail an expression of willingness 
				(otherwise, why say it?).&nbsp; One of the rules of speech 
				identified by Grice is that we do not normally over inform and 
				if this comment does not entail an expression either of 
				willingness or ability, it would break that maxim.</li>
				<li><em>You should write to your mother soon</em><br />
				is clearly an example of deontic modality, expressing the 
				speaker's view that an action is advisable but it also entails 
				dynamic modality because it would not be said if the speaker did 
				not believe the hearer was able to write to her mother.</li>
				<li><em>God could make a kangaroo with three tails but he 
				couldn't make a triangle with four sides</em><br />
				is clearly a comment concerning dynamic modality (positive and 
				negative ability) but there is an entailed alethic modality 
				embedded in the comment because we know that a triangle must 
				have three and only three sides.</li>
				<li><em>I'll buy some petrol so I can use the mower this 
				afternoon</em><br />
				is a statement of commissive deontic modality with an obligation 
				put by the speaker on the speaker but there is also an 
				entailment of epistemic modality concerning the speaker's view 
				that the mower will not function unless petrol is supplied and 
				there is a further sense of dynamic modality concerning the 
				speaker's expression of ability.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Modality is not simple.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>In some analyses, the modal auxiliary verb <em>must</em> is classified 
				as representing intrinsic or even (mistakenly) dynamic modality because it is 
				seen as personal to the speaker rather than an externally 
				imposed duty and <em>have to</em> appears under 
				extrinsic deontic modality because, the theory has it, it 
				expresses an externally imposed duty.&nbsp; However, 
				where it is not obvious which is intended, native speakers use 
				them in free variation.<br />
				It is also the case that it is difficult to separate the 
				external from the internal so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a toothache and have to go to the 
				dentist</em><br />
				can just as well be expressed as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a toothache and must go to the 
				dentist</em><br />
				because it is unclear whether a toothache represents an internal 
				or external phenomenon.</li>
				<li>The strength of both deontic and epistemic modality is often 
				determined by intonation and stress rather than depending on the 
				modal expression chosen by the speaker.</li>
				<li>In this analysis, logical deduction and logical necessity 
				are distinguished (as epistemic and alethic modalities) but, for 
				most teaching purposes, can be conflated.</li>
				<li>Teaching modal expressions using this kind of analysis 
				presumes that you start from the type of modality your learners 
				need to express and work on a limited range of ways to realise 
				the mental processes in English.<br />
				There is a guide on this site, linked below, to teaching modality.</li>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Here's a summary with examples using pure (or central) modal 
			auxiliary verbs only.&nbsp; Semi-modal auxiliary verbs and marginal modal 
			auxiliary verbs can also express different types of modality.&nbsp; All four 
			types of modality can also be expressed without modal auxiliary 
			verbs at all.<br />
			For teaching purposes, the summary is useful because you can see at 
			a glance whether the lesson you planned mixes the same verb 
			expressing different forms of modality.&nbsp; That can confuse, 
			especially at lower levels.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="examples and summary" height="592" src="../../imagesgraphics/modality_examples.png" width="620" />&nbsp;</p>

			Here's another summary which contains a few of the other 
			sub-categories you may encounter along with some examples as an <em>aide 
			memoire</em>.<br />

			<img alt="overall" height="577" src="../../imagesgraphics/modality_overall.png" width="775" /></p>
			<p>
			And here is a final set of examples to show five ways in which the 
			four types of modality are commonly achieved in English.&nbsp; It's 
			not complete and there are more examples in the guides linked at the 
			end.&nbsp; In particular, the guide to modality without modal 
			auxiliary verbs has many more examples of other ways to realise 
			modal ideas.</p>
