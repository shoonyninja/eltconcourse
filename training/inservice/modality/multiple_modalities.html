			<h1>Multiple modalities</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="3" height="207" src="../../images/three_women_pose310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>One of the defining characteristics of central modal auxiliary 
			verbs is that, in standard varieties of English, the verbs cannot 
			co-occur.&nbsp; We do not, therefore, allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She can must do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *John could might allow it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The president can't may have the answer</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			This means that when we use central modal verbs to express various 
			types of modality we are confined, in standard varieties of English, 
			to one form of modality at a time.&nbsp; So, for example, if we want 
			to express a range of permissibility, from obligatory to forbidden 
			(deontic modality), 
			we can do so using modal auxiliary verbs and we can also express 
			degrees of likelihood (epistemic modality) and willingness or ability 
			(dynamic modality) in the same way.&nbsp; 
			However, we cannot combine deontic, dynamic and epistemic modality 
			through the use of central modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; We only allow, therefore, 
			for example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Deontic modality (degrees of permissibility)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must fill in this form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She should get herself a new laptop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't go yet</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Epistemic modality (degrees of likelihood)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That must be her brother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She should be here soon if she caught the right train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may be a bit late tomorrow because I I'm going for a drink</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Dynamic modality (degrees of willingness and ability)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can help with that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She won't help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could speak French when he was a child</em><br />
				etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and, as we saw above, no combination of different sorts of 
			modality can be achieved with any central modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; 
			On this site, those verbs are identified as:<br />
		<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can | could | may | might 
		| must | shall | should | will | would | ought</strong></span><br />and 
			we also included <span class="style_black"><strong>had better</strong></span> 
			because it acts in a similar way.<br />
			In the guide to central modal auxiliary verbs (linked below), 
			incidentally, the analysis identified nine other defining 
			characteristics but they do not concern us here.</p>
			<p>There is a fourth form of modality which refers to the inevitable 
			truth of a proposition because of the way the universe works, 
			alethic modality, but, because the reference is to a universal, 
			context-independent truth, it is not combined with other forms of 
			modality.&nbsp; We cannot allow, therefore,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A rectangle could have to have four sides</em><br />
			because it makes no sense.</p>
			<p>If the terms deontic, epistemic and dynamic modality are obscure 
			to you, you could follow the general guide to types of modality, 
			linked below.&nbsp; What is said above, however, is enough for the 
			purposes of this guide.</p>
			<p>We have been careful to note that we are talking about standard 
			varieties of English in terms of the non-co-occurrence of central modal 
			auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; In many dialects of the language, not least 
			Southern USA usage, central modal auxiliary verbs often co-occur so 
			we may encounter, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He should ought to be here</em><br />
			and so on.</p>
			<p>In very casual speech, too, it is often observable that speakers 
			of English are searching for a way to combine modalities so it is 
			not impossible to encounter something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if the boss demands it, I might 
			must be there</em><br />
			but this is non-standard and unlikely to be encountered in writing 
			or more careful speech.</p>

			</table>
			<p>There are times when we need to combine types of 
			modality to make our point clear so it is possible that we want to 
			express something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a possibility that he will want to 
			have the ability to change the ticket</em><br />
			but we cannot express the thought using central modal auxiliary 
			verbs because:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He may will can change the ticket</em><br />
			is obviously not allowed.</p>
			<p>This restriction does not apply universally across languages, in 
			fact, and many do allow multiple uses of equivalent verbs in single 
			clauses.&nbsp; For example, the forbidden<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He must can come</em><br />
			in English, can be translated as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Han måste kunna komma</em> (in Swedish)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Er muss kommen können </em>(in German)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Il doit pouvoir venir </em>(in French)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Debe poder venir</em> (in Spanish)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Musí být schopen přijít </em>(in Czech)<br />
			and so on and in all these cases there is a co-occurrence of modal 
			auxiliary verbs.<br />
			Learners from language backgrounds that allow the co-occurrence of 
			modal auxiliary verbs may be confused and frustrated by the 
			irregular nature of what is and is not allowed in English.&nbsp; 
			That, of course, is a source of error because the temptation will 
			often be 
			to translate directly.</p>

			<p>All human languages are capable of expressing all human thoughts 
			so it is not surprising that English can express combinations of 
			types of modality perfectly adequately.<br />
			How it does that is a confusing mishmash of forms, however, and the 
			root of much difficulty for learners at all levels.</p>

			<p>We can combine expressions of likelihood and permissibility in 
			these ways, the first two of which are the generally preferred 
			routes and should be taught first.&nbsp; English happens to have a 
			non-defective form for obligation <em>(have to, don't have to, 
			haven't to</em>) so the following are possibilities:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Central modal auxiliary verb plus semi- or marginal-modal 
				auxiliary verb<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John might be let go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may be needed to work tonight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might be supposed to do the work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may need to be done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They might have to get a new one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could have had to take a bus</em></li>
				<li>Central modal auxiliary verb plus a lexical or main verb<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John must be forced to do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They might be told to come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They could be allowed to leave early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I doubt she may be allowed in</em></li>
				<li>Central modal auxiliary verb plus modal noun<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That could be an obligation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She might have that duty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a possibility I must be there</em></li>
				<li>Central modal auxiliary verb plus a modal adverb or 
				adjective<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's inevitable she must earn more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might be compulsory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That could be permissible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That might be obligatorily done</em></li>

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Combination 2: epistemic and dynamic</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>English also happens to have a simple modal adjective 
			form connected to its subject by the copula or a pseudo-copula: <em>able to, become unable to</em> 
			etc.&nbsp; The combination is also describable as a marginal modal 
			form and is so identified in the guide to semi- and marginal modal 
			auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; It is often used to combine the types of modality like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Central modal auxiliary verb plus semi- or marginal-modal 
				auxiliary verb<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John should be able to do it in time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may be unable to help tonight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might not be able to understand him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They might not have been able to get a seat<br />
				</em>An alternative analysis here is that the structure is 
				simpler: a modal auxiliary verb plus a copular verb and a predicative adjective,
				<em>able / unable</em>.</li>
				<li>Central modal auxiliary verb plus a lexical or main verb<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John might succeed in doing that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That may work well<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They could manage the issue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can imagine that she intended to go</em></li>
				<li>Central modal auxiliary verb plus modal noun<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That could be a success<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She may have had some ability<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a certainty that Mary can help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She might have shown some willingness</em></li>
				<li>Central modal auxiliary verb plus a modal adverb or 
				adjective<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She must be capable of doing the work this week<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might be doable<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That could be possible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John could be willing to see her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That might be successfully done</em></li>
			</ol>

			</table>
			<p>It is here that a good deal of ambiguity arises in English 
			because the modal auxiliary verbs used to express deontic modality 
			(permissibility) and epistemic modality (likelihood) are often the 
			same so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could have left my keys with John</em><br />
			means either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might have left my keys with John</em> 
			(epistemic modality referring to a possibility)<br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was allowed to leave my keys with John</em> 
			(deontic modality referring to permission)<br />
			The combinations are possible, of course, but we need some co-text 
			and context to disambiguate the forms.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Central modal auxiliary verb plus semi- or marginal-modal 
				auxiliary verb (or the adjective<em> (un)able</em>)<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John should be able to do it in time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary should be willing to help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They must be able to help tonight<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They w<span class="auto-style37">on't </span>have been able

				<li>Central modal auxiliary verb plus a lexical or main verb<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John must get it done<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She must succeed<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They ought to manage the issue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't do it</em> <em>again</em></li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ought to have had more ability<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a certainty that Mary ca<span class="auto-style37">n</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She may show some willingness</em></li>
				<li>Central modal auxiliary verb plus a modal adverb or

				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She must be capable of doing the work this week<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be doable<br />

			<p>We see above that semi-modal auxiliary forms are frequently 
			combined with other semi- and central modal auxiliary verbs to make 
			meanings which combine two types of modality.&nbsp; On this site, 
			semi-modal auxiliary verbs are identified as <em>dare, need, have 
			(to) </em>and <em>used (to)</em>.&nbsp; To that list, for our 
			purposes here, we can add <em>be able (to)</em> because it, too, can 
			function in multiple modal utterances.</p>
			<p>These semi-modal verbs are often used to combine modalities as 
			in, e.g.:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><em>She might not dare to ask</em><br />
				combining epistemic with dynamic modality</li>
				<li class="bluebullet"><em>I used to be able to speak Italian</em><br />
				combining dynamic modality with past habit</li>
				<li><em>They used to have to get the 
				water from a well</em><br />
				combining deontic modality with past habit</li>
				<li><em>She has to be able to help</em><br />

			<p>Combining types of modality is, as we see above, not a simple 
			matter in English and we also noted above that other languages are 
			far more forgiving than English in this respect.&nbsp; The fact that 
			English does not permit the co-occurrence of a range of central and 
			other modal auxiliary verbs causes some difficulty because learners 
			from many language backgrounds can see no logical reason why:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He had to could be there</em><br />
			is not allowed.<br />
			This is, therefore, not an area with which we need to trouble 
			lower-level learners but it is one which needs tackling at higher 
			levels where more sophistication is needed.</p>
			<p>Comprehension is always a good beginning in this area because 
			learners may not notice that some sentences contain multiple modal 
			meanings unless their attention is explicitly drawn to the 
			phenomena.&nbsp; Here's one way of doing that:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style41" colspan="3">Draw lines to connect 
					the meanings on the left with the meanings on the right.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" style="width: 200px">She must<br />
					She can</td>
					<td class="auto-style39" rowspan="4">&nbsp;</td>
					<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 200px">She ought to 
					be willing to help</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" style="width: 200px">She should<br />
					She will</td>
					<td class="auto-style42" style="width: 200px">They may be 
					able to help</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" style="width: 200px">I will<br />
					I should</td>
					<td class="auto-style42" style="width: 200px">She has to be 
					able to help</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style7" style="width: 200px">They may<br />
					The can</td>
					<td class="auto-style43" style="width: 200px">I should be 
					willing to help</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>and so on.</p>
			<p>We can start from more simple forms and work our way up.&nbsp; 
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style41" colspan="2">In English, the forms 
					of the left are all wrong (but they may be possible in your 
					language).<br />
					How can you rephrase them in correct English and keep the 
					same sense?<br />
					The first one is an example.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" style="width: 252px">He must can 
					leave soon</td>
					<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 252px">He must be 
					able to leave soon</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" style="width: 252px">She should can 
					go</td>
					<td class="auto-style42" style="width: 252px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" style="width: 252px">They may can't 
					do it</td>
					<td class="auto-style42" style="width: 252px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style7" style="width: 252px">The had to 
					could help</td>
					<td class="auto-style43" style="width: 252px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>and so on.</p>
			<p>When we get really sophisticated, we can begin to introduce some 
			of the less common and more formal ways to combine modality using 
			other, non-modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; As in, e.g.:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style41" colspan="2">Rephrase the sentences 
					on the left using modal auxiliary verbs where possible.<br />
					The first one is an example.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" style="width: 228px">She is obliged 
					to learn to do this</td>
					<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 228px">She must 
					become able to do this</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" style="width: 228px">It is possible 
					they might be allowed to go home</td>
					<td class="auto-style42" style="width: 228px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" style="width: 228px">It is unlikely 
					she has the strength to lift it</td>
					<td class="auto-style42" style="width: 228px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style7" style="width: 228px">It is probable 
					that he is obliged to be late</td>
					<td class="auto-style43" style="width: 228px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Now try doing this the other way around.</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style41" colspan="2">Rephrase the sentences 
					on the left using modal nouns, adjectives and adverbs but
					<strong>not</strong> modal auxiliary verbs.<br />
					The first one is an example.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" style="width: 228px">She must become 
					able to do this</td>
					<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 228px">She is obliged 
					to learn to do this</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" style="width: 228px">We might be 
					able to ask questions at the end</td>
					<td class="auto-style42" style="width: 228px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style5" style="width: 228px">They can't have 
					to leave yet, can they?</td>
					<td class="auto-style42" style="width: 228px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style7" style="width: 228px">She used to 
					have to be at work at seven</td>
					<td class="auto-style43" style="width: 228px">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>and so on.</p>
			<p>Communicatively, the area is more challenging but some kind of 
			simulated communicative events can be set up for freer practice such 
			as, e.g.:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Decide together on the abilities that someone applying for a job as a 
				sales assistant / computer game designer / gardener etc. needs 
				and discuss them with another pair to see if you have the same 
				ideas.<br />
				Start from:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This person will have to be able to ...</em></li>
				<li>Think about three obligations that lie in the future for 
				you.&nbsp; Tell your partner(s) about them.<br />
				Start from:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>By the end of this year / term / decade / century etc., I 
				might have to be able to ...</em></li>
				<li>My mother is 95 years old.&nbsp; Think about the things she 
				was able to do once that she can't do now and see if you have 
				the same list as another pair.<br />
				Start with:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mother used to be able to ...</em></li>
				<li>All schools have rules.&nbsp; What were the rules in your 
				school?&nbsp; Tell your partner about them.<br />
				Start with:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we were at school, we used to have to ... and we weren't 
				allowed to ... but we didn't have to ...</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Many other scenarios are possible of course.</p>
