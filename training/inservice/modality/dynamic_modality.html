			<h1>Dynamic modality: expressing ability and willingness</h1>

			<p>The word dynamic derives from the Greek <em>dynamikos</em> 
			meaning strong or powerful.&nbsp; In English it has been defined as:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">having a lot of ideas and enthusiasm; 
			energetic and forceful<br />
			<span class="auto-style56">(Cambridge International Dictionary of 
			English, 1995:434)</span></p>
			<p>Linguistically, we need to be a bit more exact and define this 
			form of modality as that which expresses ability or requirement of 
			the subject to do something.&nbsp; It is non-subjective insofar as 
			it refers to fact rather than likelihood or obligation (which are 
			expressed <em>via</em> epistemic and deontic modality respectively).</p>
			<p>You may find dynamic modality referred to as <strong>personal 
			modality</strong> because it refers to individuals and their ability 
			or willingness to do something.&nbsp; We don't use that term in this 
			guide because dynamic modality may not, in fact, always refer to an 
			individual, although it usually does, but it is an alternative.</p>
			<p>Dynamic modality is one of the usual four categories of modality 
			(the others being epistemic, deontic and alethic to which there are 
			separate guides).<br />
			If these terms are mysterious to you, you should follow
			<a href="types_of_modality.html">the guide to types of modality</a> 
			before tackling what follows.<br />
			There is, in fact, an argument that dynamic modality is not actually 
			a form of modality at all because the speaker / writer is not:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style41">
				<li>using a modal expression to express an opinion regarding the 
				truthfulness or necessity of an event, state or action<br />
				OR</li>
				<li>affecting the current situation by what is said</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For example, with the modal auxiliary verb <em>can</em>, four 
			clear types of modality can be expressed:</p>
			<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style58">Example</td>
					<td class="auto-style57">Type of modality expressed</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style60"><em>You can go now</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style62">Deontic: giving permission / 
					removing the obligation to stay</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style60"><em>It can't be a rectangle if it 
					has five sides</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style62">Alethic: expressing a factual state 
					(also, arguably, not really a modal use at all)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style60"><em>That can't be the right answer</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style62">Epistemic: expressing the speaker's 
					view of the truth of a proposition</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style63"><em>She can play the piano very 
					well</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style59">Dynamic: stating a simple fact 
					about ability</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Traditionally, following Palmer (2001) only the modal auxiliary 
			verbs <em>can/could</em> and <em>will/would</em> express dynamic modality, i.e., 
			express ability or willingness.<br />
			There are other ways to express the same notions, of course, and the 
			grammar that is involved is not as straightforward as it might seem.<br />
			The following is an analysis which is focused on teaching the 
			concepts and notions.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="willing" height="166" src="../../images/woman_proud250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style22">
					<h2>Expressing willingness</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Both <em>will</em> and <em>can</em> are used to express the 
			notion of willingness as in, for example:</p>
			<ol >
				<li><em>Jane will drive you to the station if you like</em></li>
				<li><em>Jane can drive you to the station if you like</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Functionally, these two utterances are identical: they both 
			express the subject's (<em>Jane's</em>) willingness to do something 
			and do not express the speaker's view of any existing obligation or 
			its lack or any comment concerning the truthfulness of a 
			proposition.</p>
			<p>There is, however, a difference in sense:<br />
			Sentence 1. concerns willingness alone but sentence 2. may be 
			construed to suggest that not only is Jane willing to drive you to 
			the station but that she is also able to do so (because, e.g., she 
			has no other outstanding commitments).<br />
			The differences become clearer when set in a dialogue:</p>
			<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style44">Fred:</td>
					<td class="auto-style47"><em>Jane will drive you to the 
					station if you like</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style44">Fred is stating that he understands 
					that Jane is willing to do this</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style45">Jane:</td>
					<td class="auto-style48"><em>Sure, no problem</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style45">Jane is confirming her willingness</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style44">OR</td>
					<td class="auto-style47">&nbsp;</td>
					<td class="auto-style44">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style45">Jane:</td>
					<td class="auto-style48"><em>Sorry, I won't drive in the 
					dark</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style45">Jane is stating her unwillingness</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style46">&nbsp;</td>
					<td class="auto-style49">&nbsp;</td>
					<td class="auto-style46">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style44">Fred:</td>
					<td class="auto-style47"><em>Jane can drive you to the 
					station if you like</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style44">Fred is stating that he understands 
					that Jane is willing to do this</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style45">Jane:</td>
					<td class="auto-style48"><em>Sure, no problem</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style45">Jane is confirming her willingness</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style44">OR</td>
					<td class="auto-style47">&nbsp;</td>
					<td class="auto-style44">&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Jane:</td>
					<td class="style_black"><em>Sorry, I've got to take the kids 
					to school</em></td>
					<td>Now she is stating her <strong>inability</strong> rather 
					than her <strong>unwillingness</strong></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The border between the notions of willingness and ability is 
			blurred in English because we can express both functions with the 
			same modal auxiliary, <em>can/could</em>, with no change to the 
			intonation.<br />
			An example of this is a statement such as:<br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I can help you with 
			your homework</em></span><br />
			in which it is unclear (without a very explicit context) whether the 
			speaker is stating an ability or a willingness to do something.&nbsp; 
			It can mean, therefore, either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am able to help you with your homework</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am willing to help you with your homework<br />
			</em>The same ambiguity occurs with the interrogative forms:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you help me 
			with my homework?</em></span><br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you help me 
			with my homework?</em></span><br />
			in which the questioner may be referring to the hearer's ability or 
			willingness.</p>
			<p>With the negative form, this ambiguity mostly disappears because:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't help you 
			with your homework</em></span><br />
			implies inability rather than unwillingness as does:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't help her</em></span><br />
			In order to state unwillingness, we have to use the modal auxiliary
			<em>will</em>:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't help you 
			with your homework<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wouldn't help her with her homework</em></span></p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				</table>
			<p>Much confusion can be avoided if the verb <em>will</em> is 
			considered polysemous (i.e., having two or more meanings).&nbsp; 
			In English the verb can, among other things, express</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Futurity </strong>(a non-modal use) as in, e.g.:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li><em>I'll be 50 tomorrow</em></li>
					<li><em>The train will arrive at platform 6</em></li>
					<li><em>When will the train arrive?</em></li>
					<li><em>I won't see him tomorrow</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Certainty or likelihood</strong> (epistemic modality) as in, e.g.:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li><em>That'll be the postman</em></li>
					<li><em>This'll be a long job</em></li>
					<li><em>This won't take long</em></li>
					<li><em>Will it rain?</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Willingness</strong> (a dynamic modal use) as in, e.g.:<ol class="greybullet">
					<li><em>I'll help you</em></li>
					<li><em>She'll read you a story</em></li>
					<li><em>Will you marry me?</em></li>
					<li><em>She won't tell me the truth</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We are only concerned with the last of these here.&nbsp; These 
			meanings are quite different and mixing up examples of the 
			three functions in the same classroom presentation can bewilder 
			learners unnecessarily.</p>
			<p>The situation is similar with the verb in the past, <em>would</em>.&nbsp; 
			It can, among other functions, signify:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Distancing and politeness</strong><ol class="greybullet">
					<li>Choosing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Would you help?</em><br />
					over<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Will you help?</em><br />
					or choosing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>If I give you the money will you buy it for me?</em><br />
					over<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> If I give you the money would you buy it for me?</em><br />
					implies greater politeness and tentativeness although both 
					refer to current willingness</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Indirect speech</strong><ol>
					<li class="greybullet">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I'll do 
					that for you</em><br />
					is reported (at another place and time) as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She said she would do it for me</em><br />
					but both refer to her willingness</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>The habitual aspect</strong><ol>
					<li class="greybullet"><em>He would often complain</em><br />expresses a habitual or repeated action and is not to do with 
				(un)willingness at all.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>

			<p>Because the verb <em>will / would</em> is polysemous (i.e., 
			having more than one connected meaning), there is scope for 
			ambiguity to arise.<br />
			For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you marry me?</em><br />
			there is no ambiguity because the speaker is clearly referring not 
			to ability but to willingness but in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will he marry her?</em><br />
			the speaker may be referring to the future likelihood of him 
			marrying her or to his willingness one way or the other.&nbsp; 
			Without a context, we cannot know.<br />
			And in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would be rude to her</em><br />
			the speaker may be referring to habitual actions, futurity in the 
			past or to the likelihood that he may choose to be rude in the 
			future.&nbsp; We cannot know without context.</p>

			<p>The verb <em>can</em> is often the first modal auxiliary verb, 
			along with <em>must</em>, that learners encounter in English.&nbsp; 
			It expresses a simple and fundamental concept and is, in the present 
			tense at least, uncomplicated so we have, simply:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>She can do that</em></li>
				<li><em>She can't do that</em></li>
				<li><em>Can you do that?</em></li>
				<li><em>Can't you do that?</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the present tense, all these instances of <em>can</em> are 
			replaceable with a copular verb (usually <em>be</em>) and the 
			adjective <em>able</em> plus <em>to</em>:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>She is able to do that</em></li>
				<li><em>She isn't able to do that</em></li>
				<li><em>Are you able to do that?</em></li>
				<li><em>Aren't you able to do that?</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>although the use of the <em>able-to</em> formulation is less 
			common and more formal.&nbsp; When no difference in meaning exists, 
			English speakers will usually prefer the modal auxiliary.<br />
			Other copular verbs make subtle changes to the meaning but the sense 
			remains:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>She seems able to do that</em></li>
				<li><em>She doesn't appear able to do that</em></li>
				<li><em>She ended up able to do that</em></li>
				<li><em>Did she prove able to do that?</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>That this formulation is analysable, and teachable, as <strong>
			copular verb phrase + adjective phrase + </strong><em><strong>to-infinitive</strong></em><strong> 
			verb phrase</strong> (plus the object if any) is revealed by the parallel forms such as:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>I am happy to do that </em>(expressing willingness)</li>
				<li><em>She is reluctant to do that</em> (expressing 
				unwillingness)</li>
				<li><em>She is wholly unable to swim</em> (expressing inability)</li>
				<li><em>Isn't she required to be here</em> (expressing 
				a lack of obligation)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.</p>
			<p>So common is the concept that the verb <em>can</em> is often directly 
			translatable into a range of languages and so fundamental is it that 
			many languages simply attach a prefix or suffix to the verb to 
			express the concept.<br />
			English is, however, unusual in that <em>can</em> is defective, and 
			has no future form at all and only a restricted past form, <em>
			could.&nbsp; </em>The use of the adjective in <em>be able to</em> is 
			the workaround in English so we get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were you able to see the doctor?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't be able to come tomorrow</em><br />
			etc.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*He could say the word in French<br />

			<p>In the past, the perfect form of <em>could</em> implies an 
			unfulfilled ability but the <em>was / were able </em>to formulation 
			implies a fulfilled ability.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>I could have spoken to her on the phone</em><br />
				refers to the fact that I was able to do so but didn't for some 
				reason (it may also mean that I consider it possible but have no 
				recollection of doing so but that is epistemic modality and does 
				not concern us here)</li>
				<li><em>I was able to speak to her on the phone</em><br />
				refers to the ability and to the fact that I did speak to her</li>
				<li><em>Could they have talked to her?</em> / <em>Couldn't they 
				have talked to her?</em><br />
				both refer to whether they had the opportunity and the ability 
				but assumes that they did not talk to her</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the negative, <em>could have</em> usually refers to 
			possibility, rarely to ability, so it is not easily usable for 
			dynamic modality.&nbsp; The statement:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>They couldn't have talked to her</em><br />
				can only express epistemic modality (i.e., that it was 
				impossible)</li>
				<li class="greybullet">but:<br /><em>I couldn't have driven any faster</em><br />
				does express ability and is often followed by 
				something like <em>(even) if I'd tried</em></li>

			<p>Because of the ambiguities which are rife with the two modal 
			auxiliary verbs we have discussed, especially in positive clauses, 
			whenever there is a need to disambiguate what is meant, native 
			speakers will often resort to non-modal-verb ways to express the 
			concepts of dynamic modality and (un)willingness or (in)ability.<br />
			There is a guide, linked below to non-modal-verb modality which 
			contains more detail.&nbsp; Here some examples will suffice:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Expressing willingness:<ol class="redbullet">
					<li>Verbs<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is offering to help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are proposing to give us a hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I refuse to help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want to come<br />
					</em>etc.</li>
					<li>Adjectives<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am willing to help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is keen to come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was eager to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are reluctant to interfere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am loath to ask<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is half-hearted about doing it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am delighted to help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is happy to lend us the money</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They are averse to eating out</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>Adverbs<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They came willingly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He accepted eagerly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived reluctantly</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>Nouns<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He showed little commitment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eagerness to meet him was obvious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His reluctance to come was clear</em><br />
					etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Expressing ability:<ol class="redbullet">
					<li>Verbs<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was able to come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They achieved the success they wanted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She failed to win the prize<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I managed to do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It worked!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He succeeded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They persuaded me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It demonstrated its value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They attained the goal</em><br />

					<li>Adjectives<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was ineffective<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a fruitful meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a productive idea</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>Adverbs<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He managed it successfully<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They worked effectively<br />

					etc.</li>
					<li>Nouns<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His success was welcome<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outcome was positive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a fine accomplishment</em><br />
					etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Many non-modal-auxiliary-verb ways of expressing dynamic modality 
			are more formal versions and often used in writing in which context 
			is limited and the scope for ambiguity is wider.</p>
