		<h1>Central modal auxiliary verbs</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="central" height="207" src="../../images/animals_jellyfish_a310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p>There is a general and simpler <a href="../../initial/grammar_essentials/modality_essentials.html" target="_blank">guide to modality 
		and modal auxiliary verbs</a> 
		which you could follow before you access this area if it is new to you (new tab if you go 
		there).</p>
			<p>This guide 
		focuses only on true, central or pure modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; All 
		three terms are used in the literature but we are sticking with <strong>
		central</strong> to distinguish these verbs from those that are modal 
		auxiliary verbs but are more peripherally so because they do not conform 
		to the tests we shall apply.<br />
		There is another
		guide to 
		semi-modal auxiliary verbs, linked in the list of related guides at the 
		end, which covers <em>dare, let, need </em>and<em> used to</em> 
		and marginal modal auxiliary verbs such as <em>seem to, tend to, be about to</em> etc.<br />
		We are also sticking with the rather clumsy expression <strong>modal 
		auxiliary verb</strong> because it is necessary to bear in mind that 
		there are other modal verbs which are not auxiliaries such as <em>guess, 
		imagine, oblige, suggest, force, intend</em> and so on which carry modal 
		meanings of some kind as, indeed, do a range of modal adjectives, 
		adverbs and nouns.<br />
		Often, these verbs are simply called modals or modal verbs but that's 
		shorthand and we'll avoid it here.<br />
		An alternative view is presented in
		the guide to 
		types of modality also linked at the end.</p>

		<p>What follows is a guide to the main central modal auxiliary verbs in English, taken one 
		by one.&nbsp; We will look at the possible 
		functions of each verb and 
		how it is used.<br />
		In the notes 
		following each table, <span class="style_underline">areas which cause specific and predictable 
		problems for learners</span> are often indicated.&nbsp; It is these in particular that you must be 
		able to analyse and explain in the classroom.<br />
		Tests in sections of this page only exist for the more complex verbs but 
		there's a link to a test on all of them at the end.</p>
		<p><strong>The identification of central or pure modal auxiliary verbs</strong> is often limited 
		to 10 verbs:<br />
		<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can | could | may | might 
		| must | shall | should | will | would | ought</strong></span><br />
		In this analysis, however, the verb <span class="styleblackbold"> <em>had 
		better</em></span> 
				is included because it shares some structural characteristics 
		with the central ten<em>.<br />
		</em>Elsewhere, you will find verbs included in or excluded from this 
		list.&nbsp; In particular, the verb <em>ought</em> is often excluded 
		because it is usually followed by the <em>to-</em>infinitive.&nbsp; That 
		is not universally the case, however, and in AmE particularly uses 
		like:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You oughtn't come if you are tired<br />
		</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ought I go?<br />
		</em>are frequent and they may be encountered in the production of BrE 
		speakers.</p>

					<h2>Ten tests for central modal auxiliary verbs</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>If you have followed the essential guide to this area you 
		may recall some of the following section.&nbsp; Here, we have extended 
			it a little to include some less commonly noted characteristics of 
			central modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; There are 10 in all.<br />
		Traditionally, in order to be included as a pure or central modal 
		auxiliary verb, the verb needs to conform to all these tests:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="1" height="62" src="../../../gfx/test1.gif" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Central modal auxiliary verbs cannot co-occur</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>So, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I must can do it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I will must do it</em><br />
			are impossible because <em>must, will</em> and <em>can</em> are pure 
			or central modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; However<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may be able to do it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have to see him</em><br />are possible so 
			<em>be able to </em>and <em>have t</em>o are not, by 
			this test, central modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; The former, in fact, 
			is simply a modal adjective used with the copula.<br />Lexical or main verbs, on the other hand, 
			can occur together and often catenate as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wants to help to do the work<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They enjoy sitting by the fire on a winter's evening</em><br />etc.<br />
			Semi-modal auxiliary verbs may also co-occur so we may encounter, 
			for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't dare let the dog go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to need to get up very early</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="test" height="62" src="../../../gfx/test2.gif" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Central modal auxiliary verbs do not inflect for person</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Central modal auxiliary verbs carry no inflexions.&nbsp; So in, for example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<em>She wants a cup of tea but I had one earlier</em><br />the lexical or main verb 
			<em>want</em> changes to <em>wants</em> with an added -<em>s</em> 
			to show who we are talking about.<br />Central modal auxiliary verbs remain unchanged for person so, for 
			example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She musts come<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It wills rain<br />
			</em>are disallowed.<br />
			Semi-modal auxiliary verbs do sometimes inflect so we may find:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She needs to leave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dares to ask<br />
			</em>Again, the verb <em>used</em> as a semi-modal auxiliary verb is 
			exceptional because it never inflects for person.&nbsp; The 
			past-tense inflexion (<em>d</em>) is optional in some circumstances 
			with that verb.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="test" height="62" src="../../../gfx/test3.gif" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Central modal auxiliary verbs have abnormal time 
					references</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<ol class="auto-style23">
				<li>Lexical or main verbs may or may not inflect regularly to 
				form a past tense but the relationship to time remains clear so, 
				for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hopes to come<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She does the work</em><br />and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hoped to come<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She did the work</em><br />are distinguished by the tense ending inflexion or by an 
				internal change to the verb.<br />(Fewer than 20 verbs in English do not inflect at all for tense 
				but the zero inflexion in these cases is still applicable to 
				tense so, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She quit her job</em><br />and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cut my finger</em><br />are still or 
				may be past forms.)<br />Some modal auxiliary verbs have past forms so:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He can come<br />
				</em>can be expressed in the past as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could come<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will do<br />
				</em>can be expressed in the past as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would do it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall be there<br />
				</em>is sometimes expressible in the past as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should be there<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She may go<br /></em>has a past form in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She might go</em></li>
				<li>Except for the unusual verb <em>used,
				</em>semi-modal auxiliary 
				verbs do inflect for tense and do so with the same significance 
				as lexical or main verbs imply so we can encounter:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She needed to get here early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hadn't dared to ask her</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Where they exist, past forms of central modal auxiliary ver<span class="auto-style33">bs 
				may be used to refer to present and future time</span> (often 
				with a more tentative sense) so we get, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could come tomorrow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She might be 
				angry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would love to come</em><br />Past forms of lexical or main verbs 
				cannot perform this present-time function.</li>
				<li>The central modal auxiliary verbs <em>must</em> and <em>ought (to) 
				</em>have no tense forms at all and <em>could</em> as 
				the past of <em>can</em> or <em>might</em> as the past of <em>may</em> are restricted to certain meanings (see below).</li>
				<li>Some central modal auxiliary verbs have alternative verb 
				forms to express other tenses which are in themselves not 
				central so <em>have to</em> is often used to form the past and future 
				of <em>must </em>and<em> be able</em> to has the same 
				function for <em>can </em>and<em> could.</em>&nbsp;  Some of these alternatives are discussed in this guide.</li>
				<li>When a central modal auxiliary verb is used in a past form 
				such as in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She should have come<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They ought to have been there<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must have snowed last night</em><br />etc.<br />the sense of the present perfect which would be implied with a 
				lexical or main verb of embedding a past in the present is not apparent.&nbsp; 
				So, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have finished</em><br />refers to the present state with the past embedded within it (it's a present perfect form) but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should have been kinder</em><br />does not necessarily carry the sense of present relevance 
				and may just be reference to a finished event which has no 
				present relevance.&nbsp; However, because modal auxiliary verbs 
				express the speaker / writer's <strong>current</strong> view of 
				an event or state, some sense of present relevance is often 
				maintained.</li>

					<h3>Negatives of central modal auxiliary verbs are formed by the inclusion of the 
			negator<em> not</em> after them</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Most  
			of these verbs allow the negator to be contracted to <em>n't</em> which is 
			added to the verb so, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not do it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Mustn't she come?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't go</em><br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You shouldn't really</em><br />are all possible,
			but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I didn't the work<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I talked not to John</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They don't should be here</em><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't must come</em><br />etc. are not possible because lexical or main verbs are negated with the<em> 
			do</em> operator in the simple present and past tenses and<em> must</em> and <em>should</em> are central 
			modal auxiliary verbs.<br />
			The verb <em>will</em> whether it is functioning as a central modal 
			auxiliary verb or as a primary auxiliary verb referring to the 
			future is unusual in that the vowel mutates from '<em>i</em>' to '<em>o</em>' 
			and loses the ending when the negator is appended.&nbsp; Thus we 
			have <em>won't</em> not *<em>willn't</em>.<br />The verbs <em>may</em> and <em>shall</em> are infrequently negated with a contracted 
			form of <em>not</em> so:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She mayn't be there<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shan't arrive late</em><br />are quite rare even in BrE and almost impossible in other varieties.<br />
			Semi-modal auxiliary verbs sometimes form their negatives with the 
			simple addition of <em>n't / not</em> but are also able to form the negatives 
			with the <em>do / does / did</em> operator as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He usedn't to be so grumpy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't use(d) to be so grumpy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She daren't go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't dare go</em><br />
			etc.</p>

			<p>As in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They must do it &rarr; Must they do it?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He can see it &rarr; Can he see it?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will be early &rarr; Will she be early?</em><br />and negative questions are formed in the same way:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mustn't we do it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Won't we be late?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can't we go now?</em><br />
			etc.<br />Lexical or main verb questions cannot be formed this way because they 
			require the <em>do</em> operator so:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you the work?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talked not you to John?</em><br />are not encountered in Modern English.<br />
			Semi-modal auxiliary verbs can also form questions by simple 
			inversion (although this is becoming rare) or by using the forms of 
			lexical or main verbs so we get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he use(d) to work here?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Used she to be a teacher?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she need to pay?<br />

			Semi-modal auxiliary verbs are also possible in non-finite forms so

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daring his displeasure, she put up her hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needing to leave urgently, they called a cab</em><br />

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They all hope to come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They both do the work.</em><br />

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They dared all to swim</em><br />

			Lexical or main verbs are not used in this way so:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I hope to be there if you hope<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She spoke about the problems as you spoke</em><br />are not permitted because, again, the 
			<em>do</em> operator it 
			required as a substitute for the verb.<br />
			Semi-modal auxiliary verbs share this characteristic to some extent 
			but can also occur with the <em>do</em> pro-form so we see:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She used to be as happy as he did<br />

			<p>Emphasis in denying a negative assumption or placing stress on 
			the verb is achieved with lexical or main verbs by the use of the <em>do</em> 
			operator as in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do hope to be there<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, you're right, I do smoke too much<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did like the music</em><br />but this cannot be achieved with central modal auxiliary verbs so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I do can be there<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She does must have more time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I do should go now</em><br />are not allowed and adverbials such as 
			<em>definitely, in fact </em>and <em>really</em> are used instead.<br />
			Semi-modal auxiliary verbs may be emphasised with the <em>do</em> 
			operator as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They did dare to swim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She does need to go<br />

			<p>So we allow, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should usually

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I smoke often too much<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		<p>Notes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Present possibility and 
			future possibility are not always easy 
			to distinguish.&nbsp; For teaching purposes, it's rarely important 
			to do so because the forms and functions are the same.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Are you coming to the meeting?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: I could do.</em><br />
			is an exchange which can apply to right now or the future because we 
			do not know when the meeting will be.</li>
			<li>Most uses of <em>could</em> refer to possibility or 
			ability.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could have left her 
			keys with John<br />
			</em>can refer to both 
			possibility 
			<span class="style_underline">and</span> ability.&nbsp; 
			It means either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John offered to look after the keys so she was 
			able to leave them with him<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It is possible that she left 
			her keys with John </em>(and that's why she can't find them now)<span class="style_underline"><br />
			Only</span> the second use of <em>
			could </em>can be replaced with <em>might</em> (<a href="#might">see below</a>).</li>
			<li><em>be able to </em>is only an alternative if the sense 
			expresses  ability.&nbsp;
			<span class="style_underline">General</span> 
			ability in the past 
			can be expressed either with <em>could</em> or <em>was able to:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could speak French = I was able to speak French</em>.<br />
			However, if we refer to a <span class="style_underline">specific 
			instance of success</span>, only <em>was able to</em> is possible:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to 
			remember the word in French<br />
			</em>not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>I could remember the 
			word in French</em>.<br />
			<strong>This restriction does not apply to negative or interrogative 
			clauses</strong> so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't able to remember the word in French<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't remember the word in French<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were you able to remember the word in French?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you remember the word in French?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't able to swim when I was a child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't swim when I was a child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were you able to swim as a child?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you swim as a child?</em><br />
			are all allowed.</li>
			<li>When used for permission, <em>
			could</em> is generally confined to tentative, polite questions.</li>
			<li>For the negative deduction uses of
			<em>could/couldn't have</em>, see under <em><a href="#must">must</a></em> 
			below.</li>
			<li>When used for complaints, the verb is usually interchangeable 
			with <em>might</em> and always in the past form.&nbsp; So:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might have told me = You could have told 
			me</em><br />
			with very little, if any, difference in meaning.</li>
			<li>When used for future ability or possibility, the question forms 
			often imply a request rather than an enquiry about 
			ability or 
			possibility.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you open the door?<br />
			</em>is not about enquiring about future ability.&nbsp; 
			It is usually a request.<br />
			However, it could be 
			enquiring about past ability and mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were you able to open the door?</em><br />
			or it is a 
			request for some help and means:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please open the door.</em></li>

			refer to possibility.

			This use of <em>
			might</em> can also be replaced with <em>could </em>(<a href="#could">see above</a>).</li>
			<li>The negative of the use for permission is usually expressed with

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We mustn't/can't go<br />
			</em>not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We mightn't go</em><br />
			because that implies an unlikelihood.</li>
			<li>The negative of the use for past possibility:<br />
			
			<span class="style_underline">when the speaker is quite sure</span> 
			of something this is usually 
			expressed using<em> couldn't have / can't have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He couldn't / can't

			</em><span class="style_underline">when the speaker is unsure</span> 
			we use <em>might</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He might not have tried to telephone me</em></li>
			<li><em>might</em> is often seen as adding 'distance' &ndash; making

			<li>The conditional use of <em>should </em>for 1st person forms

			contingent use.<br />
			In the past we prefer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would have loved to come but were away at

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should have loved to come but were away at

			<li><em>should</em> is occasionally used in rather odd, formal expressions

			</em>This is the putative use of the verb.</li>
		</ol>

			<li><em>Would </em>is one of the most common words in English, 
			ranking approximately in 60th place.</li>
			<li>The conditional uses are extremely common.&nbsp; 
			This is also called the contingent use.</li>
			<li>When used to describe past habit, it 
			frequently follows an initial use of
			<em>used to</em> and often expresses nostalgia.&nbsp; As in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We used to take our holidays in France where we would 
			stay in a small guest house and would eat good, local food every 
			evening.</em></li>
			<li>When followed by <em>rather</em>, with or without <em>... than 
			...</em>, the verb indicates preference:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<em>I'd rather stay in and watch television (than ...).</em></li>
			<li>There is a slightly unusual use of <em>would</em> to express an 
			uncertain deduction about a past event (see under <em>will</em> below).&nbsp; Compare, 
			e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			That'll be Mr Brown you saw in the classroom<br />
			</em>which implies the speaker is more confident than:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That would be Mr Brown you saw in the classroom.</em></li>
		</ol>
			<p>Arguably, <em>would </em>also functions as a tense-forming

		<p>Notes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The difference between strong advice and 
			obligation is often 
			very blurred (if it exists at all).&nbsp; Much depends on the 
			authority with which the speaker is endowed.</li>
			<li><em>must</em> can be replaced by <em>have to</em> in certain 
			circumstances only.<ol class="auto-style23">
				<li>External vs. internal obligation: 
			it is often asserted that <em>have to </em>implies an external 
			obligation but <em>must</em> refers to an internal one.&nbsp; 
			Compare<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must get this </em>done<br />which can mean that this is a self-imposed obligation, with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to 
			get this done<br /></em>which can imply an external obligation.<br />Too much can be made of this dubious distinction 
			and it's probably not worth teaching it because native speakers use 
			the verbs in free variation in most cases.<br />
				It is also difficult at times to state categorically whether an 
				obligation is internal or external especially if there is little 
				context.</li>
				<li>Tenses: <em>must</em> used for obligation has no future or past forms 
			(but it does in the sense of  
			deduction, see note 4.) so the use of <em>have to </em>is 
			obligatory in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to do it 
				yesterday<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll have to wait and see<br />
				</em>etc<em>.</em> and:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I must do it yesterday<br />
				</em>is not allowed, although<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must wait and see<br />
				</em>expresses current obligation with a prospective aspect.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>The negative of <em>must </em>for obligation 
			has two forms:<ol class="auto-style23">
				<li>No obligation: <em>needn't / don't have&nbsp;to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You 
				needn't / don't have to go</em>)<br />Only <em>didn't have 
			to / didn't need to</em> express a lack of obligation in the past.&nbsp; 
			The expression <em>needn't have </em>suggests something was 
			unnecessarily done.&nbsp; Compare:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't need to do it</em> 
			(so didn't)<br />with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He needn't have done it</em> (but did).</li>
				<li>Negative obligation is expressed with <em>must not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mustn't go</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>The negative of the use for deduction in standard British English is formed with <em>could 
			not</em> or <em>cannot:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He can't have done it by 
			himself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It couldn't have been the same man<br />
			</em>However, in 
			some varieties <em>must not</em> is used for a 
			negative logical deduction.</li>
			<li>Interrogative clauses asking for speculation or deduction are 
			also formed with <em>can</em> and <em>
			could</em> as in, e.g:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can it have been forgotten?<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could that be her mother?<br />
			</em>so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must it have been forgotten?<br />
			</em>refers rather oddly to obligation and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Must that be her mother?<br />
			</em>is disallowed.<br />
			</li>
			<li>The deductive sense of 
			the verb <strong>does</strong> have a past form:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He must have 
			escaped<br />
			</em>etc.</li>

		</table>
			<p>A certain mythology has grown up around the use of <em>must vs. 
			have to</em> to express obligation which it may be as well not to 
			allow to propagate too widely.&nbsp; In particular:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We noted above (2a) that it is sometimes averred that <em>have to</em> applies to external 
			obligation placed on a person and <em>must</em> is used for internal 
			senses of obligation and duty.&nbsp; It follows that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to write to my mother<br />
			</em>is an obligation placed on me by another and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must write to my mother<br />
			</em>is a sense of duty I am imposing on myself to commit to an 
			action.<br />
			This is a very doubtful assertion and the forms in the present tense 
			are used in free variation by many speakers with those from the USA, 
			in particular, often preferring <em>have to</em> to <em>must</em> in 
			all senses.<br />
				Furthermore, it is not always clear whether an obligation is internal or 
				external so, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tooth is getting worse and I must 
				get to a dentist</em><br />is as likely as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tooth is getting worse and I have to 
				get to a dentist</em><br />
			There are other problems with this assertion:<ol class="auto-style23">
					<li>It cannot apply to past and future forms because <em>must</em> 
				is structurally unable to occur so:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to write to my mother<br />
					</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have to write to my mother<br />
					</em>cannot be compared to some kind of internal obligation 
				using <em>must</em> because no form with that verb is available.</li>
					<li><em>have to</em> (like <em>must</em>) can 
				signify other forms of modality so, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He must be the bride's father</em><br />cannot be contrasted with<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has to be the bride's father</em><br />because neither sentence denotes any kind of obligation, 
				internal or otherwise.&nbsp; The sense concerns the likelihood 
				of a proposition being true and that is epistemic modality.<br />
					By the same token:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer must be between 0 and 1<br />
					</em>cannot be contrasted with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer has to be between 0 and 1<br />
					</em>because, again, neither sentence refers to obligation at 
				all but to a necessary truth.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>It is also suggested that <em>must</em> refers to a specific obligation 
			and <em>have to </em>refers to more general obligations so, it is averred:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I must tell her the truth</em><br />
			is correct and so is:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; We have to tell the truth at all times</em><br />
			but the alternative formulations:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I have to tell her the truth</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must tell the truth at all times</em><br />
			are somehow wrong.<br />
			That is nonsense, of course, and the same issues with other tenses 
			intervene to show that.&nbsp; The only way to express the past 
			or future obligation is:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to tell her the truth</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have to tell her the truth</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We had to tell the truth at all times</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will have to tell the truth at all times</em><br />
			so, whether the obligation is general or specific cannot be a 
			consideration.&nbsp; The same applies to the insertion of 
			progressive or perfect aspects.</li>
				<li>Finally, it is also often suggested that we use <em>must</em> to 
			refer to duties we impose on others and we reserve <em>have to </em>
			to imply that the obligation comes from elsewhere (a similar but 
			slightly subtler idea than the external-internal distinction).&nbsp; 
			So, it would follow that we should prefer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must be careful</em> (<em>because I 
			require it</em>)<br />
			to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You have to be careful</em> (<em>because other 
			authorities require it</em>).<br />
			There is slightly more substantiation for this distinction and 
			little doubt that <span class="style_underline"><strong>some</strong></span> 
			English speakers will prefer <em>have to</em> to signify a rule and
			<em>must</em> to signify a personal admonition so making a 
			difference between:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Must I wear a uniform?</em><br />
			to mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you insist that I wear a uniform</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Do I have to wear a uniform</em><br />
			to mean<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a rule about uniform wearing?</em><br />
			However, whether this distinction exists is slightly doubtful and 
			whether it is worth troubling most learners with it is even more 
			doubtful.&nbsp; It is unlikely that most native speakers would wince 
			if the modal auxiliary verbs were used in reverse.</li>

			<li>When the request form uses the 1st person, it functions as an

			mustn't leave yet</em></li>
			<li><em>cannot have / can't have</em> only occurs as <strong>negative</strong>
			<strong>past</strong> <span class="style_black">deduction</span> (see under <em><a href="#must">must</a></em>).&nbsp; 
			It is not used for <span class="style_black">permission</span> or
			<span class="style_black">ability</span> in the past.</li>
			<li><em>be able to </em>is <span class="style_underline">only</span> an alternative if the sense 
			expresses  ability:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I can speak French = I am able to 
			speak French<br />
			</em>However, <em>able to</em> is not possible in 
			other senses: you can't give permission by saying:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *You are able 
			to ask questions at the end<br />
			</em>and there is a functional 
			difference between:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you able to help me?<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you 
			help me?<br />
			</em>The first enquires about ability 
			and the second about <span class="style_black"> 
			willingness</span> 
			so it's a request.<br />Like <em>must, can</em> has no future form (although it does 
			have a past in some senses of ability only, see under <em>

				<li>Future ability:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will be able to help tomorrow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She can help tomorrow</em><br />In the second of these examples, there is a possible ambiguity

				<li>Future permission:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will be allowed to go later<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They can go later</em></li>

			is a prediction about the future but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He </em><strong><em>will</em></strong><em> 
			keep complaining</em><br />
			is a comment on his insistence.</li>
			<li>The promissory use is almost always only first person

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
			said he'll write when he can<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said you'll do it<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>The negative of the use for deduction is 
			often formed with <em>cannot:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That can't be the 
			postman<br />
			</em>but if the speaker is more certain or is basing the 
			statement on evidence or experience then<em> 
			won't</em> can be used:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That won't be 
			the postman; it's too early</em>.</li>
			<li>The use for ability is somewhat formal and may be replaced by 
			the present simple tense.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottle will hold 3 litres = The bottle 
			holds three litres</em></li>
			<li>There is often a confusion between volition and futurity which 
			is unhelpful for learners.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you marry me?<br />
			</em>refers to the hearer's <strong>present</strong> willingness or 
			volition but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will she marry him<br />

			<li>The difference between strong advice and

			should write to him<br />
			</em>with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You ought to write to him<br />
			</em>For most learners of English, this is irrelevant.<br />
			(This 
			distinction may stem from the fact that <em>ought</em> is an old 
			past participle form of the verb <em>owe</em> and we <em>owe a duty</em>.)</li>
			<li>The negative of <em>ought to </em>for obligation has two forms:<ol class="auto-style23">
				<li>No obligation: <em>needn't / don't have to:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You needn't / don't have to go</em></li>
				<li>Negative obligation: <em>ought not:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You oughtn't (to) go.<br />

			</li>
			<li>The negative of the use for deduction is formed with <em>cannot:<br />
			</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She can't have left already</em></li>
			<li>There is some evidence of the existence of <em>ought</em> as a 
			non-modal auxiliary verb with forms such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You didn't ought to do that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he ought to ask permission?<br />

			Such forms are at best non-standard; many would consider

		Notes:<br />		<ol>
			<li>The word <em>had</em> is frequently contracted to <em>'d</em>, causing some to confuse it with 
			<em>would</em>.&nbsp; E.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd better go = had better<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd rather go = would rather</em></li>
			<li>The form is only used for <strong>present or future events</strong>.&nbsp; There is no past 
		form and in reported speech the verb is often replaced, so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had better not do it<br />
			</em>is reported as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He said we 
		shouldn't do it<br />
			</em>or remains unchanged<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told us we had better not be 
		late</em></li>
			<li>The negative form for advice is formed as <em>had better not</em>.&nbsp; 
			For example<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had better not be late</em></li>
			<li>There is a common negative question form for 
			<span class="style_black">tentative suggestions</span><em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hadn't you better get some sleep?</em></li>
			<li>The <span class="style_black">advice</span> function only refers to 
			<strong>specific</strong> situations or actions.&nbsp; Compare:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had better not listen to him<br />
			</em>with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *You had better not listen 
		to bad advice<br />
			</em>For <strong>general</strong> situations or actions rather than specific 
		ones, the preferred verb is <em>should</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should not listen 
			to bad advice.</em></li>
			<li>The <span class="style_black">warning / threat </span>function is often implicit in the verb:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had 
		better not be late<br />
			</em>may be responded to with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or else?<br />
			</em>The verb 
			<em>should</em> 
		does not routinely imply this.</li>
			<li>The functions of <span class="style_black">hopes and warnings</span> usually refer to a near future.&nbsp; 
			Hence the form is often accompanied by time adverbials such as <em>
			soon</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had better finish that soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had better arrive 
			in the next day or so or he'll be too late</em></li>
			<li>The form is often used as an ersatz conditional:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had 
			better do that carefully or you'll get paint on the floor<br />
			</em>equals<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't do that carefully, you'll get paint on the floor</em></li>
			<li>Informally, <em>better</em> may be replaced with <em>best</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'd best tell the truth<br />
			</em>Some consider this 
			colloquial or even illiterate.</li>
			<li>Question forms are as for other modal auxiliary verbs but are quite formal 
		and rarer:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had I better talk to him?<br />
			</em>In fact, the negative question form 
		is a lot more common:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hadn't I better talk to him?</em></li>
			<li>The form is not used to talk about preferences (that's the function 
		of <em>would rather</em>, see above under <em>would</em>).</li>
			<li>The form cannot be used for obligation although its use by 
			someone in authority often implies obligation rather than advice..</li>
			<li>In rapid speech the <em>'d</em> is often not audible and the 
			form sounds like, e.g., <em>you better</em>, leading some to leave 
			the word out deliberately in speech and in writing.</li>

		<p>The concept of modality is common to all languages.&nbsp; We all have 
		a need to express things like willingness, probability, likelihood, 
		obligation, requirement and 
		so on.&nbsp; Modality may not only be achieved by the use of modal 
		auxiliary verbs, of course.&nbsp; Saying something like:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm almost certain 
		he'll be late<br />
		</em>instead of<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll be late<br />
		</em>is still using 
		modality in language.<br />
		Modal auxiliary <span class="style_underline">verbs</span> are, however, very 
		variable across languages.&nbsp; Here's a brief run-down by major 
		language groupings explaining a little of how it all works.&nbsp; There 
		won't be enough detail here for your particular students and your 
		setting but it is somewhere to start.&nbsp; You can get more on line but 
		beware the unreliability of many sites.<br />
		Swan and Smith, 2001, is a usually reliable source albeit frustratingly 
		inconsistent in covering modality.</p>

				<td class="auto-style46">Arabic<br />
				</td>
				<td class="auto-style44">Standard Arabic does not have modal 
				auxiliary verbs which correspond exactly to English modal auxiliaries.<br />
				However, it does have many precise and detailed ways to express 
				modal concepts.&nbsp; For example<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">must, have to, should, might, may, it is possible to, it is 
				impossible to, it is expected that, it is easy to, it is hard 
				to, it's worth mentioning that, it's well-established that, it's 
				most likely that, it's forbidden to, it's permitted to, it's 
				more proper to</span><br />
				</em>and a range of other concepts are all 
				expressed through a form of modal construction.<br />
				The problem, of course, is that these categories do not mirror 
				the modal categories of English so expect a good deal of 
				confusion, especially with modal auxiliary verbs like <em>may</em> and <em>
				could</em> which have a range of functions.<br />
				The concept of having a large range of modality in the language 
				will not be mysterious to learners from an Arabic-speaking background.<br />

				resources</em> at http://arabic.desert-sky.net/g_modals.html)</td>

			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style45">Chinese languages</td>
				<td class="auto-style44">Modern Standard Chinese, too, has a 
				range of modal auxiliary verbs, as one would expect of an isolating 
				language.&nbsp; They are, however, not at all parallel to those 
				in English.&nbsp; There are, for example, three modal auxiliary verbs 
				which perform the functions associated with <em>can</em> (ability, 
				permission, possibility) in English.&nbsp; The most commonly 
				used modal auxiliaries in Chinese languages express<br />
				<span class="style_black">
				<em>want; ask for; wish; desire<br />
				want to; would like to; feel like (something)<br />
				should; ought to; must<br />
				can; be able to; be capable of<br />
				like; love; prefer; enjoy; be fond of<br />
				can; may<br />
				be good at; be skilful in<br />
				be willing to </em></span><br />
				Conceptually, modality poses no problems but overlapping 
				meanings will make life difficult.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style45">Slavonic languages including Russian, 
				Polish, Ukrainian, Czech, Slovak etc.</td>
				<td class="auto-style44">Slavonic languages also have modal 
				auxiliary verbs but, as usual, the categories don't exactly match 
				(although they are closer than many languages).&nbsp; A single 
				verb form (roughly translatable as <em>must</em>) serves in 
				Polish for the English verbs <em>must, need to </em>and<em> 
				ought to</em>, 
				for example.<br />
				In Czech, there is a clear distinction between externally and 
				internally imposed obligations, often rendered in English by <em>
				must</em> vs. <em>have to, should</em> or <em>ought to</em>.<br />
				Russian has a simpler modal system than English so you may 
				encounter, e.g., <em>He must not</em> used to mean <em>He needn't 
				/ doesn't have to.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style45">Germanic languages</td>
				<td class="auto-style44">These languages use modality is ways 
				quite similar to English which makes life easier for learners 
				from these language backgrounds.&nbsp; The most important exceptions often 
				concern the negative uses.&nbsp; For example, in German the 
				translation of <em>needn't / don't have to</em>, expressing the 
				lack of obligation either way, would be<em> must not</em> 
				[<em>muss nicht</em>] and 
				that causes confusion.&nbsp; To translate the English sense of
				<em>must not</em> meaning prohibition, German uses a different 
				modal auxiliary verb [<em>darf nicht</em>], roughly translatable as <em>
				may not</em>.<br />In Swedish, the verb used for the sense of <em>needn't </em>
				is cognate with the English expression <em>behove</em>.<br />In these languages, too, there are usually more tense forms 
				available so an equivalent of <em>had to </em>may be rendered as
				<em>*musted</em>.&nbsp; Learners may be confused by a logically 
				constructed tense form in their first language, the past or 
				future of <em>must</em>, for example, not existing in 
				English.<br />
				The overlap in meanings between cognate modal auxiliary verbs is not 
				precise so expect errors such as <em>It can be</em> used to mean
				<em>It might be</em>.<br />
				There are few serious conceptual difficulties otherwise.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style45">Romance languages including French, 
				Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian etc.</td>
				<td class="auto-style44">These languages do not have a separate 
				grammatical category for modal auxiliary verbs and usually render the 
				concepts as a verb followed by an infinitive form, e.g., in 
				French <em>Je peux aller (I can go) </em>or in Spanish <em>Puedo 
				ir.&nbsp; </em>Expect, therefore, errors such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I can to 
				eat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *You must to enter<br />
				</em>etc. because many learners 
				perceive the <em>to-</em>form as the infinitive in English.<br />Some modal concepts, e.g., for obligation, are expressed in 
				the passive (<em>It is necessary that ...</em>).<br />
				There is, in these languages, no equivalent to the use of <em>be</em> 
				to express obligation as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are to be here at 6</em><br />
				and a modal auxiliary verb (often an impersonal one) will be used instead.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style45">Swedish, Danish and Norwegian</td>
				<td class="auto-style44">Scandinavian languages have a separate 
				class of modal auxiliary verbs although use is an issue.&nbsp; The verb
				<em>kan</em>, for example, is used to talk about the possible 
				future where English would use <em>may</em> or <em>might.&nbsp;
				</em>Expect, therefore,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It can rain tomorrow.<br />
				</em>Other uses of modal auxiliaries are close parallels with English.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style45">Japanese</td>
				<td class="auto-style44">Japanese has two classes of modal 
				auxiliary verbs: those which are attached to stems and cannot function 
				independently and those which are ordinary verbs which lose 
				their meanings when acting as auxiliaries.&nbsp; We have, 
				therefore, structures such as <em>miru</em>&nbsp;(<em>to see</em>) leading to
				<em>mirareru</em>&nbsp;(<em>to 
				be able to see</em>).<br />
				The concept of modality will not be strange but the forms will 
				cause problems in English.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style1">Greek, Turkish and other languages</td>
				<td class="auto-style37">Some languages have a very reduced set 
				of modal auxiliary verbs to call on.&nbsp; Greek, e.g., really has only two (<em>must</em> 
				and <em>can</em>), one of which only exists in the <em>It is necessary 
				/ necessarily true that </em>sense 
				in the third person.&nbsp; Added to these problems is the 
				tendency to make past modal auxiliary verbs in completely different ways (often 
				rendering the modal auxiliary in the present with the main verb in the past) so 
				mistakes such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I can saw it</em> (for <em>I was able to 
				see it</em>)<br />
				are possible.<br />
				Turkish speakers will have few problems with the modal system of 
				English as such because the language has many parallel structures 
				if not always parallel senses.</td>
