			Before you tackle this guide, you should be confident that you are 
			familiar with the contents of
			<a href="../../initial/grammarl2/modalityessentials.html">the 
			essential guide to modality</a> and
			<a href="../../initial/grammarl2/modals1by1.html">the guide to pure 
			modal auxiliary verbs</a>.<br />
			What follows is an analysis which can be used when planning to teach 
			modal auxiliary verbs in English.&nbsp; It is based on some fundamental 
			concepts in logic and the theory is that the categories of modality 
			mirror the categories of human thought, making concepts clearer and 
			more teachable.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>epistemic modality</strong></dt>
				<dd>Epistemology is the study of theories of knowledge and the 
				word <em>epistemic</em> means relating to knowledge.<br />
				This kind of modality is to do with the speaker's perception of 
				the truth or otherwise of a proposition.&nbsp; So, for example, 
				on hearing a knock at the door, the use of <em>will</em> in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will be the postman</em><br />
				signals the speaker's certainty about the proposition.&nbsp; 
				Equally:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That can't be the postman<br />
				</em>signals the speaker's certainty of untruth and the use of
				<em>might</em> in<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				That might be the postman</em><br />
				signals the speaker's uncertainty.<br />
				Modal auxiliary verbs of deduction fall into this category.</dd>
				<dt><strong>deontic modality</strong></dt>
				<dd>Deontology is the study of duty and <em>deontic</em> means 
				relating to obligation and duty (or its lack).&nbsp; For example, the use of
				<em>ought to</em> in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You ought to write to your mother<br />
				</em>expresses the speaker's perception that it is the hearer's 
				duty to write and the use of <em>must</em> in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must not write like that<br />
				</em>expresses the speaker's view that the hearer is obliged not 
				to write in that way.<br />
				The use of <em>may</em> in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may go</em><br />
				expresses the speaker's view that there is no longer a duty or 
				obligation to stay.<br />
				Modal auxiliary verbs expressing any sense of obligation or its lack fall 
				into this category.</dd>
				<dt><strong>dynamic modality</strong></dt>
				<dd>The term <em>dynamic</em> needs no explanation but here it 
				refers to the fact that the modality is centred on the subject.&nbsp; 
				For example, the use of <em>could</em> in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could swim well as a child<br />
				</em>refers to the subject's own ability and not to externally 
				imposed obligations or duties and the use of <em>can</em> in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you help me with this?<br />
				</em>refers to the hearer's ability alone and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll get it for you</em><br />
				refers to the speaker's willingness to do something (volition).&nbsp; 
				It is not, incidentally, a future tense form and does not 
				necessarily refer to the future at all; it is an expression of 
				current willingness to do something.</dd>
				<dt><strong>alethic modality</strong></dt>
				<dd>This term derives from the Greek word for <em>truth</em> 
				[αλήθεια, aleethia] and refers to logical necessity (rather than 
				deduction which concerns epistemic modality).&nbsp; For example, the use of <em>must</em> in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A square must have four sides<br />
				</em>refers not to the speaker's perception and not to any form 
				of obligation or deduction but to the fact that one of the 
				necessary conditions of being a square is to have four sides and 
				the use of <em>can't</em> in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parallel lines can't meet</em><br />
				equally represents the truth of a proposition failing which, the 
				lines cannot be parallel.</dd>

			<p>This area of study is infested with a menagerie of terminology, 
			some of which are concerned with quite subtle levels of analysis.<br />
			So, if you come across alternative expressions, here's a very short 
			guide:</p>
			<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
				<li>Epistemic modality is often singled out as being views of 
				the truth based solely on the evidence available to the speaker 
				and separated in that way from alethic modality which is not 
				contingent on the speaker's setting but expresses truths in all 
				possible worlds.</li>
				<li>Deontic modality is sometimes distinguished from boulemic modality 
				which
				expresses that which is necessary given a person's wants and 
				desires.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must go now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must not stay up later than 10<br />
				</em>etc<em>.</em></li>
				<li>Deontic modality is also occasionally distinguished from 
				teleological modality which expresses that which is necessary to 
				achieve an aim as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to get into university you need to study hard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must leave now or we'll miss the train</em><br />
				This form of modality is often expressed with conditional 
				structures as above.</li>
				<li>Dynamic modality is often referred to as ability modality 
				(because that is what is mostly concerns).&nbsp; That is not 
				compatible with the view taken in these sections of the site 
				because we also consider expressions of willingness as falling 
				into this category.</li>
				<li>Alethic modality is sometimes referred to as circumstantial 
				modality because it derives from the circumstances of the 
				universe and expresses universal truths (which epistemic 
				modality does not).&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ignition temperature of paper is 233° C</em><br />
				which is true wherever you are and not dependent on when or 
				where you state it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For teaching purposes and for the analysis of language for 
			planning, these subtleties are unnecessary, although some languages 
			deal with the categories differently.&nbsp; However, if you 
			are interested in the philosophy of language, they may have some 
			utility.</p>

			<h2>An alternative view of modality</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>With this analysis in mind, we can try an alternative way to 
			represent the diversity of modal auxiliary verbs in English.&nbsp; The usual 
			analysis (used elsewhere on this site in the consideration of 
			modal auxiliary verbs) is to take each verb in turn and then itemise and explain 
			what functions they can perform.&nbsp; For example, from the guide 
			to pure modal auxiliary verbs, we have something like:</p>
		<h3>might</h3>
		<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style7">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style8" style="width: 126px"><strong>Function</strong></td>
				<td class="auto-style8"><strong>Example</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 126px">present possibility</td>
				<td class="auto-style9"><em>Careful.&nbsp; There might be a 
				snake in the hall.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 126px">future possibility</td>
				<td class="auto-style9"><em>It might rain tomorrow.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 126px">past possibility</td>
				<td class="auto-style9"><em>He might have telephoned while I was 
				out.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 126px">suggestion</td>
				<td class="auto-style9"><em>You might try taking an aspirin.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 126px">permission</td>
				<td class="auto-style9"><em>Might I talk to you?</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 126px">complaint</td>
				<td class="auto-style9"><em>You might have warned me!</em></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is clear and quite concise but, for teaching purposes, is a 
			flawed way to see the analysis.&nbsp; Speakers of the language do 
			not proceed from a consideration of the various functions of the 
			verb and then make meaning using it.&nbsp; What they do is to 
			conceive a meaning and then select a modal expression which suits 
			their purposes.</p>
			<p>For example, I may have in mind the fact that I do not believe 
			Mary when she says:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, I saw a unicorn on my way back from the pub last night!</em><br />
			For my purposes, I might select any number of expressions of 
			modality depending on my degree of certainty, formality, setting and 
			so on.&nbsp; I may consider, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's an impossibility that you saw a unicorn<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			You can't have seen a unicorn<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It is impossible that you saw a unicorn<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I suppose you might have seen a unicorn, but I doubt it<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			You couldn't have seen a unicorn; they don't come round here<br />
			</em>and so on.</p>
			<p>These examples are forms of epistemic modality (i.e., to 
			do with the speaker's view of the truth of a proposition) although 
			the verbs and expressions themselves can be used to express other 
			types of modality.&nbsp; They all express a degree of certainty 
			about the central proposition.</p>
			<p>Now we can revisit our original 11 pure modal auxiliaries (from the other 
			guide) and re-analyse them from the point of view of these four 
			categories.</p>

			<p>In some of the above, of course, there is an implied reference to 
			possibility (i.e., epistemic modality).&nbsp; For example,<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Do you have a moment?<br />
			</em>can be interpreted as a question about a 
			current state but is more likely to mean<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you give me 
			permission to interrupt your day?<br />
			</em> and<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Registration is compulsory<br />
			</em>can be interpreted simply as a 
			statement of fact but is more likely to mean<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to 
			register.</em></p>
			<p>The verb <em>need </em>can also imply alethic modality as in, 
			e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He needs to get to work before 6<br />
			</em>which implies a simple truth rather than an obligation <em>per 
			se</em>.<br />
			The verb also has a non-modal use as a lexical verb meaning <em>
			require</em>.</p>

			English, see <a href="../functions/obligation.html">the guide to

			as either deontic (obligation or its lack) or epistemic (to do with 
			the truth of a proposition) so are excluded from this list.<br />
			Strictly speaking, dynamic modality is confined to expressions of 
			ability or willingness.&nbsp; That will limit the number of verbs 
			quite severely to <em>can, could, will, would</em> and <em>be able</em> 
			<em>to</em> for the most part.<br />

			<p>When expressing alethic modality, the verb <em>must</em> is 
			negated in standard English as <em>can't</em> or <em>couldn't</em> 
			(as it is for epistemic modality).&nbsp; In some dialect forms, 
			however, <em>mustn't</em> is used to express impossibility rather 
			than negative obligation.<br />
			The verb <em>need</em> is somewhat rarer in this sense.</p>
			<p>It is also quite rare for alethic modality to be expressed in the 
			past because, obviously, it usually refers to timeless facts.&nbsp; 
			It is occasionally encountered when a fact has been superseded and 
			is no longer true, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time a battle had to be fought on foot.</em><br />
			in such cases, the normal rule of replacing <em>must</em> with <em>
			have to</em> and <em>can't</em> with <em>couldn't</em> applies.<br />
			However, the verb <em>need</em> is not negated in the past when it 
			is used to express alethic modality, so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time armies needed to move solely on foot</em><br />
			cannot be negated as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time armies didn't need to move solely on foot</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time armies needn't have moved solely 
			on foot</em><br />
			because that implies a lack of obligation rather than a negative 
			fact.</p>

				<li>In some analyses, the modal auxiliary verb <em>must</em> is classified 
				as representing intrinsic or even dynamic modality because it is 
				seen as personal to the speaker rather than an externally 
				imposed duty and <em>have to</em> appears under 
				extrinsic deontic modality because, the theory has it, that it 
				expresses an externally imposed duty.&nbsp; However, 
				where it is not obvious which is intended, native speakers use 
				them in free variation.<br />
				It is also the case that it is difficult to separate the 
				external from the internal so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a toothache and have to go to the 
				dentist</em><br />
				can just as well be expressed as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a toothache and must go to the 
				dentist</em><br />
				because it is unclear whether a toothache represents an internal 
				or external phenomenon.</li>
				<li>The strength of both deontic and epistemic modality is often 
				determined by intonation and stress rather than depending on the 
				modal expression chosen by the speaker.</li>
				<li>In this analysis, logical deduction and logical necessity 
				are distinguished (as epistemic and alethic modalities) but, for 
				most teaching purposes, can be conflated.</li>
				<li>The verb <em>need </em>is treated here as a central modal 
				although it has semi-modal characteristics in many cases.</li>
				<li>Teaching modal expressions using this kind of analysis 
				presumes that you start from the type of modality your learners 
				need to express and work on a limited range of ways to realise 
				the mental processes in English.<br />

			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>Here's a summary with examples using pure (or central) modal 
			auxiliary verbs only.&nbsp; Semi-modal auxiliary verbs and marginal modal 
			auxiliary verbs can also express different types of modality.&nbsp; All four 
			types of modality can also be expressed without modal auxiliary 
			verbs at all.<br />
			For teaching purposes, the summary is useful because you can see at 
			a glance whether the lesson you planned mixes the same verb 
			expressing different forms of modality.&nbsp; That can confuse, 
			especially at lower levels.</p>
