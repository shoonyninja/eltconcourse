			<h1>Modality without modal auxiliary verbs</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="modality" height="207" src="../../images/man_alone310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p class="auto-style2">It is <span class="style_black">probably 
			verifiable</span> that there is no <span class="style_black">
			necessity </span>to use a modal auxiliary verb to express modality (so it's
			<span class="style_black">avoidable</span>).<br />
			It <span class="style_black">may</span> be the case that you
			<span class="style_black">don't have to</span> use a modal auxiliary verb to 
			express modality (but you <span class="style_black">can</span>).</p>
			<p>All the words <span class="style_black">in black</span> express some form of modality.&nbsp; This 
			guide is concerned with ones like those in the first sentence, i.e., 
			words which express modality of some sort (obligation, deduction 
			etc.) but which are not modal auxiliary verbs (as in the second sentence).</p>
			<p>It would be helpful but not essential if you follow
			<a href="typesofmodality.html">the general guide to 
			types of modality</a> before tackling this one.&nbsp; If the terms 
			deontic, epistemic, dynamic and alethic modality mean little to you, 
			then it is almost essential to do so.</p>
			<h3 class="auto-style56"><span class="style_red"><strong>Website alert:</strong></span><br />
			<img alt="caution" height="133" src="../../images/sign_caution200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p class="auto-style55">This is a poorly understood area.&nbsp; Some websites will seek to 
			persuade you that, for example, the word <em>just</em> in something 
			like<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll just talk to him<br />
			</em>is a modal adverb.<br />
			It 
			isn't, of course; it's a downtoner and working in the same way as 
			thousands of other adverbs may be used to modify 
			lexical verbs.&nbsp; Here we are concerned to analyse those words 
			which really do work as modality carriers in one way or another.&nbsp; 
			An example of a true modal adverb is the word <em>fairly</em> as in, 
			e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I'm <span class="style_underline">fairly</span> certain I 
			know him.</em><br />
			and there will be many more examples in what follows.</p>

					<h2>Three classes of modal words</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
			<p>There are examples of all three of these in the first sentence 
			above:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>probably</em></span>: an adverb (an epistemic use to do with 
				the certainty of something being true)</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>verifiable</em></span> and 
				<span class="style_black"> <em>avoidable</em></span>: adjectives (the 
				first is epistemic, the second deontic, expressing a lack of 
				obligation)</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>necessity</em></span>: a noun (a deontic use)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A fourth class of modal words which are not modal auxiliary verbs will be 
			discussed here.&nbsp; These are sometimes known as marginal modal 
			auxiliary verbs and include, for example, <span class="style_black"> <em>be about to</em></span>.&nbsp; They are 
			not semi-modal auxiliary verbs, of course.</p>

					<h2>Perceptions of reality</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
		
			<p>As you will know if you have a grasp of modality at all, modal 
			expressions relate to the speaker / writer's view of reality.&nbsp; 
			Non-modal auxiliary verb modality is no exception.</p>
			<p>Perceptions of reality concern:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>How likely one understands, given available evidence, that an event of a state 
				is real 
				(epistemic modality).&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's probably right<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe he's a fool</em></li>
				<li>How necessary one understands a state or action to be 
				(deontic modality).&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm ordering you to stay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no need to argue with me</em></li>
				<li>How able or willing someone is to do something (dynamic 
				modality).&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has the skills to help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm prepared to try</em></li>
				<li>Whether something is true or false without reference to 
				current conditions (alethic modality).&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E=mc</em><sup><em>2</em></sup><em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Boyle's Law states that at a constant temperature, the pressure of any mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A great many of the ways we use to express modality without using 
			modal auxiliary verbs are adverbs and/or adjuncts and disjuncts.&nbsp; A fair few are, 
			however, adjectives and a significant number are nouns.&nbsp; Many 
			are derived or derivable from verbs or from each other.</p>

			<p>Here's an incomplete list of the ways modality can be achieved 
			in English without the use of modal auxiliary verbs.<br />
			Note, though, as in some of the examples above, these are often used 
			in conjunction with modal auxiliary verbs to heighten or diminish the strength 
			of what is being said / written.<br />
			We can get, therefore, examples such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure he must be aware of that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's manifestly the case that he can't do the job<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is essential that he must do that</em><br />

					<h2>Shades of meaning</h2>

				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>For reasons which are historic more than rational, many teachers 
			compel their learners to express their perceptions using modal 
			auxiliary verbs 
			rather than any other device.&nbsp; We get, therefore the 
			admonition, for example, not to say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps he is her brother</em><br />
			but to formulate that as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He may / might / could be her brother</em></p>
			<p>For learners whose first languages exhibit few or even no modal 
			auxiliary verbs, that may be initially helpful.&nbsp; What is not in 
			doubt is that it can also be restrictive and inhibiting.<br />
			It is clear from the above that using adverbs, adjectives and nouns 
			to express modality allows for a great deal more in terms of subtle 
			shades of meaning than the use of a handful of modal auxiliary 
			verbs.<br />
			For example, it is difficult, using a modal auxiliary verb to convey the 
			senses embodied in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's your opinion although I find it disputable</em> (which is 
			not at all what's meant by, e.g., <em>You may be right</em>)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's observably the case that she is becoming more demanding</em> 
			(which is not at all what's meant by S<em>he must be becoming more 
			demanding</em>)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel an obligation to him</em> (which is almost impossible to 
			render with a modal auxiliary verb such as <em>need, should, ought to</em> 
			etc.)<br />
			and so on.</p>

				</table>
			<p>It is often averred that modal auxiliary verbs are more common in 
			spoken than in written language.<br />
			That is true but the more important issue is <strong>why</strong> it 
			should be true.&nbsp; Here's part of the answer.</p>
			<p>In speaking, we have a number of quasi-linguistic resources to 
			hand, not least of which are stress, tone, pitch and intonation.&nbsp; 
			We can, for example, easily vary the meaning of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should be at a meeting (so I'm going)</em><br />
			to make it<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should be at a meeting (but I'm not going)</em><br />
			by stressing the modal auxiliary verb and using a rising intonation along the 
			sentence.<br />
			The same trick can be performed with the whole range of modal 
			auxiliary verbs 
			in English (and any other language).</p>
			<p>In writing, no such resources apart from using bold, italic or 
			underlined fonts are available to us and in any formal kind of 
			writing these are themselves severely restricted.&nbsp; Hence the 
			need for a wide range of verbs, adjuncts, adjectives and marginal 
			modal expressions to capture a more exact sense of what we mean.<br />
			In academic writing, this becomes seriously important because the 
			difference between<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a verifiable fact<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It is arguable that<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It is transparently the case that<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			There is some evidence that</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			is very important if the wrong message is not to be sent.<br />
			Relying on the narrow range of modal auxiliary verbs available in English 
			would mean that an academic writer may easily be misunderstood.&nbsp; 
			For example, stating:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be the case that</em><br />
			when what is meant is:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a defensible conclusion that</em><br />
			would be perilous.</p>

			<p>There are clearly some issues:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Level</strong></dt>
				<dd class="auto-style38">
				<img alt="level" height="133" src="../../images/level_spirit_a200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Many of the non-modal-verb ways of expressing modal ideas are 
				teachable and learnable at quite low levels.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible that ... / Possibly, ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				It is likely that ... / There's a good likelihood that ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				It is probably that ... / Probably, ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				It is sure that ... / Surely, ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They made me do it<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She allowed me to go</em><br />
				etc.
				are all accessible to lower-level learners.<br />
				However, other items are much more demanding:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without a shadow of a doubt ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Conceivably, but not verifiably ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Some dispute the truth of the hypothesis<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I was compelled to conform<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				In conformity with your wishes ...</em><br />
				are clearly left to later stages and to higher-level learners.<br />
				Be selective, therefore.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Avoidance</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="avoid" height="133" src="../../images/no_hand200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				It is probably true that learners whose first languages have a 
				restricted range of modal auxiliaries are sometimes reluctant to 
				use them and prefer expressions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, she'll come to the party</em> (instead of <em>She 
				might come to the party</em>)<br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is probably not true </em>(instead of <em>That may 
				well not 
				be true</em>)<br />
				However, the attempt to force expressions with modal auxiliary verbs 
				instead is probably, a) doomed and b) unhelpful.<br />
				The fact is that non-modal auxiliary verb expressions are very common and 
				carry more or less subtle meanings which cannot easily be 
				expressed with a modal auxiliary verb.&nbsp; There is no good reason to 
				suppose that they are somehow inferior.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Type of modality</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="four" height="133" src="../../images/four_bottles200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				In the large table above, the effort has been made to divide the 
				expressions into the two main types of modality, epistemic, 
				relating to the truth of a proposition and deontic, relating to 
				the degree of obligation.<br />
				Not to do this when selecting items for teaching or explaining 
				meaning is perverse and bewildering for learners.&nbsp; All 
				types of modality can be expressed using these sorts of 
				expressions:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Deontic modality: <em>I feel obliged to tell you that ...</em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Epistemic modality: <em>It is clear to her that ...</em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Dynamic modality: <em>I mean to get here early</em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Alethic modality: <em>A rectangle manifestly has four sides</em><br />
				but mixing them up in the same lesson is an unfocused approach 
				which is unlikely to succeed.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Collocation and colligation</strong></dt>
				<dd>We saw above that these are significant issues in this area 
				and that it is arguably essential to teach them not only in a 
				context in which their meaning is clear but also with enough 
				co-text for their collocational and colligational 
				characteristics to be revealed.&nbsp; If we don't do this, our 
				learners will be led into errors such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The result was the consequence that ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*He was let to stay<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*The necessity was authorised<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*There is conceivable evidence that ...</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Equivalence</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="equivalence" height="133" src="../../images/balance_stones200.gif" width="200" /><br />
				We have seen that there often is no clear equivalence between a 
				sentence using a modal auxiliary and one using an alternative 
				expression.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, there is some sort of 
				equivalence which can be exploited either to teach these sorts 
				of terms or, in reverse, to teach the modal auxiliary meanings 
				themselves.&nbsp; For example, the modal auxiliary verbs <em>must, can't and 
				couldn't</em> when used epistemically to make a logical 
				deduction such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That must be our bus<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				That can't be the right platform<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				That couldn't have been the only reason</em><br />
				can be replaced with a range of alternatives, each expressing a 
				shade of certainty.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is certainly the right bus<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				There's a strong probability that this is the wrong platform<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				At first glance, that wasn't the only reason</em><br />
				Getting learners to arrange these on a scale of certainty is 
				productive.<br />
				The ability to vary the way certainty and obligation are 
				expressed is a key skill.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Written English and English for Academic Purposes</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="writing" height="133" src="../../images/write200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				There are guides on this site to
				<a href="../eap/hedgingandmodality_eap.html">using hedging 
				and modality in academic language</a> and to
				<a href="../eap/reportingverbs_eap.html">using reporting 
				verbs in EAP</a> which express varying degree of certainty and 
				assertiveness.<br />
				This area, too, is important for learners whose needs are to 
				write and understand formal English whether in an academic or a 
				professional setting.&nbsp; The ability to unpack what a writer 
				really means by, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is arguably the case that we have verified the 
				probability of ...</em><br />
				is very valuable, as is the ability not to sound overly 
				assertive and sure of yourself.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Hiding from the area</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="hiding" height="133" src="../../images/child_hiding200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Many teachers feel reluctant to tackle this area, preferring to 
				stick to the certainties (!) of using modal auxiliary verbs for these 
				functions.&nbsp; That's a mistake because the area is accessible 
				to a little analysis (see above) and can be handled right across 
				the range of levels in the classroom.<br />
				It's also, of course, one that it would be perverse to hide from 
				our learners.</dd>
