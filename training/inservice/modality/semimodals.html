	<h1>Semi- and marginal modal auxiliary verbs</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="semi" height="207" src="../../images/three_part_house310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p>There is a general, essentials 
		<a href="../../initial/grammar_essentials/modality_essentials.html" target="_blank">guide to modality</a> 
		and a 
		<a href="central_modal_verbs.html" target="_blank">guide to ce<span class="auto-style70">ntral</span> modal 
		auxiliary verbs</a> taken one by one on this site (both those links will open in new 
		tabs).<br />
		This 
		guide 
		focuses only on semi-modal auxiliary verbs and what are called marginal modal 
		auxiliary verbs (including the verb <em>let</em>).<br />
		In some analyses, marginal modal auxiliary verbs are also placed in the 
		category of semi-modal auxiliary verbs but that leads to too much 
		imprecision for our purposes.</p>
		<p>In the following you will find reference to dynamic, deontic, alethic 
		and epistemic modality.&nbsp; If the terms are unfamiliar, you can 
		safely ignore them but there is a link at the end to a guide to types of 
		modality in which 
		they are explained.<br />
		Very briefly, however:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>dynamic modality refers to the language user's perception of 
				willingness or ability</li>
				<li>deontic modality refers to the user's perception of 
				obligation or its lack</li>
				<li>epistemic modality refers to the language user's perception 
				of the truth of a proposition</li>
				<li>alethic modality refers to the truths which are independent 
				of the language users</li>
			</ol>
		<h2>Semi-modal auxiliary verbs</h2>
		<p>There is a certain amount of disagreement about what constitutes a 
		semi-modal auxiliary verb.&nbsp; For the purposes of this guide, we are considering 
		verbs which can act both as modal auxiliary verbs and as 'ordinary' lexical 
		or main verbs.<br />
		When they are modal auxiliary verbs, they follow the usual rules for 
		central modal auxiliary verbs for forming questions and negatives and 
		not using the <em>-s / -es</em> inflexion on the 3rd person.&nbsp; They 
		also do not occur reliably with other modal auxiliary verbs.<br />
		When these verbs operate as lexical or main verbs, they may co-occur with 
		central modal auxiliary verbs just like other main or lexical verbs.<br />
		The four verbs which are most often defined as semi-modal auxiliary 
		verbs are <em>dare, need, have to</em> and <em>used to</em>.&nbsp; If 
		you are here only to consider one of them or marginal modal auxiliary 
		verbs and the verb <em>let</em>, use this menu:</p>
			<p><em><a class="highlightlink" href="#dare">&nbsp;dare </a></em> &nbsp;| <em>
			<a class="highlightlink" href="#need">&nbsp;need </a></em> &nbsp;| <em>
			<a class="highlightlink" href="#have">&nbsp;have to </a> </em>&nbsp;| <em>
			<a class="highlightlink" href="#used">&nbsp;used to </a></em> &nbsp;|
			<a class="highlightlink" href="#3">&nbsp;marginal modal auxiliary verbs </a> 
			&nbsp;| <em><a class="highlightlink" href="#let">&nbsp;let </a></em></p>

		<p><a name="1"></a><em>Dare</em> is an ancient word with connections to words pre-dating Old 
		English.&nbsp; It comes from a presumed Proto-Indo European root and 
		occurs in Sanskrit, for example, as <em>dadharsha</em>.&nbsp; It also 
		has cognate forms in Old Norse, Old High German, Gothic, Old Persian, 
		Ancient Greek etc.&nbsp; In all these languages it had the meaning of
		<em>to be bold</em>.<br />
		An older English form had the irregular past tense <em>durst</em> which 
		survived into the late 19th century but only occurs in some dialects 
		today.<br />
		The verb still retains its meaning of <em>have the courage 
		to</em>.<br />
		Consider these examples:</p>

		<p>The contention here is that all these sentences are correct 
		grammatically.&nbsp; What conclusions can you draw?<br />

		little while and then click here</a>.</p>
		<div id="dare" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
		
		<h4 class="auto-style4">Conclusions</h4>
		<ol class="auto-style4">
			<li>Choices:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>It is the speaker / writer's choice whether to treat the 
				verb as a modal auxiliary and make the negative as <em>dare not 
				/ dared not </em>or as a lexical or main verb and make the negative as
				 <em>doesn't dare / didn't dare</em>.&nbsp; Sentences 1 to 5 on 
				the left carry the same meanings as sentences 6 to 10 on the 
				right respectively.</li>
				<li>It is also the speaker's choice whether to make the 
				questions as modal auxiliary verbs would and use <em>dare she?</em> or as 
				a lexical or main verb and use <em>does she dare?</em></li>
				<li>Whether dare takes the 3rd-person 's' is, again, 
				a matter of choice.</li>
				<li>It is also the speaker's choice whether the lexical or main verb 
				only is followed by the infinitive with or without <em>to</em>.&nbsp; 
				(Sentences 6 to 10) so we allow both:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't dare ask</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't dare to ask<br />
				</em>There is a limitation to this set out in point 3, below.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Co-occurrence<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>Unlike the central or pure modal auxiliary verbs, this verb can 
				co-occur with <em>will</em> and <em>would</em> so we encounter, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wouldn't dare phone her sister<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She won't dare do that</em></li>
				<li>But the verb cannot co-occur with other central modal auxiliary 
				verbs so we do not allow, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She must dare phone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They can't dare come<br />
				</em>etc.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Modal use and lexical use cannot be mixed.&nbsp;
			<strong>If the verb is treated as a modal, then all the modal rules 
			apply:</strong><ol class="auto-style4">
				<li class="auto-style5">the infinitive with 
				<em>to</em> cannot be used:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She dared not to phone her mother</em></li>
				<li class="auto-style5">the 3rd-person 
				's' cannot be used<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She dares not go</em></li>
				<li class="auto-style5">the question forms require inversion of 
				verb and subject and cannot be formed with the <em>do</em> 
				operator:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Does she dare come?</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Less obviously, sentences 1 to 4 and 6 to 8 are all questions or 
			negatives and sentences 5 and 10 are also non-assertive:<ol class="auto-style4">
				<li class="auto-style5"><strong>Modal use is confined to 
				non-assertive uses of the verb </strong>&ndash; negatives and 
				questions mostly, as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I daren't ask again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dare you try?<br />
				</em>but not:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*She dare try</em></li>
				<li class="auto-style5">If you want to make a positive, 
				assertive statement then you must choose the non-modal, lexical 
				form &ndash; you can have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She often dares to swim at night<br />
				</em>but not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She often dare swim at night</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</div>
		<p>To many, the modal forms of the verb sound slightly stilted and old 
		fashioned and the non-modal, lexical forms are, in fact, more common as corpus 
		research has shown.&nbsp; The non-modal forms are also more common in 
		American English.</p>
		<p>In most cases, the verb expresses dynamic modality because it refers 
		to ability and willingness rather than to obligation imposed or likelihood imagined.<br />
		Other forms of modality occur in the three common set phrases with <em>dare</em></p>
			<h4>Set phrases</h4>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li><em>I daresay he will come later</em><br />
			This is written as one word and is only used in the first person 
			singular.&nbsp; It means something like <em>I believe</em>.&nbsp; 
			This is the only common use of the verb with an assertive 
			sense.&nbsp; It refers to epistemic modality in that it expresses 
			the speaker's view of likelihood.</li>
			<li><em>How dare you!</em><br />
			This is an expression of outrage and can refer to deontic modality 
			in that it expresses the speaker's view that something is forbidden.&nbsp; 
			It is not, incidentally, a question.</li>
			<li><em>You dare!<br />
			Don't you dare!</em><br />
			This is used as a threat of retribution or punishment if somebody 
			does something and is also deontic in effect, expressing the 
			speaker's desire to forbid an action.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Imperatives</h4>
			<p>Unusually for a modal auxiliary verb, <em>dare</em> can be used 
			in the imperative mood so we allow, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Go on, dare ask a question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please don't dare to ask<br />
			</em>although this is a rare use of the verb.</p>
			<h4>Transitive uses</h4>
			<ol class="auto-style71">
				<li>There is a transitive use of <em>dare</em> to mean <em>challenge</em> in expressions such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dare you to jump<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dared 
		me to do it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he dare you to do it?<br /></em>etc.&nbsp; In this use the verb is always a 
		lexical or main verb, never modal so we do not allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I dare you go<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She dared me ask<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Dared he you to do it?</em></li>
				<li>Another, even rarer transitive use of the verb occurs in expressions 
		such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She dared the water<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dared a question</em><br />
		where the meaning is something like <em>have the courage to try.<br />
		</em>Again, the verb is always lexical, never modal, in this meaning.</li>
			</ol>
		
			<p>Here's a summary of this verb, which, as all summaries do, leaves 
			out some detail:<br />

				</td>

		</table>
		<p><a name="2"></a><em>Need</em> is the only semi-modal which fits into the notions of 
		possibility, necessity etc. along with the central modal auxiliary verbs.<br />
		It does, however, have two non-modal, lexical uses.&nbsp; Consider these examples:</p>

			</em>The modal form of the verb is <strong>only</strong> 
			used in non-assertive ways, usually questions or negatives, as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Need you be so impatient?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You needn't take it with</em> <em>you</em><br />
			etc.</li>
			<li>
			The modal auxiliary verb has no past form so, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Needed she ask?</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I needed not ask</em><br />
			are not allowed in Modern English and the past form of choice is the 
			lexical or main verb (1).</li>
			<li>
			The modal form is followed by the bare infinitive; the lexical form 
			by the infinitive with <em>to,</em> as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't need to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I needn't go</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't need go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I needn't to go</em></li>
			<li>
			There are two forms of the lexical or main verb:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>The first carries the sense of a modal auxiliary verb and is followed by 
				the infinitive with <em>to</em>.&nbsp; The meaning conveyed is 
				one of necessity or lack of it as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to speak to you</em><br />
				It is also used as the negative of <em>must / have to</em> (see 
				the guide to central modal auxiliary verbs) and implies lack of obligation as in, 
				for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You don't need to pay for this</em></li>
				<li>The second lexical or main verb (sentences 8, 9 and 10) is perfectly 
				'normal' in the sense that it is transitive and follows the form 
				of a regular verb and means something akin to <em>require</em>.&nbsp; It is often used with a gerund, 
				e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
				car needs washing<br />
				</em>In this sense, there are no restrictions concerning 
				assertive and non-assertive uses so all these are possible:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I needed some help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you need any help?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't need any help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn't you need some help</em><br />
				etc.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>However, the verb may not be used in the imperative in any 
			of its forms with any of its meanings so all the following are 
			forbidden:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Need help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Don't need to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Needn't come early</em></li>
		</ol>
		</div>
		<p>T<em><span class="auto-style12">here is fruitful ground for confusion 
		here, not least in the distinction between, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She needn't have 
		phoned her mother <span class="auto-style12">(but did)<br />
		and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She 
		didn't need to phone her mother </em>(so didn't).</p>
		<p>A further source of confusion is that the verb is usually used to 
		refer to obligation, i.e., deontic modality, but it can be used to refer 
		to logical necessity, i.e., alethic modality, as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A rectangle needs to have four sides<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many sides does a rectangle need to have?<br />
		</em>and in this case, it is always formed as a lexical or main verb.&nbsp; 
		When the verb expresses a positive universal truth, it cannot be used as 
		a modal auxiliary so we do not allow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*The answer need be 6</em><br />
		However, in the negative, both<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rectangle doesn't need to have four equal sides 
		like a square</em><br />
		and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rectangle needn't have four equal sides like a 
		square<br />
		</em>are possible.<br />The negative is frequently formed with <em>can't</em>, as in:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A square can't have more than four sides<br />
		</em>and this implies necessity rather than lack of obligation.<br />
		Questions can be formed in either way but the modal use is often very 
		doubtful:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the metal need to be heated to melt?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Need the metal be heated to melt?</em></p>
		<p>Again, to many, the modal form, especially the question, sounds formal and stilted and again, the form is rarer in 
		American English.</p>

		<p>There are times when <em>need, must</em> and <em>have to</em> may be 
		used interchangeably to express obligation or its lack but there are some important differences in nuance.<br />
		For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;You must buy a ticket<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to buy a ticket<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to buy a ticket</em><br />
		may be considered synonymous and, in many cases, they are.<br />
		All of these are examples of deontic modality and that is to do with 
		obligation and duty.&nbsp; So, for example,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;You have to fill in a form</em><br />
		or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must fill in a form</em><br />
		refer to the hearer’s duty and the obligation placed on him/her by or
		<em>via</em> the 
		speaker.&nbsp; It is sometimes used casually in spoken language to mean 
		that this is not an obligation on you personally but a general truth.<br />
		However, in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You need to fill in a form</em><br />
		The semi-modal <em>need</em> implies that it is a general rather than 
		personal requirement, to do with the logical necessity of something 
		being true.<br />
		This form is often used, for example, in the passive as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>To be processed, the form needs to be submitted before 
		the end of the month</em><br />
		which states a conditional necessity rather than a personal obligation.<br />
		The verb is often used by corporate bodies to reduce the directness of 
		an obligation placed on customers so while:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You must return your completed form by the end of the 
		month</em><br />
		sounds rude and demanding,<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to return your completed form by the end 
		of the month</em><br />
		sounds far less threatening although the meaning is identical.</p>
		<p>The verb often implies some undesired consequence in the way that <em>
		must</em> and <em>have to</em> do not.&nbsp; For example, choosing the 
		formulation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You need to be at the station by 6</em> (<em>or you'll 
		miss the train</em>)<br />
		expresses the preference for avoiding the unwelcome consequence while<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You must be at the station by 6</em><br />
		expresses more direct obligation.</p>
		<p>Face-saving for the hearer is often the motivation for selecting <em>
		need</em> over the more direct model verbs of obligation.&nbsp; In, for 
		example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Everyone needs to be in the office by 8 o'clock</em><br />
		no personal obligation is implied because this is simply company policy 
		and not my imposition on you or anyone else.&nbsp; It is more polite and 
		distances the speaker from any sense of assumed authority.&nbsp; If, on 
		the other hand, I say:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone must be in the office by 8 o'clock</em><br />
		I am laying an obligation on each member of the group personally.<br />
		Compare, too, the use of need in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The bank needs to have these figures tomorrow</em><br />
		with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You have to / must give the bank the figures tomorrow</em><br />
		because the first saves the face of the hearer by not imposing authority 
		on him/her.</p>
		<p>Finally, we can ignore (if we wish) any statement using <em>must</em> 
		or <em>have to</em> because we are independent operators.&nbsp; So, for 
		example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You have to come at 6 o’clock</em><br />
		is an obligation hearers can ignore if they choose and that might upset someone 
		else, but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You need to come at 6 o’clock</em><br />
		is probably not, because it implies that the hearers will miss something important 
		if they don’t, not that someone else will be upset.</p>
			<p>Here's a summary of this verb, which, as all summaries do, leaves 
			out some detail:<br />
			<img alt="need" height="523" src="../../imagesgraphics/need_summary.png" width="620" /><br />
			There is an argument that both lexical forms of this verb are

			<p>Elsewhere on this site<em>, have to</em> is considered as a modal 
			auxiliary verb proper primarily because it acts for the true modal 
			auxiliary verb <em>must</em> in other tenses (past and future) and 
			as a straightforward alternative to <em>must</em> in other contexts.<br />
			However, it shares structural characteristics with the semi-modal 
			auxiliary verbs such as <em>need, dare</em> and <em>used to</em> so it is 
			considered here.</p>
			<p>The verb signifies the same sorts of modality as <em>must</em>, 
			too, so, for example it can show:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>deontic modality (duty and obligation)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry, I have to leave now</em><br />
				which can be expressed as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry I must leave now</em></li>
				<li>epistemic modality (likelihood)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That has to be his sister.&nbsp; They are 
				so alike</em><br />
				which can be expressed as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That must be his sister.&nbsp; They are 
				so alike</em></li>
				<li>alethic modality (necessity)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A prime number has to be divisible only 
				by 1 and itself</em><br />
				which can be expressed as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A prime number must be divisible only by 
				1 and itself</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>However, unlike <em>must</em>, <em>have to </em>exhibits two 
			kinds of structure: as a modal auxiliary verb and as a lexical or main verb:</p>
		<table class="tableblueborder" style="width: 60%">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style64" style="width: 218px">Modal auxiliary verb</td>
				<td class="auto-style66" style="width: 218px">Lexical or main verb</td>

			<li><em>She didn't have to be late</em></li>
			<li><em>Did she have to come early?</em></li>
		</ol>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Formally, this is the case although some consider that examples 
			2. and 3. are somewhat stilted and old fashioned.&nbsp; Maybe so, 
			but they do exist and they are used.</p>
			<p>Functionally, however, there are issues, the most obvious of 
			which concerns the fact that <em>have to </em>in the negative 
			signifies a lack of obligation whereas <em>must</em> signifies a 
			negative obligation.<br />
			Compare, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mustn't start before 9</em><br />
			which signifies that starting before 9 is forbidden<br />
			with<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't have to start before 9</em><br />
			which signifies that starting before 9 is permitted but not 
			required.<br />
			Both these forms refer to deontic modality, of course.<br />
			There is, in other words, a <strong>functional</strong> difference 
			between sentences 2. and 5. above.<br />
			Sentence 2 suggest she had an obligation not to be late but sentence 
			5. suggests that she <strong>chose</strong> to be late and there was 
			nothing to prevent her coming on time.</p>
			<p>However, if the verb is used in its guise as a modal auxiliary 
			(forming negatives and questions like central modal auxiliary 
			verbs), the case is altered.&nbsp; If we say, instead:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You haven't to start before 9</em><br />
			we are effectively saying that it is forbidden to start before 9, 
			not that it is permitted but not required, so it is functionally the 
			same as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mustn't start before 9.</em></p>
			<p>In interrogative sentences, the situation is simpler albeit 
			inconsistent with the negative uses:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Must I be here at 9?</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mustn't I be here at 9?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I have to be here at 9?</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't I have to be here at 9?</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Have I to be here at 9?</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haven't I to be here at 9?</em><br />
			<strong>all</strong> suggest reference to obligation, not its lack, 
			and it makes no difference whether the question form is positive or 
			negative (so the 'rule' that the negative of <em>have to</em> always 
			expresses a lack of obligation is not completely accurate).</p>

			<p>Because <em>must</em> is, as are all pure or central modal 
			auxiliary verbs, defective, no inflected forms are available to 
			signify tense and aspect and the verb cannot be used beyond the

&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *I musted go<br />

		</table>
			<p>It is sometimes averred that <em>have to</em> applies to external 
			obligation placed on a person and <em>must</em> is used for internal 
			senses of obligation and duty.&nbsp; It follows that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to write to my mother<br />
			</em>is an obligation placed on me by another and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must write to my mother<br />
			</em>is a sense of duty I am imposing on myself to commit to an 
			action.<br />
			This is a very doubtful assertion and the forms in the present tense 
			are used in free variation by many speakers with those from the USA, 
			in particular, often preferring <em>have to</em> to <em>must</em> in 
			all senses.<br />
			There are other problems with this assertion:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It cannot apply to past and future forms because <em>must</em> 
				is structurally unable to occur so:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to write to my mother<br />
				</em>or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have to write to my mother<br />
				</em>cannot be compared to some kind of internal obligation 
				using <em>must</em> because no form with that verb is available.</li>
				<li>We saw above that <em>have to</em> (like <em>must</em>) can 
				signify other forms of modality so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He must be the bride's father</em><br />
				cannot be contrasted with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has to be the bride's father</em><br />
				because neither sentence denotes any kind of obligation, 
				internal or otherwise.&nbsp; The sense concerns the likelihood 
				of a proposition being true and that is epistemic modality.</li>
				<li>By the same token:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer must be between 0 and 1<br />
				</em>cannot be contrasted with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer has to be between 0 and 1<br />
				</em>because, again, neither sentence refers to obligation at 
				all but to a necessary truth.</li>
				<li>It is not always clear whether an obligation is internal or 
				external so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tooth is getting worse and I must 
				get to a dentist</em><br />
				is as likely as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tooth is getting worse and I have to 
				get to a dentist</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is also suggested that <em>must</em> refers to a specific obligation 
			and <em>have to </em>refers to more general obligations so, it is averred:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I must tell her the truth</em><br />
			is correct and so is:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; We have to tell the truth at all times</em><br />
			but the alternative formulations:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I have to tell her the truth</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must tell the truth at all times</em><br />
			are somehow wrong.<br />
			That is nonsense, of course, and the same issues with other tenses 
			intervene to show that.&nbsp; The only way to express the past 
			or future obligation is:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to tell her the truth</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have to tell her the truth</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We had to tell the truth at all times</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will have to tell the truth at all times</em><br />
			so, whether the obligation is general or specific cannot be a 
			consideration.&nbsp; The same applies to the insertion of 
			progressive or perfect aspects.</p>
			<p>Finally, it is also often suggested that we use <em>must</em> to 
			refer to duties we impose on others and we reserve <em>have to </em>
			to imply that the obligation comes from elsewhere (a similar but 
			slightly subtler idea than the external-internal distinction).&nbsp; 
			So, it would follow that we should prefer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must be careful</em> (<em>because I 
			require it</em>)<br />
			to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You have to be careful</em> (<em>because other 
			authorities require it</em>).<br />
			There is slightly more substantiation for this distinction and 
			little doubt that <span class="style_underline"><strong>some</strong></span> 
			English speakers will prefer <em>have to</em> to signify a rule and
			<em>must</em> to signify a personal admonition so making a 
			difference between:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Must I wear a uniform?</em><br />
			to mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you insist that I wear a uniform</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Do I have to wear a uniform</em><br />
			to mean<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a rule about uniform wearing?</em><br />
			However, whether this distinction exists is slightly doubtful and 
			whether it is worth troubling most learners with it is even more 
			doubtful.&nbsp; It is unlikely that most native speakers would wince 
			if the modal auxiliary verbs were used in reverse.</p>

			<p>One distinction between the verbs does, however, have statistical

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we have to follow the signs?<br />

			</em>The even rarer form:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have we to follow the signs?</em><br />

			<p>It is also suggested that <em>have to</em> is the form of choice to 
			replace <em>need</em> in the past and future so, by this 'rule', we should 
			prefer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to buy another ticket</em><br />

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I needed to buy another ticket</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have to buy another ticket</em><br />
			over<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will need to buy another ticket</em></p>
			<p>This is another pseudo-rule.&nbsp; It is the case that the 
			somewhat formal use of <em>need</em> as a modal auxiliary verb as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Need I buy a ticket?</em><br />
			has no past or future form but that does not mean that we replace it 
			with <em>have to</em>.&nbsp; We can equally well use <em>need</em> 
			as a lexical or main verb and choose to say:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to buy a ticket</em><br />
			by inserting the <em>to</em>-infinitive instead of the bare 
			infinitive.<br />
			The only time when the forms are clearly distinguishable is in the 
			past when, as we saw above in the discussion of <em>need</em>, there 
			is a difference between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't need to call him</em> (so I didn't)<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I needn't have called him</em> (but I did)<br />
			and between<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't have to call him</em> (so I probably didn't but

			To many, the modal form is formal, stilted and even wrong.</li>
			<li>There is no requirement only to use the modal in non-assertive 
			contexts.&nbsp; This is unlike <em>need</em> and <em>dare</em> (see 
			above).&nbsp; So the verb maintains its form in questions, statements 
			and negatives (sentences 1. to 4.).</li>
			<li>There is some spelling confusing.&nbsp; The '<em>d</em>' is optional 
			where shown in brackets, compulsory otherwise.</li>
			<li>Confusion with the <em>be/get used to </em>structures, as in, 
			e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I'm used to working late<br />
			</em>can mostly 
			be avoided if you don't present them in the same lesson.</li>
			<li>The pronunciation of this verb to express habit varies from the verb meaning 
			<em>
			employ</em>: the '<em>s</em>' is pronounced /s/ in the former and /z/ in 
			the latter.&nbsp; Additionally, the '<em>d'</em> is pronounced as 
			/d/ in the main-verb use but as /t/ in the modal auxiliary use.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used a hammer</em> (/ˈaɪ.ˈjuːzd.ə.ˈhæ.mə/)<br />
			vs.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to work hard</em> (/ˈaɪ.ˈjuːstə.ˈwɜːk.hɑːd/)<br />
			Many learners have trouble with this.</li>
		</ol>
			<h3><em>used to vs. would</em></h3>
			<p><em>Used to </em>can be replaced by <em>would </em>usually after
			<em>used to </em>has set the scene.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used to take our holidays in Margate where we would stay in a 
			guesthouse and would go swimming every day ... .<br />
			</em>This is sometimes considered a time-frame function so <em>used 
			+ to </em>is used to set the overall time frame in which the events 
			and actions are referred to with <em>would</em>.&nbsp; Thus, in this 
			example, <em>We used to take our holidays in Margate</em> serves to 
			set the time frame in which all else takes place.<br />
			An allied point is that when the topic changes, <em>used</em> is 
			again the verb which signals it.&nbsp; So, for example, after the 
			holiday anecdote we may encounter:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the holiday, when I got back to work I 
			used to miss the freedom and would find it difficult to focus on the 
			job.<br />
			</em>This is called the episode boundary marking use of the verb and 
			serves to mark the change.</p>
			<p>It is often averred that only<em> used to 
			</em>may refer to past 
			states rather than actions:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He used to be so slim<br />
			</em>not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He would be so slim</em>.<br />This is an often-used classroom rule but it is another pseudo rule, 
			in fact.&nbsp; There are exceptions to it when it comes to the 
			use of copular verbs.<br /><em>Would</em> can be used with verbs which convey 
			the relationship between subject and complement like <em>be, 
			appear, seem, remain </em>etc. in, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would sometimes be a difficult person to talk to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He would often appear uninterested<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I would remain in the house<br /></em>Frequently, we insert time adverbials in these formulations.<br />
			The distinction here is to do with the adjective which is used:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style71">
				<li>When we use an adjective which is stative or inherent to the 
				subject and not under its control, the use of <em>would</em> is 
				forbidden so, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She would be short<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They would be French<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *My mother would be beautiful</em><br />etc. are all disallowed because the characteristic is not 
				variable.</li>
				<li>However, when the adjective is dynamic or non-inherent in 
				nature, <em>would</em> can be used to express the past state as 
				in, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would be obstructive<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would be curious<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother would be happy</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Another way of putting this is to distinguish between temporary, 
			repeated or permanent states:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style71">
				<li>Temporary or repeated states are allowed with <em>would</em> 
				so we encounter:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would get irritable if I asked too 
				many questions</em><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would often be found in the garden</em></li>
				<li>Permanent states are not allowed with <em>would</em> so we 
				do not encounter:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She would be an impatient person</em><br />although<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would get impatient</em><br />is allowed because the state is temporary.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the negative and interrogative forms <em>would</em> is often 
			avoided in favour of <em>used to</em> because to many:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldn't get up early when I was on holiday</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you often have lunch on the terrace?</em><br />
			sound stilted.</p>
			<p>Here's a summary of these verbs, which, as all summaries do, 
			leaves out some detail:<br />

			<p>Modal auxiliary verbs (whether central of semi-) express the 
			notions of truthfulness, likelihood, impossibility, duty, advice, 
			obligation, willingness and so on.&nbsp; Those terms are dismissed 
			elsewhere on this site in favour of the concepts of epistemic, 
			deontic, dynamic and alethic modality, incidentally.<br />
			However, it is quite arguable that both <em>used</em> and <em>would</em> 
			in the meaning we are discussing here are, in fact, not modal in the 
			true sense at all.&nbsp; What both verbs are doing is signalling 
			that a verb is to be considered both past and habitual in aspect.<br />
			If that is the case, a strong argument can be made that they are 
			acting as primary rather than modal auxiliary verbs just as, e.g.,
			<em>have, be, do, get
			</em>and <em>will</em>
			function to signal, perfect, progressive, 
			causative, passive, future and other aspects of the verb.<br />
			For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been running for the bus<br />
			</em>we have the verb <em>have</em> acting to signal the perfect aspect 
			and the verb <em>be</em> signalling, with the <em>-ing</em> 
			participle, that the action is progressive.&nbsp; That is what 
			primary auxiliary verbs do.<br />
			By analogy, we should consider, therefore that <em>used</em> in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used to visit my grandmother<br />
			</em>and <em>would </em>in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would visit my grandmother<br />
			</em>are both signalling that the aspect of the verb is habitual and 
			the tense is past.<br />
			They are, therefore, acting much more as primary rather than modal 
			auxiliary verbs and should be described (and taught) that way.<br />
			However, most authorities persist in classifying the structure <em>
			used</em> + <em>to-</em>infinitive and <em>would </em>as a 
			semi-modal verbs and that is what is done here.</p>

		<h2>Semi-auxiliaries or Marginal modal auxiliary verbs</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Apart from pure and semi-modal auxiliary verbs, there is a class of multi-word 
		verbs which are often referred to as semi-auxiliaries (and just as often 
		dumped into the semi-modal category).&nbsp; They are also called 
		marginal modal auxiliary verbs because they are often lexical equivalents of true 
		modal auxiliary verbs.<br />
		What you call them is of 
		little consequence but their behaviour requires special treatment in the 
		classroom because they, too, act like modal auxiliary verbs insofar as they:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="greybullet">express the 
		writer / speaker's view of reality</li>
			<li class="greybullet">occur in combination 
		with main verbs and in some senses cannot stand alone</li>
		</ul>
		<p>They all, however, make questions and negatives as main verbs do and 
		cannot be inverted for questions or negated without an auxiliary (<em>do</em>) 
		in the present and past simple tense forms.<br />They also all, where it is appropriate, take a third-person, 
		singular <em>-s </em>or<em> -es </em>inflexion as well as conventional 
		past-tense markers and aspectual features.<br />
		However, many of these verbs cannot be used in progressive or continuous 
		aspects.&nbsp; Where this is the case below, it is noted.</p>
		<p>A short list includes:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em>happen to</em></dt>
			<dd>As in, e.g.,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I happened to see John yesterday.<br />
			</em>The sense is<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By chance I saw John<br />
			</em>rather than by 
			arrangement or plan.<br />
			The verb is not used in the progressive aspect.&nbsp; So:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was happening to speak to Mary<br />
			</em>is not allowed.<br />
			The question form is allowable:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she happen to meet him?</em><br />
			but the negative is questionable at best:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; ?She didn't happen to meet him</em></dd>
			<dt><em>be (un)able to</em></dt>
			<dd>This is sometimes described as a modal verb because it expresses 
			dynamic modality in tenses or combinations of modalities that are 
			forbidden to the defective central modal auxiliary verb <em>can / 
			could</em>.&nbsp; It is, in fact much simpler than that being a 
			simple adjective linked to its subject by the copula <em>be </em>or 
			by a pseudo-copula such as <em>become, appear, end up, seem</em> 
			etc.<br />
			Because its function is always to refer to ability rather than 
			permissibility or likelihood, it is more limited in its use than <em>
			can / could.</em>&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was able to swim well as a child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She might be unable to come at that time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were you able to see the doctor?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't be able to help, I'm afraid</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She seemed able to move it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He became unable to climb the stairs as he got older</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			Because the adjective is stative rather than dynamic, that is to say 
			not under the direct control of the subject, progressive and 
			imperative forms are not allowed so we do not encounter:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She was being able to do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Please be able to come</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			The first difference with this form is that it can refer to a 
			specific rather than a general ability so while both:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could swim well as a child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was able to swim well as a child</em><br />
			refer to the person's general ability<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was able to swim across the rive</em>r<br />
			refers only to a specific instance and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could swim across the river</em><br />
			can only refer to the generally demonstrated ability to do so, not 
			any specific event.<br />
			Secondly, the past use of the <em>be able to </em>construction 
			refers to a successful attempt in a way that the use of <em>could 
			have</em> does not.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to talk to the boss</em><br />
			suggests a successful outcome but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could have talked to the boss</em><br />
			suggests that the speaker did not, in fact, do so.</dd>
			<dt><em>care to</em></dt>
			<dd>This is similar in sense to <em>would like to</em> but can 
			<strong>only</strong> 
			be used non-assertively, in questions and negatives, so we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you care to go out?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I don't care to eat in smoky restaurants</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I care to eat out<br />
			</em>The verb is not used in the progressive aspect.&nbsp; So:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*I wasn't caring to eat out so often<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Are you caring for something to eat<br />
			</em>are not allowed.<br />
			The verb is often combined with <em>would</em> in polite offers such 
			as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you care for some more tea?</em><br />
			etc.</dd>
			<dt><em>mean to</em></dt>
			<dd>This semi-auxiliary is often used for current intentions in the same way 
			that <em>going to</em> is used as in, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean to call on 
			him on my way.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been meaning to ask you about this<br />
			</em>The verb can be used in this sense in all forms, positive, 
			negative and interrogative:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does she mean to go to the shops?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't mean to get the train</em><br />
			but there is some ambiguity because, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't mean to be nasty</em><br />
			refers to her intention, not her plan whereas:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I meant to go to the shops</em><br />
			implies a frustrated past plan akin to:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to go to the shops</em><br />
			but didn't for some reason.<br />
			(The verb <em>mean</em> followed by a -<em>ing</em> form is not 
			in this category.&nbsp; That verb signifies that something is 
			involved or implied as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I need a new car but that means spending money I don't 
			have</em>.)</dd>
			<dt><em>seem to</em></dt>
			<dd>This verb is often classified 
			(wrongly) as always a copula.&nbsp; It is a copular verb when it is used 
			without another verb as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He seems happy</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is seeming a bit down these days</em><br />
			The sense of <em>seem </em><span class="style_underline"><em>to</em></span> 
			is different and is usually one of doubt or 
			uncertainty so it belongs with the central modal auxiliaries such as <em>might, 
			may, could</em> etc. as in, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He seems to be unhappy</em>.<br />
			It expresses epistemic modality because it concerns the speaker's 
			view of the likelihood of a proposition being true.&nbsp; In this 
			sense, <em>seem to</em> cannot be used in the progressive aspect so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is seeming to be unhappy</em><br />
			is not allowed.<br />
			Questions and negative uses are permitted.</dd>
			<dt><em>tend to</em></dt>
			<dd>In the present tense this verb suggests preference (and, 
			therefore, habit) as in, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tend only to watch the news on TV<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am tending to eat less meat<br />
			</em>In the past, however, it often performs the same function as 
			the semi-modal <em>used to</em> as in, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We tended to take 
			long walks on our holidays<br />
			</em>compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used to take long 
			walks on our holidays</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; We would take long walks on our holidays.<br />
			</em>Unlike <em>used to</em> and, obviously, <em>would</em>, <em>
			tend to </em>can be used in the progressive / continuous aspect so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were tending to get up later and later</em><br />
			is possible to express a habit in formation which is a useful 
			concept not available with the other ways of expressing past habit.&nbsp; 
			We hear, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am tending to play less golf these days</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was tending to practise less and less 
			because I was so busy</em><br />
			which is not expressible with <em>used to</em> or <em>would</em>.</dd>
			<dt><em>turn out to</em></dt>
			<dd>This is often not classified as a semi-auxiliary, and it is not 
			one in something like<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather turned out nice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is turning out to be a real asset to the company<br />
			</em>where it is a copular phrasal verb, linking the subject and the 
			epithet or non-finite clause and with a meaning akin to <em>become</em>.&nbsp; 
			We can replace it that way and get:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather became nice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is becoming a real asset to the company<br />
			</em>However, it has affinities with copular verbs and means 
			something like <em>ended up</em> in expressions such as<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned out to want even more money</em>.<br />
			which cannot be rephrased with <em>become.<br />
			</em>It cannot, in this sense, be used with the progressive aspect so:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*He was turning out to want even more money</em><br />
			is not allowed.<br />
			Questions and negative uses are permitted.</dd>
			<dt><em>be about to</em></dt>
			<dd>This semi-auxiliary is also often used as an equivalent to <em>
			going to</em> but emphasises the close proximity of the events in 
			time.<br />
			Both are used in the past to refer to a frustrated plan.<br />
			Compare, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about to have 
			dinner when you called<br />
			</em>with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to have dinner when 
			you called.<br />
			</em>Both are used in the present to refer to a future based on 
			current evidence or previous experience (and so are epistemic in 
			sense).&nbsp; E.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the weather.&nbsp; It's about to rain / It's going 
			to rain<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't argue any more; she's about to / going to 
			lose her temper.<br />
			</em>The verb is not used in the progressive aspect but can be used 
			for inanimate subjects.&nbsp; We allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was about to collapse<br />
			</em>but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It was being about to collapse</em></dd>
			<dt><em>be on the point of</em></dt>
			<dd>works in a very similar way and has a similar meaning 
			emphasising even more strongly the close proximity in time of the 
			intended action.&nbsp; It can also be used to refer to a frustrated 
			plan.&nbsp; Examples are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was on the point of interrupting when the 
			meeting closed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are on the point of leaving so hurry if you want to go 
			with them</em></dd>
			<dt><em>went to</em></dt>
			<dd>This is a real oddity.&nbsp; It can <em><strong>only</strong></em> 
			be used to refer to the past existence of an intention which was not 
			fulfilled and exists in no other tense.&nbsp; It means roughly the 
			same as <em>be about to</em>, however.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to pick up the stone but realised it 
			was too hot to touch</em><br />
			which does <strong>not</strong> carry the usual sense of movement 
			towards which <em>went</em> normally signals.&nbsp; It is a direct 
			equivalent of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to pick up the stone but realised 
			it was too hot to touch<br />
			</em>Unlike <em>going to</em>, however, this form can never be used 
			with inanimate subjects because it signals a pre-formed intention 
			so, while we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car was going to crash</em><br />
			we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The car went to crash.</em><br />
			The final oddity is that it cannot easily be used in questions and 
			negatives so both:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Did he go to pick up the stone before he 
			realised it was too hot to touch?<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He didn't go to pick up the stone before her 
			realised it was too hot to touch<br />
			</em>are not allowed.</dd>
			<dt><em>be likely to</em></dt>
			<dd>This is modal in nature and clearly expresses a degree of 
			probability so belongs with central or pure modal auxiliary verbs like<em> may, could, will</em> 
			etc. and concerns epistemic modality.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's likely to be late<br />
			</em>with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He may well be late</em>.<br />
			The construction is not used in the progressive aspect.<br />
			In this sense the marginal modal suggests a greater degree of 
			possibility than <em>may, could</em> or <em>might</em> but not the 
			greater certainty signalled by <em>will</em>.</dd>
			<dt><em>be supposed to</em></dt>
			<dd>This has affinities with modal auxiliaries such as<em> should, ought to</em> 
			and<em> must</em> (in some senses) and refers to obligation (deontic 
			modality) and to likelihood (epistemic modality).<br />
			Compare, for example,<br />
			<em> 
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			You aren't supposed to be in here<br />
			</em>and</dd>
			<dd><em> 
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			You shouldn't be in 
			here<br />
			</em>which are both deontic in meaning, referring to obligation or 
			duty, with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The train ought to be here at 6<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
			train is supposed to be here at 6.<br />
			</em>which are both epistemic, referring to the speaker's perception 
			of the truth of a proposition.<br />
			There is sometimes a 
			sense with this construction that the event or state has not taken / 
			will not take place although it <em><strong>should</strong></em>.&nbsp; Compare, 
			e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's supposed to be here already (but he isn't)<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He should be here already (and I think he is)<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I should go (and probably will)<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I'm supposed to go (but probably won't)<br />
			</em>The verb is not used in the progressive aspect.</dd>

		<p>This verb is somewhat anomalous, quirky, even, and many analyses will not consider 
		it a modal auxiliary verb of any type.&nbsp; Here it follows the section on 
		marginal modal auxiliary verbs but could just as easily be inserted after the 
		semi-modal auxiliary verbs proper.&nbsp; It shares some modal 
		characteristics as well as functioning as a causative or main verb in, 
		e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I let him believe I was enjoying the meal</em> 
		(causative)<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		In the functions of offering, permission and obligation, the verb has no modal 
		characteristics (it has a past form [irregular and unchanged], takes a 
		third-person <em>-s</em> and forms questions and negatives with the <em>
		do</em> operator).&nbsp; The form is usually one of a simple imperative 
		and can be softened with <em>please</em> etc.<p>The verb works as a 
		modal auxiliary, however, insofar as it cannot appear without a main 
		verb and implies suggestion, obligation and so on.&nbsp; In this regard, 
		it acts often as a cohortative expression, inviting cooperation rather 
		than expressing obligation (9, 10 and 11, above).</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>It is almost always abbreviated to <em>let's</em> rather than 
			keeping the full form which is reserved for a persuading / 
			obligation function.<br />
			Compare, for example:<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>Let us try harder</em><br />
				which, depending on setting and participants, could be an 
				obligation equivalent to:<br />
				<em>We must try harder</em><br />
				or it could be a rather formal suggestion.</li>
				<li><em>Let's try harder</em><br />
				which is simply a cohortative suggestion more or less equivalent to<br />
				<em>We should try harder, shouldn't we?</em></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>When the verb is being used as a main verb in the imperative 
			with a meaning connected to <em>allow, </em>there can be no contraction so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us free</em><br />
			cannot be contracted to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Let's free</em></li>
			<li>As a response to a suggestion using <em>shall</em> such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall we go now?</em><br />
			the use of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, let's</em><br />
			is common as a way of acceding to a suggestion.</li>
			<li>Suasion: there is a rare and somewhat formal, if not poetic, use 
			of <em>let</em> with a main verb in the subjunctive in expressions 
			such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let it rain<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Let the sun shine<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Let him be promoted</em><br />
			The use here is called optative (wishing).<br />
			There is a further unusual use as a kind of challenge in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him try!<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Let them come!</em></li>
			<li>Negatives:<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>There are two negative forms, the second of which is informal at 
			best:<br />Using <em>not</em> in the same way that central modal 
				auxiliary verbs make 
				negatives as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's not tell him the truth<br />
				</em>Using the<em> do </em>operator as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't let's tell him the truth</em></li>
				<li >The verb cannot be used in the 
			positive (i.e., assertive form) as a suggestion-making device in the second person so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Let you give me a hand</em><br />is not allowed.<br />but there is a purely negative second-person 
				imperative use with the operator
				<em>do</em> as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't let anyone tell you it will be easy</em></li>
				<li >The optative use in e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Let it snow<br />
				</em>can be made negative with the insertion of <em>not</em> 
				before the main verb in e.g.<em>:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Let him not come too early<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Let the snow not get too heavy<br />
				</em>Although some might think it wrong, there is also a 
				negative using the <em>do</em> operator:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just don't let it rain<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Please don't let him get the job<br />
				</em>As in the examples, these are often prefaced with <em>just
				</em>or<em> please.<br />
				</em>The challenge use mentioned above in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Let him do his worst!<br />
				</em>cannot be negated.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li class="greybullet">Interrogatives:<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>There is no pure interrogative form for the modal use so<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				*Let we go?<br />
				</em>is not permitted.</li>
				<li>There is a question-tag formula which betrays the modal 
				nature of the verb as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's go, shall we?</em><br />
				and that's roughly equivalent to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall we go?</em><br />
				and that cannot have a tag so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall go, shan't we?</em><br />
				carries only future reference, not the idea of suggestion.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The imperative mood:<br />
			Unlike many languages, English does not have a first-person, plural 
			imperative form so there is no obvious equivalent of the French:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Allons à la maison</em><br />
			or the Spanish:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V<em>amos a casa<br />
			</em>or the Itialian<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andiamo a casa<br />
			</em>and so on.<br />
			It is the verb <em>let</em> which fills this structural gap in 
			English with, as we see above the formulation of<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's go home.</em></li>
