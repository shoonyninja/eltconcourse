			<a href="../../initial/grammarl2/modalityessentials.html">the 
			essential guide to modality</a> and
			<a href="../../initial/grammarl2/modals1by1.html">the guide to pure

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>English modal verbs are often described as defective, meaning 
			that they cannot be used with the full range of inflexions or in 
			the full range of tenses that lexical or main verbs allow.<br />
			For example,<br />
			<em>smoke, go, enjoy, imagine, come, decide, think, 
				spin </em>etc. are all non-defective, lexical verbs and change form to show:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li>Person<em><br />
				I 
				smoke, she smoke<strong>s</strong></em></li>
				<li>Tense<em><br />
				I come, I c<strong>a</strong>me, 
				I imagine, I imagine<strong>d</strong></em></li>
				<li>Aspect<br />
				<em>I 
				decide, I <strong>am</strong> decid<strong>ing</strong></em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Modal auxiliary verbs cannot be treated this way (<em>*I musted, *He musts, *I 
			am musting </em>etc.)</p>
			<p>Unlike many languages, English has few 
			natural past-tense forms for modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; There is, for 
			example, no simple past-tense way of expressing<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must go now<br />
			</em>If we want to put it in the past, we are obliged to use 
			somewhat clumsy formulations such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to go then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he had to go then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was obliged to go then</em><br />and so on.<br />Equally, when we use reported or indirect speech, we are often 
			forced to substitute modal verbs with other expressions and report, 
			for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may go</em><br />as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave me permission to leave</em><br />although<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said I might go</em><br />is another possibility.<br />See 
			<a href="../verbs/reportedspeech.html">the guide to reported 
			speech</a> for more on how we cope with the difficulty of reporting 
			modal expressions like these.</p>
			<p>Here's the list of modal verbs, taken from
			<a href="../../initial/grammarl2/modalityessentials.html">the 
			essential guide to modality</a> showing which do and which do not have past-tense forms:</p>

		</table><p>The verb <em>had to</em> is shown in brackets because it is actually 
			non-defective and can be altered for tense and person:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has to go</em><br />
			and for aspect<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's having to work long hours<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She has had to work long hours<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She will have to work long hours<br />
			</em>The verb <em>be able to</em> is similar although it does not 
			permit the progressive particle.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was able to open the case<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had been able to open the case<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will have been able to open the case</em><br />
			but not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was being able to open the case</em><br />
			or any other progressive, continuous or durative -<em>ing</em> 
			form.<br />
			Other languages are more obliging and have forms of modal verbs or modal 
			expressions akin to <em>canned, musted</em> etc. to express past 
			obligation or past ability or <em>will must</em>, <em>will can</em> 
			to express future ideas.</p>
			<p>This is not to say, of course, that English is incapable of 
			expressing the ideas of tense and aspect with modal verbs.&nbsp; 
			However, the ways it is done are often complicated and difficult to 
			learn.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tablebrownborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style32">Past permission and prohibition:</td>
					<td class="auto-style66"><em>I was allowed / permitted to 
					...<br />
					I could ...<br />
					It was forbidden to ...</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style39">Note that <em>*I can have helped</em> 
					is not available as the past of <em>I can 
					help</em>.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style35">Past ability:</td>
					<td class="auto-style29"><em>I was able to ...<br />
					I could ...<br />
					I had the ability to ...</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style31">Again, <em>*She can have climbed 
					the wall</em> is not an available option as a past form of
					<em>She can climb the wall</em>.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style64">Past volition:</td>
					<td class="auto-style65"><em>He said he was willing to ...<br />
					She was happy to ...</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style38">The past of the volitional use of
					<em>I'll make the dinner</em> is not available as <em>He 
					said he'll have made the dinner</em> because that carries a 
					future perfect meaning.<br />
					The past form <em>would</em> is an available option which 
					occurs in contingent (conditional) clauses but often without 
					the sense of volition except in indirect speech.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<br />
			<p>In summary, <span class="style_black">past ability, past permission</span> 
			and <span class="style_black">past volition</span> are not normally expressed 
			using a perfective aspect.</p>

			<h2>Identifying types of modality</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p> The trick, of course, is to identify the types of modality that 
			can be used in this way and those that can't.&nbsp; To do that, we 
			need a little logical theory.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>speculation and deduction</dt>
				<dd>this is called <strong>epistemic modality</strong> because 
				it refers to the speaker's viewpoint regarding the truth or 
				otherwise of a proposition.&nbsp; From the table above, these 
				are examples of epistemic modality, expressing various degrees of 
				confidence:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will have missed the train<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					She might / could have missed the train<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					She can't have missed the train<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					She can't have arrived yet<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She must be getting tired<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					They might be arriving late<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I may be travelling for work<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					You can't still be working<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					He can't be working at this hour<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She must have been getting 
					tired<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					They can't have been working hard enough<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					They might have been arguing</em></dd>
				<dt>degrees of obligation</dt>
				<dd>this is called <strong>deontic modality</strong> because it 
				concerned with duty or obligation (or the lack thereof).&nbsp; 
				From the table, these are examples of deontic modality 
				expressing varying degrees of obligation:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shouldn't have said that<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					He needn't have gone<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					He shouldn't be smoking<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				You should be working less<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					She shouldn't have been working so long<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					They shouldn't have been playing by the river<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					They oughtn't to have been sleeping</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p> There are two other types of modality which do not normally 
			occur with the perfective, progressive or perfect aspects:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>alethic modality</strong><br />
				This refers to truth of propositions in the sense that something 
				is necessarily rather than deductively the case.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iron must be heated to 1,538°C to melt</em><br />
				This cannot be referred to as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Iron must have been heated to 1,538°C to melt</em><br />
				because it is a necessary (i.e., always true) property of the 
				element.</li>
				<li><strong>dynamic modality</strong><br />
				This refers to modality centred on the subject.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see the mountains</em><br />
				and is not to do with external obligations, duties or a view of 
				the truth of a proposition.&nbsp; We can have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could have swum across the river</em><br />
				but only in the sense of an <strong>unfulfilled</strong> 
				ability.&nbsp; If we say, e.g.,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could have swum across the river</em><br />
				the hearer will understand that we are referring to a possible 
				event (i.e., epistemic modality), not a past&nbsp;ability.&nbsp; 
				For past ability, we would use the past tense of <em>can</em> 
				and have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could swim across the river<br />
				</em>or the replacement form<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was able to swim across the river</em></li>
			</ol>

			types of modality</a>.</p>

			<p> It is important to understand what the modal verb + <em>have</em> 
			+ past participle is actually implying in terms of aspect.<br />
			If you have followed <a href="../verbs/aspect.html">the guide to aspect</a> on this site, you will be 
			aware that the view taken here is that a sentence such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has arrived</em><br />
			is actually a present tense form with a perfect aspect.&nbsp; In 
			other words, the <em>have</em> + participle refers to the present in 
			relation to the past.&nbsp; The present perfect is a relational, 
			present tense.</p>
			<p> Unfortunately, when we are dealing with modal concepts, that 
			definition of the function of the structure is only partially true.&nbsp; 
			Here are some examples to explain:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tablebrownborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style32">Example</td>
					<td class="auto-style56">Explanation</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style35"><em>She might have missed the train 
					and still be at the station</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style57">This is a true <strong>perfect</strong> 
					aspect of the verb phrase because it refers to the present 
					in relation to the past.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style35"><em>He shouldn't have said that and 
					upset her so</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style57">This is, in fact, a <strong>perfective</strong>
					<strong>past</strong> form.&nbsp; Both the saying and the 
					upsetting refer to events and states in the past.&nbsp; We 
					can add a fixed time phrase such as <em>last week</em> to 
					this sentence.</td>

			<p> In summary, the general distinction between <strong>relational</strong> tense 
			forms (perfect aspect) and <strong>absolute</strong> tense forms 
			(simple aspect) breaks down when modality is 
			considered.<br />
			This is a key teaching point because the rule of present relevance 
			signalled by the <em>have</em> + participle form no longer 
			consistently applies.<br />

			<p> There is ample scope for confusion in this so things have to be 
			taken carefully.&nbsp; A first rule of teaching is not to overload 
			learners and a second is to distinguish very carefully between the 
			types of modality which can be used with the perfect or perfective 
			forms.<br />
			It is, of course, not necessary to burden learners with terms 
			such as epistemic modality but, in order to be clear and helpful, 
			teachers need to be aware of the meaning of the terms and select 
			targets and settings in which the modality is clear.</p>
			<p> The final important thing to note is that the form which appears 
			to be a perfect aspect, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might have told him</em><br />
			is, in fact, often perfective (i.e., finished and fixed in time) and 
			unrelated to the perfect aspect of, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have told him</em><br />
			which refers to the fact that he currently knows whatever it is.<br />
			This is not at all easy to grasp.&nbsp; Learners who have taken 
			pains to assimilate the concept of the relational nature of perfect 
			aspects may be bewildered to discover that it no longer applies in 
			many cases.</p>

			<p> If you refer to <a href="../teaching/modalverbsteaching.html">the guide to teaching modality</a>, you will find a number of 
			teaching ideas evaluated in terms of their clarity and efficacy.&nbsp; 
			The key point is to distinguish the type of modality which is being 
			considered.&nbsp; Mixing them up will cause a good deal of 
			confusion, not least because some of your learners' first languages 
			may reserve particular verbs or structures for each type of 
			modality.</p>

				<dd>Deductive procedures such as the ones outlined in the guide 
				to teaching modality are fruitful providing the level of 
				(un)certainty is clearly identified.<br />
				For future time, speculation exercises are common and science 
				fiction can be an engaging focus.&nbsp; Topics 
				typically include:<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you think your home town will be like in 20 years' 
				time?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				What technology do you think will be available to your 
				grandchildren?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				What do you believe cities of the future will be like?</span><br />
				</em>Younger students can be encouraged to think about their own 
				futures.<em><br />
				</em>All these questions contain a verb process 
				realised by verbs like <em>
				think </em>or<em> believe</em>.&nbsp; That's important or the 
				response will simple be a future perfect form expressing too 
				much certainty.<em><br />
				</em>However, as is the case for deduction settings, the degree 
				of certainty signalled by the modal verbs and intonation / stressing 
				is a key consideration.<br />
				In the past, epistemic modality (e.g., for deduction based on 
				current evidence) can be practised with the use of accident- or 
				crime-scene graphics to elicit, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The burglar must have come in through the bathroom window<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The driver of the red van can't have been looking<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He might not have indicated<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He must have been in the bedroom</em><br />
				etc.<br />

				idea at B2/C1 level,

				<dt><strong>for deontic modality<br />
				<img alt="airport" height="133" src="../../images/approach_plane_landing200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>The telling of a story containing many instances of poor 
				judgement calls is an engaging procedure.&nbsp; For example, the 
				following story read aloud quite slowly with pauses to allow 
				interruption using <em>shouldn't have </em>... can work well:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>When I landed at Heathrow, I left 
				my coat on the plane because I knew it's always warm in London.&nbsp; 
				After that, the 
				first thing I did was light a cigar and take a few photographs 
				of the arrivals hall.&nbsp; When my turn came to have my 
				passport checked I refused to hand it over and told the woman 
				she looked silly in her uniform.&nbsp; Before I left the airport 
				I decided to leave my luggage behind in an airport caf&eacute; because 
				it was too heavy to carry and then I started to walk to central London.</em></span><br /> 
				The types of responses one hopes for are, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shouldn't have done that; you should have ...</em><br />
				This can be combined later with expressions of epistemic 
				modality along the lines of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shouldn't have done that because she might have got very 
				angry</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Learners can be further engaged by getting them to write their 
				own silly stories and reading them out for others to comment on.&nbsp; 
				Possible topics are:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A disastrous holiday choice<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A dreadful dinner party with the wrong guests sitting together</span><br />
				etc.</dd>
