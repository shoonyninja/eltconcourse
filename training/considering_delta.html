			<h1>Considering taking the Cambridge Assessment English Delta?</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="study" height="207" src="images/man_studying310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide is intended for anyone who is 
			considering moving on from an initial qualification (such as CELTA) 
			to a more advanced course in English Language Teaching.<br />
			It sets the scene and gets you thinking 
			about what you need to know and whether you are ready for the 
			demands of this most prestigious qualification.<br />
			Before you go on, if you have not already done so, you will be wise 
			to read through the Delta overview so talk of Modules and so on will 
			not be mysterious.&nbsp;

			<p>Mastery of your profession requires more than a short course and 
			a bit of experience.&nbsp; In outline, mastery also involves:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Subject knowledge: mastery of the structure, grammar, 
				phonology, genres 
				and text types of English and a knowledge of how it differs from 
				other languages.</li>
				<li>Procedural knowledge: mastery of a range of teaching 
				approaches and techniques.</li>
				<li>Methodological knowledge: a thorough understanding of the 
				theoretical underpinnings of a range of approaches and methods 
				in ELT and the ability to link this understanding to classroom 
				practice, course design and planning, including assessment and 
				evaluation of learners' skills and knowledge.</li>
				<li>The ability to consider and take into account specific 
				learner needs.</li>
				<li>The ability to consider and take into account the needs and 
				requirements of other stakeholder (sponsors, parents, national 
				educational authorities etc.).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>(For more, see
			<a href="../articles/articles1/ELT_Concourse_The_expert_teacher.pdf" target="_blank">
			the article on what mastery involves</a>.)</p>
			<p>No initial course can provide you with more than a superficial 
			understanding of these areas but if you want to call yourself a 
			fully qualified professional you need an in-depth understanding of 
			all of them.<br />
			Many of these will be covered on other sorts of courses such as MAs 
			in TESOL but few will combine theoretical understanding with an 
			assessment of the ability to put ideas into practice.&nbsp; It is 
			also worth noting that, expensive though they are, Delta courses 
			are around one half to one quarter of the cost of a master's 
			degree.</p>
			<p>The other obvious reasons for taking a course include the fact 
			that the qualification will allow you to progress professionally 
			into academic management, teacher training, materials writing and 
			marketing.&nbsp; Without a qualification at this level, you will be 
			hampered if your ambitions lie beyond the classroom.</p>
		
			<p>Many people feel that having their initial qualification and a 
			few years' solid experience behind them is all they need to be a 
			competent and efficient teacher of English.&nbsp; In some cases, 
			that's true.<br />
			However, Delta is not a super CELTA &ndash; it is <strong>
			qualitatively</strong> different as well as requiring more of you.&nbsp; 
			The difference is:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>An initial training course (such as CELTA) begins 
				from the premise that you know nothing about teaching.<br />
				A Delta course starts from the premise that you have acquired 
				through training and/or experience a range of essential teaching behaviours 
				and seeks to build on that.</li>
				<li>An initial course relies on tutors modelling teaching 
				procedures and techniques and getting the trainees to copy what 
				they do.&nbsp; Feedback on your practice comes from others.<br />
				A Delta course focuses on your classroom behaviour and planning 
				skills to refine them and develop in you more alternatives and 
				procedures.&nbsp; Feedback comes from others and from your own 
				reflection on your practice.</li>
				<li>An initial course provides the minimum theoretical 
				background needed for specific lessons and classroom procedures.<br />
				A Delta course requires you to do extensive reading and research 
				fully to master the underlying principles of what you do or plan 
				to do in the classroom.</li>
				<li>An initial course is incremental in building on each stage 
				of your training in the expectation that this will lead to some 
				professional competence by the end of the course.<br />
				A Delta course requires you to reflect on your own teaching and 
				seek ways to improve and develop your skills leading to mastery 
				of the skills you need.</li>
				<li>CELTA (and one other recognised initial qualification) is at 
				Level 5 of the Ofqual scheme in Britain, i.e., at 
				the same level as a foundation degree or higher education 
				diploma, and is a taught course in its entirety.<br />
				Delta is at Level 7 of the same scheme, i.e., at the same 
				level as a Master's degree, and requires much more independent 
				work and study.<br />
				</li>
			</ol>

			professional competence – but the level and the ways of getting 
			there differ markedly.</p>

			<p>Ideally, you should have an initial teaching qualification plus 
			<span class="style_underline">at least</span> one year's experience, preferably in more than one setting 
			and with a range of types of learners.&nbsp; However, many course 
			providers will bend these requirements slightly if they believe that 
			you have other, compensating, skills and experience and a good chance 
			of being successful.&nbsp; Other providers may require more, such as 
			a first degree.</p>
			<p>To enter for Modules One and Three of the Delta scheme, <strong>you don't 
			need to take a course at all</strong> so there are no minimum qualifications 
			and background experience requirements.</p>
			<p>Additionally, you are required to write, in suitable academic 
			style over 14,000 words during a Module Two course, not including lesson plans, 
			so the ability to use English competently and appropriately is 
			vital.<br />
			That applies whether you are a native or a 
			non-native speaker of English.<br />
			Within the Delta section there is

			guide to writing style for Delta</a> (and any other course at a 
			similar level).</p>

			<p>The only Module of the Delta for which you must take some kind of 
			course is Module Two, which includes teaching practice and needs to 
			be overseen by a qualified tutor.<br />
			You do not have to take a course for Modules One and Three and there 
			is a complete, free Module One course on this site (linked in the list of related guides at the end and
			<a href="inservice/delta/mod1/m1course/m1courseindex.html" target="_blank">
			here</a>).&nbsp; Many people do, however, opt to take courses for 
			Modules One and Three and there are good ones (and some of the other 
			sort).</p>
			<p>What follows is entirely independent advice.&nbsp; This site is

					<h3><strong>Face-to-face courses</strong></h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>These are the most common, and the most popular, and there 
				are centres worldwide offering various forms of face-to-face 
				courses for some or all the Delta Modules.<br />Most of these will be enhanced by a form of on-line facility 
				(often something like a Moodle site) but all assessments of 
				teaching will be done by qualified tutors.<br />On most of these courses, too, you will have access to a decent 
				ELT library and other resources.<br />You will also, probably, have the opportunity for face-to-face 
				tutorials with tutors to sort out any difficulties, give you an 
				honest evaluation of your progress and provide advice and 
				support.<br />On these courses, it is the centre which arranges for an external 
				assessor.<br />Face to face courses come in three sorts although there are 
				variations:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li>Intensive courses run full-time, typically over an 8- or 
					10-week period.&nbsp; These courses allow you to focus on 
					the demands of Delta without the distraction of working to 
					support yourself.&nbsp; There is usually a good camaraderie 
					among participants.&nbsp; The learners who form the 
					teaching-practice classes are generally recruited in the 
					same way as on initial courses such as CELTA and are often 
					motivated and friendly volunteers.<br />If you are taking a course like this away from your home 
					base, you need to factor in the costs of accommodation and 
					that can be quite variable.</li>
				<li>Semi-intensive courses run typically over 16 to 20 
					weeks.&nbsp; These courses are for people who have good 
					time-management skills and can focus on the course as well 
					as holding down a job to pay the bills.&nbsp; Usually, you 
					will have to commit to at least two long evening sessions 
					every week and there will often be a number of weekend 
					sessions as well.&nbsp; On these courses, you will normally 
					teach your own students in your own institution with the 
					tutors travelling to you.&nbsp; That's an advantage many 
					people underestimate.</li>
				<li>Extended courses run over an academic year (at least 9 
					months) or longer in some cases.&nbsp; On these courses, you 
					will usually have to attend at least one evening session a 
					week but there may be breaks in the programme.&nbsp; On 
					these courses, too, you will usually teach your own students 
					in your own institution.&nbsp; If you take a course like 
					this, you need to be confident that you will be in a 
					teaching job in the area for the duration of the course.</li>
			</ol>

			</table>
			<p>Preparation for Module One (which is assessed through a written 
				examination) and for Module Three (which is assessed through an 
				externally marked long essay) is reasonably straightforward for 
				on-line course providers.&nbsp; There are lots of paid-for 
			online courses for those two Modules of the Delta but this site has 
			one which is free.</p>
			<p>Clearly, however, the first hurdle such courses need to overcome 
				is how to assess, support and evaluate teaching practice in 
				Module Two when no qualified tutor is available to observe and 
				report on teaching assignments.<br />
			Centres running distance-learning programmes for Delta Module Two 
			have developed a variety of solutions to this issue:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Local Tutors<br />
				These sorts of courses 
				rely on a network of local tutors who are not, for the most 
				part, Delta accredited tutors but they are Delta qualified, or 
				should be.<br />
				On these courses, it is usually the candidate's responsibility 
				to find a local tutor who will observe teaching, give 
				feedback according to Cambridge's criteria and be able to help 
				and advise with lesson planning, preparation and other Delta 
				Module Two demands.<br />
				Local tutors are, normally, trained by the main 
				course provider but you need to bear in mind that such people 
				are not trained, standardised or monitored by anyone else.&nbsp; 
				Quality is inevitably variable and the feedback you receive on 
				your essays, preparation and teaching may not be fully in line 
				with how an external assessor may apply the criteria.<br />
				External assessors for the Delta cannot and will not take poor 
				local-tutor advice into consideration when assessing for Module 
				Two.&nbsp; If the advice you have been given is inadequate, you 
				may not pass despite your best efforts.<br />
				Better centres also insist that local tutors fulfil a number of 
				other requirements.&nbsp; Check what these are before you 
				entrust a centre with your money.&nbsp; These often include but 
				are not limited to:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>Holding a Delta, DTEFLA (Delta's predecessor) or an MA 
					in Applied Linguistics or another qualification such as The 
					Trinity Diploma in Teaching English to Speakers of Other 
					Languages (DipTESOL).&nbsp; You should remember that 
					claiming to hold the Delta means that you have passed 
					<strong>all 
					three</strong> modules which make it up.</li>
					<li>Being very experienced.&nbsp; This usually means 
					experience of teaching a wide range of levels in a variety 
					of settings.</li>
					<li>Having previous teacher training experience.&nbsp; This 
					means working as an academic manager involved in training and 
					supervising teachers, giving talks and seminars, leading 
					workshops and working on teacher development programmes.&nbsp; 
					This experience will usually also mean having been 
					extensively involved 
					in observing and evaluating teaching.<br />
					Be aware that having been a CELTA trainer is not usually 
					considered enough for this role.</li>
					<li>Undertaking a training programme.&nbsp; This usually 
					means taking a fairly rigorous course often involving many 
					hours of online work and assignment writing.&nbsp; If the 
					centre you are considering giving your money to does not run 
					a decent training course for local tutors, think carefully.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Induction courses<br />
				Some, not all, distance-learning course providers offer the 
				opportunity to take a one- or two-week induction course during 
				which there will be the opportunity for your teaching to be 
				observed by a properly qualified and experienced Delta tutor.&nbsp; 
				This may involve extra costs but has obvious benefits.</li>
				<li>Monitoring<br />
				Good providers will, as a matter of course, carefully monitor 
				the performance of local tutors to ensure that all written work 
				is being fairly assessed in accordance with the criteria and 
				that the advice and feedback you are getting is up to the 
				standard required.&nbsp; Make sure you check that this is the 
				case.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are fewer of these sorts of courses.&nbsp; The Cambridge site where you can 
			find a course provider lists three distance-learning courses and 
			they differ little in how the course is delivered.&nbsp; Click
			<a href="https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/find-a-centre/find-a-teaching-centre/" target="_blank">
			here</a> to go to that site.<br />
			If the centre you are considering is not listed on that site, be 
			very careful to ensure that the standards of local tutors and 
			monitoring are adequate.&nbsp; Delta is not a cheap option.</p>
			<h4>Problems you may face<br />
			<img alt="problem" height="133" src="images/problems_b200.gif" width="200" /></h4>
			<p>If you decide to all or part of your Delta <em>via</em> an 
			on-line course provider, there are some issues to consider:</p>
			<ol class="greenbullet">
				<li>On distance-learning courses you will often have to pay the expenses for 
				an external assessor to come to you and that can be very costly 
				in parts of the world where no assessor is locally based 
				and an assessor may have to travel long distances to get to you.</li>
				<li>If you are working somewhere which does not have a good ELT 
				library or in a place where no such resources are available, you 
				also need to factor in the considerable costs of buying a range of reference 
				materials.</li>
				<li>You will not, usually, have the opportunity to interact with 
				people in the same position as you and bounce ideas around.</li>
				<li>You will not have face-to-face contact with someone who can 
				advise and help.&nbsp; Distance-learning tutors are not 
				available all the time.</li>
				<li>Because there may be large distances (and time zones) 
				separating you from the centre's staff, you may find that they 
				are unable to appreciate the peculiarities of your setting.</li>
				<li>Your local tutor may not be adequately experienced or 
				trained and be applying the criteria for assessment differently 
				from the way Cambridge-appointed assessors for Module Two apply 
				them.</li>
				<li>You have no way to know who is marking your written work or 
				what their levels of training, expertise and experience are.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Whichever form of course you opt for, the factors to consider are 
			the same.&nbsp; You may also like to look at
			<a href="inservice/delta/delta_faqs.html" target="_blank">the guide 
			to frequently asked questions about the Delta</a>.</p>
			<h3><strong>Questions to ask and centres to avoid<br />
			<img alt="ask" height="133" src="images/animals_meerkat_ask200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></h3>
			<p>Regrettably, Delta has become much like any other commodity.&nbsp; 
			You get, if you are careful and fortunate, what you pay for.&nbsp; 
			There are many dedicated, well-informed and able tutors who will 
			work hard to help you succeed and a few of the other sort, too.<br />
			Most organisations who offer Delta courses are doing it to make a 
			profit.&nbsp; If you appreciate that, you can approach the choices 
			with a suitably sceptical attitude.<br />
			If you take your car to a garage for repair, you do not want the 
			mechanics to learn how to fix it by practising on your vehicle.&nbsp; 
			So it is with Delta.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Is the centre up to date?<br />
				If there's a reading list or a library list, how many of the 
				books and references are up to date?<br />
				Trust nobody who calls the qualification DELTA instead of 
				Delta.&nbsp; It hasn't been called DELTA for over a decade so 
				anyone still using the old upper-case letters for it is simply 
				sloppy or not paying attention.</li>
				<li>Does the centre run a course for Module Two?<br />
				Do not trust a centre which only offers Modules One and/or 
				Three.&nbsp; They know, and so do you now, that you don't need 
				to do a course at all for these modules and there is <strong>no</strong> 
				oversight from Cambridge regarding the tutors or the content of 
				courses ostensibly preparing for Modules One or Three.&nbsp; It 
				is, however, a good way for some organisations to make a few 
				pennies (yours, in this case).</li>
				<li>Are the tutors accredited?<br />
				A centre that can't also offer preparation for Module Two 
				may not have properly qualified tutors (that's why it isn't 
				accredited to run a course for Module Two).<br />
				This is not to say that there aren't good courses out there for 
				Modules One and Three, just that there are more of the other 
				sort.</li>
				<li>Are the tutors qualified and experienced?<br />
				Delta is a Master's degree level qualification.&nbsp; You 
				will be wise to check that the tutors a centre employs are up to 
				the demands of teaching at that level.&nbsp; The main course 
				tutor, at least, should be someone with many years of experience 
				teaching at this level.<br />
				Cambridge Assessment English does not have minimum qualifications for tutors and some 
				are more able, more experienced and more qualified than others.</li>
				<li>What are the centre's pass rates?<br />
				Be deeply sceptical of any centre that won't give you 
				specific details about their pass rates.&nbsp; Pass rates may 
				not be a precise guide to quality but it's the best measure you 
				have.<br />
				Low pass rates may mean<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>that a centre is so desperate to recruit people (and 
					take their money) that they are taking people on to a course 
					who have no realistic chance of passing or</li>
					<li>that the centre has poor, ill-informed tutors who are 
					not giving people proper advice and not planning a course in 
					a way that allows you the opportunity to build on and 
					develop your knowledge and skills or</li>
					<li>both.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>How does the centre select candidates?<br />
				Do not trust a centre that does not interview properly or 
				give you a pre-interview task to complete that really tests you.&nbsp; 
				If candidates are too casually selected, you may find yourself 
				working with people who simply don't know enough or have the 
				right background for the course.&nbsp; This will deny you the 
				opportunity to learn from your peers.</li>
				<li>Does the centre set out its and your responsibilities 
				clearly?<br />
				If a centre can't give you with a proper contract setting 
				out what the centre guarantees and what your responsibilities 
				are, walk away.</li>
				<li>What pre-course tasks are asked of you?<br />
				Good course providers will have a proper 
				pre-course task and reading list.&nbsp; Ask to see what they 
				have and how they will give you feedback on it.&nbsp; If the 
				centre provides nothing or just a list of books to read, consider walking away.&nbsp; 
				Good centres will provide a lot more direction than that and may 
				even give you a copy of what parts of what they think you should 
				read.</li>
				<li>Is the course too cheap?<br />
				Delta courses are expensive and you need to buy the best 
				quality you can afford.&nbsp; The cheaper a course is, the less 
				likely the centre will be able (or willing) to invest in high 
				quality tutors and decent reference resources and so on.&nbsp; 
				You are not buying a cheese sandwich.</li>
				<li>If you go for a distance-learning option:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>What training does the centre provide for local tutors?</li>
					<li>How are local tutors selected and accredited by the 
					centre?</li>
					<li>What qualifications does the centre demand of the local 
					tutor?</li>
					<li>Will the local tutor's advice and grading of assignments 
					be in line with the scheme's criteria for assessment?</li>
					<li>Who is checking?</li>

			<p>The majority of people opt to take a full course for Delta, 
			preparing for all three Modules at the same time.&nbsp; There is no 
			requirement to do this because you can enter independently for 
			Modules One and Three and you can take the Modules in whatever order 
			you like.&nbsp; Only Module Two, because it involves assessment of 
			practical teaching skills, requires you to take a course at (or at a 
			distance from) a 
			recognised centre with accredited tutors.<br />
			Once you have decided how you are going to do the Delta, here are 
			some places to go on this site to prepare you in terms of language 
			and skills analysis, methodological background, terminology and 
			practice.<br />
