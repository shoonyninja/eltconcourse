			<p>In the list above, we have examples of all the four major word 
			classes which are meaning carrying or content words.&nbsp; We can 
			also call them content lexemes.<br />
			They are:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. a verb (<em>carrying</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. a noun or a verb (<em>chance</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. another noun (<em>happiness</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. an adjective (<em>probableish</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. an adverb (<em>cosily</em>)<br />
			and in what follows, we will discover more about these essential 
			word classes.</p>

			<p>We saw in Unit 2 that words like these are open-class items.&nbsp; 
			That means, of course, that we can never come up with a completely 
			comprehensive list of any of these classes of words because as soon 
			as we think we have a list someone will say <em>goodlookingish</em> 
			or <em>thingummydoobrie</em> and the list is instantly incomplete.</p>

					<h3><strong>A note about words and phrases</strong></h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>In what follows we will usually be considering single words 
			(because it's easier and more straightforward) so we have, for 
			example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>house</em> as a noun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>go</em> as a verb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>red</em> as an adjective<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>soon</em> as an adverb<br />
			but we also need to remember that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>garden tools</em> is a noun phrase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>wind surf</em> is a verb phrase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>red coloured</em> is an adjective phrase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>from time to time</em> is an adverb phrase<br />
			so we should really be talking about noun, verb, adjective and 
			adverb <span class="style_underline"><strong><em>phrases</em></strong></span>, 
			not words because the slot test we saw in Unit 2 for word class will 
			work whether the item is a single word or a phrase <strong>acting as
			</strong>a single word.<br />
			We won't complicate matters everywhere in this unit but you need to 
			bear that in mind.<br />
			(Unit 8 of this course considers phrases in a bit more detail.)</p>

					take a plural and can come with a singular or plural verb 
					form.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two
					<span class="style_black">cows</span> over there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has a new <span class="style_black">car</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the first <span class="style_black">problem</span> we 
					need to solve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have four good <span class="style_black">neighbours</span></em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>mass nouns<br />
					refer to things we do not count and come only in the 
					singular (except in some special uses).&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span class="style_black">
					furniture</span> is worn out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like some <span class="style_black">coffee</span>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy <span class="style_black">running</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has no <span class="style_black">time</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are taking <span class="style_black">food</span> with us</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					For more about the difference between count and mass nouns, 
					read on.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Proper nouns</strong><br />
				are usually spelled with a capital letter (in English) and refer 
				to people, jobs, times and places.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke to <span class="style_black">Fred</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is the <span class="style_black">Chief Executive Officer</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on <span class="style_black">Monday</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to <span class="style_black">Berlin</span></em><br />
				There are some special rules for these, explained below.</li>
				<li><strong>Collective nouns</strong><br />
				refer to groups of people and things and can be either singular 
				or plural.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They have joined a new <span class="style_black">class</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She keeps a <span class="style_black">flock</span> of sheep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span class="style_black">police</span> are coming soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span class="style_black">government</span> is about to 
				fall</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She served in three 
				<span class="style_black">brigades</span></em><br />

			<p><strong>Proper nouns</strong> are the names for people and 
			places.&nbsp; They usually begin with a Capital letter.&nbsp; There 
			is a range of types and a number of difficulties for learners and 
			teachers:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><strong>People</strong><ul class="greenbullet" >
					<li class="greenbullet"><em>Mary, Tiger Woods, Mr Smith, Uncle 
				Fred</em> 
				etc.<br />
					English does not use an article with proper nouns for people 
					unless we are distinguishing two people with the same name 
					as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>No, I don't mean the John who works in IT, I mean the 
					John from Finance.</em><br />
					Many languages routinely use an article with people's names 
					so elementary learners in particular may say something 
					like.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*I'll talk to the Mr Smith<br />
					</em>English can use an article with names if there is some 
					restriction:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the young King Edward, the old Mr 
					Smith</em> etc.<br />
					English, exceptionally, uses the articles with some titles:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Duke of Westminster<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Reverend Smith</em><br />
					but not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the Bishop Smith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the Lord Michael</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="bluebullet"><strong>Jobs and Positions</strong><ul class="greenbullet">
					<li class="greenbullet"><em class="greenbullet">The President, The Pope, 
					The Managing Director, The Queen</em> etc.<br />We usually put 
					the definite article, <em>the</em>, before these nouns 
					because there is only one of them that is the reference 
					(although, of course, there are a number of presidents, 
					queens, kings, prime ministers and so on, but both speaker 
					and listener know which one is the topic).</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="bluebullet"><strong>Times</strong><ul class="greenbullet">
					<li class="greenbullet"><em>Monday, February, the summer, 
					Christmas, Easter</em></li>
					<li class="greenbullet">Capitalisation:<br />
					Days, months and festivals are capitalised but seasons are 
					generally not capitalised in English (other languages do 
					things differently).</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">Article use:<br />
					When the noun is used with a unique meaning for days, months 
					and festivals, the article is omitted:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>On Monday, in February 1934, at Christmas </em>etc.<br />
					When the nouns are restricted in some way, the article is 
					used, especially with the adjectives <em>previous</em> and
					<em>following</em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;the previous March, the following Christmas, the May of 
					1986, the Monday afterwards<br />
					</em>Seasons are a little tricky.&nbsp; They usually 
					function as common countable nouns, see below, and take the 
					article normally:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy the summers here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The winter is always harsh in Scotland</em><br />
					They can, however, function like other times and the article 
					is then omitted:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came in spring and stayed till 
					autumn</em></li>
					<li class="greenbullet">Plurals:<br />
					Days of the week and seasons regularly take plurals:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent many summers in Spain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I get bored on Sundays</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Places and buildings etc.</strong><ul class="greenbullet">
					<li class="greenbullet"><em>Britain, Germany, 
				Margate, London, Lake Victoria, Jamaica, The Thames, The Suez 
				Canal, Baker Street, St Paul's Cathedral, The Tate Gallery </em>etc.<br />
					The use of the article is idiomatic in English (not so in 
					many languages) so this is a cause of a good deal of error.&nbsp; 
					There are some rules of thumb, however:<ul class="greenbullet">
						<li><strong>rivers, mountain ranges</strong> and 
							<strong>canals<br /></strong>We usually put <em>the</em> before these:
							<em>The Thames, The Nile, The Himalayas, The Alps, 
							The Suez Canal, The Panama Canal</em></li>
						<li><strong>lakes, countries, islands, streets</strong> and 
							<strong>cities<br /></strong>We do not usually put 
						<em>the</em> before 
							these:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lake Tanganyika, France, Crete, 
						Rome</em><br />But we <strong>do</strong> put <em>the</em> in front of the 
							name of the country if it contains a classifying adjective like
						<em>united</em> or <em>Arab</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States 
							of America, The United Kingdom, The Federal Republic 
							of Germany, The United Arab Emirates<br />
						</em>One or two countries have, in the past, been used 
						with an article but the practice is dying out: <em>The 
						Sudan, The Argentine, The Gambia</em>, for example.<br />
						There are some exceptions including:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The Hague, the Bronx, the City (of London), the Strand, 
						The Mall </em>etc.</li>
						<li><strong>buildings</strong> and <strong>mountains</strong><br />This is 
						a very idiomatic area and not easy to learn or teach because 
						there are rules of use rather than rules of grammar.&nbsp; 
						Again, a classifying adjective denoting the name of the 
						building or mountain will usually compel the use of the 
						article.<br /><em>The Guggenheim Museum, The British 
						Museum, Scotland 
				Yard, Mont Blanc, The Eiger</em></li>
						<li><strong>continents</strong><br />Do not usually take the article and are always 
						capitalised so:<br />
						<em>Asia, Europe, (South) America, Antarctica</em> etc.<br />
						but<br />
						<em>the Antarctic, the Arctic</em></li>
						<li><strong>directions<br />
						</strong>Usually take an article as in, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The north west</em><br />
						etc.<br />
						Most writers do not capitalise these but some do.</li>

			<p>In all languages, some nouns are used for groups of things or 
			people.&nbsp; In English, these can be both singular and plural but 
			in most languages they are only singular.&nbsp; For 
			example, in English, we can say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The army <span class="style_black"><strong>is</strong></span> very large </em> (thinking about it as a single thing)<br />
			and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The army <span class="style_black"><strong>are</strong></span> helping </em> (thinking about 
			the army as a lot of 
			individual people)<br />
			We can also have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The football team <span class="style_black">
			<strong>are</strong></span> playing 
			on Sunday<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The football team <span class="style_black">
			<strong>is</strong></span> playing on Sunday<br />
			</em>In the first one, we are thinking about all the players 
			separately; in the second one we are thinking of 
			<span class="style_black">it</span> as a single 
			unit, the team.<br />Other collective nouns are, e.g., <em>navy, crew, flock, herd, staff, 
			family, committee, 
			government, class, staff </em>etc.<br />
			In American English these 
			words are normally used with a singular verb as is the case in most 
			languages.</p>

			<p>The distinction between these two types of nouns either does not 
			exist at all in some languages or is very differently handled.&nbsp; 
			The problems for learners in this area are extensive.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Most nouns in English are count nouns.&nbsp; Count nouns have a 
			singular (for one) and plural (for more than one).&nbsp; This means 
			we can say, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have three pencils<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I want that pencil<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The pencil is here<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Those pencils are no good<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Please give me a pencil<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I have several pencils on the desk<br /></em>Count nouns cannot usually appear in the singular without an 
			article (<em>a(n)</em> or <em>the</em>) so we do not find:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Pencil is needed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Person is here</em><br />etc.</li>
				<li>Many nouns in English are mass nouns.&nbsp; These nouns do not 
			have a plural.&nbsp; We can say, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want that milk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I have some milk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The milk is here<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			This milk is bad<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Please give me some milk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I have some milk in the glass<br /></em>Mass nouns always use a singular verb and never take a plural.</li>

			<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_mass_nouns.pdf" target="_blank">this 
			link</a>.</p>
			<p>It is possible, of course, to make mass nouns countable by the 
			addition of what is called a partitive or a quantifier as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three hours' sleep<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			a piece of iron<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			a bar of chocolate<br />

			two means of transportation<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			pints of milk<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			drifts of snow</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			As you see, however, the choice of quantifier or partitive is 
			not an easy one to make.</p>

			This unit is to do with content lexemes or lexical words, not 
			function words but, unfortunately, verbs happen to occur in both 
			categories.<br />
			Here we will focus on what are usually called Main Verbs but you 
			should know now that there are two other basic sorts of verbs.&nbsp; 
			Unit 6 looks at Primary auxiliary verbs (<em>be, have, do, get</em>) 
			and Unit 9 looks at Modal auxiliary verbs (<em>may, might, can, 
			should</em> etc.).</p>
			<p>
			For our purposes here, there are two forms of verbs that 
			behave rather differently:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Copular or linking verbs</strong><br />
				These verbs act to link a noun to an attribute or a noun to 
				another noun.&nbsp; The verbs <strong class="style_red">in red</strong> 
				in these examples are copular verbs:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John <span class="style_red"><strong>is</strong>
				</span>happy<br />

			<p>Copular verbs have some quite peculiar characteristics in terms 
			of what they may link together and if you want to know more, there 
			is a guide, linked below, which analyses them more thoroughly than is 
			possible here.<br />
			The only verb which can be described as the pure copular verb is <em>
			be</em> and it is the most flexible and frequently used in this 
			function.&nbsp; It is sometimes described as the colourless copula 
			because it carries no intrinsic meaning.<br />
			The verbs <em>be, become, remain, stay</em> and<em> end up </em>are 
			all quite versatile and can 
			be used:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>to link together a noun and an adjective (called the 
				attribute) as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was angry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He became unhappy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They remained dissatisfied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed happy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ended up frozen</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>to link a noun to another noun as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tree was an ash<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary became a gardener<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They remained students here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stayed a soldier<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ended up a prisoner<br />
				</em>The important issue here is that the two noun phrases refer 
				to the same thing or person so <em>the tree</em> and <em>ash</em> 
				are the same, as are <em>Mary </em>and <em>a gardener</em> and 
				so on.&nbsp; The term for this is that they are <strong>co-referential</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Other common copular verbs cannot link two nouns and only work to 
			link a noun and an adjective.&nbsp; The common ones are <em>seem, 
			appear, sound, smell, taste </em>and <em>feel</em>.<br />
			This means we do not allow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*She seemed a doctor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She appeared a doctor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It sounded a pop song<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It smelt fresh air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It tasted apples<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It felt silk<br />
			</em>but we allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She seemed content<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She appeared angry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sounded awful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It smelt fresh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It tasted delicious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It felt smooth</em></p>
			<p>Here's a list of some common copular verbs with examples divided into those 
			which describe a current state and those which signal a change of 
			state (which is a good way to teach them):</p>

			<p>Main verbs are rather more complicated.<br />
			They come in three main sorts but some verbs can appear in more than 
			one category.&nbsp; The 
			first two categories are the really crucial ones.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Intransitive verbs</strong><br />
				<img alt="arrive" height="133" src="../../images/arrival200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Some verbs never take an object and can stand alone.&nbsp; We 
				can say, for example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrived at the airport<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I responded<br />
				</em>etc.,
				and 
				the meaning is clear.<br />
				However, for example, we cannot say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She arrived the hotel<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It occurred the rain<br />
				</em>because neither of these verbs 
				can refer to a noun directly, i.e., they cannot take an object.&nbsp; We can, and frequently do, 
				insert a preposition to get, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came<strong> to</strong> the hotel<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It occurred <strong>towards</strong> the end of December<br />
				</em>but the verb is still not taking 
				an object in these cases.<br />
				Other examples of generally intransitive verbs include<br /><em>agree, appear, belong, collapse, die, disappear, exist, 
				fall, go, happen, inquire, laugh, live, look, remain, respond, 
				rise, sit, sleep, stand, stay, vanish, wait.<br />
				</em>Most of these can be followed by a prepositional phrase 
				such as<em> about the weather, at six o'clock, of hunger </em>
				and so on but these are <strong>not</strong> objects of the 
				verb.&nbsp; Technically, they are referred to as <strong>
				complements</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Transitive verbs</strong><br />
				<img alt="bring" height="133" src="../../images/present_hand_flowers_a200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Verbs which are always transitive must have an object complement.<br />
				For example, we cannot have a sentence such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He brought<br />
				</em>and we must insert an object and get:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He brought some flowers<br />
				</em>because the verb <em>bring</em> must have an object to make any sense.&nbsp; We need to 
				know both who or what did it and what or who it was done to.<br />
				Other examples of generally transitive verbs include: <em>buy, 
				cost, get, give, make, owe, pass, show, take, tell.<br />
				</em>We can divide transitive verbs into two more categories:<ol>
					<li>Those transitive verbs which can take only one object.&nbsp; 
					These are called <strong>monotransitive</strong> verbs.&nbsp; 
					For example, we can say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drank the coffee<br />
					</em>but 
					not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She drank me the coffee</em>.<br />
					Other examples 
					of verbs which only take one object when they are transitive 
					include <em>eat, say, play, expect, remember, suspect</em>.</li>
					<li>Those transitive verbs which can take two objects.&nbsp; These 
					are verbs which are <strong>ditransitive</strong>.&nbsp; For 
					example, we can say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bought the drinks<br />
					</em>and that's 
					a verb with a single object (<em>the drinks</em>) but we can 
					also say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bought us the drinks<br />
					</em>and here we have 
					two objects, <em>the drinks</em> (the <strong>direct object</strong>) 
					and <em>us</em> (the <strong>indirect object</strong>).<br />
					Another example is<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sold me the car<br />
					</em>which has a 
					direct object (<em>the car</em>) and an indirect object (<em>me</em>).<br />
					We can also change the order and put the 
					indirect object at the end but then we have to insert a 
					preposition:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bought the drinks for us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
					sold the car to me<br />
					</em>Other examples of verbs which can or even must be 
					ditransitive include:<br /><em>allow, appoint, ask, 
					assure, award, bake, bet, bring, buy, call, cause, charge, 
					cook, cost, cut, deal, do, draw, feed, find, get, give, 
					hand, lend, make, offer, order, owe, pass, pay, promise, 
					read, save, sell, send, show, teach, tell, throw, wish, 
					write<br />
					</em>In English, the indirect object comes before the direct 
					object but that is not always the case in other languages.<br />
					There is more about subjects and objects in Unit 5 of this 
					course.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Verbs which can be both transitive and intransitive</strong><br />
				These verbs, and there are lots of them, can be both.&nbsp; They 
				are called <strong>ambivalent</strong> verbs.<br />
				For example, we can say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She eats </em>(intransitive)<br />
				and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She eats fish (</em>transitive).<br />
				Other 
				examples in this category include<br /><em>drink, explain, help, 
				decide, fly, smoke, swim, play, continue.</em></li>
			</ol>

			</table>
			<p>Although there are lots of irregular verbs in English (around 
			200), learning them is not particularly difficult because the verbs 
			only have one or two changes at most.<br />
			In some languages, such as most European ones, life is much more 
			complicated and it may be necessary to learn more than ten forms for 
			each irregular verbs.<br />
			In English there are three forms of all main verbs:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The base form of the verb:<br />
				All verbs, irregular or not have this form.&nbsp; Examples are:<br />
				<em>arrive, go, be, enjoy, buy, sleep</em> etc.</li>
				<li>The past tense form:<br />
				These are either regular, adding <em>-d</em> after a base form 
				ending in <em>e</em> or <em>-ed</em> after any other letter or 
				they are irregular.&nbsp; 
				Examples are:<br />
				<em>arrived, went, was/were, enjoyed, bought, slept </em>etc.</li>
				<li>The past participle form:<br />
				These are again regular or irregular but if they are regular, 
				they always have the same form as the past tense and even when 
				they are irregular, most of the verbs retain the same form as 
				the past tense.&nbsp; Examples are:<br />
				<em>arrived, gone, been, enjoyed, bought, slept </em>etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To make things even easier, there are only a few verbs which are 
			truly irregular and most fall into groups with similar sounds which 
			often rhyme.&nbsp; So, for example we encounter:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style16">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style15">Verbs which never change</td>
				<td class="auto-style15"><em>put, cut, cost, rid</em> etc.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style15">Verbs adding <em>-t</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style15"><em>smell-smelt, learn-learnt, spill-spilt</em> etc.</td>

				<td class="auto-style15">Verbs adding <em>-t</em>

				<td class="auto-style15">Verbs changing /ɪ/ to /ʌ/</td>
				<td class="auto-style15"><em>cling-clung, dig-dug, win-won</em> etc.</td>

				<p>In many course books and other reference materials, you will 
				find an alphabetic list of irregular verbs and that is helpful 
				for reference but not so helpful for learners because it hides 
				the patterns.<br />

			<li><em>The audience was <span class="style_black"><strong>fascinated</strong></span> by the <span class="style_black">
			<strong>short</strong></span> lecture.</em></li>
		</ol>
			<p>Some are easier to identify than others, aren't they?&nbsp; Here 
			are some comments:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style25">
				<li><span class="style_brown">Adjectives in English usually come 
				before the noun they modify.&nbsp; We can see this with </span>
				<em><span class="style_black">tall</span><span class="style_brown"> 
				trees, </span><span class="style_black">fierce</span><span class="style_brown"> 
				winds, </span><span class="style_black">first</span><span class="style_brown">

				<span class="auto-style75">and</span> </span>
				<span class="style_black"> short</span><span class="style_brown"> 
				lecture.</span></em><span class="style_brown"><br />
				This use of adjectives is called <strong>attributive</strong>.<br />
				Some adjectives are only used attributively.&nbsp; Examples are <em>
				entire, outright, pure</em>.&nbsp; We can have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ate the entire packet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the pure truth</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was an outright lie</em><br />
				but we can't say:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The packet was entire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				*The truth was pure<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The lie was outright</em></span></li>
				<li><span class="style_brown">In sentences 3. and 4., however, 
				we have the alternative adjective position: <em>looked </em>
				</span><em><span class="style_black">nervous</span><span class="style_brown">, 
				was </span><span class="style_black">fascinated</span></em><span class="style_brown">.<br />
				Here the adjectives follow the noun they modify and are 
				connected to it either by the verb <em>be</em> or by another 
				verb which works in the same way.&nbsp; These are called, 
				as we saw above in the section on verbs, <strong>copular verbs</strong> and 
				you now know that one of their functions is to 
				connect a noun with an adjective.<br />
				</span> When the adjective is connected to the noun in this way, the use
				of the adjective is called <strong>predicative</strong>.<br />
				Some adjectives can only be used predicatively.&nbsp; Examples 
				are <em>asleep, awake, alive, alert</em> etc.&nbsp; They start 
				with <em>a-</em>.&nbsp; We can't say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The asleep dog<br />
				</em>and we need to say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog is / was / seems asleep<br />
				</em>for example.</li>

			<p>There are two simple tests for adjectives:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>We can make comparatives either by adding -<em>er</em> or -<em>est</em> 
			or by putting <em>more</em> / <em>most</em> before them</li>
			<li>We can modify them with the adverb <em>very</em></li>

			<li>
			We 
			can have: <em>talle<strong>r</strong>, fierce<strong>r</strong>,
			<strong>more </strong>nervous,, <strong>more</strong> fascinated </em>
			and<em> short<strong>er</strong></em><br />
			However, we can't have <em>*firster, *more green-jacketed, *more 
			first-form.<br />
			</em>The reason is twofold:<ol class="auto-style66">
				<li>Some adjectives simply cannot be made more or less: you are 
				either <span class="style_black"> <em>first</em></span> or you aren't, something is either 
				<span class="style_black"><em>impossible</em></span> or it isn't.&nbsp; Such adjectives are called <strong>
				ungradable</strong>.<br />
				<strong>Ungradable adjectives</strong> include those which represent 
			an on-off, either-or distinction such as <em>first, 
			last, open, shut </em>etc.&nbsp; Something or 
			someone is either one or the other and there are no intermediate 
			stages.</li>
				<li>The second reason is that some adjectives tell us what 
				<strong>class</strong> 
				of thing we are dealing with.&nbsp; We can't have <em>*very <span class="style_black">green-jacketed</span></em>,
			<em>*<span class="style_black">very first form </span></em>etc. 
				because these are classifiers.<strong><br />
				Classifiers</strong> tell us what class or category of 
			object or person we are considering and they also cannot be graded.&nbsp; 
			The words include many nouns which are used as if they were 
			adjectives.&nbsp; They include, for example, words such as <em>
			French, electronic, school, plastic</em> and so on which come 
			immediately before the noun in most cases and also cannot be 
			compared.&nbsp; A car 
			can't be <em>*a very <span class="style_black">sports</span> car</em> 
			and we can't have <em>a very plastic cup</em>, for example.<br />
				An adjective which is not 
				a classifier is sometimes called an <strong>epithet</strong> to 
				distinguish it from a classifier.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>
			We can also have v<em>ery
			<span class="style_black">tall</span>, very
			<span class="style_black">fierce</span>, very
			<span class="style_black">nervous</span>, very
			<span class="style_black">short</span></em> and so on.&nbsp; There's 
			some argument whether we can have <em>very first</em> in 
			this sense, because <em>very</em> means <em>truly</em> here, or <em>very 
			fascinated</em> because <em>fascinated</em> is usually considered 
			too strong a word to be modified by <em>very</em>.&nbsp; Compare it 
			with <em>very amazing, very dreadful, very astounding</em> etc.<br />
			These adjectives, sometimes called <strong>extreme adjectives</strong>, are not 
			usually gradable with <em>very</em> (we prefer adverbs such as <em>
			completely, totally, extremely </em>etc. to modify them).</li>

		<p >Adjectives can be made comparative or superlative.<br />
		Comparative structures are, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary is </em><strong><em>taller</em></strong><em> 
		than John<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary is </em><strong><em>more intelligent</em></strong><em> 
		than me</em><br />
		Superlative structures single 
		out one as the highest form of the adjective, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is the <strong>fittest</strong> person for 
		the job<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the<strong> most ridiculous</strong> idea of them all<br />
		</em>The 
		rules for how we make the forms apply to both.</p>
		<p >English has two ways to compare adjectives:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			We can add -<em>er</em> or -<em>est</em> to the end of 
			the adjective (dropping an 'e' or changing 'y' to 'i' where we need 
			to).&nbsp; This is called <strong>inflexion</strong>.</li>
			<li>
			
			We can add <em>more</em> or <em>most</em> before the adjective.&nbsp; 
			This is called a <strong>periphrastic</strong> form.</li>
		</ol>

		Many books for students delight in giving complex and elaborate rules 
		for why we say, for example:</p>
		<ul class="greenbullet">
			<li><em>small, brown house<br />
			</em>not<br /><em>brown, small house</em></li>
			<li><em>tall citrus trees<br />
			</em>not<br /><em>citrus tall trees</em></li>
			<li><em>rude 
		English tourists<br />
			</em>not<br /><em>English rude tourists</em></li>
			<li><em>ugly, fat, porcelain, Chinese</em> <em>vases<br />
			</em>not<br />
			<em>porcelain, 
		Chinese, fat, ugly</em> <em>vases</em></li>
		</ul>
		<p>But actually the general rule is quite 
		simple.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp;
		Click when 
		<img alt="eye" class="verticalalignmiddle" height="16" src="../../../gfx/eyeopen.gif" width="16" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'ordering',0,'style.visibility','visible')" /> you have

		<div id="ordering" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
		
			<ol class="style_brown" >
			<li>Classifiers like, <span class="style_black"><em>English, Chinese</em></span> and&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>citrus</em></span> go closest 
			to the noun.&nbsp; Some classifiers are inseparable from the noun, 
			e.g., <em><span class="style_black">school</span>boys</em>.&nbsp; 
			They form a compound.</li>
			<li>Adjectives which are ungradable (i.e., cannot be more or less 
			so) come next.&nbsp; The example here is <span class="style_black">
			<em>porcelain</em></span>.&nbsp; Something is either <em>porcelain</em>  
			or it isn't.&nbsp; Often these relate to the material something is 
			made of.</li>
			<li>Adjectives which are gradable but not very arguable come next.&nbsp; 
			The examples here are <em><span class="style_black">fat </span> </em>and<em>
			</em>
			<span class="style_black"><em>tall</em></span>.</li>
			<li>Adjectives which are a matter of opinion come furthest from the 
			noun.&nbsp; The example here is <span class="style_black"><em>ugly</em></span> 
			(and probably, <span class="style_black"><em>rude</em></span>)).</li>

			<p>This category, a sub-category of time 
			adverbs, gets its own section because it is troublesome for learners.<br />
			There are two sorts of these adverbs:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				Adverbs of definite frequency:<br />
				These refer to measurable amounts of time and include, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I get the newspaper daily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She travels to London weekly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We meet annually</em><br />
				The normal position for these adverbs is at the end of a clause, 
				after the verb, its object or any prepositional phrase.<br />
				Placing the adverbs anywhere else usually results in non-English 
				or special emphasis.<br />
				Apart from <em>annually</em> and <em>seasonally</em>, these 
				adverbs also functions as adjectives:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a monthly meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a yearly trip<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a daily news broadcast</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>
				Adverbs of indefinite frequency:<br />
				These refer to how often something happens but not in measurable 
				terms.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seldom go to see her</em><br />
				<em>vs.</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I often go to see her</em><br />
				are comparably different but tell us nothing more than a rough 
				idea of frequency.&nbsp; We do not know if the speaker means 
				<em>daily, monthly, annually </em>or <em>seasonally</em>.<br />
				There are three issues with these adverbs:<ol class="auto-style66">
					<li>Strength:<br />
					It is a traditional classroom practice to place these on a 
					cline, like this:<br />
					<img alt="cline" height="135" src="../../imagesgraphics/frequency_adverbs.png" width="465" /><br />
					but that's only a guide because native speakers will often 
					disagree about where on the cline the adverbs occur.</li>
					<li>Sentence type:<ol class="auto-style67">
						<li>Two of the adverbs do not <strong>usually</strong> occur in negative 
						sentences:<br />
						We accept:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sometimes see my sister<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you occasionally meet your brother in London?</em><br />
						but not:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't sometimes see her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She does not occasionally meet her brother</em></li>
						<li>Four of these adverbs do not occur in questions or 
						negative sentences:<br />
						We accept<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hardly ever go to London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She scarcely ever asks for help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We seldom eat before seven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She rarely wants to eat out</em><br />
						but not, usually:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Do you hardly ever go to London?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't scarcely see her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She didn't seldom eat out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Does she rarely eat out?</em><br />
						etc.</li>
						<li>Because <em>never</em> is a true negator, it cannot 
						occur in a negative sentence so we do not allow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;*We don't never arrive on time<br />
						</em>but is does occur in questions as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you never have breakfast?</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Position:<ol class="auto-style67">
						<li>All these frequency adverbs usually appear before 
						the main verb and after any auxiliary verb so, we 
						accept, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seldom been to his house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can scarcely ever take the early train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sometimes work late</em><br />
						but not<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have been seldom to his house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We scarcely ever can take the early train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They work sometimes late</em></li>
						<li>They occur, however, <span class="style_underline">
						before</span> semi-modal auxiliary verbs<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She often has to come in early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is often able to help me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They seldom used to entertain guests<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They seldom dare to go</em></li>
						<li>They always follow the verb <em>be</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am always late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is never on time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are scarcely ever helpful</em></li>
						<li>The adverbs <em>often, usually, sometimes </em>and
						<em>occasionally</em> can occur at the end of clauses:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They work late in the office sometimes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She comes to the house occasionally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He complains about having no money often</em><br />
						Others in this category can occur at the end of clauses 
						but only with some special emphasis.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Two adverbs of frequency are not in the lists above because they 
			have special characteristics:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em><strong>generally</strong></em><br />
				This is an adverb of frequency but it is difficult to place it 
				on a cline because, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He generally doesn't come to see me = He 
				rarely comes to see me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She generally complains about the food = She usually 
				complains about the food.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you generally eat early? = Do you usually eat early</em><br />
				So, in positive and interrogative sentences, the word means <em>
				usually</em> but in negatives, it means <em>seldom</em> or <em>
				rarely</em>.</li>
				<li><strong><em>ever</em></strong><br />
				This is the positive form of <em>never</em> and occurs regularly 
				in questions to elicit a statement of frequency:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you ever go to the cinema?&nbsp; 
				Rarely, these days</em><br />
				It can also occur in negative sentences with the sense of <em>
				never</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't ever wait for an answer</em><br />
				and is generally in the sense of a complaint.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you can see, these adverbs have special characteristics which 
			are not parallelled in other languages and cause, in particular, 
			word-ordering problems for learners.&nbsp; Handle with care.</p>

			<p class="nomarginbottom">Most adverbs can be placed at the beginning 
			of clauses but doing so marks them for special emphasis in English.&nbsp; 
			In other languages, this is one of the normal positions for adverbs 
			and does not signify a special meaning.<br />
			When learners mistakenly place adverbs at the front of clauses, 
			therefore, they can give the wrong impression and a native speaker 
			of English may be puzzled about the emphasis which that position 
			implies.<br />
			Here are some examples of the four types of adverbs which can be 
			placed in the initial position:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequently, she works very late at the office<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daily, the rubbish is collected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carefully, she climbed the ladder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside, they sat in the sunshine</em><br />
			and all these examples, mark the adverb as particularly important.<br />
			They are also, as you see, separated from the rest of the clause with a 
			comma.<br />
			Adverbs of place, used this way often imply a whole clause so the 
			last example may be equivalent to:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they got outside, they sat in the 
			sunshine</em></p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">However, we do not allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Greatly, I liked the exhibition<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Slightly, she enjoyed the film</em><br />
			because:</p>
			<p class="auto-style72"><strong>Adverbs of degree can </strong><em>
			<strong><span class="style_underline">never</span></strong></em><strong> 
			be fronted.</strong></p>
			<p>It is not usually a very good idea to present fronted adverbs to 
			learners at lower levels because the special emphasis which is 
			implied may not be apparent to them.</p>

			<p>Adjectives, as you know, can usually be modified two ways to show 
			comparison or superlatives.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				By adding -<em>er</em> and -<em>est</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm older than her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's the youngest in the family</em></li>
				<li>
				By using <em>more</em> and <em>most</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hotel was more expensive than I 
				expected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the most beautiful painting</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Adverbs are a little different because they are almost always 
			compared using <em>more</em> and <em>most</em> so we do not say, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*He drive slowlier than me</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She came quicklier than her brother</em><br />
			but say:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove more slowly than me</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came more quickly than her brother</em></p>
			<p>However, there are two issues:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Some short adverbs which do not end in -<em>ly</em> can be used with 
				-<em>er</em> and -<em>est</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked harder than anyone else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove faster than I did.</em><br />
				The other common adverbs that take this form are: <em>near, 
				soon, late, early</em>.<br />
				The adverb <em>often</em> can be used both ways informally but 
				some people do not approve of <em>oftener</em>.</li>
				<li>In colloquial speech, we often hear short adverbs being 
				modified like adjectives (but it is considered wrong by most 
				people):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain fell heavier<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun shone brighter and brighter</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the classroom, the safest rule is that, apart from <em>fast,

			<p>We have to be careful to know how a word is used, what it means 
			to the speaker and what context it is used in.</p>
			<p>There is a good argument that no pairs of words can be absolute 
			synonyms because shades of meaning, grammatical forms or dialect use 
			will always distinguish them.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>sidewalk</em> and <em>pavement</em> may be synonymous 
				but the first is American dialect use and the second British 
				dialect use</li>
				<li><em>determined</em> and <em>pig-headed</em> may mean the 
				same in some settings but the second is much more negative</li>
				<li><em>conceal</em> and <em>hide</em> may have the same meaning 
				but you can't say <em>I concealed behind the curtain</em> and 
				you can say <em>I hid behind the curtain</em>.</li>
			</ul>
		
		
		<p>There are three types of antonymy which we considered above in the 
		task:</p>
		
		<img alt="antonymy 1" height="132" src="../../imagesgraphics/antonymy.png" width="310" /><br />
			<img alt="antonymy2" src="../../imagesgraphics/antonymy2.png" /><ul class="yellowbulletlist">
				<li>Gradable antonyms have meaning 
				relative to each other.&nbsp; For example, a mouse is a tiny 
				animal but huge compared to a microbe so <em>tiny</em> and <em>
				huge</em> are gradable antonyms.</li>
				<li>Converse antonyms imply their 
				counterparts so a <em>nurse</em> implies a <em>patient</em>, <em>
				inanimate</em> implies <em>animate</em> and so on.</li>
				<li>Complementary antonyms become 
				synonyms if you insert <em>not</em> before them.&nbsp; For 
				example, <em>clear</em> and <em>unclear</em> become synonyms with the insertion of 
				<em>not</em> (<em>not clear = unclear, clear = not unclear</em>).&nbsp; Other 
				types of antonyms don't exhibit this because <em>not male</em> ≠
				<em>female</em> (it could mean neuter) and <em>not old </em>≠
				<em>young</em> (it could mean <em>middle aged, quite new </em>
				and many other things).</li>

			<p>Two things are happening here:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Homonymy<br />
				When a word has two unconnected meanings such as <em>bank,</em> 
				which can mean the side of a river or a business which looks 
				after people's money, then the words can be described as 
				<strong>homonyms</strong>.<br />
				(The word <em>homonym</em> comes from the Greek for <em>same 
				name</em> incidentally.)<br />
				The meanings are unconnected and probably derive from different 
				sources (which is the case with the two meanings of <em>bank</em>).<br />
				When we convert the noun to verb as in the second two examples, 
				we are simply converting the word class with no effect on 
				meaning.<br />
				We also have a case of homonymy with two of the meanings of <em>
				blue</em> (the colour and the feeling of depression).</li>
				<li>Polysemy<br />
				When a word has two meanings which are different but obviously 
				connected in some way, they can be referred to as polysemes.<br />
				This is the case with <em>glasses</em> in this list.&nbsp; 
				Clearly, in all three cases, the word refers to something made 
				of glass but in the first case it means <em>spectacles</em>, in 
				the second case it means <em>containers made of glass</em> and 
				in the third case it means the <em>contents of a glass</em>.<br />
				The word <em>doubtfully</em> is also a case of polysemy because 
				its meaning is altered in the two examples.&nbsp; In the first 
				example it is modifying the adjective <em>correct</em>, toning 
				it down and making it far less certain so it means something 
				like <em>only just possibly</em> and in the second case it is 
				modifying the verb and telling us how she looked and means 
				something akin to <em>sceptically</em>.&nbsp; The uses cannot be 
				reversed so we can't allow either:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That is sceptically correct</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She looked at me only just possibly</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The word <em>go</em> in this task is somewhere in the middle.<br />
			When it is a verb, it usually means something like <em>move away</em> 
			from a place but we can also use it to mean <em>work</em> or <em>
			function</em> and we can convert it to a noun to mean <em>try</em> 
			or <em>attempt</em>.<br />
			Whether this is a case of the word having three homonyms or whether 
			you think the words are closely enough connected in meaning to be 
			considered polysemes is a debatable matter.</p>

					<h2>Three types of meaning</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>When we try to answer the question, <em>What does 'mean' mean?</em>, 
			we discover that we need to think about three types of meaning.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Sense</strong><br />
				This refers to a word's general significance.<br />
				For example, we can probably agree on the sense of the word <em>
				coin</em>.&nbsp; The word, as a noun, means a small metal unit 
				of currency.&nbsp; This is the word's sense or its <strong>denotation</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Reference</strong><br />
				This refers to the actual thing I mean (or the action etc. but 
				for simplicity's sake, we'll focus on nouns).&nbsp; In other 
				words, it is this instance of the word's use.<br />
				For example, if I say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coin on the book</em><br />
				I know (and so do you) that I am referring not to coins in a 
				general sense but to a particular one I have in mind.</li>
				<li><strong>Connotation</strong><br />
				This refers to a second level of meaning above denotation and is 
				often personally or culturally determined.&nbsp; For example, the 
				lexemes <em>earn</em> and <em>coin it in</em> and the words <em>quack</em> and <em>doctor</em> carry the same senses (<em>making 
				money </em>and<em> a medical 
				practitioner, </em>respectively) but mean very different things.&nbsp; The same can 
				be said of a whole range of lexemes such as <em>
				youth-teen, child-brat, newspaper-rag, speech-sermon, 
				dirt-filth, police officer-copper-cop</em> and so on.<br />
				We saw this above with the uses of <em>small</em> (denoting only size) 
				and <em>little</em> (denoting size and connoting attractiveness).</li>

			<p>The issue here is called <strong>idiomaticity</strong> and the 
			example is of an <strong>idiom</strong>.<br />
			Idioms are frequently impossible to understand by knowing all the 
			words that make them up, a phenomenon known as non-compositionality.<br />
			Here are some examples of idioms in English (on the left) and some 
			equivalents in other languages.&nbsp; Can you make them match?<br />

			<img id="img6" alt="idiom translation" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img6',/*url*/'../../imagesgraphics/idiomtranslateans.png')" src="../../imagesgraphics/idiomtranslatetask.png" /></p>
			<p>There are two important issues to describe concerning idioms in 
			any language:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Transparency</strong>:<br />
				It is sometimes possible to guess at the meaning, of course, and 
			there is a range of idiomatic language from the completely obvious 
			to the fully impenetrable.<br />
				For example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li><span class="style_black"><em>she has missed the boat</em></span> 
					(meaning lost an opportunity) is just about comprehensible 
					given some context</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em>they threw in the towel</em></span> 
					(meaning gave up or surrendered) is possible to understand 
					if one has some knowledge of boxing conventions</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em>he kicked the bucket</em></span> 
					(meaning died) is wholly incomprehensible and must be 
					learned and used as a complete unit</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Fixedness</strong>:<br />
				Some idioms cannot be altered at all (or only very slightly in 
				terms of changing the tense or pronouns), but others can have 
				multiple variants.<br />
				For example:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li><span class="style_black"><em>through thick and thin</em></span> cannot be altered to 
					<span class="style_black"><em>through fat 
					and thin</em></span> or <span class="style_black"><em>through thick and narrow</em></span> and retain its meaning 
					and is at the fixed end of the spectrum</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em>we're having a hoot</em></span> can be expressed alternatively as 
					<span class="style_black"><em>we're having a whale of a time</em></span>, and 
					<span class="style_black"><em>hit the sack</em></span> can be 
					replaced with <span class="style_black"><em>hit the hay</em></span> and so on.&nbsp; These are idioms 
					with limited flexibility.</li>
					<li>Other expressions, which are really just strong 
					associations between words or collocations, are very much 
					more flexible (and don't count as idioms at all in some 
					analyses).<br />
					For example, we can <em><span class="style_black">make the beds, haste, 
					friends</span> </em>and so on and on but not 
					<span class="style_black"> <em>*make the homework</em></span>, or 
					<span class="style_black"> 
					<em>*make 
					damage</em></span> (for which the verb <em>do</em> is preferred).<br />
					Similarly, we <span class="style_black"> <em>pay attention, a compliment </em>
					</span>and <span class="style_black"> <em>
					our respects</em></span> but <span class="style_black"> <em>take an interest</em>, <em>
					offence, place</em></span> etc. and 
					<span class="style_black"> <em>give explanations, thanks</em></span> 
					and <span class="style_black"> <em>promises</em></span> etc.</li>
				</ol>

					<h3>Idea 1: Homophones and homographs</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We have already met words which have more than one meaning, 
			homonyms and polysemes, so now we need to look at words which look 
			the same or sound the same but have different meanings.<br />
			Clearly, in our example above, the word <em>bank</em> meaning <em>a 
			financial business </em>and <em>the side of the river </em>both look 
			the same (are spelled in the same way) and also sound the same (are 
			pronounced in the same way), but that is not always the case.<br />
			Many other words are homonyms of others so, for example, we may find 
			homonym pairs such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bat</em> (hitting tool) and <em>bat</em> (flying animal)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; down</em> (lower) and <em>down</em> (feathers)</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em>dear</em> and <em>deer</em></dt>
				<dd>These words are written differently but pronounced the same 
				and have <strong>different meanings</strong>.&nbsp; They are 
				<strong>homophones</strong>.&nbsp; Other examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hare-hair<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				right-rite-write<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				no-know<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				discreet-discrete</em></dd>
				<dt><em>lead</em> weight and <em>lead</em> an army</dt>
				<dd>These words are written the same but pronounced differently 
				and have <strong>different meanings</strong>.&nbsp; They are 
				<strong>homographs</strong>.&nbsp; Other examples are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; read</em> (present tense) and <em>read</em> (past tense)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalid</em> (not usable) and <em>invalid</em> (sick person)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bass </em>(a deep voice) and <em>bass</em> (a fish)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desert</em> (leave one's duty) and <em>desert</em> (arid 
				area)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; export</em> (the noun, stressed on the first syllable) and
				<em>export</em> (the verb, stressed on the second syllable)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tear</em> (rip) and <em>tear</em> (drop of eye water)</dd>

				<h3>Idea 3: Word families, lexical sets and lexical fields</h3>

			</table>
			
		<p>On this site, the terms are defined like this because for teaching 
		purposes, it seems the most useful.<br />
		A word family refers to words with the same root.<br />
		A lexical set refers to words for objects (or verbs etc.) found in the 
		same conceptual area.<br />
		A lexical field refers to words of all kinds which occur in the same 
		topic.<br />
		Like this:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="family set field" src="../../imagesgraphics/word_families310.png" /><br />
		Lexical sets are usually defined as being words of the same class so we 
		could also have, e.g.<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; treat, care for, tend, operate, nurse, examine, 
		cure</em> etc.<br />
		as verbs in a lexical set to do with health care.</p>

				<h3>Idea 4: Collocation</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>
			Some words, as we saw above, go together, hand-in-hand, with other 
			words, some don't.</p>
			
			<p>So we have, for example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;torrential + rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; bright + sunshine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; bitterly + cold</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Some words do not collocate so we can have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>strong winds and heavy snow</em><br />
			but not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*strong snow and heavy winds</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>tall people </em>and <em>high mountains</em><br />
			but not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*high people</em> and <em>tall mountains</em></p>
			<p>Collocations can be analysed by:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><strong>type</strong>:<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li>verb + noun (e.g., <em>rent an apartment</em> <em>vs.</em> <em>
					rent / hire a car</em> but not <em>*hire an apartment</em>)</li>
					<li>adjective + noun (e.g., <em>nagging toothache, splitting 
					headache </em>but not <em>*splitting toothache</em>)</li>
					<li>adverb + adjective (e.g., <em>deeply depressed</em> but 
					not <em>*ecstatically unhappy, *shallowly depressed</em>)</li>
					<li>noun + noun (e.g., <em>cash dispenser,</em> <em>
					chocolate machine</em> and <em>cash machine</em> but not <em>
					*chocolate dispenser</em>)</li>
					<li>verb + adverb (e.g., <em>tiptoe quietly, shout loudly
					</em>but not<em> *walk violently</em> or <em>*shout softly</em>)</li>
					<li>verb + preposition (e.g., <em>rely on </em>not <em>*rely 
					by</em>, <em>burst out laughing </em>but <em>burst into 
					tears</em>)<br />
					(Some do not allow this combination as a collocation, 
					strictly speaking, because it is a grammatical issue.)</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>strength</strong>:<br />
				<img alt="collocation" height="215" src="../../imagesgraphics/collocation.png" width="465" /><ul class="bluebullet">
					<li>On the right we have fixed and semi-fixed idioms such as<br /><em>the black sheep of the family</em> (no word except
					<em>sheep</em> is allowed)<br />
					Here, too, we find two-word combinations (and sometimes 
					three-word combinations) which occur in a fixed order, do 
					not allow alternatives and carry a single significance such 
					as<br /><em>by and large<br />tall, dark and handsome<br />willy-nilly<br />
					</em>etc.</li>
					<li>Some collocations allow few other possibilities.&nbsp; 
					For example:<br /><em>liquid assets</em> or <em>fixed assets<br />
					torrential rain</em> or <em>flood<br />
					rolling pin / stone / tobacco<br />
					</em>There is a cline here, too, from strong to weak <em>via</em> 
					medium strength collocations.&nbsp; Some allow a very wide 
					range of possible terms but others are quite restricted.</li>
					<li>The strength of a collocation is not usually reciprocal.<br />
					This means that, for example, while an adjective such as <em>
					unpainted</em> applies to a large but limited set of nouns (<em>door, 
					house, metal, railing, building
					</em>etc.), the reverse is 
					not the case and the number of adjectives which can be 
					applied to a noun such as <em>house</em> is virtually 
					unlimited.&nbsp; So, too, while <em>the beds</em> collocates 
					with a very limited number of verbs (<em>make</em> is the 
					only obvious one), the verb <em>make</em> will collocate 
					with an extremely large number of nouns.<br />
					That is what is meant by non-reciprocity.</li>
					<li>With textual collocations, certain words occur 
					conventionally together such as<br /><em>doctors treat patients<br />
					nurses care for patients<br />
					police officers arrest people<br />
					firemen attend fires<br />
					</em>and many other noun + verb + noun combinations are possible such as<br /><em>solicitors advise clients<br />
					waiters serve diners<br />
					</em>etc.</li>
