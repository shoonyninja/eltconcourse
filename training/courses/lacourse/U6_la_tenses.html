			<h1>Unit 6: tenses in English</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="time" height="207" src="../../images/hourglass310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>
			This Unit draws on the knowledge of verbs that you acquired in Unit 
			3 but focuses not on what the verbs mean but on the relationship 
			between events and actions and time.<br />
			So, from the outset, we'll get some basic ideas clear.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Time</dt>
				<dd>Is not a concept dependent on the language you speak.<br />
				Cultures may view time differently (some imagining it moving 
				from behind to in front of you or from below to above and many viewing 
				time as a continuum moving along a straight line from left to 
				right) but time itself is not a subject for language analysis.<br />
				Time can be a point:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What time does the train arrive?</em><br />
				a resource:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have enough time?</em><br />
				or an occasion<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you have a nice time?</em></dd>
				<dt>Tense</dt>
				<dd>is a language term and strictly speaking refers to changes 
				made to the verb to show the relationship between the action, 
				state or event and the time at or in which it occurred.<br />
				It is possible to recognise that, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went home</em><br />
				refers to past time because of the form of the verb and that<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She works here</em><br />
				refers to present time (and the past and the future, 
				incidentally) because the form of the verb signals that with the 
				-<em>s</em> ending on the verb.<br />
				We can also recognise that:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is working in her office</em><br />
				almost certainly refers to the present moment because of the 
				forms of the two verbs.<br />
				English has many tense forms but only, arguably, two tenses: 
				past and non-past.<br />
				Other languages do things differently and many will have a 
				special form of the verb to show a future tense and may make 
				other changes to the forms of the language to signal their 
				connection with time.<br />
				We will not be so strict in this Unit and the next and will 
				refer to all forms of the verb which relate it to time as a 
				tense form.<br />
				There is often a clear relationship between time and tense form 
				so we can be reasonably sure that:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary left</em><br />
				refers to the past but that is not always the case because, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What would he do if Mary left?</em><br />
				is a reference to a possible (but unlikely) future which uses 
				the same tense form.</dd>
				<dt>Aspect</dt>
				<dd>is a key concept in understanding English tenses because the 
				language depends heavily on forms of the verb to signal how the 
				speaker feels about the tense.&nbsp; We will use two of the most 
				important aspects of English tense forms to exemplify what is 
				meant:<ol class="yellowbulletlist">
					<li>For example, if I say:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John arrived</em><br />
				I am referring to an action which took place in the past and is 
				finished as far as I am concerned.&nbsp; I am saying nothing at 
				all about where John&nbsp;is now.<br />
				However, if I say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John has arrived</em><br />
				then I am saying something very different.&nbsp; In effect, what 
				I am saying is that although John's arrival is finished, the 
				relevance of it to the present is clear to me and I want to 
				communicate it.&nbsp; What English has done with this form of 
				the verb is embed a past event in the present to make it clear 
				that the past event has changed the way I view the present.<br />
				I might, therefore, go on to say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... so now we can eat</em><br />
				or express whatever else in the present has been affected by 
				John's past arrival.&nbsp; This is called the <strong>perfect</strong> aspect of 
					the tense in English.</li>
					<li>The other important aspect signalled by the 
					verb form in English is the progressive.<br />
					I can, for example, say:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John thinks he is Napoleon</em><br />
					and am making a statement about a present condition.<br />
					However, I can also say:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shush.&nbsp; John is thinking</em><br />
					and now I am signalling the fact that I am talking about an 
					action in progress.&nbsp; That's why it is called the 
					<strong>progressive</strong> aspect.</li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
			</dl>

			Now we are clear about that, we can get on with the Unit.<br />

			<p>Some of the examples in the fourth column are disputable and some

		<p>The names of the tenses are quite logically constructed and 
		that will help you to remember them.&nbsp; The only variation is whether 
		people prefer to say simple present rather than present simple, for 
		example, and the terms are all synonymous so it really doesn't matter.</p>
			<ul class="yellowbulletlist">
				<li>Tenses called simple forms are just that.&nbsp; They do not 
				use other verbs to make the forms.</li>
				<li>Progressive forms refer to ongoing actions and we use a form

				<li>Perfect forms relate two time together (past in the past, 
				past in the present, past in the future) and we use a form of 
				the verb <em>have</em> to make them.</li>
				<li>The terms can be stacked so we get, e.g., past perfect 
				progressive, present perfect progressive and so on.</li>
				<li>Some people refer to non-progressive forms as simple forms,

			<p>Here we are on quite safe ground because most languages use a 
			simple present tense for to talk about things which are true now, 
			were true in the past and will (probably) remain true.<br />
			We put in the <em>probably</em> there because as we all know the 
			future is by definition not certain and that, as we shall see later, 
			is a fact which determines how we think about it and which in turn 
			determines the forms we use to talk about it.</p>
			<p>The form we use predominately in English is the simple form of 
			the verb.&nbsp; We do not, usually, use a form such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is working in a bank</em><br />
			because that implies that the work is temporary rather than 
			permanent.<br />
			We also do not use a perfect form such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has worked in a bank</em><br />
			because that implies that he no longer does.</p>

			<p>Apart from the fact that English is unusual in using the verb <em>
			do</em> to make negatives and interrogatives in the simple present 
			tense (and the simple past) that all seems quite straightforward.<br />
			However, there are three issues to consider:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the simple present tense, English has a single inflexion, 
				either <em>-s</em> or<em> -es</em> added to the verb in the 
				third-person singular.&nbsp; No other form is inflected at all 
				so we use the base form of the verb.<br />
				Most languages have a more sophisticated set of inflexions which 
				makes life comparatively simple when learning English but also 
				means that learners very often forget to use the single 
				inflexion that English does demand.<br />
				The exceptions are:<ol class="yellowbulletlist">
					<li>The verb <em>be</em> which is very irregular and changes 
					from <em>be </em>to <em>am, is</em> and <em>are</em></li>
					<li>The verb <em>have</em> which drops the final two letters 
					in the second-person singular form and adds an -<em>s</em> 
					to make <em>has</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Some verbs, mostly those which refer to mental states, 
				wishes and perception are also used in the present simple to 
				refer not to always but to a current (i.e., present) condition 
				or state.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like this food<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to go home now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love this weather<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see him now</em><br />
				all refer to a current, not permanent situation.</li>
				<li>The central copular verb, <em>be</em>, which we encountered 
				in Unit 3 is also used to refer to both temporary states and 
				permanent ones so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A litre is 1000 millilitres</em><br />
				refers to a permanent condition but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog is in the bathroom</em><br />
				refers to the present, non-permanent situation.<br />
				Other copular verbs can also refer to temporary states with a 
				simple present tense form, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel hungry</em><br />
				clearly does not refer to a permanent condition but to a 
				present-only state.<br />
				With other verbs, this is not the case so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take the train to work</em><br />
				is a reference to always but if we want to refer to a specific 
				present condition or a specific temporary habit we need to use a 
				different form:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am taking the train to work</em><br />
				The difference here is in how the verb is used.<br />
				When its use is what is called <strong>stative</strong>, it 
				refers to the present, not always, so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She appears unhappy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It smells bad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That tastes good</em><br />
				etc. all refer to the present only and not to a permanent 
				condition.<br />
				We can use these verbs in what is called a dynamic form as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is tasting the food</em><br />
				which has a different meaning, of course.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We shall encounter issues with the stative <em>vs</em>. dynamic 
			uses of verbs elsewhere in this Unit.</p>

			<p>We saw, in the last section, that some verbs refer to a present 
			state, event or action even though they are in the present simple 
			tense.&nbsp; Therefore, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house looks a bit untidy</em><br />
			does not refer to always but to its <span lang="x-none"></span>present condition only.<br />
			We can use a real present-tense form and convert that to:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is looking a bit untidy</em><br />
			with no change in meaning.<br />
			However, if we change:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lives in London</em><br />
			to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is living in London</em><br />
			we clearly do change the signal we send: the first suggests a 
			permanent situation and the second suggest that living in London is 
			a present situation only and is temporary.</p>

			with no, or very little, change in meaning.<br />
			Other verbs are not so obliging and have different meanings 
			depending on how they are used.<br />
			Verbs which are generally, not always, used with a stative meaning 
			in the simple present are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Verbs of possession or relations between things such as <em>
				be, appear, consist, contain, cost, have, depend, fit, include, 
				involve, matter, mean, measure, owe, own, possess, seem, weigh</em> 
				and so on.&nbsp; So we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It weighs three pound</em>s (not<em> is weighing</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jacket doesn't fit me</em> (not <em>isn't fitting</em>)</li>
				<li>Verbs of sensations: <em>feel, hear, look, see, smell, 
				sound, taste, touch</em>.&nbsp; So we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It tastes delicious</em> (not <em>is tasting</em>)<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>That smells awful </em>(not <em>is smelling</em>)</li>
				<li>Verbs referring to emotional states such as <em>adore, 
				appreciate, care, desire, dislike, hate, hope, like, love, mind, 
				need, prefer, value, want, wish</em>.&nbsp; So we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I appreciate your time</em> (not <em>am appreciating</em>)<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I love the summer</em> (not <em>am loving</em>)</li>
				<li>Verbs referring to mental processes and states such as <em>
				agree, astonish, believe, concern, deny, disagree, doubt, 
				expect, flabbergast, forget, imagine, impress, know, please, 
				promise, realise, recognise, remember, satisfy, suppose, 
				surprise, think, understand</em>.&nbsp; So we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I deny taking it</em> (not <em>am denying</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recognised her at once</em> (not <em>was recognising</em>)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In some books and on some sites, you will find these verbs 
			referred to as stative verbs.&nbsp; That's not quite accurate 
			because it is better put as <strong>verbs normally used statively
			</strong>because, with a change in meaning, we can use most of them 
			dynamically so we allow, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is measuring me for a new dress<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're looking well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm hating this music<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please wait a minute, I'm thinking about it</em><br />
			and so on.</p>
			<p>However, for nearly all the other verbs in the language (around 
			30,000 of them) reference to the present is signalled by the present 
			progressive which is formed with <em>be</em> + an <em>-ing</em> form 
			(and you will see and hear it called the present continuous, too).</p>
			<p>The following are all examples, <span class="style_red"><strong>
			<em>in red</em></strong></span>, of the tense used to refer to a 
			current event or activity:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>They <span class="style_red"><strong>are looking </strong></span>
			for her phone</em></li>
			<li><em>I <strong> <span class="style_red">am working</span></strong>
			in London this week</em></li>
			<li><em>He <span class="style_red"><strong>is</strong></span> 
			outside <span class="style_red"><strong>washing</strong></span> the 
			car</em></li>
			<li><em>She <span class="style_red"><strong>is catching up</strong></span> 
			with the rest of the runners</em></li>
			<li><em>I <span class="style_red"><strong>am </strong></span></em>
			<span class="style_red"><strong><em>staying</em></strong></span><em> for three 
			days</em></li>
		</ol>
			<p>However, as we saw with the present simple, the present 
			progressive does not always signal the same kind of event.<br />
			Here's how we use the tense (mostly):</p>
			<table class="auto-style157" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style10" style="border-top-color: #009900; border-top-width: 1px">

					<em>The woman in that car is writing a book</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style10"><strong>Currently arranged future</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style116"><em>We are driving to London 
					tomorrow</em></td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>You may find that the last of these is referred to as the present 
			progressive or continuous for the future and that is one way to look 
			at it (but the wrong way).<br />
			The tense is a present form and refers to a present arrangement, not 
			a future event (which may not happen).</p>
			<p>Stative and dynamic uses are also in play here, of course, so, 
			for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like this music</em><br />
			probably refers to a current feeling rather than a permanent state, 
			whereas:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like her music</em><br />
			refers to a permanent feeling.</p>
			<p>On the other hand<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is being silly</em><br />
			refers to the present and not a permanent state, but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is silly</em><br />
			refers to always.</p>
			<p>There is one more form that is often spoken of as a future form:
			<em>going + to</em>.<br />
			In a sentence like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to see him tomorrow</em><br />
			you may be forgiven for thinking that the reference is only to the 
			future and that is the way many people interpret it.<br />
			However, a moment's thought reveals that it carries the same meaning 
			as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my current intention to see him 
			tomorrow</em><br />
			so the form is a present tense with reference to a present intention 
			and intentions, as we know from the meaning of the word, are always 
			concerned with the future.<br />
			In other words, this is a question of meaning, not grammatical form.</p>

			<p>We are generally fairly certain about events that occur 
			repeatedly, habitually or perennially but even when we speak about 
			the present, we are not always sure we are right.<br />
			So, for example, when someone asks:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's Mary doing?</em><br />
			the response may be<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's reading in the garden</em><br />
			but if we can't actually see her we can use other forms to show a 
			bit of doubt such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She may be reading in the garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could be sitting in the garden</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			There is more about this in Unit 8 which considers modal auxiliary 
			verbs and a little more below when we come to consider how we talk 
			about the future (which is even less certain than the present, of 
			course.</p>

			<p>We saw above that we can use a present progressive form to talk 
			about arrangements and intentions (which both refer to the future)

			<p>Many teachers and, alas, teacher trainers and materials writers, 
			seem to believe that this tense form refers to the past.<br />
			It does not and the clue is the name of the tense: <strong>the 
			<span class="style_underline">present</span> perfect</strong>.<br />
			What this tense form does is relate a past event to the present and 
			signal that the present is now the way it is because the past event 
			occurred.&nbsp; In other words, it embeds the past in the present, 
			and does not refer explicitly to the past: it describes the <strong>
			present</strong>.<br />
			Another reason that this is obviously a present tense lies in the 
			fact that the effect can sometimes leap the present and refer to a 
			future situation as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has snowed for hours ... so the trains 
			will 
			be cancelled</em></p>

			might be the present effects?<br />

			<p>Occasionally, too, you will find websites and others who aver 
			that the present perfect refers to recent events but that is not 
			necessarily the case because we can say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter has learned French</em> (<em>so now he 
			can speak it</em>)<br />
			and the learning could have taken place at any time.<br />
			Often, of course, the past event is quite recent because that is how 
			cause and effect work but it is not a characteristic of the present 
			perfect.&nbsp; It is a characteristic of the universe.</p>

			</table>
		<p>This tense is the one everyone recognises as a past form and it 
		translates directly into hundreds of other languages which use a simple 
		form (with an ending or other change to signal the tense) for a past, 
		completed action.<br />
		As we saw in Unit 3, one small issue is that many common verbs in 
		English happen to be irregular and do not take the simple -<em>d</em> or 
		-<em>ed</em> ending as the past-tense inflexion.<br />
		Refer to the list in that unit for the forms of irregular past tenses.<br />
		The form is used to refer to two sorts of states, events or actions:</p>

					<em>We took our holidays at the seaside when I was a child</em></td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>The past simple is an absolute tense which means it is 
			independent of any other time and not relative.<br />
			For this reason it occurs frequently with absolute-time markers such 
			as <em>last, month, in July, in 1976, before the war, when he was 10</em> 
			and so on.<br />
			It rarely occurs, in British English, with markers such as <em>
			recently, yet, just, since</em>.&nbsp; However, in American and 
			other varieties, the form does occur with these markers so we 
			encounter:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she just leave?</em><br />
			when a British-English speaker would probably prefer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has she just left?</em></p>
			<p>An issue with the regular past forms (and regular past participle 
			forms) is how the ending is pronounced: it may be as <em>d, t </em>
			or<em> ed.&nbsp; </em>There is a guide linked below to the 
			pronunciation.</p>

		<p>The past progressive is more complicated because it is not a truly 
		absolute tense.&nbsp; If we compare:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We drove to London</em><br />
		with<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were driving to London</em><br />
		it is clear that the second of these events was probably unfinished.&nbsp; 
		Certainly, the form does not imply that the event was finished but the 
		first sentence clearly refers to a completed action.&nbsp; It is, in the 
		jargon, perfective (not perfect).<br />
		It is the unfinished, or non-finite aspect that makes the tense hard for 
		people to learn because many languages do not have a dedicated form for 
		this idea.</p>

		<p>We'll look at each in turn:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The use of the progressive form to refer to a background 
				event should be familiar to you now from the section above on 
				talking about the present.<br />
				We use it in the same way when we are talking about the past as 
				in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was teaching at that school when she 
				bought her first house</em><br />
				in which we know that the teaching and house buying cannot have 
				happened at the same time so the first action forms the 
				background to the second.</li>
				<li>We also use the form in a related way to refer to actions 
				which are interrupted (either to be continued or not depending 
				on the meaning (not the form) of the sentence).<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was walking home when I met John and 
				went to the pub</em><br />
				in which the walking was terminated by the visit to the pub and 
				we do not know (or much care) whether it continued later.<br />
				We can also have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was walking home when the idea came to 
				me</em><br />
				in which it seems that the walking continued after the idea 
				arrived.<br />
				Sometimes, we do not know if the action continued or not so in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was working in the garden when he rang</em><br />
				may mean that I did or did not answer the call.</li>
				<li>Sometimes, we simply want to emphasise the fact that an 
				action took a long time (it was, in the jargon, durative) so we 
				use this tense as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was raining for hours and hours</em></li>
				<li>Finally, we use the form to refer to two (or more) 
				long-lasting events that ran parallel in time as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John was reading while I was working</em></li>
			</ol>

			<p>We saw above that the present perfect embeds a past event in the 
			present which it has changed in some way.<br />
			The past perfect does exactly the same but both actions, states or 
			events are set in the past and completed.<br />
			We only use this tense when we wish to make the sequence clear.&nbsp; 
			When it's obvious, we can simply use two past simple forms.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had met her before and remembered her name</em><br />
			and in that it is made clear that the first action has changed the 
			second.&nbsp; It is the pre-past embedded in the past just as the 
			present perfect refers to the past embedded in the present.</p>

				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>We saw above that we can use the simple past to refer to past 
			habits so we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I swam in the sea when I was on holiday</em><br />
			to mean that I repeatedly swam in the sea in the past.<br />
			However, English also has an unusual dedicated form which refers to 
			past habits which are no longer.&nbsp; Two, in fact:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to swim in the sea when I was on 
			holiday</em><br />
			which implies that I no longer take holidays where this is possible.<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would swim in the sea when I was on holiday</em><br />
			which implies exactly the same thing.<br />
			There are, in fact, some restrictions on the use of this forms which 
			the guides linked at the end will explain.</p>

			<p>Past time lines are helpful because languages vary considerably 
			and it is important to help our students any way we can when it 
			comes to understanding past concepts.<br />
			The simple past for a completed event can be shown like this:<br />
					<img alt="past simple" height="113" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line_past_simple.png" width="310" /><br />
			The interrupted past can be visualised like this:<br />
					<img alt="past progressive" height="131" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line_past_progressive_2.png" width="310" /><br />
			in which we have event 1 (cycling) terminated by event 2 (the 
			accident).<br />
			We can also illustrate the continuing event 1, like this:<br />
					<img alt="past progressive" height="131" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line_past_progressive.png" width="310" /><br />
			in which event 1 continues after event 2.<br />
			Parallel, long-duration events can be shown like this:<br />
			<img alt="parallel" height="111" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line_past_progressive_parallel.png" width="310" /><br />
			Showing background events is slightly trickier but we can try 
			something like:<br />
			<img alt="background" height="109" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line_past_progressive_background.png" width="310" /><br />
			The past perfect can be shown to embedding a pre-past event in the 
			past in a similar way to how we do it for the present perfect, like 
			this:<br />
					<img alt="past perfect" height="124" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line_past_perfect.png" width="310" /><br />
			The discontinued past habit structures can be illustrated in two 
			ways (one for an action and one for a state):<br />
					<img alt="used to" height="125" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line_used_to.png" width="310" /><br />
					<img alt="used to" height="125" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line_used_to_continuous.png" width="310" /><br />
			and in both cases we show that the action or event is terminated.</p>

			<p>The future is, as is often pointed out, unknowable.<br />
			We are, therefore, in the realms of speculation and that explains 
			how English uses certain forms to talk about the future.<br />
			We have, above, dismissed both:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am meeting John later</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going see a doctor about this pain</em><br />
			as not being future forms at all because the first refers to a 
			current arrangement and the second to a current intention, both of 
			which are present conditions so it is unsurprising that English uses 
			a present form for them.</p>
		<p>From the outset, we should make something clear.<br />
		The word <em>will </em>is a modal auxiliary verb that refers to 
		willingness and volition so, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll get that for you<br />
		</em>is not a future tense form, it is an expression of current 
		willingness.<br />We will not be considering modal auxiliary verb uses here because 
		that is reserved for Unit 8 of this course.<br />
		However, because the future is always in doubt, we often use modal 
		auxiliary verbs and other expressions which signal the doubtfulness such 
		as is exemplified here:<br />
			<img alt="certain" height="187" src="../../imagesgraphics/certainty_gradient%202.png" width="250" /></p>
			<p>English speakers use these kinds of verbs very frequently to talk 
			about the future and reserve the two tenses we have identified here 
			for quite limited uses.</p>
			<p>This leaves us with some very simple choices to talk about the 
			future sensibly.&nbsp; Again, because this unit is more about tense 
			than aspect, we'll only consider two forms.<br />
			It is true that English does not have a future tense because we make 
			no changes to the verb forms to denote a future reference.<br />
			This is unlike, for example, French, Spanish and Italian which all 
			have distinct inflexions on the verb to show the future tense.<br />
			Other languages, such as German and Dutch are much more like English 
			in this respect.<br />
			However, the two forms we have selected here <strong>function</strong> 
			as future tense forms even if they are not specifically inflected to 
			show it.</p>
			<p>The two forms are:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style66">
				<li>The simple or <em>will </em>future as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will get my new car tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will be a long job<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High tide will be at 6</em></li>
				<li>The future progressive, as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She will be working late tonight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be having my dinner then so call later</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>We'll take them one at a time.</p>

					<img alt="simple" height="133" src="../../images/clear_green_yellow200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style8">
					<h3>The simple or<em> will </em>future</h3>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Two functions of this tense form used for real future reference 
			concern us here.</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style157">

					<td class="auto-style116" style="border-top-color: #009900; border-top-width: 1px">
					<em>My son will be ten tomorrow</em></td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Here are a few examples of these uses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Prediction based on experience (and sometimes just hunches):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect Joan will be late as usual<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This won't be easy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll take a while<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning will be fine and dry but cloud will build in the 
				afternoon and most areas will see some rain before the evening.</em></li>
				<li>Absolute futures:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercury will be visible in the southern sky this evening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My birthday will be on a Thursday next year</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the use exemplified in 1., above, it is very common to add an 
			expression which relates to the speaker's certainty of the event so 
			we encounter, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think that will help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope John will be there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if she will come</em><br />
			etc.</p>
			<p>In the use exemplified in 2., above, a simple present tense is 
			often substituted to get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The planets are aligned on the 4th May<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My birthday is on a Thursday this year</em><br />
			and so on, because the sense is one of a timetabled event and 
			parallels expressions we saw above when talking about scheduled 
			events such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The London trains leave at ten past every 
			hour.</em></p>
			<p>You may read about the <em>will</em> future being used for what is 
			sometimes called a spontaneous decision and that may be exemplified 
			in a mini-dialogue as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: <em>There's no milk!<br />
			</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: <em>Oh, I'll go and get some from the 
			shop.<br />
			</em>or something equally unlikely.<br />
			The truth of the matter is that this form does not refer to the 
			future <em>per se</em> although an action may follow.&nbsp; It 
			refers to the speaker's current (not future) willingness to commit 
			to doing something.&nbsp; It is therefore a modal auxiliary verb 
			expressing willingness, not a tense marker.&nbsp; Much confusion is 
			caused in the minds of learners by people who refer to it as a 
			future form.<br />
			In any case, the future event may not happen because the next line 
			of the dialogue could be something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't bother.&nbsp; George can stop on his 
			way home and get some.</em></p>

					<em>I'll be taking the train while the car's with you</em></td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<ol>
				<li>Potential interruption:<br />
				The use of the progressive form to refer to a background 
				event which may or may not be interrupted should be familiar to you now from the sections above on 
				talking about the present and the past.&nbsp; This is a parallel 
				with those uses so we may also encounter, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be staying with my brother during 
				the conference so I don't need a hotel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'll be having lunch about now so call later</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				The difference here is, naturally, that we do not know whether 
				any interruption will occur but we do know that there is a 
				potential for it.</li>
				<li>The second use is often quite hard for learners to grasp 
				because it is peculiar to English.<br />
				It refers to something which occurs as a matter of course and is akin 
				to the timetabled use of the present simple or progressive (with 
				either of which it can often be replaced).&nbsp; For example:
				<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll be arriving at Calais at 16:40<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The professor will be giving a lecture at that time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun'll be shining at that time of year in Greece</em><br />
				all of which can be rephrased using a present-tense form.</li>
				<li>Predicted temporary state or habit:<br />
				We use this form for temporary conditions which we are committed 
				to.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be teaching her class while she's on 
				holiday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'll be taking the bus to school this term<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody will be working in the office on Bank Holidays</em><br />
				</li>

				</tr>

			<p>Future time lines are helpful because they can focus on the 
			nature of the difference between a current arrangement or intention 
			and a real future form.&nbsp; See above for the ways that the latter 
			two can be illustrated.<br />
			The future simple for a predicted event can be shows like this:<br />
