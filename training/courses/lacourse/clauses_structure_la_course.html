			<p>Clauses are independent units of meaning.&nbsp; They are,

			<p>All the chunks on the right here contain a verb of some sort but

			However, if you have spotted that only <em>he arrived</em> and <em>
			she left early</em> can stand alone as pieces of intelligible 
			language, you have noticed something rather important.&nbsp; A 
			definition of a clause used in many traditional grammars is that it 
			is a unit containing a subject and its predicate.</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>The subject is the thing or person that does whatever the 
				verb suggests.</li>
				<li>The predicate can be many things.<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>In the example above, <em>they met outside</em>, it is the adverb:
					<span class="style_black"><em>outside</em></span></li>
					<li>It can be a prepositional phrase: <em>They met
					<span class="style_black">outside the pub</span></em></li>
					<li>It can be a noun phrase (as an object): <em>They met
					<span class="style_black">me</span></em></li>
					<li>It can be another clause: <em>They met
					<span class="style_black">because they needed to talk</span></em></li>

			<p>In this analysis, we will be using the term 'clause' for any group of 
			words containing a verb phrase but will distinguish between <strong>finite</strong> 
			and <strong>non-finite</strong> clauses.</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>A finite verb, as in the sentences above, is a form that is 
				marked in some way for tense (the past of <em>meet</em>, in this 
				case) or for person (such as adding <em>-s</em> to the verb to 
				make <em>He meets</em>).&nbsp; In English, many verbs which are 
				finite (i.e., carrying tense and person) do not have an 
				obvious marker in the morphology.&nbsp; They are still finite 
				forms because having no obvious mark is called a zero marker.<br />
				All of these are clauses with finite verbs (i.e., they are 
				finite clauses):<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li><em>He arrived at 6 </em>(marked for tense with <em>-d</em> 
					on the verb)</li>
					<li><em>We start at 7</em> (no marking for tense or person but zero 
					marked and finite)</li>
					<li><em>We are starting at 8</em> (marked for tense [current 
					arrangement to talk about the future] and person [plural <em>
					are</em>])</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>A non-finite verb form is not marked for tense or person, 
				even by zero, and 
				we do not, by looking at it, know when it happens or who does 
				it.&nbsp; All these are non-finite clauses:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>opening the letter ...</li>
					<li>... to see clearly</li>
					<li>having seen it ...</li>
					<li>to speak honestly ...</li>

			<img alt="matrix" height="166" src="../../images/matrix250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><h2>Matrix and Subordinate clauses</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>In geology, a matrix is a fine-grained rock in which other 
			minerals are embedded and the definition will hold quite well for 
			our purposes.<br />
			Consider these two sentences:</p>
			<ol class="style_brown">
				<li class="style_brown">She saw <em>the dog wanted food</em></li>
				<li>S<span class="style_brown">he saw <em>the dog wanted <strong>
				to eat something</strong></em></span></li>
			</ol>
			<dl>
				<dt>In sentence 1., we have two clauses:</dt>
				<dd>The Matrix clause: <span class="style_brown"><em>She saw the dog 
				wanted food</em></span><em><br />
				</em>The Subordinate clause embedded in the matrix:<em>
				<span class="style_brown">the dog wanted food</span><br />
				</em>Both of these clauses are finite because the verb is marked 
				for tense (and in many languages would also be marked for aspect 
				and person).</dd>
				<dt>In sentence 2., we have three clauses:</dt>
				<dd>The Matrix clause: <span class="style_brown">She saw the dog 
				wanted to eat something</span><em><br />
				</em>Subordinate clause A: <em><span class="style_brown">the dog 
				wanted to eat something</span><br />
				</em>Subordinate clause B: <em><span class="style_brown">
				<strong>to eat something</strong></span><br />
				</em>Both the Matrix clause and Subordinate clause A are finite 
				clauses with the verb marked for tense (<em>s<strong>aw</strong></em> 
				and <em>want<strong>ed</strong></em> respectively).<br />
				Subordinate clause A is embedded in the Matrix clause.<br />
				Subordinate clause B is embedded in Subordinate clause A and is 
				non-finite (the verb, <em>to eat</em>, is unmarked for person or 
				tense).<br />
				Subordinate clause A, therefore, is the Matrix clause for 
				Subordinate B.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>This means, if you are following, that the terms Matrix and 
			Subordinate are <strong>relative</strong>.&nbsp; A subordinate 
			clause can be the matrix clause for its own subordinate clause.<br />
			In many cases (as in these examples) the Matrix clause and the 
			sentence are the same.&nbsp; That needn't be the case because we can 
			have, e.g.,<em><br />
			Mary came home when she finished work&nbsp;and John left as soon as 
			he saw her.<br />
			</em>In which we have two Matrix clauses both with an embedded 
			Subordinate clause (of time) but only one sentence.</p>
			<p>If you prefer a graphical representation:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="clause embedding" height="92" src="../../imagesgraphics/clause_structure.png" width="400" /><br />
			</p>
			<p>
			or</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="clauses " height="129" src="../../imagesgraphics/clause_structure2.png" width="400" /></p>
			<p>
			There are two important points:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li class="auto-style4"><strong>All matrix clauses must be 
				<span class="style_underline">finite</span> clauses</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Subordinate clauses can be finite 
				<span class="style_underline">or</span> non-finite</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Non-finite clauses contain one of the following verb forms:</p>
			<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
				<li >the bare infinitive: <em>She let me
				<strong>leave</strong> early</em></li>
				<li >a <em>to</em>-infinitive: <em>I want <strong>to 
				leave</strong> early</em></li>
				<li >a past participle form: <em><strong>
				Left</strong> on the table were the remains of dinner</em></li>
				<li >an <em>-ing</em> form: <em><strong>
				Leaving</strong> early was a real bonus.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Finite verb forms will always be marked for tense (even if as in, 
			e.g., <em>They come late</em>, the marking for tense is the <strong>
			absence</strong> of a change to the verb or an ending) and often 
			for person, too, as in e.g., <em>He come<strong>s</strong> late</em>.</p>
			<p>There will be more about types of subordinate clauses later in 
			the course.</p>

					<img alt="verbless" height="166" src="../../images/jigsaw_missing250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><h2>Verbless clauses</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>This sounds like a contradiction in terms because we have just 
			defined a clause as a unit containing a verb phrase.&nbsp; At times, 
			however, we can leave out the verb because it will be easily 
			understood.&nbsp; We also, incidentally, often have to leave out the 
			verb's subject as well.<br />
			Here are some examples:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Leaving out the finite verb phrase</dt>
				<dd><em>If possible, come before six</em> (= <em>If it is 
				possible, come before six</em>)<br />
				<em>Whether now or later, we'll get it done </em>(= <em>Whether 
				we do it now or later, we'll get it done</em>)<br />
				These clauses often contain conjunctions such as <em>whether, 
				whenever, where </em>etc.</dd>
				<dt>Leaving out a non-finite verb phrase</dt>
				<dd><em>Too tired to cook, I went straight to bed </em>(= <em>
				Being too tired to cook, I went straight to bed</em>)<br />
				<em>There are lots of interesting jobs in the sector, many 
				highly paid </em>(= <em>There are lots of interesting jobs in 
				the sector, many being highly paid</em>)</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Verbless clauses are sometimes called <strong>defective</strong> 
			clauses or even simply <strong>small</strong> clauses.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="aspect" height="166" src="../../images/aspect250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><h2>Tenses and aspects</h2></td>

			</table>
			
			<p>This is a short course so we will not try to analyse tenses and 
			aspects in any depth.<br />
			For much more in this area, go to
			<a href="../../initial/indexes_ip/verbs_index_ip.html" target="_blank">
			the initial plus index to verbs and tenses</a>.</p>
			<p>You are probably aware that all languages have a way of saying 
			when something happened so we can immediately see the difference 
			between, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am speaking French<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke French<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will speak French</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			You will also be able to see immediately that the first refers to 
			something the present, the second refers to a time in the past and 
			the third refers to the future.<br />
			The first is a present tense, the second is a past tense and, 
			although it is not really a tense because the form of the verb 
			doesn't change, the third <em>works</em> like a future tense.</p>
			<p>What you may be less sure about is the difference between these 
			pairs of clauses:</p>
			<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
				<li><em>I speak French<br />
				vs.<br />
				I am speaking French</em></li>
				<li><em>I spoke French<br />
				vs.<br />
				I have spoken French</em></li>
				<li><em>I spoke French<br />
				vs.<br />
				I was speaking French</em></li>
				<li><em>I will speak French<br />
				vs.<br />
				I am going to speak French</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The difference lies in something called aspect and there are four 
			in English which cause problems for learners (and others) and you 
			should know about.<br />
			Briefly, the four are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Simple</strong><br />
				The simple aspect refers to single events or things which are 
				true whether we are talking about the present, the past or the 
				future.&nbsp; All of these are simple aspect forms:<ol class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>I like ice cream</em><br />
					This is permanently the case so refers not to the present but 
					to all times.&nbsp; Confusingly, the form is called the 
					present simple but it isn't really a present tense.</li>
					<li><em>I ate an ice cream</em><br />
					This refers to a single event set in the past and we could 
					add, for example,<em> last Tuesday, yesterday, when I was in 
					Margate</em> and lots of other fixed-time expressions.</li>
					<li><em>I will eat an ice cream later</em><br />
					This refers to my prediction about an event in the future.&nbsp; 
					It will probably come true but it might not.&nbsp; The 
					future is like that.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Progressive</strong><br />
				As the name implies, this refers to ongoing events.<br />
				These two examples are in the progressive aspect:<ol class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>I am eating an ice cream</em><br />
					This describes a current ongoing event.&nbsp; We could add, 
					for example,<em> at the moment, as I speak, now</em> and 
					other time expressions referring to the present.</li>
					<li><em>I was eating an ice cream</em><br />
					This describes an event which was ongoing in the past.&nbsp; 
					We often add something like <em>... when you called, while I 
					was sitting in the coffee shop</em> and so on to say either 
					that the event was interrupted or what else was happening at 
					the same time.</li>
				</ol>In neither of these cases is it made clear when (or if) the action stopped.</li>
				<li><strong>Perfect</strong><br />
				This is the most difficult one for many people to understand 
				because it does not exist in lots of languages.<br />
				The perfect aspect relates two times together.&nbsp; These two 
				examples are in the perfect aspect:<ol class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>I have just eaten an ice cream</em><br />
					This puts a past event inside the present and we will often 
					follow it with something like <em>... so I'm not hungry</em> 
					to make it clear that the past event has changed the 
					present.&nbsp; The statement is about the present.</li>
					<li><em>I had eaten an ice cream</em><br />
					This does the same kind of thing but puts a pre-past even 
					inside the past and it could be followed by <em>... and I 
					felt a bit sick</em> so makes it clear that event one changed 
					event two in some way.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Prospective</strong><br />
				This refers to <strong>looking towards the future</strong> not 
				just talking about the future.<br />
				Here are two examples:<ol class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li><em>I am going to buy an ice cream</em><br />
					This refers to my current intention and it may or may not 
					come true.</li>
					<li><em>We agreed that I am buying the ice creams today</em><br />
					This refers to an arrangement which exists now concerning 
					the immediate future.&nbsp; Again, it may or may not come 
					true.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you can see, English tense forms are a bit complicated.<br />
			Here's a map of all of them with their names.<br />
			You don't have to know all this now but if you want to teach 
			English, you must learn about them.<br />
			If you follow <a href="../../tenses/tenses_map.html" target="_blank">
			this link to the tenses map</a>, you will be able to click on the 
			diagram to go to a guide to each tense type.</p>

					<td class="auto-style7"><h2>Modality</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>This course does not have a separate section concerned with 
			clauses which contain what is called modal expressions so this will 
			be the only brief mention.&nbsp; For more on this very important 
			area, follow the link to Modality below.<br />
			Briefly:</p>
			<p>Modality refers to how the speaker / writer sees a state or event 
			in terms of four factors:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>How likely something is to be true.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will be your mother coming home, I 
				expect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She can't have left already<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must be joking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess that's a possibility<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ostensibly, she's in charge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She should have arrived by now if she got the right train</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>How permissible or obligatory something is.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to get a visa to travel there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can go now, if you like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You aren't allowed to turn right here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This must be sent out today<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see a doctor about those headaches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smoking is not permitted</em></li>
				<li>Whether a person is able or willing to do something.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you help with this?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you see him later?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was she able to understand?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have the strength for this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like some tea?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't wait for her</em></li>
				<li>Whether something is inevitable because of the way the world 
				works.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer must be more than seven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rectangle has to have parallel sides<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gravity acts equally everywhere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Light travels faster than sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parallel lines cannot meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is necessary to raise the temperature above 1538&deg; 
				Celsius to melt 
				iron</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you can see from the examples, there are many different ways 
			to signal the speaker's view of these four factors but the most 
			common (and sometimes the only one taught) is by using modal 
			auxiliary verbs such as <em>can, could, may, might, must, ought to, 
			had better, have to, need to, should </em>and so on.<br />
			These verbs have special characteristics which are explained on this 
			site.</p>
