			Throughout this course, the longest texts we have dealt with have 
			been full sentences and quite often we have been concerned with much 
			shorter stretches of language.<br />
			The course would not be complete, however, without some 
			consideration of texts in English.</p>
			<p>
			What we are looking at in this unit is any text above the 
			level of a single sentence either written or spoken so, for example 
			all the following constitute texts worthy of some analysis:</p>
			<ul class="yellowbulletlist">
				<li><em>War and Peace</em></li>
				<li>A four-part conversation in a shop between a customer and a 
				salesperson</li>
				<li>A five-page transcription of a classroom interaction</li>
				<li>An essay written by a learner of English</li>
				<li>A PhD thesis</li>
				<li>This page</li>
				<li>This whole website</li>
				<li>A newspaper</li>
				<li>A newspaper article</li>
				<li>An announcement at a station</li>

			<p>The first thing to be clear about is that here we are using the 
			word <em>genre</em> in a technical sense applicable to language 
			studies.<br />
			We are not, for example, discussing genres in literature such as 
			sci-fi, detective stories, historical novels and so on and nor are 
			we considering musical genres such as rock, jazz, classical, ballet 
			etc.</p>
			<p>In language teaching, genre can be defined as a class of texts 
			having the same purposes in the culture and therefore sharing the 
			same structural, grammatical and lexical characteristics.<br />
			For example, if you have before you the instructions for using a 
			microwave and for building a swimming pool they will clearly be very 
			different.&nbsp; However, they will share elements 
			concerning layout of controls and parts, operations, safety features 
			and much more and you will know almost instantly that you are 
			looking at texts in the same genre.<br />
			Equally, if you go into a shop intent on buying a new computer, then 
			the transaction will follow similar lines, using the same ordering 
			of events that buying a sandwich at the station buffet will show.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Whether these are written or spoken, the following genres share 
			some characteristics because they are intended to achieve the same 
			ends.<br />
			This is not a complete list because definitions of genres can be 
			narrow or broad but it covers most eventualities.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>RECOUNT</dt>
				<dd>the setting out of a sequence of events to say what happened and 
	describe their significance.&nbsp; A spoken recount might begin with:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A funny thing happened to me on the way to the office 
	this morning.<br />
				</em>Other examples might include:<br />an anecdote, an excuse for being 
					late, a joke, a complaint about a journey</dd>
				<dt>NARRATIVE</dt>
				<dd>to retell a set of events with a problematic or unexpected 
				outcome to entertain and/or instruct.&nbsp; A narrative might 
				begin with:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once upon a time ...<br />
				</em>Other examples might include:<br />
				a novel, a short story, fables, 
					parables</dd>
				<dt>PROCEDURE</dt>
				<dd>to explain how to do something.&nbsp; An example might be 
				something that came with a piece of self-assembly furniture and 
				might begin:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate leg A and bolt Z.<br />
				</em>Other examples might include:<br />
				recipes, manuals, maintenance 
					instructions</dd>
				<dt>INFORMATION REPORT</dt>
				<dd>to provide information about something (that's what this 
				text is doing).&nbsp; Such texts usually begin with headings 
				stating the topic.<br />
				Examples might include:<br />
				encyclopaedia entries giving 
					information about things, text book sections, grammar books, 
					reports of experiments, news reports</dd>
				<dt>EXPLANATION</dt>
				<dd>to say why and how something happens.&nbsp; An explanation 
				often involves explaining cause and effect so such a text might 
				begin:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above 2000 meters, the air becomes 
				noticeably thinner so water boils at a lower temperature.&nbsp; 
				This causes ...<br />
				</em>Other examples might include:<br />
				web pages like this, encyclopaedia entries explaining processes</dd>
				<dt>EXPOSITION</dt>
				<dd>to argue a case.&nbsp; This is a one-sided view and a 
				typical exposition text might begin:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We the undersigned write to protest that 
				...<br />
				</em>Other examples might include:<br />
				political pamphlets, leader columns 
					in papers, letters to the editor</dd>
				<dt>DISCUSSION</dt>
				<dd>to present both sides of a case before (possibly) coming to a decision.&nbsp; 
				A typical discussion text might begin:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a range of views about the 
				usefulness of the passive voice form in English.&nbsp; Some 
				believe ...<br />
				</em>Other examples might include:<br />
				academic texts, student essays, 
					histories</dd>

			<p>And here are the ways that these texts are usually staged with a 
			very simple and very short example text to give you the idea:</p>

			<p>If you are aware of the structure and content of the various text

			<ol>

				to be placed and you know that the stages will follow a

				<li>You can produce written and spoken texts which will not 
				disorientate your listener or reader because you will be 
				following a pattern with which they are familiar.&nbsp; 
				Deviating from the pattern will confuse and irritate the reader

			<p>This section looks, quite briefly, at how parts of texts (long or 
			short) hang together.<br />
			Unit 9 considered <strong>cohesion</strong> (i.e., grammatical and 
			lexical linking devices) but here we are focused on <strong>
			coherence</strong>.<br />
			To see the difference, consider these two dialogues:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style191">
				<li><em>Where's Peter?</em></li>
				<li><em>He's in the garden</em></li>
			</ol>
			<ol class="auto-style191">
				<li><em>Where's Peter?</em></li>
				<li><em>The grass needed cutting</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Both these dialogues are coherent but they are very different.<br />
			In the first, B's answer includes the pronoun <em>he</em> which 
			clearly refers to <em>Peter</em> and it also contains <em>in the 
			garden </em>which is reference to a place and answers the question
			<em>where.<br />
			</em>In the second, there is no such linking because the answer 
			makes no reference either to Peter or the place and appears 
			unconnected.<br />
			However, we can use our knowledge of the world to assume two things:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style192">
				<li>the grass is found in the garden</li>
				<li>it is Peter's usual task (or even his job) to cut the grass.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and in this way, we can understand what's going on.<br />
			Texts work in similar ways and may lack cohesion while still 
			remaining coherent (and they may do both, of course).</p>
			<p>To see what's meant now, compare these two pairs of sentences:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Mary went to London with her mother and brother.&nbsp; Of 
				course, the British Museum was on the list of things to see 
				because the boy had spoken about wanting to see the Darwin 
				exhibition.</em></li>
				<li><em>Mary took her mother and brother to London.&nbsp; The city 
				has always delighted her and she wanted to show people around.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In neither of these little recount texts is there any obvious 
			grammatical linking between the sentences but if we change them 
			around, we get a rather odd result.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3"><em>Mary went to London with her mother and brother.&nbsp; 
				The city has always delighted her and she wanted to show people 
				around.</em></li>
				<li><em>Mary took her mother and brother to London.&nbsp; Of course, 
				the British Museum was on the list of things to see because the 
				boy had spoken about wanting to see the Darwin exhibition.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The reason that texts 1. and 2. flow more naturally is to do with 
			themes and rhemes.&nbsp; Here is how it works:</p>

				<li>In both the first sentences the theme is <em>Mary</em> (because 
				that is who the sentences are about)</li>
				<li>However, the second parts of the first sentences have 
				different rhemes:<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li>in text 1., the rheme is <em>her mother and her brother
					</em>so 
					it is logical that the next sentence concerns one of them.&nbsp; 
					In this case, it takes her brother's wishes as its theme.&nbsp; 
					We might expect the text to go on to consider what her 
					mother wanted to do.</li>
					<li>in text 2., however, the rheme is <em>London</em> because that 
					comes last in the first sentence.&nbsp; It is therefore 
					logical that the next sentence should take the city as its 
					theme.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is, rather predictably, a lot more that can be said about 
			themes and rhemes&nbsp;but if you have followed that, you are on your way 
			to being able to analyse texts rather than sentences in isolation.<br />
			A written longer text will often hold together in this way and many 
			spoken ones will also have a similar structure.&nbsp; It looks like 
			this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="theme-rheme simple" height="325" src="../../imagesgraphics/theme_rheme_simpler.png" width="465" /><br />
			It's not that simple in reality very often because rheme 1 may wait 
			for a while before it becomes a theme in its own right and some 
			rhemes may never get that status.</p>

				<p>This section is a footnote and you may be pleased to know 
				that there's no accompanying test.</p>
			<p>The usual analysis of how people understand texts, whether they 
			are spoken or written, identifies two strategies.&nbsp; However, 
			there are behaviours which fall uncertainly into one category or 
			another and some which clearly have to be employed in tandem with 
			others to be effective.&nbsp; The two approaches are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Top-down processing<br />
				<img alt="down" height="133" src="../../../gfx/arrow_down_green133.gif" width="58" /><br />
				This takes an overall view of a text (spoken or written) and 
				attempts to understand it by using:<ol class="auto-style192">
					<li>knowledge of the world (sometimes called encyclopedic 
					knowledge)<br />
					<img alt="earth" height="133" src="../../images/earth200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					which tells us, for example, that when we hear an 
					announcement in a railway station it will probably be 
					information about times and locations or safety issues and 
					that when we sit down to watch an evening news programme on 
					TV, we are already primed to understand the types of stories 
					and even the topics which will follow.<br />
					Equally, when we pick up a novel or a short story, we 
					usually know what it is about and what kind of story it is.&nbsp; 
					We very rarely read or listen to anything without knowing a 
					good deal about the text beforehand and that aids our 
					comprehension because we are not reading or listening for 
					just anything that comes along, we are using the skills for 
					something identifiable.</li>
					<li>knowledge of social relationships<br />
					<img alt="3" height="133" src="../../images/three_females200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					which alerts us to the intentions of writers and speakers.&nbsp; 
					If we know <strong>why</strong> something is being written 
					or said we are well on the way to understanding <strong>what</strong> 
					is being written or said.<br />
					For example, if we pick up the sports page of a newspaper, 
					we are alert to the fact that it will contain reports of 
					games and matches and may also contain interviews with 
					sports people and schedules of events.&nbsp; We do not come 
					cold to the text.<br />
					When we are spoken to by anyone at all, we usually know what 
					the person's role is (friend, authority figure, informant, 
					salesperson etc.) so we are primed to understand the sorts 
					of things they are likely to say.</li>
					<li>knowledge of the structure of the text<br />
					<img alt="structure" height="133" src="../../images/structure_leaf200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
					which helps us to locate the information we need.&nbsp; This 
					functions in two ways, too:<ol class="auto-style193">
						<li>generic structure<br />
						helps us to know where in a text to look or listen so we 
						know, for example, when reading a procedural text that 
						we are likely to find the materials we need at the 
						beginning and a step-by-step explanation of what to do 
						following that.&nbsp; If someone is giving us the 
						instructions for a procedure orally, we know, too, that 
						the information will (or should) come in comprehensible, 
						logically ordered packets.</li>
						<li>theme-rheme structure<br />
						helps us to locate the topic because the first line of 
						any text (written or spoken) will usually contain an 
						identification of the topic and the rheme of that 
						sentence will often form the theme of a subsequent 
						sentence or section.<br />
						In fact, we can listen to or read only the first 
						sentences in texts and ignore the rest and still manage 
						to get the gist and sometimes much more than that.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Bottom-up processing<br />
				<img alt="up" height="133" src="../../../gfx/arrow_up_green133.gif" width="58" /><br />
				This approach focuses analytically on the structures and lexis 
				of the language and our understanding is helped by our knowledge 
				of:<ol class="auto-style192">
					<li>the phonemes and other features of the spoken language<br />
					which helps us to break up the stream of speech and identify 
					individual words as well as the attitudes of the speaker and 
					the functions (questions, enquiries, warnings, agreement 
					etc.) of what is being said.</li>
					<li>the morphemes and lexemes<br />
					which helps us to decipher unknown words by looking at their 
					internal structure and also to recognise words we know, of 
					course.&nbsp; We know, therefore, or can infer, that the 
					word <em>untidy</em> is the opposite of <em>tidy</em>, that
					<em>opened</em> is the past tense of <em>open</em> and so 
					on.</li>
					<li>the grammar and structure<br />
					which helps us to identify relationships between words and 
					word classes so if we hear or read, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave it an almighty thump with a 
					hammer</em><br />
					we can infer that <em>almighty</em> is an adjective, that
					<em>thump</em> is a noun (because of the ending on <em>
					almighty </em>and the presence of the article <em>an</em>) 
					and, if we know the word <em>hammer</em>, 
					we know what sort of noun it must be.<br />
					Equally, if an unknown word appears preceded by <em>this, 
					that, these </em>or<em> those</em> we are alert to the fact 
					it's probably a noun but if it appears between an article 
					and a noun, then it's an adjective.&nbsp; We know, too, that 
					nouns and noun phrases form subjects and objects so we can 
					look for the head of phrases in something like:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fractious horse with the white 
					facial flash was neighing irritably in its stable</em><br />
					and be able to reduce that to<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The horse neighed in its stable</em><br />
					which gives us all the information we need for now without 
					troubling about the other elements.&nbsp; We also know, of 
					course, that <em>neigh</em> is something horses do and our 
					knowledge of the world allows us to guess what it might be.&nbsp; 
					If we don't know the word <em>stable</em>, it's not too hard 
					to figure out what it is from the fact that horses are found 
					in them.<br />
					Lastly, if we see:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The alligator devoured the fish</em><br />
					and we know the words <em>alligator</em> (because it's the same in 
					many languages) and <em>fish</em> (because it's very common) 
					we can be pretty certain of the meaning of <em>devoured</em> 
					and know, incidentally, that it's a regular verb.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We must emphasise again that these approaches are not in an 
			either-or relationship.&nbsp; Good listeners and readers use them 
			simultaneously to make sense of what they hear and read.</p>
