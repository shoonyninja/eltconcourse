			<h1>Unit 9: sentences &ndash; clauses and phrases</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="cogs" height="207" src="../../images/cogs_clockwork310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>
			Elsewhere in this course, reference has occasionally been made to 
			sentences, clauses and phrases.&nbsp; Now it is time to take a 
			closer look at what these terms mean.</p>
			<p>
			Briefly, here are some working definitions starting from the bottom 
			up:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>phrase</strong></dt>
				<dd>A phrase is a group of words performing a single grammatical 
				function.<br />
				For example, in<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Water damages paper<br />
				</em>we have three words performing three functions, as you 
				know, like this:<ol>
				<li><em>water</em>: the noun acting as the subject</li>
				<li><em>damages</em>: the verb</li>
				<li><em>paper</em>: a noun acting as the object</li>
			</ol>
				However, we can also have a sentence which appears much more 
				complicated such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman over there has been to see the 
				new film on at the Odeon</em><br />
				and here we have three phrases doing the same things:<ol>
				<li><em>The woman over there</em>: the noun phrase acting as the subject</li>
				<li><em>has been to see</em>: the verb phrase</li>
				<li><em>the new film on at the Odeon</em>: a noun phrase acting as the object</li>
			</ol>If you have followed Unit 2, concerned with word class, this will be familiar ground.&nbsp; Phrases are sometimes single words, sometimes many words, but they perform a 
				<strong>single</strong> grammatical function so it makes sense to talk about word and phrase class.</dd>
				<dt><strong>clause</strong></dt>
				<dd>Clauses are groups of words which contain verbs.<br />
				For example, all these are clauses and they, too, can perform 
				some important grammatical roles.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to see the film<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because he was lonely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made himself dinner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly opening the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He crept in</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				These examples are of three different kinds and that will be 
				explained shortly.</dd>
				<dt><strong>sentence</strong></dt>
				<dd>Just as phrases can consist of more than one word and 
				clauses usually do, sentences can consist of one clause or more 
				than one (sometimes many more).<br />
				Section C of Unit 4 was concerned with conjunctions and there it 
				was explained that there is a difference between coordination 
				and subordination.<br />
				There are four types of sentences:<ol>
				<li>simple sentences contain a single clause, such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John packed his suitcase</em></li>
					<li>compound sentences contain two (or more) coordinated 
					clauses which can potentially stand alone such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took the money from the bank, 
					went back to the shop and bought the coat</em></li>
				<li>complex sentences contain a main clause and a subordinate 
				clause as in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her the truth because she asked</em></li>
				<li>compound-complex sentences contain a combination of 
				coordination and subordination as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came home and fed the cat because he 
				had forgotten in the morning before he sat down to watch the TV</em></li>
			</ol>
				We will assume in what follows that the distinction between 
				these four kinds of sentence is clear.<br />
				To check, try <a href="hps/sentence_types_la_hp.htm" class="highlightlinkla">this test</a>.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>
			The rest of this unit considers phrases, clauses and how they are 
			linked to make a text hang together along with an analysis of a 
			particular sentence type.</p>

			<p>In the section on word class, you encountered the main functions 
			of lexemes.&nbsp; Phrases perform very similar functions so will be 
			easy to identify.<br />
			In what follows, you need to understand that the term <strong>phrase</strong> 
			can be used for a single lexeme or a combination of lexemes.&nbsp; 
			The lexeme <em>table</em> is a noun but it is also a noun phrase.<br />
			In what follows, use your knowledge of the functions of lexemes to 
			decide what the parts <span class="auto-style33"><strong>in green

				<dt class="auto-style33">
					<strong><em>should definitely have paid 
				less</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This is called a verb phrase (and it is) but it 
				contains two embedded adverb phrases: <em>definitely</em> and 
				<em>less</em>.&nbsp; 
				Remember that phrases in this analysis can be single words.&nbsp; 
				A verb phrase strictly seen contains only verb forms so the verb 
				phrase is <em>should have paid</em> and the adverbials, <em>definitely</em> and 
				<em>less</em> modify the verb phrase.&nbsp; For teaching purposes, 
				because verb phrases often contain embedded adverbials, it makes 
				sense to treat them as single units.</dd>
				<dt class="auto-style33"><strong><em>from the bank</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>This is a prepositional phrase and has a noun phrase (<em>the bank</em>) embedded in it acting as 
				its complement.</dd>
			</dl>
			
			<p>Embedding is common.&nbsp; We frequently embed adjective phrases 
			inside noun phrases and adverb phrases inside verb phrases and noun 
			phrases are almost always seen when a preposition is used at all, 
			helping to make up the prepositional phrase.</p>

		<p>One key idea to understand about phrases is the Head because this is 
		the central concept of the phrase.<br />
		For example:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong><em>The young </em> <span class="auto-style33"><em>woman</em></span><em> in red</em></strong></dt>
	<dd>The noun <span class="auto-style33"><strong><em>woman</em></strong></span> is 
	the Head of this phrase.&nbsp; There is a pre-head (<em>the young</em>) and 
	a post-head (<em>in red</em>).&nbsp; We say that the noun is pre-modified, 
	with a determiner and an adjective, and post-modified, with a prepositional 
	phrase.</dd>
			<dt><strong><em>certainly </em> <span class="auto-style33"><em>bought</em></span><em> 
			hurriedly</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>The verb <span class="auto-style33"><strong><em>bought</em></strong></span> 
			is the Head of this verb phrase, in fact, the phrase only consists 
			of the single word.&nbsp; It is pre-modified by an 
			adverb phrase (<em>certainly</em>) and post-modified by another one 
			(<em>hurriedly</em>).</dd>
			<dt><strong><em>the red </em> <span class="auto-style33"><em>car</em></span><em> with the 
			yellow roof</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>The noun <span class="auto-style33"><strong><em>car</em></strong></span> 
			is the Head of this phrase.&nbsp; The pre-head modifier is a 
			determiner plus an adjective, <em>the red</em>.&nbsp; The post-head 
			modifier is a prepositional phrase, <em>with the yellow roof</em>.</dd>
			<dt><strong><em>the more <span class="auto-style33">expensive </span>
			car</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>Here, we have chosen an adjective phrase of which, obviously, 
			the adjective <em>expensive</em> is its Head.&nbsp; It is 
			pre-modified by the adverb <em>more</em> to make it a comparative 
			form.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>the car directly <span class="auto-style33">in front 
			of</span> the garage</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Here, we have the complex preposition, <em>in front of</em>, 
			which forms the Head of the prepositional phrase.&nbsp; It has a 
			complement (or object to some), <em>the garage</em> and is 
			pre-modified by the adverb <em>directly</em>.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>drove very <span class="auto-style33">quickly</span></strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Here, we have an adverb phrase with its Head, <em>quickly</em> 
			and that is pre-modified by another intensifying adverb, <em>very</em>.</dd>
</dl>
		<p>Phrases can sometimes become separated but the analysis of what is 
		the Head, what is the pre-head and what is the post-head stays the same.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			<p><em>The young woman in red</em><strong> 
			</strong><span class="auto-style33"><em>certainly</em></span><strong>
			<span class="auto-style33"><em>bought</em></span>  </strong>
			<em>the red
			car with the yellow roof</em><strong> 
			</strong>
			<span class="auto-style33"><em>hurriedly</em></span><strong>.</strong></p>
			<p>Here, the adverb
			<span class="auto-style33"><em>hurriedly</em></span> is the post-head modifier of the <span class="auto-style33">verb phrase
			</span>but it
			has become 
			separated from the verb and sent to the end of the sentence.</p>
			<p>Phrases can usually only have one Head but they can have 
			many pre- and post-head elements.&nbsp; For example, can you analyse 
			this?&nbsp; Find the Heads of the phrases and then identify the pre- 
			and post-head modifiers.<br />

		<p>When analysing clauses, we need to understand which bit is modifying 
		what.&nbsp; For example, in the sentence:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bought the car with the red roof</em><br />
		it is clear that <em>with the red roof</em> post-modifies the Head <em>
		car</em>.&nbsp; You can't say<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bought with the red roof</em><br />
		so the prepositional phrase obviously modifies <em>the car</em>.</p>
			<p>However, in<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She photographed the dog in the garden</em><br />
		it is not so clear:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the dog in the garden?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was she in the 
		garden?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were they both in the garden?</em><br />
			We can say<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the garden, she photographed the dog</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the dog in the garden that she 
			photographed</em><br />
			and the meaning becomes clear.</p>
			<p>If <em>in the garden</em> modifies the Head <em>dog</em> it is the dog which was
		in the garden and she could have been outside the garden, in 
		the house or in the road, for example.&nbsp; She could have been in a 
		low-flying aircraft for all we know.<br />
		If <em>in the garden</em> modifies the verb phrase <em>photographed</em>, 
		on the other hand, we know that the action took place there and that the 
		dog was also in the garden or the preposition would have been <em>from</em> 
		(<em>She photographed the dog from the garden</em>).</p>
			<p>All this means that we have to be clear what the constituents of the 
			clauses are.&nbsp; Either it is<br />
		Noun phrase as the object of the verb: <em>the dog in the garden</em><br />
		or<br />
		Verb phrase (post modified by a prepositional phrase): <em>photographed in the garden</em></p>
			<p>Try this for yourself with:</p>
			<p><em><strong>She spoke to the man from the big house on the corner.</strong></em></p>
			<p>What are the two possible meanings and how does this change the 
			analysis?<br />

			<p>In this analysis, we will be using the term <strong>clause</strong> for any group of 
			words containing a verb phrase but will distinguish between <strong>finite</strong> 
			and <strong>non-finite</strong> clauses.</p>
			<ul class="yellowbulletlist">
				<li>A finite verb is a form that is 
				marked in some way for tense.&nbsp; For example, in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They met outside the house</em><br />
				we have the past of <em>meet</em>, in this 
				case but no marking for person in that tense because English 
				doesn't do that.&nbsp; In:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She plays tennis on Thursdays</em><br />
				we have another finite form but this time marked for person.<br />
				In English, many verbs which are 
				finite (i.e., carrying tense and person markers) do not have an 
				obvious marker in the morphology.&nbsp; They are still finite 
				forms because having no obvious mark is called a zero marker.<br />
				All of these are clauses with finite verbs (i.e., they are 
				finite clauses):<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em>He arrived at 6 </em>(marked for tense with <em>-d</em> 
					on the verb)</li>
					<li><em>We start at 7</em> (no marking for tense or person but zero 
					marked and finite)</li>
					<li><em>We are starting at 8</em> (marked for tense [current 
					arrangement to talk about the future] and person [plural <em>
					are</em>])</li>

				</li>
				<li>A non-finite verb form is not marked for tense or person, 
				even by zero, and 
				we do not, by looking at it, know when it happens or who does

				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>In geology, a matrix is a fine-grained rock in which other 
			minerals are embedded and the definition will hold quite well for 
			our purposes.<br />
			Consider these two sentences:</p>
			<ol class="style_brown">
				<li class="style_brown">She saw <em>the dog wanted food</em></li>
				<li>S<span class="style_brown">he saw <em>the dog wanted <strong>
				to eat something</strong></em></span></li>
			</ol>
			<dl>
				<dt>In sentence 1., we have two clauses:</dt>
				<dd>The Matrix clause: <span class="style_brown"><em>She saw the dog 
				wanted food</em></span><br />The Subordinate clause embedded in the matrix:<em>
				<span class="style_brown">the dog wanted food</span><br />
				</em>Both of these clauses are finite because the verb is marked 
				for tense (and in many languages would also be marked for aspect 
				and person).</dd>
				<dt>In sentence 2., we have three clauses:</dt>
				<dd>The Matrix clause: <span class="style_brown">She saw the dog 
				wanted to eat something</span><br />Subordinate clause A: <em><span class="style_brown">the dog 
				wanted to eat something</span><br />
				</em>Subordinate clause B: <em><span class="style_brown">
				<strong>to eat something</strong></span><br />
				</em>Both the Matrix clause and Subordinate clause A are finite 
				clauses with the verb marked for tense (<em>s<strong>aw</strong></em> 
				and <em>want<strong>ed</strong></em> respectively).<br />
				Subordinate clause A is embedded in the Matrix clause.<br />
				Subordinate clause B is embedded in Subordinate clause A and is 
				non-finite (the verb, <em>to eat</em>, is unmarked for person or 
				tense).<br />
				Subordinate clause A, therefore, is the Matrix clause for 
				Subordinate B.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>This means, if you are following, that the terms Matrix and 
			Subordinate are <strong>relative</strong>.&nbsp; A subordinate 
			clause can be the matrix clause for its own subordinate clause.<br />
			In many cases (as in these examples) the Matrix clause and the 
			sentence are the same.&nbsp; That needn't be the case because we can 
			have, e.g.,<br /><em>Mary came home when she finished work&nbsp;and John left as soon as 
			he saw her.<br />
			</em>In which we have two Matrix clauses both with an embedded 
			Subordinate clause (of time) but only one sentence.</p>
			<p>If you prefer a graphical representation:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="clause embedding" height="92" src="../../imagesgraphics/clause_structure.png" width="400" /><br />
			</p>
			<p>
			or</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="clauses " height="129" src="../../imagesgraphics/clause_structure2.png" width="400" /></p>
			<p>
			There are two important points:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>All matrix clauses must be 
				<span class="style_underline">finite</span> clauses</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Subordinate clauses can be finite 
				<span class="style_underline">or</span> non-finite</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Non-finite clauses contain one of the following verb forms:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li >the bare infinitive: <em>She let me
				<strong>leave</strong> early</em></li>
				<li >a <em>to</em>-infinitive: <em>I want <strong>to 
				leave</strong> early</em></li>
				<li >a past participle form: <em><strong>
				Left</strong> on the table were the remains of dinner</em></li>
				<li >an <em>-ing</em> form: <em><strong>
				Leaving</strong> early was a real bonus.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Finite verb forms will always be marked for tense (even if as in, 
			e.g., <em>They come late</em>, the marking for tense is the <strong>
			absence</strong> of a change to the verb or an ending) and often 
			for person, too, as in e.g., <em>He come<strong>s</strong> late</em>.</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>This sounds like a contradiction in terms because we have just 
			defined a clause as a unit containing a verb phrase.&nbsp; At times, 
			however, we can leave out the verb because it will be easily 
			understood.&nbsp; We also, incidentally, often have to leave out the 
			verb's subject as well.<br />
			Here are some examples:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Leaving out the finite verb phrase</dt>
				<dd><em>If possible, come before six</em> (= <em>If it is 
				possible, come before six</em>)<br />
				<em>Whether now or later, we'll get it done </em>(= <em>Whether 
				we do it now or later, we'll get it done</em>)<br />
				These clauses often contain conjunctions such as <em>whether, 
				whenever, where </em>etc.</dd>
				<dt>Leaving out a non-finite verb phrase</dt>
				<dd><em>Too tired to cook, I went straight to bed </em>(= <em>
				Being too tired to cook, I went straight to bed</em>)<br />
				<em>There are lots of interesting jobs in the sector, many 
				highly paid </em>(= <em>There are lots of interesting jobs in

			clauses or even simply <strong>small</strong> clauses.</p>

		<span class="style_black"><strong>black</strong></span>.</p>
		<p style="width: 70%"><span class="style_black"><strong><em>John</em></strong>
		<strong><em>came</em></strong>  </span><em>into </em> <span class="style_black"><strong>
		<em>the house</em></strong></span><em>, 
		</em> 
		<span class="style_black"><strong><em>walked</em></strong>  </span>
		<em>through
		</em>
		<span class="style_red"><strong><em>it</em></strong> <strong><em>and</em></strong><em>
		</em> </span><em>went into 
		the </em> <span class="style_black"><strong><em>garden</em></strong><em>
		</em> </span>
		<span class="style_red"><strong><em>where</em></strong> <strong><em>he</em></strong><em>
		</em>
		</span><em>picked two red 
		</em> 
		<span class="style_black"><strong><em>roses</em></strong>  </span>
		<em>and a 
		yellow </em> <span class="style_red"><strong><em>one</em></strong></span>.</p>
		<p>The words <span class="style_red"><strong>in red </strong></span>are examples of cohesion in English and they link to 
		the words <span class="style_black"><strong>in black</strong></span>.</p>
		<ul class="greenbullet">
			<li><span class="style_red"><em>it</em></span> refers to the house</li>
			<li><span class="style_red"><em>and</em></span> links the two 
			actions</li>
			<li><span class="style_red"><em>where</em></span> links the garden 
			to the action</li>
			<li><span class="style_red"><em>he</em></span> refers to John</li>
			<li><span class="style_red"><em>one</em></span> at the end tells 
		us it's also a rose so we don't need to repeat the noun</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Notice, 
		too, that we don't repeat <em>John</em> in <em>walked through it</em>  
		because we know who did that.</p>
		<p>We can refer backwards in a text like this:<br />
		<img alt="referencing" height="102" src="../../imagesgraphics/anaphoric.png" width="465" /><br />
		This is called <strong>anaphoric referencing</strong>.</p>
		<p>It's also possible to refer forwards in a text but that is rarer and 
		gives a different, literary, feel sometimes.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="cataphoric" height="57" src="../../imagesgraphics/cataphoric.png" width="465" /></p>
		<p>
		This is called <strong>cataphoric referencing</strong>.</p>
		<p>
		In all the cases above, we are concerned with what makes sentences hang 
		together.&nbsp; This is called <strong>cohesion</strong>.</p>

		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Reference</strong>:</dt>
	<dd>As we saw in the section on pronouns, this is often achieved using pronouns such as
	<span class="style_red"><em>he</em></span> in the sentence about 
	<em>John</em> 
	above.&nbsp; The pronoun refers either back or forward to the noun in 
	sentences such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	John didn't tell me where </em>
	<span class="style_red"><em>he</em></span><em> is<br />
	or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
	<span class="style_red">she</span> came in, I saw that 
	Mary was very upset<br /></em>Sometimes referencing is to a whole statement in examples such 
			as<em><span class="style_red"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			As I mentioned earlier</span> ...<br /></em>etc.<br />Here are some more examples:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			A: Where's <span class="style_black">the car</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			B: I lent <span class="style_red">it</span> to Mary<br />
	<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bus broke down</span> and
			<span class="style_red">that'</span>s why I'm late<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			When I finally got round to reading <span class="style_red">them</span>, 
			I thought <span class="style_black">the books</span> were really 
			good</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Ellipsis</strong>:</dt>
			<dd>This means leaving out (<strong>ellipting</strong> is the 
			technical verb) a word because the reader / 
			listener knows what the reference is.&nbsp; In the example above, 
			we don't repeat <em>John</em> for the second verb.&nbsp; In spoken 
			English, we very often get exchanges like<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			A: What'<span class="style_black">s for lunch</span>?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			B: Cauliflower cheese </em>(leaving out the clause, <em>is for lunch</em>)<br />
			Here are two more examples:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Who <span class="style_black">arrived</span>?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			B: John</em> (ellipting the verb, <em>arrived</em>)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't like the red <span class="style_black">shoes</span> but 
			I love the <span class="style_red">blue</span></em> (ellipting the 
			noun, <em>shoes</em>)</dd>
			<dt><strong>Substitution</strong>:</dt>
			<dd>In this, we don't leave out the word but change it for something 
			more general.&nbsp; For example, above, the use of 
			<span class="style_red"> <em>one</em></span> to 
			mean <em>a rose</em> or in something like<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What <span class="style_black">wines</span> do you want?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I'll take the French </em><span class="style_red"><em>stuff</em></span></dd>
			<dt><strong>Conjunction</strong>:</dt>
			<dd>We use conjunction to join ideas 
			(you discovered a lot about conjunction in this course) in both spoken and written English.&nbsp; For 
			example, <span class="style_red"><em>and</em></span><em> went into the garden</em>, above, or in exchanges like<br />
			<em>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you open the cage?<span class="style_red"><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Because</span> 
			I wanted to change the water</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Lexical cohesion</strong>:</dt>
			<dd>This refers to the fact that in any text (written or spoken) 
			there are likely to appear chains of related words.&nbsp; For 
			example, a text about hospitals it is likely 
			to contain nouns such as <em>
			medicine, patient, nurse, ward, treatment</em> and <em>doctor</em> 
			with verbs such as<em> treat, admit, operate, 
			sterilise</em> and <em>care for</em>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Grammatical cohesion</strong>:</dt>
			<dd>This refers to the fact that we employ similar grammar in texts 
			to keep the theme, especially the tense, consistent.&nbsp; For 
			example, the use of simple past tenses in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He </em><span class="style_red"><em>went</em></span><em> into 
			the bar, </em><span class="style_red"><em>walked</em></span><em> up 
			to the counter and </em><span class="style_red"><em>ordered</em></span><em> 
			three beers</em></dd>

		<p>Conditional sentences are just one case of clause subordination but, 
		because they cause a good deal of difficulty for learners (and some 
		teachers) we are using them here as an elaborated example of clause 
		patterns.</p>
			<p>A conditional sentence is defined on this site as:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">A sentence which consists of two clauses at 
			least, one of which expresses the condition (the protasis) and 
			contains the conditional conjunction or other marker of condition 
			and one which expresses the consequence of the fulfilment of the 
			condition (the apodosis).<br />
			<span class="auto-style34"><span class="auto-style191">(From the
			<a href="../../glossaries/glossary_is_grammar_lexis_phonology.html" target="_blank">
			glossary of grammar, lexis and phonology</a>)</span></span></p>
			<p>For example, in the sentence:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you come to the party, you'll be able to 
			meet his sister</em><br />
			there are two clauses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The protasis:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you come to the party</em><br />
				which expresses the condition</li>
				<li>The apodosis<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you'll be able to meet his sister</em><br />
				which expresses the consequence of coming to the party.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Another way of putting this is to state that conditionals are a special form of sentences with a main and a 
		subordinate clause.&nbsp; If you would like to review the differences 
			between subordination and coordination, see
			<a class="highlightlinkla" href="U4_la_function_words.html#sectionc" target="_blank">the section on 
		<strong class="highlightlinkla">conjunctions</strong> in Unit 4</a> (new 
			tab).<br />
			Here are a few 
		examples:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>If you see John, will you ask him?</em></li>
			<li><em>I would not bother with it if I were you.</em></li>
			<li><em>You wouldn't have had an accident if you had looked where you 
			were going.</em></li>
			<li><em>If it rains all night, the road'll be flooded by dawn.</em></li>
			<li><em>He would come if you bothered to invite him.</em></li>
			<li><em>If it hadn't been for the rain, we would have won the match.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>In this list, there are two examples of each of the three basic 
		types of conditional sentences.<br />
		Think about what the sentences mean and what times they refer to and 
		then divide up the list into three categories.<br />

			<p>It is important to understand that 
			conditional sentences like these are in two parts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				The conditional clause which starts with 
				the word <em>if</em> (or another word such as <em>providing, unless, 
				supposing </em>etc. which has a similar function).&nbsp; The 
				conditional clause cannot stand alone and make any sense so it 
				is a dependent clause.</li>
				<li>
				The main clause, which can stand alone and 
				represents the outcome.</li>

		The form is easy enough and most learners get it quickly.</p>
			<p>
		The concept is slightly more difficult.&nbsp; First conditional forms are 
		concerned with future events and imply that if one condition is met 
		(<em>coming, pushing hard</em>) the other event (<em>seeing, moving</em>) 
		will follow.<br />Here are some more examples of the form:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it rains, I'll take an umbrella<br />

		Again, this is not too

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Unlikely condition<br />
			</strong>the speaker does not believe there 
		is a high likelihood of an event occurring but if it does, the follow-on 
		event is certain:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I won the lottery I'd be happy (but I 
			don't think I'll win it)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If they gave me an extra holiday, I would be really happy (but I don't 
		think they will)</em><strong><br /></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What would you do if you won the lottery? (but I don't 
		think you'll win)</em></li>
			<li><strong>Unreal condition<br />
			</strong>the speaker does not believe that an event is 
		at all possible logically&nbsp;but is happy to speculate about the outcomes 
		of an unreal event.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If I were you, I'd buy it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If I had a penny 
		for every time I've said that, I'd be a wealthy woman</em></li>
