			<h1>Transcription: a teach-yourself course</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="phonemes" height="207" src="../../imagesgraphics/phoneme_cloud310.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>
			This guide also forms Strand 6 of
			the Teacher 
			Development section.</p>
			<p>This guide concerns transcription, not a description of the 
			sounds of English.&nbsp; For a description of how the sounds of 
			English are made and what mouth parts do, see
			<a href="../../inservice/indexes_is/pronunciation_index_is.html" target="_blank">the 
			in-service guides to pronunciation</a> (new tab).<br />
			This course is:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Firstly, a guide to teaching 
				yourself to transcribe words in what are called their citation 
				forms, i.e., the way they are pronounced when you ask someone 
				to 
				read a list carefully.</li>
				<li>Secondly, a guide to how things are 
				pronounced in normal but not very rapid or mumbled connected 
				speech.</li>
				<li>Thirdly, to provide you with some 
				practice at transcribing what you read and what you hear (see 
				the link at the end for the latter).</li>
				<li>Free.&nbsp; All materials on this site are 
					covered by a Creative Commons licence which means that you 
					are free to share, copy and amend any of the materials but 
					under certain conditions.<br />
					You may not use this 
					material for commercial purposes.&nbsp; The material may be 
					used with fee-paying learners of English but may <strong>not</strong> 
					be used on fee-paying courses for teachers.&nbsp; Small excerpts 
				from materials, conventionally attributed, may be used on such 
				courses but wholesale lifting of materials is explicitly 
				forbidden.&nbsp; There is, of course, no objection at all to 
				providing fee-paying course participants with a link to this 
				guide or any other materials on this site.&nbsp; Indeed, that is 
				welcomed.</li>

					<h2>Why should you learn to transcribe?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are teachers of English language who can lead successful 
			careers in the classroom without ever using more than a minimal 
			amount of phonemic transcription.&nbsp; Some use none at all.&nbsp; 
			There are, however, six good reasons why knowing how to transcribe 
			sounds is a useful skill for a teacher and knowing how to read 
			transcriptions is a useful skill for learners.&nbsp; Here they are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Independence</strong><ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>For the teacher, the ability to transcribe what is heard 
				allows rapid identification of troublesome sounds and other 
				issues that need to be brought to the attention of learners.&nbsp; 
				One can, of course, rely on a pronouncing or other form of 
				dictionary to do the work but that is time consuming and not 
				always possible.&nbsp; Freeing yourself from the need to consult 
				a website or a dictionary for the pronunciation of words allows 
				you to focus on what's important.</li>
					<li>For the learner, the ability to read the transcriptions of 
				pronunciation in a dictionary, mono- or bi-lingual, gives 
					autonomous access 
				to how the word should sound without reference to the spelling 
					or to a model.&nbsp; 
				Many people, dazzled by the spelling, are unaware that, for 
				example, <em>no </em>and <em>know</em> are identically 
				pronounced or that the words <em>right, rite</em> and <em>write</em> 
				also share a single pronunciation.<br />By the same token, it may not at first be obvious that in the 
				words <em>troupe, bought, should, cough</em> and <em>tourist</em> the combination 
				of the letters <em>o</em> and <em>u</em> is differently pronounced in each case.<br />
					It is, of course, possible for the teacher to model the pronunciations in 
					the classroom but the ability to note them down in phonemic 
					script is a valuable learning tool.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Systematicity</strong><br />
				Phonemic transcription is independent of the language 
				insofar as it is systematic.&nbsp; Many attempts have been made 
				to spell English words phonetically but without some unambiguous 
				system of symbols such attempts fail.&nbsp; Unless we can rely 
				on a generally accepted system, there is, for 
				example, no easy way to show the pronunciation of diphthongs and 
				the difference between long and short vowels without resorting to 
				a range of odd and obscure marks over letters such as <em>&ccedil;, &acirc;, &oelig;</em> and so on.&nbsp; 
				Having a single system works.</li>
				<li><strong>Reliability</strong><br />As you may know, spelling in English is not a reliable guide to 
				how a word is pronounced so, even if a learner can correctly 
				recognise and produce the different pronunciations of the <em>o</em> 
				in <em>love</em> and <em>move</em> that is not a guide to 
				knowing how <em>shove</em> or <em>hove</em> are pronounced at 
				all.&nbsp; Access to the phonemic script allows learners 
				instantly to relate the pronunciation of words to one another 
				and not to pronounce <em>hove</em> as if it rhymed with <em>love</em> 
				or <em>shave</em> as if it rhymed with <em>have</em>.<br />Teachers who can transcribe have the ability to make this clear 
				and learners who can read transcription are able to make a note 
				of the difference.</li>
				<li><strong>Ambiguity</strong><br />
				Even when words are spelled the same, they may be differently 
				pronounced (a phenomenon known as homography) so we get, for 
				example, <em>entrance</em> meaning a <em>way in</em> and a verb 
				meaning <em>bewitch</em> or <em>hold someone's complete 
				attention</em>.&nbsp; The words are very differently pronounced.&nbsp; Other examples will include <em>row, minute, live
				</em>and hundreds more.&nbsp; Being able instantly to spot the 
				difference is a skill learners need to develop if they are 
				sensibly to use a dictionary and teachers need instantly to 
				point out when teaching.&nbsp; The best way to do that is <em>
				via</em> phonemic transcription.</li>
				<li><strong>Professionalism</strong><br />
				The ability to use a simple, if technical, area of linguistics 
				is an indicator of professional competence.&nbsp; An inability 
				to read or write a transcription of how something is pronounced 
				is a handicap when it comes to teaching pronunciation and most 
				learners expect formal pronunciation work to be part of what 
				happens in the classroom.</li>
				<li><strong>Correction and needs analysis</strong><br />
				The ability to transcribe how learners pronounce certain 
				phonemes and words is helpful when it comes to researching the 
				needs of your learners.&nbsp; Having a transcription of what 
				they actually produce next to a transcription of what they 
				should produce helps you to identify what needs work and what is 
				adequate.<br />
				For learners, too, a transcription of what they say and the 
				model to compare it to helps them to notice the gap.</li>

			<p>We are talking about
			<span class="style_underline">English</span> sounds here.&nbsp; The study 
			of language sounds (phonemic analysis) is 
			<span class="style_underline">language specific</span>.&nbsp; This 
			mini-course is concerned with the transcription of English sounds.<br />
			You will not, therefore, find mention of the vowel /ɯ/ (which occurs 
			in Turkish, Korean, Irish and many other languages) or /ɾ/ which is 
			the Spanish trilled /r/ sound that does not appear in English but is 
			common in, e.g., Japanese and other languages.&nbsp; The chart below 
			does not, therefore, describe all the sounds of language, just the 
			ones that are used in English (and not all of them as we shall 
			shortly see).</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Phonemes</strong>:<br />
				<img alt="phoneme" height="133" src="../../images/woman_listening_headphones200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>
				In English the sounds /p/ and /b/ are phonemes because changing 
			one to the other affects the meaning of a word.&nbsp; The sentences<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave him a bat</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave him a pat</em><br />
				are distinguished from each other only by the initial sound in 				<em>bat</em> or <em>
			pat</em>.&nbsp; However, the sense of each sentence is very 
				different.<br />
				This is called the Minimal Pair Test:<br />
				<strong><span class="style_black">If you change a single sound in a word 
				in the same place and make a new 
				word, the sound you have changed is a phoneme in that language.</span><br />
				</strong>In other languages, most varieties of Arabic, for example, these two 
				sounds, /b/ and /p/, are not phonemes and changing one to the other will not 
				change the meaning of a word (but it might sound odd).<br />
				Here are some examples of minimal pairs formed with other 
				consonant sounds.&nbsp; Don't worry about the transcriptions at 
				this stage; they are just for reference.&nbsp; Focus on the 
				left-hand column in each of these lists.</dd>

				which
				are examples of vowel-sound minimal pairs in English and any two of the 
				words form a pairing with only one change to the vowel.<br />
				In some languages, not all these vowel sounds are produced and 
				in some, there are vowels that English does not use at all.&nbsp; 
				For example, in Greek there is no distinction between a long 'e' 
				sound as in <em>feet</em> and the short sound in <em>fit</em>.&nbsp; 
				Speakers of the language often use either, both or a sound 
				midway between them without changing the meaning of a word.&nbsp; 
				The sounds do not, therefore, distinguish between minimal pairs in that language.<br />
				You can see that there are, in fact, two vowel sounds in the 
				words <em>boat, bite</em> and <em>bait</em> but the vowel in 
				these cases is called a diphthong and for the purposes of 
				identifying a minimal pair, that counts as a single vowel.&nbsp; 
				You may also have seen that the letter '<em>j</em>' in <em>jut</em> 
				and <em>jet</em> in the first set is formed from two symbols (/dʒ/) and that, 
				too, counts as a single sound.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Allophones</strong>:<br />
				<img alt="similar" height="133" src="../../images/birds_two_gulls200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd><a name="allo"></a>Allophones are slightly different pronunciations of certain phonemes 
		which do not affect the meaning of what is said (although it may sound 
		odd).&nbsp; We saw above that /p/ and /b/ are not phonemes in most 
				varieties of Arabic as are, incidentally, /f/ and /v/ in some 
			varieties.&nbsp; Changing one for the other does not affect the 
				meaning of what you say.&nbsp; You can, of course, pronounce 
				both sounds in Arabic and a hearer may notice the difference but 
				will not assume that you are using a different word, just 
				slightly different ways of making the sound.&nbsp; In this case, 
				the two sounds are allophones.<br />
				An allophone is any of the various ways to say a phoneme in a 
				language, which do <span class="style_underline"><strong>not</strong></span> 
				contribute to distinctions of meaning.&nbsp; In other words, 
				there may be many ways to pronounce a sound, all slightly 
				different, but the differences do not change the meaning.&nbsp; 
				Phonemes are sets of allophones, therefore.<br />
			All languages have a number of allophones.&nbsp; When we are doing a 
				simple phonemic transcription in English, it is not necessary to 
				transcribe allophones differently because they carry no semantic 
				signals.&nbsp; That is not the case in other languages, of 
				course.<br />
				Here are some examples in English:<ol>
					<li>the sound /t/ can be pronounced with and without a 
					following /h/ sound<br />
					Compare the sounds in <em>track </em>and<em> tack<br />
					</em>In the first, when the /t/ is followed by another 
					consonant, the sound is without much aspiration (transcribed 
					as /t/) but in the second, the sound is aspirated and 
					transcribed as /tʰ/.<br />
					In English, these sounds are not phonemes because you can 
					change /t/ to /tʰ/ without changing the meaning of a word.&nbsp; In 
			some languages, Mandarin, for example, /t/ and /tʰ/ are 
					separate phonemes and swapping them around will change the 
					meaning of what you say.</li>
					<li>The same applies to /k/ <em>vs.</em> /kʰ/ (<em>ski</em> 
			vs. <em>cat</em>).&nbsp; When /k/ is not the first sound in the 
					word, it lacks much aspiration but when it is the first 
					sound, or, like /t/ when it is the first sound of a 
					syllable, it carries the aspiration and is transcribed that 
					way.</li>
					<li>The sound /p/ exhibits the same characteristic.&nbsp; 
					Make it the first sound in a word or a syllable, such as in
					<em>copper</em> and it will be aspirated to /pʰ/.</li>
					<li>The /l/ sound in English also has two discernible 
					pronunciations which occur at the beginning and end of the 
					word <em>lull</em> (/lʌl/).&nbsp; Again, because the sounds 
					to not carry any semantic information in English they are 
					not usually transcribed differently:<ul class="smallredbullet">
						<li>the light [l] as in <em>lap</em> which is simply 
						transcribed as /læp/ with the sound pronounced with the 
						tongue tip on the alveolar ridge behind the top teeth.&nbsp; 
						This pronunciation occurs when /l/ is followed by any 
						vowel sound so <em>pull it</em> is transcribed as /pʊl.ɪt/.</li>
						<li>the dark version (which has the symbol [ɫ]) and occurs at the end of words like
						<em>full</em>, transcribed as [fʊɫ] with the tongue 
						further back in the mouth approaching the velum or soft 
						palate.&nbsp; The sound is referred to, incidentally, as 
						velarised.&nbsp; The pronunciation is used when /l/ is 
						not followed by a vowel so pull that is transcribed as /pʊɫ.ðæt/.&nbsp; 
						The transcription may safely be left as /l/ in all cases 
						because it is simpler and we have a rule for the 
						pronunciation of the allophones.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Allophones of vowels are also quite common.&nbsp; For 
					example:<ul class="smallredbullet">
						<li>in Standard British English, the word <em>nurse</em> is transcribed with 
				a long vowel (as /nɜːs/) but in rapid speech the vowel may be 
				shortened to give /nɜs/.&nbsp; No-one listening will mistake the word 
				or assume that the word with a shorter vowel carries a different 
				meaning so the transcription need not distinguish too 
				carefully.&nbsp; The sounds are allophones.<br />
				In Standard American English the word is transcribed as /ˈnɝːs/ 
				with the tiny /r/ denoting that the 'r' sound is pronounced by most 
				American-English speakers but, again, that is an allophonic, not 
				phonemic, difference because the word remains the same with the 
				same meaning.&nbsp; In some varieties of British English, too, 
				the /r/ will be pronounced so we will have /nɜːrs/ as the 
						transcription.</li>
						<li>the words <em>beauty</em> 
				and <em>booty</em> may be pronounced identically as /ˈbuː.ti/ 
				although the standard form for <em>beauty</em> is /ˈbjuː.ti/ and 
				for <em>booty</em>, it is /ˈbuː.ti/.&nbsp; It makes no 
				difference to meaning if your dialect does not distinguish.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				So, the moral is that, unless you are particularly focused on an 
				allophonic phenomenon in your transcription, you can safely use 
				the simplest symbol for the allophone set and ignore the 
				differences.&nbsp; If, however, you are concerned to notice 
				differences, then you have to use phonetic rather than phonemic 
				transcription.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Minimal pairs</strong>:<br />
				<img alt="pair" height="133" src="../../images/two_shoes200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>As we saw above, pairs of words which are distinguished only by a change in one 
			phoneme in the same place are called minimal pairs.&nbsp; For example, <em>hit-hat, 
			kick-sick, fit-bit, sheep-ship, jerk-dirk, hot-cot, love-live</em> 
			etc. are all distinguished in meaning by a single change to a vowel 
			or a consonant.&nbsp; That's in English, of course.&nbsp; It bears 
			repeating that what is an allophone in English may be a phoneme in 
			other languages and <em>vice versa</em>.<br />
				Minimal pairs can also be distinguished by where the stress 
				falls.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				If you stress the word <em>export</em> on the first syllable, 
				you are referring to the noun: <strong>EX</strong>port.&nbsp; Stress the second syllable 
				and you refer to the verb: ex<strong>PORT</strong>.<br />
				Stress the word <em>convict</em> on the first syllable and you 
				refer to a resident of a prison: <strong>CON</strong>vict.&nbsp; Stress the second 
				syllable and you refer to act of finding someone guilty of an 
				offence: con<strong>VICT</strong>.<br />
				One can also have <strong>minimal sets</strong> in which there 
				are more than two words but they are all distinguished from each 
				other by a single difference.&nbsp; For example,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sit, set, sat, sot, suit </em>and <em>
				cite</em><br />
				all differ by a single vowel (/sɪt/, /set/, /sæt/, /sɒt/, /suːt/, 
				/saɪt/ respectively)<br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>fit, hit, bit, knit, lit, sit </em>and <em>kit</em><br />
				is also a minimal set because only the initial consonant 
				distinguishes between them (/fɪt/, /hɪt/, /bɪt/, /nɪt/, /lɪt/, /sɪt/, 
				/kɪt/ respectively).</dd>

			<p>In all the words above, the place of articulation (i.e., where in 
			the mouth the sound is made) is identical for both pairs of 
			consonants.&nbsp; All that changes is whether or not the vocal cords 
			or folds vibrate.<br />
			If you put your hand on your throat and say the

			Try saying the words and examples in the table above out loud

			<p>You have to listen out for voicing when you are transcribing 
			because voiced and unvoiced consonants are full phonemes in English.<br />
			There is, in fact, a cline between fully unvoiced phonemes and those 
			which are heavily voiced but for the purposes of a phonemic rather 
			than phonetic transcription, we simply have to draw a line and have 
			unvoiced and voiced consonants on either side of it.<br />
			Individual speakers, too, vary in the amount of voicing they exhibit 
			and in which consonants they voice in which environments.<br />
			For more, see the section below under assimilation concerning

			If you are transcribing the speech of someone from Scotland, Ireland

			example, they pronounce the initial consonant on <em>where, when, 
			whether, whine, what </em>etc<em>.<br />
			</em>Although the sound is now almost extinct except in some 
			varieties, a variant of /w/ usually transcribed as /hw/ (or you may 
			see it as [ʍ]), appears at the beginning of words spelled <em>wh-</em> 
			but has for almost all speakers of English now merged with /w/.&nbsp; 
			The result is that apart from a small minority of speakers, there is 
			no distinction in pronunciation between <em>weather</em> and <em>

			<p>There are those who argue (Wells, for example) that there is 
			actually no such thing as a triphthong in English.&nbsp; They take 
			the view, roughly summarised, that the vowels in, e.g., <em>player</em> 
			break into two syllables so what we have is simply a diphthong 
			followed by another vowel so the transcription should be:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈpleɪ.ə/, not /ˈpleɪə/<br />
			and that means the diphthong /eɪ/ as in <em>day</em> followed by the 
			schwa in the second syllable.<br />
			Wells puts it like this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">I would argue that part of the definition of a 
			true triphthong must be that it constitutes a single V unit, making 
			with any associated consonants just a single syllable.<br />
			Given that, do we have triphthongs in English? I claim that 
			generally, at the phonetic level, we don’t. I treat the items we are 
			discussing as basically sequences of a strong vowel plus a weak 
			vowel.<br />
			<span class="auto-style103">Wells, 2009</span></p>
			<p>Roach, on the other hand, argues differently and states that:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The most complex English sounds of the vowel 
			type are the triphthongs. They can be rather difficult to pronounce, 
			and very difficult to recognise. A triphthong is a glide from one 
			vowel to another and then to a third, all produced rapidly and <em>
			<strong>without interruption</strong></em>.<br />
			<span class="auto-style103">Roach, 2009:29 (emphasis added)</span></p>
			<p>Crystal, states:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The distinction between triphthongs and the 
			more common diphthongs is sometimes phonetically unclear.<br />
			<span class="auto-style103">Crystal, 2008:497</span></p>
			<p>This is not the place to pit two esteemed phoneticians against 
			each other so we'll stick with the simplest explanation, the one 
			proposed by Wells, and suggest that what is sometimes called a 
			triphthong is, in fact a glide from a diphthong to another vowel, 
			the schwa and that there are (or can be) two syllables in such 
			pronunciations.<br />
			Here, we will recognise five of these combinations of sounds.&nbsp; 
			Whether whomever you are transcribing produces all five is a matter 
			of the accent and background of the speaker as well as how carefully 
			and slowly the words are spoken.<br />

			<li>/eɪə/ as in <em>player</em> (/ˈpleɪər̩/) or <em>mayor</em> (/ˈmeɪər/.&nbsp; Start with

			<h2>Marking stress and syllables</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>As we saw, the main stressed syllable is conventionally indicated 
			by ' before the syllable (e.g., /'sɪl.əb.l̩/).<br />
			It is sometimes helpful to mark secondary stress in longer words 
			like <em>incontrovertible</em> by a lowered symbol like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ɪn<strong>ˌ</strong>k.ɒn.trə.'vɜː.təb.l̩/<br />
			in which you can see a small <strong>ˌ</strong> before the /k/ sound 
			indicating that the second syllable carries secondary stress and the 
			main stress falls on the fourth syllable and is shown by the 'vɜː in 
			the transcription.&nbsp; Most learners find just one stressed 
			syllable enough to cope with.<br />
			If we want to show that non-phonemically, we might write:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in<span class="style_underline">con</span>tro<span class="style_underline"><strong>VER</strong></span>tible<br />
			on the board with an <span class="style_underline">underline</span> 
			lower-case for secondarily stressed syllables but bold, underlined
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>CAPITALS</strong></span> for 
			the main stress.<br />
			(An alternative way to mark stress sometimes used by professional 
			phoneticians is to place an acute accent over the onset vowel of a 
			stressed syllable and a grave accent over a secondarily stressed 
			item.&nbsp; In this case, the syllable borders are usually ignored.)</p>
			<p>However, before we can decide where to put the stress mark, we 
			need to identify the syllables in an utterance.&nbsp; That is not 
			always as easy as it sounds.<br />
			A syllable is <span class="style_black"><em>a unit of pronunciation 
			having one vowel sound, with or without surrounding consonants</em></span>.<br />
			By that definition, all of the following are single syllables:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ask<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bus</em><br />
			of various kinds (there is a guide to the difference on this site 
			which you can access
			<a href="../../inservice/pronunciation/syllable_phonotactics.html" target="_blank">
			in the guide to syllables and phonotactics</a> (new tab)).<br />
			You can transcribe these individual words without any stress or 
			syllable marks because there is no stress to note and only one 
			syllable in question.&nbsp; In connected speech, of course, we may 
			need to insert a stress mark if the word carries stress in a longer 
			string of text.&nbsp; The transcription of those words is, 
			therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or: 
			</em>/ɔː/<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go: 
			</em>/ɡəʊ/<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ask: 
			</em>/ɑːsk/<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bus: 
			</em>/bʌs/<br />and there are no other markings.</p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">However, words or utterances of more than 
			one syllable pose a problem because the transcription needs to show 
			both the division into syllables and the place where the stress 
			appears.</p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">Syllables first.<br />
			Count the syllables in <em>denationalization</em> and then 
			transcribe the word, putting a '.' between the syllables.<br />

			<p class="auto-style97" id="vowels0" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">You 
			should have:<br />
			There are 7 syllables so the word is broken down as <em>de-na-tio-na-li-za-tion</em>.<br />
			The transcription is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˌdi:.ˌnæ.ʃə.nə.laɪ.ˈzeɪʃ.n̩/<br />
			In rapid speech, however, many speakers will omit some of the 
			syllables in very long words so the transcription might easily be:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˌdi:.ˌnæʃ.nə.laɪ.ˈzeɪʃ.n̩/<br />
			with the third syllable dropped.<br />
			Notice, too, that the final syllable in both cases is simply /n̩/ 
			which denotes that there is no obvious vowel between the /ʃ/ and the 
			/n/ sounds.&nbsp; That's called a syllabic consonant because the 
			single consonant forms a syllable.<br />
			If you transcribed that with /ən/ at the end, that's fine (and 
			correct).&nbsp; It can also be transcribed as /ᵊn/ 
			to show that the vowel is very short.&nbsp; There is a bit more on 
			syllabic consonants below.</p>
			<p>The rules for deciding where a syllable starts and stops are 
			quite complex in English but there is a rule of thumb we can use to 
			decide, for example, how to divide a word like <em>tumbler</em>.<br />

			Here are the rules:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>If there is a choice, attach the consonant to the right-hand 
				syllable, not the left:<br />
				That would mean that the transcription would be:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈtʌm.blə/<br />
				and that's fine, but why don't we attach both consonants to the 
				right-hand syllable and it isn't:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈtʌ.mblə/?<br />
				Here, we need rule 2:</li>
				<li>If attaching the consonants to the right-hand element 
				produces a syllable which is forbidden as the beginning of a 
				word in English, move one of them to the left.<br />
				In English, no word can begin /mb/ (although that is allowable 
				in some languages).&nbsp; We can, however, have a word beginning 
				/bl/, of course, such as <em>black, blur, block</em> etc.<br />
				Therefore, applying both rules, we end up with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ˈtʌm.blə/</li>

			<p>There are times when you have to listen extremely carefully to 
			hear whether a speaker is actually producing the intrusive sound or 
			inserting /ʔ/, a glottal stop (see next section).<br />
			For example, many will pronounce<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Go out</em><br />
			as /gəʊʔaʊt/ rather than /ɡəʊ.ˈwaʊt/,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gorilla and me</em><br />
			as /ðə.ɡə.ˈrɪ.ləʔənd.miː/ rather than /ðə.ɡə.ˈrɪ.lə.rənd.miː/<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am here</em><br />
			as /ˈaɪʔæm.hɪə/ rather than /ˈaɪ.jæm.hɪə/.</p>
			<p>As we saw above with the transcription of <em>suet</em>, many 
			speakers of all varieties will insert an intrusive /w/ in the middle 
			of the word, producing /ˈsuːwɪt/ instead of /ˈsuːɪt/ and so we also 
			hear <em>fuel</em> as /ˈfjuːwəl/ but that word, even without the 
			intrusive /w/ is pronounced with an intrusive /j/ as the 
			transcriptions show.<br />
			if you listen carefully to some British English speakers 
			pronouncing words such as <em>tune, fortune, produce, century, 
			nature, mixture, picture, creature, opportunity, situation, actually</em> 
			you may hear an intrusive /j/ sound after the /t/ or /d/ not shown 
			in the spelling.<br />
			Therefore, the transcription is actually:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>tune</em> /tjuːn/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>actually</em> /ˈæk.tjuə.li/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>situation</em> /ˌsɪ.tjʊ.ˈeɪʃ.n̩/<br />
			etc. although ˈæk.tʃuə.li/ and /ˌsɪ.tʃʊ.ˈeɪʃ.n̩/ are also heard.&nbsp; 
			Not all speakers do this.</p>
			<p>A further issue to listen for is <strong>the linking /r/</strong> 
			sound.<br />
			In British English, the final 'r' on many words is unsounded so, for 
			example, <em>harbour</em> is pronounced as /ˈhɑː.bə/, whereas in 
			AmE, the standard pronunciation includes the /r/ sound and the 
			pronunciation is /ˈhɑːr.bər/.<br />
			However, when a word ending in 'r' immediately precedes a word with 
			an initial vowel, we get the linking /r/ and the sound is produced 
			so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; My father asked</em><br />
			will be pronounced as<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			/maɪ.ˈfɑːð.ər.ˈɑːskt/ in BrE and as<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			/maɪ.ˈfɑːð.r̩.ˈæskt/ in AmE.</p>

			<p>In the last case, the assimilation of /s/ 
			and /z/ to /ʃ/, some would aver that the /s/ and /z/ sounds are 
			simply being omitted and that's elision, the topic of the next 
			section.&nbsp; Others believe that the /ʃ/ sound is, in fact being 
			extended to nearly double its usual pronunciation so this is a case 
			of assimilation.&nbsp; The distinction, such as it is, is not vital 
			for teaching purposes.<br />
			Consonant lengthening is a minor area in English (but not so in some 
					languages).&nbsp; There are times when two non-plosive 
					consonants occur together and, normally in rapid speech, one 
					of them is assimilated (or elided, depending on your point 
					of view).&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some milk</em><br />
					is usually pronounced as /səm.ɪlk/<br />
					with only one /m/ sound.<br />
					However, when people are being slightly more careful and 
					speaking a little more slowly, both /m/ sounds are heard so 
					the transcription is /səm.mɪlk/ and it would appear from 
					that that there are two separate sounds in the middle of the 
					phrase.&nbsp; What in fact frequently happens is not that we 
					have two /m/ sounds but that we have a single sound slightly 
					lengthened.<br />
					The transcription is sometimes adjusted to take this into 
					account and a length mark is inserted after the consonant so 
					we get the transcription as /səmː.ɪlk/.<br />
					The phenomenon is called <strong>gemination</strong> (from 
					the Latin <em>gemini</em>, meaning twins).<br />
					This sort of lengthening occurs most frequently with certain 
					consonants because plosives such as /p/ cannot usually be 
					lengthened.<br />
					Some examples are:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; club bar</em> /klʌb.bɑː/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mad demons</em> /mæd.ˈdiː.mənz/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; safe fire</em> /seɪf.ˈfaɪə/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; big gate</em> /bɪɡ.ɡeɪt/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; full label</em> /fʊl.ˈleɪb.l̩/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warm margarine </em>
					/wɔːm.ˌmɑː.dʒə.ˈriːn/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gin next</em> /dʒɪn.nekst/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; car research</em> /kɑː.rɪ.ˈsɜːtʃ/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less sense</em> /les.sens/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mash shop</em> /mæʃ.ʃɒp/<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cave visit</em> /keɪv.ˈvɪ.zɪt/<br />
					and here we have followed the convention of transcribing 
					both consonants although we are aware that in rapid speech 
					one will not usually be sounded.&nbsp; If that is the case 
			in what you hear, delete the second of the consonant sounds but 
			retain the syllable marker.&nbsp; If you wish to use the length 
			marker after the consonant, that's fine too, providing that it is 
			what you heard, but be aware that it is not a widely used 
			convention.<br />
					In some languages, including Arabic, Danish, Estonian, 
					Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Polish and Turkish, 
					consonant lengthening carries meaning so a short or long 
					consonant are independent phonemes.&nbsp; In English, no 
					such meaning attaches to a longer consonant so we are 
					dealing with allophonic differences and the transcription 
			may be unaffected, therefore.</p>

			<h3>Voicing and devoicing</h3>
			<p>Assimilation, both progressive and regressive, also affects 
			voicing (sometimes known as sonorisation).&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>the <em>s</em> following an unvoiced consonant will 
				be pronounced as /s/ so we get <em>hat</em> and <em>hats</em> (/hæt/ 
				and /hæts/), <em>make</em> and <em>makes</em> (/ˈmeɪk/ and /ˈmeɪks/) 
				and so on.</li>
				<li>following a voiced consonant, however, <em>s </em>is usually voiced 
				from /s/ to /z/ so we get <em>rug</em> and <em>rugs</em> (/rʌɡ/ and /rʌɡz/),
				<em>cab</em> 
				and <em>cabs</em> (/kæb/ and /kæbz/) and so on.</li>
				<li>some speakers carry this over to other sounds, particularly 
				the&nbsp;/θ/ and may pronounce, for example, <em>baths</em> as&nbsp;/bɑːðz/ and
				<em>youths</em> as /juːðz/.&nbsp; Others will retain the /θ/ in 
				the plural forms.&nbsp; You simply have to listen out for which 
				the speaker is doing.</li>
				<li>regressively, the /v/ in, for example, <em>have</em> is 
				often devoiced before a voiceless consonant such as /t/ so the 
				pronunciation of <em>have to</em> is /həf.tuː/ or /həf.tə/ and <em>love 
				camping</em> is /ˈlʌf.ˈkæmp.ɪŋ/.&nbsp; Not all speakers do this and 
				many retain the voiced /v/ in such expressions so, again, you 
				have to listen for which variety the speaker is producing.</li>
				<li>a teaching point is that in some languages, German, Dutch, 
				Polish and Russian, for example, a final consonant is always 
				devoiced so, e.g., <em>bag, club, has, had</em> and <em>cave</em> 
				may be pronounced as /bæk/, /klʌp/, /hæs/, /hət/, /keɪf/, 
				respectively, instead of /bæɡ/, /klʌb/, /hæz/, /həd/ and /keɪv/.<br />
				If you are transcribing learner English, that is something to 
				listen out for.</li>

			<p>It is important, too, to listen carefully for what is <strong>not</strong> 
			pronounced and this also involves releasing oneself from the spell 
			of the written word and hearing only what is being said, not what 
			one expects to be said.<br />
			Again, the guide to connected speech has more detail in this area 
			but here it will be enough to present some examples:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>English uses a variety of 
			contracted forms, leaving out whole sections of words (<em>hasn't, 
			can't, wouldn't've</em> etc.).&nbsp; You need to listen carefully to 
				detect whether the speaker has used these or not (as, e.g., /ˈhæznt/, 
				/kɑːnt/, /ˈwʊdnt.əv/ etc.&nbsp; There are other examples such as:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the loss of the /d/ in 
				<em>sandwich</em> (/ˈsæn.wɪdʒ/)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the 
			pronunciation of <em>library </em>as /ˈlaɪ.bri/, <em>comfortable</em> 
			as /ˈkʌmf.təb.l̩/ or <em>probably</em> as /ˈprɒbli/.</li>
				<li>The initial /h/ sound is often dropped in rapid speech so, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give it 
			to him<br />
				</em>may be correctly transcribed as /<span class="style_brown">ˈ</span>ɡɪv.ɪt.tu.ɪm/.</li>
				<li>The initial vowel in <em>if</em> is often elided in 
				conditional clauses so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I were you ...</em><br />
				is pronounced as: /ˈfaɪ.wə.ju/</li>
				<li>Function words are often reduced.&nbsp; We saw above that 
				the schwa often appears in reduced function words such as <em>
				of, and, to</em> and so on.&nbsp; Reduction also occurs, 
				however, when all or part of 
			a function word such as <em>of</em> is omitted as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cup of 
			coffee<br /></em>being pronounced<em> as
			cuppa coffee</em> (/kʌpə ˈkɒ.fi/<br />In many cases the word <em>and</em> is reduced to 'n' 
				and the /d/ is dropped as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tea 
			'n' cakes<br />
				</em>as /tiː n̩ keɪks/.</li>
				<li>Clusters of consonants are often simplified so, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sixths<br />
				</em>may usually be transcribed as /sɪkθs/ 
			or even /sɪkfs/ and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; text message</em><br />
				becomes /teks.ˈme.sɪdʒ/<br />
				and so on.<br />
				More examples are in the guide to connected speech.</li>
				<li>Adjacent sound elision occurs frequently.&nbsp; When the 
				sound at the end of one stretch of language is the same as the 
				one at the beginning of the next item, they are usually reduced 
				to a single sound in connected speech so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm meeting Mary</em><br />
				is pronounced as: /aɪ.ˈmiːt.ɪŋ.ˈmeər.i/ not /aɪm.ˈmiːt.ɪŋ.ˈmeər.i/<br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't take that table</em><br />
				is pronounced as /dəʊn.teɪk.ðæ.ˈteɪb.l̩/ not /dəʊnt.teɪk.ðæt.ˈteɪb.l̩/<br />
				In the transcription here, we have removed the first of the 
				sounds but you can decide whether it is the first or the second 
				which is elided.<br />
				Speakers are not consistent in this and some will retain both 
				sounds or, when it is possible, as with /m/ to extend the sound 
				slightly.&nbsp; That is not possible with stops such as /t/, /k/ 
				/d/ etc. but occurs with fricatives like /f/ and /s/ and with 
				the nasal sounds.&nbsp; When it happens both phonemes appear in 
				the transcription so, e.g.,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She makes sandwiches</em><br />
				can be transcribed either as /ʃi.ˈmeɪk.ˈsæn.wɪdʒ.ɪz/ or as 
				/ʃi.ˈmeɪks.ˈsæn.wɪdʒ.ɪz/</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Again, speakers vary in this with some being more careful and 
			correct and others less so (or sloppy as writers to newspapers often 
			describe them).&nbsp; You have to listen hard to hear what is really 
			being said.</p>

			<p>At the back of your mouth there is a part of your larynx called

			A glottal stop is formed by briefly blocking the airflow at the

					<h3>Rhoticity</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
					<p>
					A rhotic dialect or variety of English is one in which the 
					letter 'r' is pronounced as /r/ before a consonant or at the 
					end of a word.&nbsp; For example, a rhotic accent, in this 
					case General American is our example, will pronounce:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>card</em> as /kɑːrd/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>far</em> as /fɑːr/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>murder</em> as /ˈmɝː.dər/<br />
					The symbol /ɝ/ is called an R-coloured or rhotic vowel.<br />
					A non-rhotic variety such as BrE will pronounce those three words as /kɑːd/, 
					/fɑː/ and /ˈmɜː.də/.<br />
					The rhotic pronunciation is standard in American English and 
					is becoming slightly more frequent in BrE, too.<br />
					You sometimes need to listen hard to recognise whether an 
					'r' is being sounded in the middle of a word so, for example 
					the AmE pronunciation of <em>diversion</em> is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /daɪ.ˈvɝː.ʒən/<br />
					whereas the BrE pronunciation lacks rhoticity:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /daɪ.ˈvɜːʃ.n̩/.<br />
					There are other differences, too, which are covered later.<br />
					The symbol /ɝː/ to show the sound (a rhotic vowel) may also 
					appear as /ɜːr/</p>
			<p>
					We saw above that in most southern British dialects, the /r/ 
					sound is only pronounced when the following sound is a vowel 
					so we get, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; My father asked</em><br />
					pronounced as<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			/maɪ.ˈfɑːð.ər.ˈɑːskt/ in BrE and as<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			/maɪ.ˈfɑːð.r̩.ˈæskt/ in AmE.<br />
					When the following sound is non-vocalic (not a vowel), this 
					linking /r/ does not occur so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;My father told me</em><br />
					is pronounced as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /maɪ.ˈfɑːð.ə.təʊld.miː/<br />
					in non-rhotic accents but as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /maɪ.ˈfɑːð.ər.təʊld.miː/<br />
					in rhotic accents.<br />
					In some speakers, the linking /r/ is avoided in favour of a 
					glottal /ʔ/ (see above).<br />
					In transcribing what is actually said, either by speakers of 
					the language or by learners, it is important to be alert to 
					whether the speaker is using a rhotic accent or a non-rhotic 
					accent.</p>
			<p>
					There are three influences which determine the use of a rhotic 
					accent and using knowledge of them can help you to listen 
					out when transcribing speakers' production.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Geographical location<br />
						As a rule of thumb, the following varieties of English 
						are non-rhotic:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Southern British English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BBC English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welsh English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Zealand English (although there is some evidence of the 
						influence of Scottish settlers contributing to rhoticity 
						in some areas)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Australian English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malaysian English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporean English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South African English and English spoken elsewhere in Africa 
						as a <em>lingua franca</em><br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trinidadian and Tobagonian English<br />
						and the following varieties are generally rhotic:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most varieties of Scottish English (although non-rhotic 
						accents are common in Edinburgh and latterly in Glasgow)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South West English and some varieties in and around 
						Manchester, parts of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and on 
						the Scottish Borders<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irish English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; American English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barbadian English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indian English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pakistani English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bangladeshi English.</li>
						<li>Social class and perceived status<br />
						The status of rhotic <em>vs</em>. non-rhotic accents has 
						a somewhat chequered history.<br />
						In most varieties of British English a non-rhotic 
						production is associated with high status dialects such 
						as BBC English and rhotic varieties are confined to 
						rural areas and the north.&nbsp; This is changing with 
						an identifiable move towards rhotic varieties 
						everywhere.&nbsp; The degree of rhoticity closely 
						matches socio-economic class.<br />
						In North America, the situation is more complex.<br />
						Up until the end of the 19th century, a non-rhotic 
						pronunciation was considered prestigious, especially in 
						East coast cities such as New York and Boston.<br />
						The American Civil War (1861-1865) and, arguably, the 
						previous War of Independence (1775-1783), changed things, 
						removing the prestige of <em>r</em>-dropping and, since 
						the Second World War, a rhotic pronunciation has become 
						a standard high-prestige accent in the USA.<br />
						African-American Vernacular English retains the 
						non-rhotic pronunciation but some speakers with Hispanic 
						heritages may use a Spanish-influenced trill for the 
						/r/.<br />
						Canadian English is generally rhotic.</li>
						<li>Influences<br />
						Many speakers of English as a second language will use a 
						rhotic accent either because of the influence of AmE on 
						their learning of the language or because their first 
						languages are rhotic and they carry over the 
						pronunciation of /r/ into English.<br />
						For example, speakers of English who have Hindi or a 
						Dravidian language as their first will often use a 
						rhotic pronunciation in English but speakers of 
						Cantonese (which lacks the /r/ consonant) will often use 
						a non-rhotic pronunciation.&nbsp; Hence, for example, 
						Hong Kong English is generally non-rhotic although the 
						influence of American media and cultural issues are 
						contributing to more rhoticity even there.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>
					Varieties of /r/ sounds</h4>
					<p>
					In English, how the /r/ sound is produced is not 
					semantically significant, the various pronunciations, 
					therefore, heard in South West Britain, Ireland and Scotland 
					etc. are allophonic not phonemic distinctions.<br />
					Learners of English will, quite naturally, often carry over 
					their native language pronunciation of /r/ into English and 
					that contributes significantly to a foreign accent although 
					it rarely interferes with communication.<br />
					Here's a short list:<br />
					In Spanish, the sole difference between <em>pero</em> (<em>but</em>) 
					and <em>perro</em> (<em>dog</em>) is that in the former the 
					'r' is pronounced as a single flap (phonetically as [ɾ]) 
					rather than trilled as it is in the latter like the Scottish 
					[r].<br />
					Many languages, including Bulgarian, Swedish, Norwegian, 
					Italian, Spanish, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian and 
					Dutch use a similar trilled sound.<br />
					French, European Portuguese and some German speakers may use 
					a voiceless uvular fricative, phonetically [ʁ] which is 
					produced by restricting the airflow over the back of the 
					throat with the tongue.&nbsp; This is not so obvious if it 
					occurs at all in 
					many German dialects.<br />
					Most Chinese languages, except Cantonese, use a retroflex sound, phonetically, 
					[ɻ] in which the tip of the tongue is curled back but the 
					situation is complex dialectically.&nbsp; This is not 
					dissimilar, incidentally, to the sound as it is produced in 
					South West Britain.<br />
					Some languages, notably Thai and Japanese, do not 
					distinguish phonemically between /r/ and /l/ so the 
					production of 'r' and 'l' in English may be randomly one or the 
					other.</p>

					<h3>Crushing the schwa: syllabic consonants</h3>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>If you listen very carefully to how someone pronounces a word 
			like <em>stable</em>, you may hear two or three possible pronunciations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greenbullet">/ˈsteɪb.l̩/<br />
				or</li>
				<li class="greenbullet">/ˈsteɪbəl/<br />
				or</li>
				<li class="greenbullet">/ˈsteɪbᵊl/</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The first is more likely to appear in quite rapid speech and the 
			second sounds rather formal and slow.&nbsp; The third is an 
			intermediate stage in which some people will hear a schwa but aver 
			that it is simply shortened.&nbsp; That would be transcribed with the symbol for the schwa raised to signify its comparative 
			shortness.<br />
			What is happening is that the schwa between /b/ and /l/ is being 
			crushed in normal rapid speech so that the final /l/ sound 
			constitutes a syllable on its own.&nbsp; Usually, syllables are 
			defined by vowels but, in this case, a consonant alone is the 
			syllable because the schwa is all but impossible to hear.<br />
			To transcribe this phenomenon, you need to place a dot before the 
			syllable and insert a small mark below it to signify that it is a 
			syllabic consonant (see above).</p>
			<p>There are, in English, three types of syllabic consonant and they 
			affect /l/ (the example above), /n/ and /r/.&nbsp; Here are some 
			examples.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>syllabic /l/</strong></dt>
				<dd>The example of <em>stable</em> above is a case but this type of 
				schwa crushing occurs very frequently with the suffix -<em>able</em> 
				meaning <em>with the ability</em> so, for example, we get:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="width: 200px" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style150" style="width: 100px"><em>capable</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style149" style="width: 100px">/ˈkeɪ.pəb.l̩/</td>
				</tr>

					<td class="auto-style151" style="width: 100px">
					/'ʌŋk.l̩/</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
				and so on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>syllabic /n/</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is not such an obvious phenomenon so two transcriptions 
				of many words are possible.&nbsp; It all depends on how rapidly 
				and clearly the words are pronounced.&nbsp; The faster the 
				production, the more likely it is that the final /n/ will 
				constitute a syllable on its own.&nbsp; Like this:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style150" style="width: 100px"><em>darken</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style153" style="width: 100px">/ˈdɑːkən/</td>

					/ˈdræ.ɡən/</td>
					<td class="auto-style151" style="width: 100px">
					/ˈdræɡ.n̩/</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
				This is frequent in many varieties of English with the 
				noun-forming suffix -<em>tion</em>.&nbsp; So we have, e.g.:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style150" style="width: 100px"><em>meditation</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style153" style="width: 100px">/ˌme.dɪ.ˈteɪʃ.ən/</td>

					<td class="auto-style151" style="width: 100px">
					/ɪk.ˈsep.ʃ.n̩/</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
				This does not occur with the nasalised sound /ŋ/.&nbsp; But if 
				the sound is converted to /n/ it may so <em>hunting</em> could be 
				transcribed as /'hʌnt.n̩/ in some varieties of English.</dd>
				<dt><strong>syllabic /r/</strong></dt>
				<dd>Again, this is not always obvious and does not occur in most 
				varieties of British English.&nbsp; However, in some American 
				and other standard varieties in which a final /r/ is pronounced 
				even when not followed by a vowel sound, 
				it may be syllabic.&nbsp; So, in rapid speech 
				we may encounter, for example:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">

			<p>Unlike individual sounds and issues of connected speech, there is

			intonation.<br />
			In the classroom, most teachers develop their own ways of doing this 
			depending on the features they want to highlight.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Some use slanted and carefully positioned boxes, like this:<br />
				<img alt="intonation" height="53" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonation_time_here.png" width="250" /><br />
				which works well for showing the rise and fall of tone across a 
				sentence but less well for showing the tonic stress.</li>
				<li>Some use slanted or straight lines, like this:<br />
				<img alt="intonation 2" height="70" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonation_time_here2.png" width="250" /></li>
				<li>or wavy lines:<br />
				<img alt="intonation 3" height="89" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonation_time_here4.png" width="250" /></li>
				<li>and these can be extended to include some recognition of the 
				stressed syllables, like this:<br />
				<img alt="intonation 3" height="68" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonation_time_here3.png" width="250" /></li>
				<li>As a more consistent way of showing the patterns, you may 
				like to try having a keyed transcription, like this:<br />
				<img alt="intonation 5" height="39" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonation_time_here5.png" width="310" /><br />
				in which
				<img alt="level" class="auto-style90" height="15" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonation_level.png" width="24" /> 
				= level tone starts here,
				<img alt="down" height="24" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonation_down.png" width="17" />

				= rising tone here.<br />
				Letters <span class="auto-style89"><strong>in UPPER CASE 
				underlined and in bold</strong></span> show stress.</li>
				<li>In the section on intonation in this site a variety of 
				formats is used depending on what it is that needs describing.&nbsp; 
				Some of it looks like this:<br />
		<img alt="intonation" height="48" src="../../imagesgraphics/intonation310.png" width="310" /><br />
				representing a sharp rise, a level tone, a rise-fall, a 
				fall-rise, a rising tone and a falling tone respectively.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Whichever system or systems you adopt, you need to make sure that 
			your learners understand its implications.</p>
			<p>There is no exercise on this because</p>
			<ol class="auto-style91">
				<li>you are free to choose, adapt or invent your own system</li>
				<li>people usually disagree about how the intonation actually 
				works and</li>
				<li>there is simply no evidence that we can equate intonation to

			</ol>

			<p>Nearly all of the above has so far been based on RP (Received 
			Pronunciation) in British English although we have referred to other 
			varieties when it was essential to do so.&nbsp; You may find yourself 
			transcribing the standard American pronunciation, called GAm or just 
			GA 
			(General American) which has a similar status to RP in Britain.<br />
			We need also to be aware that within varieties there are significant 
			differences of accent.&nbsp; In the USA at least nine varieties are 
			usually identified and, of course, the more precise and careful the 
			analysis is, the more varieties will be described.&nbsp; 
			Traditionally, in Britain eight varieties are usually recognised and 
			each is further divided into between three and ten sub-varieties.<br />
			You need to be alert to the usual differences between the varieties 
			and transcribe what you heard, not what you expected to hear.&nbsp; 
			Here's some help:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Rhoticity</strong></dt>
				<dd>We saw (above) that AmE is a rhotic variety but most BrE 
				forms are non-rhotic.&nbsp; The pronunciation, therefore of 
				words such as <em>curse, nurse, father </em>and so on is 
				marginally different in the varieties.&nbsp; The symbol /ɝː/ 
				represents this rhotic sound.&nbsp; At the end of words the /r/ 
				sound in AmE is often syllabic (/r̩/) which can, alternatively, 
				be transcribed as /ɚ/.<br />
				For example:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style55">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style165">Example</td>
						<td class="auto-style165">AmE</td>
						<td class="auto-style165">BrE</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style146"><em>father</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style146">/ˈfɑːð.ᵊr/, /ˈfɑːð.ɚ/ or /ˈfɑːð.r̩/</td>
						<td class="auto-style146">/ˈfɑːð.ə/</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style146"><em>nurse</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style146">/nɝːs/</td>
						<td class="auto-style146">/nɜːs/</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style146"><em>curse</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style146">/kɝːs/</td>
						<td class="auto-style146">/kɜːs/</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				(Rhoticity differences between BrE and AmE can also affect 
				spelling so we get the US spelling of <em>schoolmarm</em> and 
				the British spelling as <em>schoolma'am</em>, for example.)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Word stress</strong></dt>
				<dd>Although rarely the cause of any misunderstanding, there are 
				some differences.&nbsp; In many cases, both patterns exist in 
				both varieties.&nbsp; Some examples are:<ol class="auto-style91">
					<li>Words stressed in the first syllable in BrE and the 
					second in AmE include:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>ballet, barrage, baton, 
					brochure, buffet, café, chauffeur, debris, detail, frontier, 
					garage, massage, parquet, plateau, risqué, sachet, salon
					</em></span><span class="style_blue">and</span><span class="style_black"><em> 
					vaccine</em></span>.</li>
				<li>A few words show the opposite pattern, stressed on the 
				second syllable in BrE and on the first in AmE and they include:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>address, cigarette, renaissance </em></span>
				<span class="style_blue">and</span><span class="style_black"><em> 
				magazine</em></span></li>
				<li>In BrE, it is common to stress two-syllable verbs which end 
				in -<em>ate</em> on the second syllable but the first is often 
				stressed in AmE.&nbsp; These include:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>collate, cremate, curate, dictate, 
				donate, frustrate, gyrate, locate, migrate, mutate, narrate, 
				placate, pulsate, rotate, spectate, stagnate, translate, vacat</em></span>e 
				and <span class="style_black"><em>vibrate</em></span>.</li>
			</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Weak, absent or full vowel sounds</strong></dt>
				<dd>In general, AmE more frequently uses the full vowel sound on 
				unstressed syllables.&nbsp; Some examples are:<ol class="auto-style91">
				<li>Words ending with an unstressed -<em>ary, -ery, -ory,</em> 
				or <em>-mony</em> have endings in which the vowel is usually 
				weakened or elided altogether in BrE and given a fuller form in 
				AmE.<br />
				For example:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style55">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style165">Example</td>
						<td class="auto-style165">AmE</td>
						<td class="auto-style165">BrE</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style146"><em>military</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style146">/ˈmɪ.lə.ˌte.ri/</td>
						<td class="auto-style146">/ˈmɪ.lɪ.tri/</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style146"><em>monastery</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style146">/ˈmɑː.nə.ˌste.ri/</td>
						<td class="auto-style146">/ˈmɒ.nə.stri/</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style146"><em>testimony</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style146">/ˈtest.əˌmo.ʊ.ni/</td>
						<td class="auto-style146">/ˈtest.ɪ.mə.ni/</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
					</li>
					<li>Conversely, words ending in -<em>ile</em> usually retain 
					the full form of the vowel in BrE but a reduced or absent 
					form in AmE.&nbsp; For example, <em>fertile</em> is /ˈfɝː.təl/ 
					in AmE but /ˈfɜː.taɪl/ in BrE.<br />
					Another difference here is that the 'r' is given a 
					pronunciation lacking in BrE (that can be alternatively 
					transcribed as /ˈfɜːr.təl/ in AmE).<br />
					AmE tends to have a syllabic final consonant in some words 
					in this class so, for example, <em>fragile</em> may be 
					pronounced as /ˈfræ.dʒəl/ or /ˈfræ.dʒl̩/ in AmE but is more 
					likely to be /ˈfræ.dʒaɪl/ in BrE.</li>
				<li>An outlier is the pronunciation of <em>saint </em>before a 
				name.&nbsp; In AmE, this is usually the full form as /ˈseɪnt/ 
				but in BrE, it is reduced to /sənt/.</li>
			</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>/ɑː/ </strong> <em><strong>vs</strong></em><strong>. /æ/</strong></dt>
				<dd>In southern BrE, words such as <em>bath</em> are pronounced 
				with the /ɑː/ as, e.g., /bɑːθ/ (although that would be a short 
				vowel in the north of England and elsewhere).&nbsp; AmE usually 
				prefers /æ/ so we get for example:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style55">
