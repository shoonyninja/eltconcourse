				<dt><strong>the grammar<br />
				<img alt="grammar" height="98" src="../../images/dictionary_grammar150.jpg" width="150" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>If you are a native speaker of English, the very word <em>
				grammar</em> may strike fear into your heart.<br />
				In most English-speaking societies the study of the language and 
				its forms comes low on the list of priorities at school.&nbsp; 
				However, while you may not need to be able to state the rules of 
				grammar or describe how words in the language work in order 
				<strong>use</strong> it successfully, you need to be able to do both 
				of those things in order to <strong>teach</strong> it successfully.<br />
				There is, in fact, nothing particularly terrifying or 
				complicated about most English grammar (indeed, compared to many 
				languages, it is deceptively simple).</dd>
				<dt><strong>the terminology<br />
				<img alt="terminology" height="100" src="../../images/dictionary_abc150.jpg" width="150" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>Like every profession, English Language Teaching (ELT) has 
				its own vocabulary to describe teaching, learning and the forms 
				of English.&nbsp; Again, it's not a mysterious area and many of 
				the terms are transparent in meaning.&nbsp; You already know 
				terms like <em>past, present, future, conditional, linking, 
				pronunciation, progressive, task, communicative, drill, elicit, voice, aspect, continuous, 
				hypothetical </em>and so on.&nbsp; All you need to learn is how 
				the terms are used in ELT when we analyse things.<br />
				Sure, there are terms in the area you may not know (such as <em>
				collocation, modal auxiliary verb, auxiliary, preposition, tag question, 
				perfect aspect</em> and so on) but your knowledge of these will 
				grow as you investigate the areas you want to teach.&nbsp; It 
				won't come all at once and <em><strong>it doesn't have to</strong></em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>communication<br />
				<img alt="communication" height="98" src="../../images/feedback150.jpg" width="150" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>For most purposes, learners want to learn how to <strong>do</strong> 
				things in the language rather than be accurate in every respect 
				and walking, talking dictionaries.&nbsp; As a teacher, 
				therefore, you need to know about how language is used to 
				communicate.&nbsp; The area is to do with <em>function</em> (another 
				term you are already familiar with).</dd>
				<dt><strong>words<br />
				<img alt="words" height="102" src="../../images/label150.jpg" width="150" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>Without grammar, you can't say much in a language but without 
				words, you can't say anything at all.&nbsp; As a teacher, it is 
				part of your job to help your learners understand and use the 
				words they need to get what they want done in the language.&nbsp; 
				Nobody will ever acquire all the words of any language and a 
				learner will often struggle.&nbsp; This is where you come in.&nbsp; 
				Knowing how words work together will help you help them.</dd>
				<dt><strong>pronunciation<br />
				<img alt="pronunciation" height="98" src="../../images/talk_present_graphic150.jpg" width="150" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>There's not much point in being able to speak a language if 
				nobody can understand you.&nbsp; Equally, knowing how a language 
				is pronounced helps you to understand what you hear.&nbsp; Part of being 
				a teacher is to help in this respect and there are a few things 
				you need to know about how English is pronounced.</dd>

			<p>Procedural knowledge refers to the knowing what to do in a

			down.&nbsp; Before we do that, make a short list of some things you

				coherent lesson which isn't just a jumble of activities and 
				tests.&nbsp; There's no mystery here, either.&nbsp; It's mostly 
				a matter of common sense and the ability to put yourself in the 
				learners' shoes.</dd>
				<dt><strong>present<br />
				<img alt="present" height="99" src="../../images/present150.jpg" width="150" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>Clearly, if an area is new to your learners or you are 
				extending what they know, you need to have a few techniques to 
				hand to help you present information clearly in a way that 
				people can understand.</dd>
				<dt><strong>practise<br />
				<img alt="practice" height="99" src="../../images/music_practice_piano150.jpg" width="150" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>Knowing something about language isn't enough.&nbsp; Your 
				learners need to get real, solid practice in using the language 
				in situations which are as realistic as possible.&nbsp; This is 
				often the hard part but we'll come to some simple ideas soon.</dd>
				<dt><strong>manage the classroom<br />
				<img alt="manage" height="98" src="../../images/teaching_graphic150.jpg" width="150" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>teachers are also managers so you need to think a bit about 
				how you instruct, explain and group your learners.&nbsp; This is 
				not a mystery.&nbsp; Most of us have, at times, managed other 
				people.</dd>
				<dt><strong>deal with error<br />
				<img alt="error" height="99" src="../../images/error150.jpg" width="150" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>All learners make mistakes.&nbsp; The trick is to learn from 
				them.&nbsp; Helping learners to do that is very important.</dd>
				<dt><strong>move forward<br />
				<img alt="forward" height="98" src="../../images/go150.jpg" width="150" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>Teaching is a funny job because so often it's up to the 
				teacher to decide what to do next.&nbsp; Sure, you may have a 
				coursebook to help you and may work somewhere where there's a 
				clear syllabus (by no means invariably the case) but much of the 
				planning long-term will be up to you.</dd>
				<dt><strong>use materials and teaching aids<br />
				<img alt="aids" height="99" src="../../images/teacher_fronted150.jpg" width="150" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>Fortunately, you don't have to invent everything yourself.&nbsp; 
				There are excellent published materials in text form and a 
				wealth of resources on the web (including on this site).&nbsp; 
				Your job is to select appropriate ones and use them 
				intelligently.&nbsp; That's not too hard.<br />
				It's also true that we have (mostly) moved on from a blackboard 
				and some chalk so, depending where you teach, there will be 
				other resources available: DVDs, CDs, Interactive Whiteboards, 
				data projectors, the web and so on.&nbsp; As always, the trick 
				is selecting well and using them purposefully.</dd>
