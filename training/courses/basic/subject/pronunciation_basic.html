			<h1>Pronunciation</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="pronounce" height="207" src="../../../images/pronunciation310.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Pronunciation is a rather technical area.&nbsp; What follows is 
			an attempt to map out the territory and give you some key concepts 
			and understanding &ndash; no more.<br />
			There is a link at the end to take you to some more comprehensive 
			guides.<br />
			The following assumes no knowledge of how to write the pronunciation 
			of words using a transcription system.&nbsp; However, learning such 
			a system is very valuable.&nbsp; Here is what is meant:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="chart" height="471" src="../../../imagesgraphics/phonemes620.png" width="620" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			It actually isn't too hard to learn the symbols and it pays dividends.</p>

					<td class="auto-style27">
					<h2>5 key concepts</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<ol>
				<li><strong>consonants</strong><br />
				As you can see from the chart, there are quite a lot of 
				consonants.&nbsp; They don't appear in alphabetic order above 
				and there's a good reason for that.&nbsp; There are two sorts: 
				<strong>voiced</strong> and <strong>unvoiced</strong>.&nbsp; Here's the test:<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>Try saying <strong>SSSSSSSSSS </strong>aloud now (go 
					on, nobody's listening but you).&nbsp; Try to make a single 
					continuous noise.</li>
					<li>Now say<strong> ZZZZZZZZZZ</strong> aloud, again as a 
					continuous noise.</li>
					<li>Now put the palm of your hand on your throat and say
					<strong>SSSSSSSSSSZZZZZZZZZZSSSSSSSSSSZZZZZZZZZZZ</strong></li>
				</ol>When you got to c., you should have been able to tell the 
				difference.&nbsp; A voiced consonant (such as the z-sound) is 
				made by vibrating your vocal cords (or folds, technically).&nbsp; 
				An unvoiced consonant (such as the s-sound) has no such 
				vibration.&nbsp; The sound is made by the air passing through 
				your mouth alone.<br />
			The importance is that many English consonants form voiced-unvoiced 
			pairs and it's important for learners to get the difference.&nbsp; 
			The word <em>bat</em> sounds different from <em>pat</em> simply 
			because the b-sound is voiced and the p-sound is unvoiced.&nbsp; The 
			other pairs are the red sounds in<br />
			<span class="style_red"><strong>t</strong></span>ot-<span class="style_red"><strong>d</strong></span>ot,
			<span class="style_red"><strong>c</strong></span>ard-<span class="style_red"><strong>g</strong></span>uard,
			<span class="style_red"><strong>f</strong></span>an-<span class="style_red"><strong>v</strong></span>an,
			<span class="style_red"><strong>j</strong></span>ump,
			<span class="style_red"><strong>ch</strong></span>ump,
			<span class="style_red"><strong>th</strong></span>ink-<span class="style_red"><strong>th</strong></span>is 
			and <span class="style_red"><strong>sh</strong></span>oo-<span class="style_red"><strong>z</strong></span>oo<br />
			All the other consonant sounds are as you see them in the chart.</li>
				<li><strong>vowels</strong><br />
				There are, traditionally, 5 vowel letters in English: a, e, i, o 
				and u.&nbsp; As you can see from the chart, however, there are 
				22 vowels in the language.&nbsp; To make matters worse, the 
				individual sounds are not reliably represented by the spelling.&nbsp; 
				The vowel sound in <em>blood</em>, for example, is the same as 
				the one in <em>cup</em>, despite the spelling difference.&nbsp; 
				This means that learners need to hear and say almost every word 
				they meet.<br />
				There are two letters which look like consonants but sometimes 
				act as vowels: w (as in <em>how) </em> and y (as in <em>try</em>).</li>
				<li><strong>stress</strong><br />
				Again, there are two types:<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>word stress refers to the part of the word where the 
					stress (or loudest section) falls.&nbsp; We say <strong>won</strong>derful, 
					not won<strong>der</strong>ful or wonder<strong>ful</strong>, 
					for example.</li>
					<li>sentence stress refers to which part or parts of a 
					sentence are stressed.&nbsp; We would usually say, <em>I 
					went to </em><strong><em>Lon</em></strong><em>don yesterday</em> 
					rather than <em>I <strong>went</strong> to London yesterday</em> 
					or <em>I went <strong>to</strong> London yesterday</em>.&nbsp; 
					Of course, we can stress a word whenever we like but we are 
					usually making some sort of point.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>intonation</strong><br />
				This refers to the 'music' of the language.&nbsp; Our voice 
				rises and falls in pitch in some remarkably predictable ways.&nbsp; 
				Try saying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You are going<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are going?<br />
				</em>In the second, your voice pitch will rise to show the 
				question.</li>
				<li><strong>weak forms</strong><br />
				We do not usually pronounce the small words which hold the 
				language together very completely.&nbsp; For example, we say <em>
				fish 'n' chips</em> or <em>a cuppa tea</em>.&nbsp; Neither of 
				these are in any way wrong, by the way, they are simply a 
				feature of the language which needs to be learned.<br />
				The most common weak form is the sound at the end of a word like
				<em>later</em>.&nbsp; It is a very short vowel and is the sound 
				of the <em>a</em> in<em> cuppa tea</em>.&nbsp; If you learn no other 
				transcription, learn to represent this sound as a /ə/<em>.&nbsp; for</em> 
			is pronounced /fə/, for example in rapid speech as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please come for tea<br />
				</em>but the word <em>four</em> is pronounced differently in, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have four shirts.</em></li>

			<p>As was said, this is a rather technical area and, unless you are 
			very keen, not one to trouble about too much at this stage.&nbsp; 
			You must, however, be prepared to correct and guide your learners' 
			pronunciation but it is possible to do that without focusing on any 
			of the terminology above &ndash; just on the effects.</p>
			<p>If you want more, try following
			<a href="../../../glossaries/glossary_ip_phonology.html" target="_blank">the guide 
			to some key terminology</a> in this area.&nbsp; It covers a bit more 
			than you have done here and will also give you some links to 
			more difficult guides.</p>
			<p>When you have time, you need to learn to 
			transcribe the sounds of English as phonemes.&nbsp; There is
			<a href="../../transcription1/transcription.html" target="_blank">a transcription 
			course</a> on this site to do just that.</p>
			<p>If you would like to hear the sounds of English pronounced,
			<a href="https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/phonemic-chart" target="_blank">the ideal place to go has been kindly provided by the British 
			Council</a>.</p>
