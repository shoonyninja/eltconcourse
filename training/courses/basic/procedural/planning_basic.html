				This is a presentation and practice lesson.</li>
				<li>Lessons which were intended to <strong>improve some kind of

				on with it and did it.<br />
				This is, rather obviously, a revision lesson.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So, the first question to answer when you sit down to plan a 
			lesson is: <em>What sort of lesson is it?</em><br />
			The answer will determine how it is structured.</p>

			<h3>Presentation lessons</h3>
			<p>These will need three stages at least.&nbsp; Here they are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>presenting</strong> the new language or skill</li>
				<li>carefully <strong>practising</strong> the language or skill in a situation 
				which avoids too much error.&nbsp; In other words, this stage 
				must be quite tightly <strong>controlled</strong></li>
				<li><strong>using</strong> the new language or skill more freely and in a way 
				which is personal and clearly relevant to the learners</li>
			</ol>
			<p><a name="2"></a>Now you need to download an example of a plan of this sort.&nbsp;
			<a href="../../../../teachers/materials/ELT_Concourse_like_hate_love_A1A2.pdf" target="_blank">
			Click here to do that</a>.&nbsp; The plan will open in an new tab 
			so you can have it on screen or print it out (or even use it!).</p>

			<ol id="list2" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">
				<li>Stage 1 (15 minutes) is the presentation phase.<br />
				Here the learners look at the pictures and try to identify the 
				name of the activity.&nbsp; If they can't, the teacher has to 
				provide it (or the learners could use their dictionaries / ask 
				each other etc.).<br />
				<strong>The teacher's job is to supply 
				and model language</strong>.&nbsp; That's what 
				presentation is all about.</li>
				<li>Stage 2 (15 minutes) is very tightly controlled practice.<br />
				All the learners have to do is change positive sentences to 
				negative ones and vice versa.&nbsp; They change, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
				like fishing<br />
				</em>to<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't like fishing<br />
				</em>or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like 
				shopping<br />
				</em>to<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate shopping / I don't like shopping</em>.<br />
				<strong>The aim is to get the learners to use the language 
				accurately</strong> so the task is simple.&nbsp; The teacher's role is to 
				monitor and spot problems, helping people to get it right.</li>
				<li>Stage 3 (15 minutes) is freer practice and gets the students 
				moving around (often A Very Good Thing).<br />
				The language is, again, personalised for the 
				students.&nbsp; They have to ask and answer questions in a way 
				which is <strong>true for them</strong>.&nbsp; Making language 
				personal makes it memorable.</li>
				<li>Stage 4 (15 minutes) is revision and a bit of fun.&nbsp; If 
				the lesson has overrun (it is planned for 60 minutes but could 
				take longer and probably would with a large class) then this 
				stage can be left until later and form the basis of a revision 
				lesson.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is an example of what is called a PPP lesson: Present &rarr; 
			Practise &rarr; Produce.&nbsp; It is probably the most commonly 
			used plan in the profession.<br />
			The lesson staging can be used for many different purposes.&nbsp; 
			For example, it could easily be adapted to present and practise 
			things you are allowed to do (<em>I can ...</em>) and things that 
			are forbidden (<em>We can't ... / mustn't ...</em>).&nbsp; All 
			that's needed is some different pictures and a change to the 
			worksheet.</p>

			<ol id="list3" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" class="style_brown"  >
				<li>Stage 1 presents the target of the lesson by getting the 
				learners to look at a model text and analyse it.<br />
				If this were a speaking lesson, this might be done through the 
				learners reading / watching / listening to a model dialogue or some 
				other form of speaking.</li>
				<li>Stage 2 focuses on the language the learners will need to 
				complete the task.<br />
				This is an important stage because it is very frustrating to be 
				asked to complete a task for which you know you don't have the 
				resources.</li>
				<li>Stage 3 gets the learners to cooperate in brainstorming what 
				they are going to write.<br />
				This, too, is an important stage because it allows the learners 
				a bit of time and space to get their ideas together.&nbsp; We 
				all perform better with a bit of preparation.</li>
				<li>Stages 4 and 5 could be left to a later lesson.<br />
				This is the productive stage and again asks the learners to 
				cooperate to produce a result.&nbsp; Note that the result is 
				valued by, in this case, a poster presentation for everyone to 
				read.&nbsp; It could be done orally but this is a writing lesson 
				so it's logical to pair it with reading.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3><a name="4"></a>Revision lessons</h3>
			<table class="auto-style2">

					There's no example for this because, rather obviously, it

					<a href="#4" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'list4',0,'style.visibility','visible')">

				</tr>
			</table>
			<ol id="list4" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">
				<li>The personal likes and dislikes language could be recycled 
				in a number of ways, including:<ol class="auto-style2">
					<li>getting the learners to carry out a survey of another 
					group's likes and dislikes</li>
					<li>reading a text about someone's likes and dislikes and 
					reporting back</li>
					<li>writing a letter / email setting out one's likes and 
					dislikes</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The report-writing lesson target could be revised by also:<ol class="auto-style2">
					<li>getting the learners to tell you / each other how a 
					report is written</li>
					<li>getting the learners to write a report on something 
					different</li>
					<li>getting the learners to present an oral report to the 
					class with one topic for each group</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The important thing is that language and skills lessons <strong>
			need</strong> to be revised.</p>
			<p>There's no test in this area (there were enough already) but now 
			you can go and plan a lesson!</p>
			<p>There are some more examples of plans you can copy, use adapt or 
			analyse in <a href="../../../../teachers/teachers.html" target="_blank">
			the teachers' section of this site</a>.</p>
			<p>Now you can go on to the first stage: <a href="presenting_basic.html">
			presenting and explaining</a>.</p>
