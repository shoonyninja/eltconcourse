			<p>If you have followed the section on planning, you will know that 
			presenting a new piece of language or a new skill is a key part of 
			any teacher's job.&nbsp; This section is designed to give you a few 
			alternatives.</p>
			<h2>Don't lecture ...</h2>
			<p>In the picture above, the speaker is in the role of lecturer.&nbsp; 
			He will probably not engage too much with his audience; 
			interruptions, questions and requests for clarification will not be 
			welcome.&nbsp; <strong>This is <span class="style_underline">not</span> 
			your role.</strong></p>
			<h2>... lead and explain</h2>
			<p>Learners are not empty vessels waiting to be filled.&nbsp; They 
			are, usually, thinking, responding human beings who bring their own 
			experience and knowledge to the classroom.&nbsp; If you ignore this 
			simple fact you will make everyone's life seriously more difficult 
			and frustrating.</p>

					<h2>Explaining</h2>

			<p>Part of a presentation of something new is going to involve 
			explaining the skill of the language.&nbsp; You need to be careful 
			not to give in to the temptation to lecture and talk at people.&nbsp; 
			They will get bored and restless.</p>
			<p><span class="style_red"><strong>You can't explain what you don't 
			understand.</strong></span>&nbsp; Make sure you have looked at the 
			guides on this site concerning what you are going to present and/or check in a book.</p>
			<h3>elicit what is known</h3>
			<p>The first phase of most explanations is to elicit what is already 
			known.&nbsp; There are two reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It ensures that you aren't explaining something that the 
				learners already know.&nbsp; That is a very dull thing to do.</li>
				<li>It reminds the learners of what they already know and it is 
				easier to accommodate new information into what is already 
				known.<br />
				For example:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>You may want to explain the form of something like <em>I 
					am going to take the train tomorrow</em>.&nbsp; You could 
					set this out on the board like this:<br />
					<span class="style_black">Subject (<em>I, you, we, it, Mary, 
					the weather </em>etc.) + <em>be</em> (<em>am, is, are</em>) 
					+ <em>going to</em> + infinitive verb (<em>talk, rain, visit</em> 
					etc.) + object + adverb (<em>tomorrow, next, over the 
					weekend</em> etc.)</span></li>
					<li>That would work, especially if you talk it through as 
					you write rather than simply shove it on the board and let 
					the learners figure it all out.</li>
					<li>However, it is probably the case that your learners 
					already know how to form a clause like <em>I am writing</em> 
					and they already know what the subject and object of a verb 
					are because they can make a sentence like <em>I enjoy music</em>.&nbsp; 
					They probably also know quite a lot of time adverbials such 
					as <em>tomorrow, next week</em> etc.</li>
					<li>So, you can elicit what they know as you go along and 
					insert what they don't know (probably
					<span class="style_black"><em>going to </em>+ infinitive</span>) 
					so that the new information is accommodated, not learnt from 
					scratch.&nbsp; The phase might go:<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
						<li>Write the word <span class="style_black">Subject</span></li>
						<li>Ask: <em>What subjects can a verb have?</em>&nbsp; 
						Elicit pronouns, names and something inanimate like <em>
						weather</em>.</li>
						<li>Write the word <span class="style_black">be</span> 
						and elicit the three present tense forms (<em>am, is, 
						are</em>)</li>
						<li>Write <span class="style_black">+ going to + 
						infinitive</span> <span class="style_brown"><strong>in a 
						different colour</strong></span> and
						<span class="style_underline">underline it</span>.&nbsp; 
						It's the target of all this.</li>
						<li>Ask: <em>What's an infinitive?&nbsp; Can you give me 
						an example?</em>&nbsp; Elicit things like <em>see, get, 
						have, visit</em> etc.</li>
						<li>Ask: <em>What comes after the verb?</em>&nbsp; 
						Elicit the <span class="style_black">object</span>.&nbsp;
						<em>What sorts of objects can we use after take?</em>&nbsp; 
						Elicit words for things (<em>the money, the train, a 
						test</em> etc.) </li>
						<li>Write the word <span class="style_black"><em>
						tomorrow</em></span> and ask: <em>So am I talking 
						about the present the past or the future?&nbsp; What 
						other words can we use to talk about the future?</em>&nbsp; 
						Elicit, things like <em>next week, next Sunday, on 
						Thursday</em> etc.</li>
						<li>If need be, repeat all this with a different model 
						sentence, eliciting the five elements as you go along.&nbsp; 
						Use a learner as the subject &ndash; it's involving.</li>
						<li>At the end, this bit of the board would look a bit 
						like this:<br />
						<img alt="going to example" class="auto-style13" height="207" src="images/goingto.png" width="500" /></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>explaining time and tense</h3>
			<p>One way to present and explain tense would follow neatly from the 
			lesson beginning with an anecdote which we have seen is to use a 
			pictorial way to represent concepts.&nbsp; For example, here the 
			distinction is being made between <em>I watched</em> and <em>I was 
			watching</em>.<br />
			For example, to represent something like <em>He was standing in the 
			queue when the policeman pulled him out</em>, you could have a 
			picture like this:<em><br />
					<img alt="time line" height="93" src="../../../imagesgraphics/pasttimeline6a.png" width="400" /><br />
			</em>Note that it is clear that the action of standing stopped when 
			the policeman pulled him out.<br />
			To represent another concept of, e.g., <em>He was standing in the 
			queue when he saw me</em>, in which the standing action continues, 
			you could have a picture like this:<br />
					<img alt="time line" height="92" src="../../../imagesgraphics/pasttimeline5a.png" width="400" /><br />
			In both pictures it is clear when things happened.&nbsp; Hence the 
			labelling.<br />
			For much more on using time lines, see
			<a href="../../../initial/teaching/usingtimelines.html" target="_blank">
			the guide</a>.</p>
			<h3>explaining other concepts</h3>
			<p>Diagrams and pictures can be used for many other concepts which 
			are otherwise difficult to grasp.&nbsp; For example, the difference
			<em>can, may, can't</em> and <em>must not </em>can be presented
			<strong>and explained</strong> using signs like:<br />
			<img alt="No Overnight Parking Sign" height="196" src="images/no-overnight_parking_sign.jpg" width="130" /><img alt="Senior Citizens Parking Sign" height="196" src="images/senior-citizens-parking-sign.jpg" width="130" /><img alt="Motorcycle Parking Only Sign" height="196" src="images/motorcycle_parking.jpg" width="130" /><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Teaching is creative so you need to come up with clear and engaging 
			ways of presenting language.&nbsp; That's not as easy as telling 
			people things but it is much more effective and engaging.</p>
			<h3>explaining differences</h3>
			<p>A lot of language is concerned with different strengths of 
			expression.&nbsp; For example, </p>
			<ol class="auto-style10">
				<li>the difference between<em> frequently, often, usually, 
				sometimes, never, rarely, seldom</em> etc.</li>
				<li>the difference in certainty between <em>I will come, I may 
				come, I might come</em> and <em>I will definitely come</em></li>
				<li>the difference between <em>big, large, wide, huge, enormous</em> 
				and <em>tiny</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>can all be explained using visuals.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			
			
				<img alt="A" height="232" src="images/adverbsfrequency.png" width="500" class="auto-style13" /><br />
&nbsp;<p><img alt="B" class="auto-style13" height="202" src="images/certainty.png" width="500" /></p>
			<p>You can get the learners to come and stick the words on the board 
			in either of the above ideas.&nbsp; That's also engaging.</p>
			<p>Put these sentences with the right pictures:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style12">
				<tr>
					<td style="width: 212px">
					<ol>
						<li>It's tiny but not minute.</li>
						<li>It's big but not enormous.</li>
						<li>It's big and wide.</li>
						<li>It's huge.</li>
					</ol>
					</td>
					<td>
					<ol>
						<li value="5">It's really big.</li>
						<li>It's very small.</li>
						<li>It's comparatively small.</li>
						<li>It's large but not huge.</li>
					</ol>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style11">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="Mouse" height="120" src="images/mouse.jpg" width="219" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="Elephant" height="120" src="images/elephant.jpg" width="180" /></td>

					<td class="auto-style27">
					<h2>Checking understanding</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Don't assume that when you have explained something, it's been 
			learned.<br />
			For ways of checking whether something is understood, try concept-checking questions (CCQs in the trade).<br />
		Two examples:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You have just taught the meaning of the verb in <em>They 
			<strong>unearthed</strong> a whole new temple.<br />
			</em>Some possible CCQs:<ol >
				<li><em>Did they dig the temple up or bury it?</em></li>
				<li><em>Does this verb take an object?&nbsp; Always?</em></li>
				<li><em>What else can you unearth, for example?</em></li>
				<li><em>What's the opposite of unearth?</em></li>
				<li><em>Can you unearth an idea?&nbsp; A fish?&nbsp; A secret?&nbsp; 
				A reason?</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>You have just introduced <em>going to</em> in a dialogue about 
			someone's plans for the evening.<br />
			Some possible CCQs:<ol >
				<li><em>How sure is he that he is going to the restaurant on the 
				corner?</em></li>
				<li><em>When did he make the decision to go?</em></li>
				<li><em>Has he just decided to go or did he decide yesterday when he 
				was invited?</em></li>
				<li><em>When did Mary invite him?&nbsp; Did he say Yes or No?&nbsp; 
				When did he say Yes?</em></li>
				<li><em>Why did he agree to meet at the restaurant?</em></li>
			</ol>
