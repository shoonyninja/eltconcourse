			<h1>Unit 6: Observing 
					and assessing</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="eye" height="207" src="../../images/eye_multicoloured_a310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>On most courses, the observation and assessment of teaching lies 
			at the heart.<br />
			If that is not true for your course right now but you have designs 
			on training more widely on courses leading to recognised 
			qualifications, the art (not science) of observing, assessing and 
			supporting teaching behaviour is the most important skill you can 
			acquire.<br />
			It's also the hardest.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td>
					<img alt="2" height="166" src="../../images/two_flowers250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Two purposes, two audiences</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are two fundamental forms of assessment and they are 
			distinguished by their purposes and their audience.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="1" height="68" src="../../../gfx/1grey.gif" width="100" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Type 1: support and enhancement</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is characterised by what happens in a lot of good teaching 
			institutions.<br />
			Someone, probably a trainer like you or an academic manager who is 
			also a teacher trainer, arranges in-house observations for all 
			teachers on a regular basis.<br />
			There is not supposed to be any assessment component to these 
			observations and the observer's sole function is to act as an impartial 
			viewer 
			seeing what is going on in the classrooms and, sometimes, maintaining standards.<br />
			A secondary function for less experienced members of staff is also a 
			training exercise to suggest ways to improve and develop techniques 
			and procedures.<br />
			In some organisations, where the majority or a sizeable proportion 
			of the teaching team is inexperienced, these sorts of observations 
			may become solely training exercises and then they tend towards Type 2 
			observations.<br />
			In
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u3_training_to_train_types.html">
			Unit 3</a>, some consideration is given to the differences between 
			in-house programmes for experienced teachers and those designed for 
			less experienced or newly qualified teachers.<br />
			In terms of the audience for any feedback, what may also happen is that the reports on these observations may 
			find their way into the management's in tray and be appended to a 
			staff record.&nbsp; Then it's assessment, not support.<br />
			In all cases there may well be a set of criteria or a definition of 
			the areas of teaching behaviour that form the structure of any 
			comments, reports or feedback sessions but that is not always the 
			case and the agenda may vary according to what the teacher being 
			observed is interested in investigating.<br />
			There is much more later in this unit on what structure(s) reports 
			may take.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Type 2: assessment and evaluation</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>On formal teacher training courses which lead to recognised 
			qualifications, observation is almost always assessment first and 
			support second.<br />
			Observations like these are carried out by trainers who have 
			themselves been trained in observation and the teaching is assessed 
			for all participants against a standard, unvarying set of criteria.<br />
			Ideally, the observer-assessor does not deviate from the criteria 
			and secretly invent new ones but that has been known.<br />
			The support element of observation and feedback on such courses is 
			often confined to advice and training concerning how better to meet 
			the criteria in future.<br />
			Even on courses which contain teaching practice of some kind but are 
			not externally certificated, a similar process of criterion 
			referencing is often in place.&nbsp; In these cases, however, it is 
			possible to reverse the ordering and put support before assessment 
			although there will almost always be a large element of the latter.<br />
			On recognised courses, the criteria against which assessment is made 
			are available to both the assessor-observer and the 
			candidate-participant but on other courses this may not be the case 
			and the criteria against which one is being assessed are not 
			transparent.&nbsp; Such unfairness is thankfully rare.<br />
			The audience for the assessment records is threefold: the course 
			participant, the institution and the training team and any 
			externally accrediting body.</p>
			<p>These differences are not digital in an either-this-or-that way 
			because the forms of training that are possible live on a cline from 
			solely assessment to solely support and help.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="cline" height="195" src="t-to-t_images/training_cline.jpg" width="465" /></p>
			<p>It does not take a great deal of imagination to see how easy it 
			is for support to slide imperceptibly into assessment and for 
			assessment to contain a large element of support but the distinction 
			is still a valid starting point.<br />
			Your simple first task is to decide what sort of observations you 
			will carry out next (i.e., where are you on the cline).&nbsp; That's somewhere to start and gets some 
			of the wood out of the way of the trees in what is a complex and 
			challenging area.</p>

					<h2>Criteria for observation</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Whatever your role and the mix of support and assessment at which 
			you are aiming, you need to be more than a casual observer, you need 
			to be an active, if unmoving and silent, participant.<br />
			This means you need a set of criteria of some kind which divides 
			teaching behaviour into appropriate categories and allows you to 
			make notes and structure the observation itself and the feedback you 
			give, both written and spoken.<br />
			There are probably as many sets of criteria as there are people 
			observing teaching and you may need to develop your own.<br />
			A good starting place is the lists of criteria developed by external 
			accrediting bodies in the field of teacher training and education.&nbsp;

			<p>It may not be within your brief to support, assess or give 
			feedback on planning at all.&nbsp; You may also feel that asking 
			people on an in-house support programme to produce lengthy and 
			detailed plans is not going to help them engage with and be 
			motivated by the programme itself.&nbsp; Those are judgements only 
			you can make but there are provisos:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style31">
				<li>Some insight into the teacher's thought processes in terms 
				of what was planned is a useful way of helping people identify 
				and articulate the aims they set out to achieve and the 
				objectives they had in mind.&nbsp; You may feel that these data 
				will become clear as the lesson progresses and the feeling may 
				be justified.&nbsp; It is, however, not always the case.&nbsp; 
				If something goes well, is it down to good planning, good 
				management or both?&nbsp; If something goes badly, is it the 
				result of poor planning, poor management or both?<br />
				It is not always a simple and obvious matter.</li>
				<li>Many teachers hardly plan at all and it is helpful 
				occasionally to force their hands so that they recall what it is 
				that they are trying to do and are reminded that a good teacher 
				can teach well with or without a good plan but a poor or 
				inexperienced teacher can't.&nbsp; In both cases, poor or no planning 
				usually results in poor and incoherent lessons.</li>
				<li>Planning sessions on any teacher training courses are ideal 
				opportunities for a bit of collaborative work and mutual support 
				and feedback from peers.&nbsp; If you have taken the trouble to 
				design planning sessions into your course, it seems perverse not 
				to ask people to apply the skills they have won.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you are training on a course leading to an accredited 
			qualification, there will usually be a set of criteria to apply to 
			planning documents and there may be a pro-forma lesson plan for 
			people to complete.<br />
			There is plenty of guidance, advice and exemplification in the 
			sections on the site concerned with preparing for CELTA and Delta 
			(links on the left).&nbsp; There is also a pair of short guides to 
			lesson planning for inexperienced teachers which you can open in a 
			new tab from
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="../../initial/teaching/planning.html" target="_blank">
			here</a>.<br />
			On an in-house or less formal course, a simpler form is often 
			appropriate and if you would like an example, one is available from
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="worksheets/ELT_Concourse_Training_to_Train_Lesson_plan_proforma.pdf" target="_blank">
			this link</a>.</p>
			<p>If you do decide to include the quality of planning in your 
			observation programme and feedback routines, and have asked for a 
			more detailed lesson plan to assess, here's a short 
			checklist:</p>
			<ul class="greenroundbullet">
				<li>What (if any!) characteristics of the learners has the 
				teacher borne in mind?</li>
				<li>Do all the stages target some of the aims and objectives?</li>
				<li>Are the stages coherent with a rising level of challenge 
				(see
				<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u4_training_to_train_running_sessions.html" target="_blank">
				Unit 4</a> for some consideration of cognitive load)?</li>
				<li>What materials have been chosen?</li>
				<li>What interaction patterns have been planned?</li>
				<li>What's the teacher's role at various stages?</li>
				<li>What are the learners going to achieve?</li>
				<li>How will learning be checked and made clear?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Input into the planning process can take a variety of forms but 
			essentially it can be:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Part of a plenary input session in which the purposes and 
				form of planning are made clear before people collaborate on 
				designing lessons or parts of lessons.</li>
				<li>A small-group or one-to-one seminar / tutorial in which 
				individuals talk through the plan and explain its rationale and 
				structure.&nbsp; (See 
				<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u5_training_to_train_tutorials.html">Unit 5</a> for some consideration of tutorial 
				structures.)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Planning is the stage at which teachers can (or should) match the 
			procedures and techniques they are using to the underlying 
			principles and hypotheses from which they work.<br />
			A useful question to ask all teachers at this stage is:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which major 
			theories of learning and language and which interesting hypotheses 
			have informed this plan?</em></span><br />
			If the answer is:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Err, um, err</em></span><br />
			or a blank look, you may need do some training.</p>

			<p>Some teachers simply do not like to be observed but others

			It is worth reminding the first and last groups that you as a 
			trainer are being observed by other teachers all the time (well, at

			Here's a brief run-down of some of the most important ideas.</p>

		<h3>Using charts</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
		There are lots of ways to use charts when observing teaching.&nbsp; 
		Charts allow a quick way to record data, can be very informative and can 
		later be used to compare the different ways different teachers deal with things like 
		apportioning time, gaining and maintaining attention and groupings.&nbsp; 
		Charts are, however, rarely useful if you are attempting to assess 
		effectiveness and for that undertaking, you need a form and a useful and 
		applicable set of criteria to work from.&nbsp; There is a bit more below 
		under using forms.</p>
			<p>
			For example:<br />
		If you want to measure the amount of teacher <em>vs</em>. learner talk and map it 
		against your estimation of energy levels in the classroom, you could use 
		something like this:<br />
		Start with a blank chart and three coloured 
		pens to play with while the lesson progresses.&nbsp; You can also use a set of blank circles and make pie charts if that's 
		easier.&nbsp; Clearly, you can vary the parameters to suit what the 
		teacher or you want(s) 
		to be the focus.</p>
			<img alt="chart" height="215" src="../../imagesgraphics/observation_bar_chart.png" width="465" /><p>Then, 
			in feedback, you and the teacher can compare what you both perceived to 
			be happening with what you recorded and spot and discuss the differences.</p>
		<p>A reasonably simple alternative type of chart is something like this 
		which is intended to focus on error correction and instruction checking 
		but could be used for all sorts of other purposes such as concept 
		checking, nomination of learners and so on.&nbsp; You place a bar on the line where you believe it should go and then, later, 
		discuss the findings with the teacher.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="task" height="303" src="../../imagesgraphics/observation_areas_task.png" width="465" /></p>
		<p>
		For time apportioning, an effective chart type is the pie chart which 
		may look something like this:</p>
		<img alt="pie" height="197" src="../../imagesgraphics/observation_time_pie_chart.png" width="465" /><br />
		Again, a comparison with the teacher's planned timing can be informative especially if you find wide 
		variations.<br />
		<br />
		Interaction&nbsp;patterns are also candidates for graphical 
		representation.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		<img alt="interaction" height="270" src="../../imagesgraphics/observation_interaction_chart_cutdown.jpg" width="465" /><p>This sort of chart quickly shows how equitably attention is shared 
		and who are the most forthcoming learners etc.&nbsp; It will soon become 
		messy if you try it for the whole lesson so is best reserved for plenary 
		sections of the lesson or for short snatches only.</p>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

		<h3>Using forms</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Charts and so on are mostly for information.&nbsp; Their use is a 
		data-gathering process not assessment of any kind.<br />
		At other times, you will be in some kind of assessment mode.</p>
			<p>A generalised, institution-wide form is often what is used and 
			the categories will probably be drawn from an externally overseen teacher 
			training programme.&nbsp; There are examples linked from the table 
			above of the sorts of categories and criteria you can select from if 
			your choices are not constrained by an examining body.<br />
			Whatever you use should be open and transparent.&nbsp; There should be no hint that the form the teacher 
			sees is different from what you actually use.<br />
			If you are concerned to target the observations more narrowly, you 
			can invent forms which are more 
			focused.<br />
		Here are some examples.&nbsp; The focus will reflect your and your 
			course's current concerns:</p>

			<p>It has often been noted that is <em>possible</em> that a 
			hurricane blowing through a scrapyard will assemble a working 
			airliner from parts picked up a flung randomly around in its path.&nbsp; 
			That is, however, an unlikely outcome because there are nearly 
			infinitely more ways that the parts can be assembled which do not 
			form an airliner than the one that does.<br />
			In other words, there are more ways to be wrong than right <strong>
			in principle</strong>.</p>
			<p>Novice (and not so novice) teachers continually seek out 
			novel and interesting ways to do things the wrong way simply because 
			there are more ways of doing something wrong than right.&nbsp; However, 
			there is more than one way to be effective, even if what is done 
			runs counter to our own prejudices or preferred understanding of 
			good practice.<br />
			Teacher trainers are not tasked with telling people what the 
			right way is to do something but to open up possibilities and give 
			people options.&nbsp;
			There should be no presumption of a monopoly of 
			knowledge concerning how things should rather than can be done.&nbsp; There is 
			very little solid evidence to support quite a lot of received 
			wisdom in the field and we should acknowledge that.&nbsp; This includes, 
			for example, the efficacy of drilling, delayed correction, inductive 
			learning and much else.<br />
			We need, accordingly, to leave most of our preconceptions at the 
			classroom door and try to judge whether what is happening is 
			achieving its ends.<br />
			Whether the ends are worth achieving is another matter to do with 
			planning (see above).</p>
			<p>We can address matters of practice at different levels and in

				<dd>Novice or very inexperienced teachers need clear guidance rather than 
			being told somewhat vaguely what they <em>could</em> (=<em>should</em>?) have done but 
			that should not be at the expense of making assertions concerning 
			the efficacy of one approach over another.<br />
				Setting out advice and 
			feedback in the form of imperatives – do this, do not do that – 
			reinforces the air of omniscience.<br />
				There are times when it is fully 
			appropriate to tell novice teachers not to do something (e.g., give 
			instructions vaguely and after the task has been distributed) but 
			there are other times when advice needs to be far less dogmatically 
			expressed.<br />
				Teachers at this level of experience know (or should know) that 
				they have much to learn and do not find advice particularly 
				threatening, especially at pre-service level, simply because 
				they know and you know that they are not <strong>supposed</strong> to know how to 
				do things.<br />
				If inexperienced teachers are persuaded that doing 
			something in one way, which may not be appropriate for their aims 
			and setting, is invariably wrong, they may lose 
			the opportunity to deploy a procedure in other settings where it is 
			appropriate.<br />
				For these sorts of teacher:<ul class="greenroundbullet">
					<li>you need to be something of a generalist because neither 
					you nor they know now what they are best at and where they 
					need advice.</li>
					<li>you need to look at their classroom tactics and gently 
					suggest alternatives to any they are using which you think 
					should either be done better another way or are 
					inappropriate to the setting.</li>
					<li>you need particularly to look for things like 
					thoroughness in practice and presentation because typically 
					teachers like this burn through materials too quickly and 
					don't properly exploit what they have.</li>
					<li>you need to limit your ambitions.&nbsp; Most teachers at is 
					level can take on board and act on a maximum of three ideas 
					and bits of advice per observation.&nbsp; Do not give them long 
					lists because that will de-focus, confuse and depress them.</li>
					<li>you need, in feedback, to be absolutely clear and not 
					hedge with too many comments on what could have been done.&nbsp; 
					If you mean<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A better way to do this is ...</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what you should have done</em>:<br />
					then say so.</li>
					<li>teachers like this will often welcome positive, 
					constructive feedback and are confused by the presentation 
					of too many alternatives.</li>
					<li>you need to consider carefully what they are capable of 
					doing.&nbsp; You are, no doubt, able to carry out complex and 
					sophisticated classroom procedures using multiple media 
					inputs but, before you suggest they do so, ask yourself 
					whether they have the experience and aplomb to carry it off 
					successfully.</li>

				<dd>These are usually teachers with some experience post-initial

				classroom efficiently and automatically.&nbsp; They don't need, 
				for example, to think about how to elicit, how to drill and how 
				to set up activities.&nbsp; They may need focus and some advice 
				concerning what they need to learn before they go on to further 
				training at diploma level or above.<ul class="greenroundbullet">
					<li>before any observation, discuss with them where they 
					feel their weaknesses are in the classroom and then set up 
					an observation that focuses on what they need to improve.&nbsp; 
					Most teachers in this category can identify a range of 
					issues.&nbsp; If they can't, nudge them.</li>
					<li>focus on the data you have gathered and discuss them 
					together, seeking a way forward to improvement.</li>
					<li>set up more than one observation if time permits, 
					focused on the same area to note any changes in behaviour.&nbsp; 
					This way, your observations become part of a development 
					programme.</li>

				<dd>Experienced teachers will often be working towards a 
				recognised advanced qualification such as Delta or the Trinity 
				Dip. TESOL.&nbsp; They may even be going on to master's degree 
				level so need handling with a bit of care.<br />
				Many are serene and comfortable in what 
				they do and may resent assessment or advice from you.<br />
				Teacher training at this level may involve some 
				deconstruction of the teacher's current behaviours before 
				reconstruction can begin and that is a threatening prospect and 
				process for many.&nbsp; This is especially the case with people 
				who have become accustomed to using force of personality rather 
				than technique to manage interactions in the classroom.<br />
				People vary and some 
				will be very open to feedback on their performance (especially 
				if it is not all negative).<br />
				In many cases, it is appropriate to focus your observation on something the teacher 
				wants to find out and needs an observer, who is not otherwise 
				employed in the classroom, to be a data gatherer.<ol class="greenroundbullet">
					<li>look for excellence.&nbsp; Many teachers in this 
					category have become specialists at some forms of classroom 
					behaviour.&nbsp; It may be anything from crisp instruction 
					giving to the use of poetry.&nbsp; Whatever it is, try to 
					identify it.</li>
					<li>be alert for negative habits that the teacher may be 
					unaware of.&nbsp; After a few years of doing something that 
					seems to 'work' (however that nebulous concept is defined), 
					some classroom habits can become ingrained.&nbsp; Look for 
					these and mention them, interspersed with positive comments 
					in your feedback.&nbsp; Secretly, the teacher may well be 
					grateful that you have pointed out that they consistently 
					overpraise, talk facing the board or use <em>OK, um</em> as 
					a filler.</li>
					<li>feedback will be much more even in this case.&nbsp; The 
					teacher will know where the high and low points of the 
					lesson were so you are in listening mode.&nbsp; You want the 
					teacher to reflect.</li>
					<li>if your observation was part of an in-house development 
					programme, this may be an opportunity to ask whether the 
					teacher may be prepared to lead a short workshop for the 
					whole teaching team on something they clearly do well.&nbsp; Even if the idea is 
					rejected, the teacher will be covertly pleased that you 
					asked.</li>

			<p>The rationale for all observations is to give sound, 
			constructive and timely advice.&nbsp; Obviously, some observations will amount to an assessment of a teacher’s competence

				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Sound in this context should be taken to mean usable.&nbsp; There is 
			little point in suggesting a procedure, approach or technique which 
			is beyond the teacher’s ability to implement.<br />
			For example, while 
			we may believe that a higher-level class might benefit from some 
			explicit understanding of the differences between deontic and 
			epistemic modality, telling a teacher on a 
			CELTA-level course (or even one, alas, who finished such a course 
			months ago) to provide that sort of teaching is not going to 
			produce any instant improvement.&nbsp; However, suggesting to the same 
			teacher that a lesson is better planned by considering concepts of 
			obligation and likelihood separately (which amounts to much the same 
			thing) would be helpful and, much more importantly, doable.<br />
			The same consideration applies to techniques, of course.&nbsp; What 
			you need to look for are, say, three things that this 
			teacher can do now to make the experience for the learners more 
			interesting and more productive.&nbsp; Three ideas to take away from an 
			observation is the maximum most teachers can handle.</p>
			<p>If possible, these three ideas should be in separate areas.&nbsp; A short 
			and non-exhaustive list would be one idea in three of these areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Presenting</li>
				<li>Correcting / Handling error</li>
				<li>Classroom management</li>
				<li>Monitoring</li>
				<li>Giving feedback</li>
				<li>Getting Feedback</li>
				<li>Summing up and getting students to focus on what they have learned</li>
				<li>Aims</li>
				<li>Appropriacy of language / skills work</li>
				<li>Level of challenge (usually too low)</li>
				<li>Instructional language</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other categories and areas will be appropriate, of course, providing 
			they are priorities and not peripheral to the teacher’s behaviour.</p>

			<p>On most courses this will be both oral and written because:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Oral feedback gives people the opportunity to ask questions, 
				seek clarification, argue, justify and respond but is also 
				ephemeral and often quickly forgotten.</li>
				<li>Written feedback provides the opportunity to read, re-read 
				and highlight essentials.&nbsp; It also makes the process more 
				serious and more formal as well as valuing it (because writing 
				is time consuming and needs to be done with some care).&nbsp; It 
				is also one-sided and uncommunicative</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Get the best of both.</p>
			<p>We considered the three main categories of teacher above and 
			we also looked at the cline from fully assessment-based observation 
			to fully support-based observation.<br />
			How the 
			feedback meeting is handled will depend a good deal on the where the 
			teacher is and what the observation was intended to do.<br />
			Feedback on in-house programmes may be less formal and agenda driven 
			but a record of sorts should nevertheless be kept for future 
			reference.</p>
			<h4>Constructive advice</h4>
			<p>This term should not be confused with positive. Constructive 
			advice can be advice to avoid something or advice to do something. 
			What it is not, of course, is merely critical.<br />
			How advice is given needs careful handling if it is to be 
			constructive.</p>

					part of their time (i.e., they are on a break or it’s after 
					teaching hours), make very sure the teacher knows you know 
					this and appreciate it.</li>
					<li>Ask for the teacher’s view of the good and less good 
					areas of the lesson.&nbsp; Nudge them into identifying the 
					stages, if they can’t think of much and then lead them 
					through the sections of the lesson.&nbsp; Let them do the 
					talking.&nbsp; It’s not your turn yet.&nbsp; Probe a little 
					here to encourage self-appraisal (it’s a key teaching skill) 
					with questions like<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you say that?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much did it 
					matter?<br />
					</em>and so on.</li>
					<li>Now it’s your turn.<ol class="greenroundbullet">
						<li>Start with the positives (there are always some) but 
						avoid the use of ‘nice’, ‘lovely’ etc. because these are 
						meaningless terms.&nbsp; Prefer words like ‘helpful’, 
						‘engaging’, ‘motivating’ etc. because those are what you 
						probably mean.</li>
						<li>Now focus on your three main points – the ones you 
						want them to work on – explaining why they are important 
						and what they should (not <em>could</em>) have done.&nbsp; Make 
						this very constructive and allow them any number of <em>
						Yes, but … </em>interruptions.</li>
						<li>Sum up the three issues and make sure the teacher 
						can do the same – you are concept checking, in fact.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Broaden things out.&nbsp; Ask about the teacher’s 
					progress in general on the course vis-&agrave;-vis teaching in 
					particular.&nbsp; Get them to say if anything 
					is concerning them:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you getting enough support?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					Are you generally happy with the course?</em><br />
					etc.&nbsp; Make it clear the 
					views are valued.</li>
					<li>Draw the meeting to a close by shutting your laptop / 
					putting away papers etc.&nbsp; Make it clear that written 
					feedback will follow (if you don’t have it right now).&nbsp; 
					Thank the trainee again for the tolerance and time.</li>

					<h2>Feedback on reading and research</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Some of the feedback you give on written work will, naturally, 
			also apply to the research and reading the participant undertook to 
			construct the submitted text.<br />
			At other times, however, you may set some reading and research as a 
			pre-seminar / tutorial task and get the members of the group to 
			report back to the others concerning what they have read and 
			researched and how they have understood any implications.<br />
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u5_training_to_train_tutorials.html">
			Unit 5</a> of this course covers the issues with tutorials and 
			seminars in some depth so here we will confine ourselves to those 
			which address course content.<br />
			Feedback to this kind of task is likely to be oral and come not only 
			from you but also be encouraged from the participant's peers at the 
			meeting.<br />
			After you have set up the seminar, made sure everyone knows what 
			it's about and what the outcomes should be, a conventional way to 
			proceed is:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Ask each person in turn to give their presentation.&nbsp; If 
				time is limited, make that clear.</li>
				<li>At the end of each presentation, invite other members of the 
				group to:<ul class="brownroundbullet">
					<li>ask for any clarification they need</li>
					<li>make any points they think are relevant</li>
					<li>present any alternatives they can think of</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Now it's your turn.&nbsp; While participants are giving 
				their presentations, you should be listening for any gaps in 
				their knowledge or any misunderstandings that seem to have been 
				exposed.&nbsp; What you need to do is alert people to the times 
				when they may have read too little or not thought too hard about 
				what they have read and also to draw in other members of the 
				group.&nbsp; Now you can ask some questions such 
				as:<ol class="brownroundbullet">
					<li>You said at the beginning that Widdowson suggests that 
					formal language knowledge is part and parcel of 
					communicative skill.&nbsp; Do you accept that he's correct?&nbsp; 
					Does this mean he is suggesting we teach language systems 
					before any communicative activity?&nbsp; What happens to a 
					Test-Teach-Test structure if we do that?&nbsp; Does this sit 
					well with Task-based Learning approaches?</li>
					<li>You have discovered most of the main uses of the present 
					perfect continuous but haven't mentioned iterative aspects.&nbsp; 
					Can you suggest how the form is used for those?&nbsp; Can 
					anyone else explain what is meant by <em>iterative</em>?</li>
					<li>You stated that English doesn't have a future tense.&nbsp; 
					Most learners think the <em>will</em> form serves that 
					function.&nbsp; Doesn't it?</li>
					<li>You suggested, rightly, I think, that how we read is 
					mostly determined by our purposes for reading.&nbsp; What 
					role does the text type play?</li>
					<li>I think you have the main characteristics of theories of 
					active grammar construction and imitation theory right.&nbsp; 
					What aspects of research have you found which offer an 
					alternative view to how people process language?<br />
					What do the others think?</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and so on.<br />
			This is also an opportunity to use turn taking appropriately and the 
			most useful form of getting someone else's comments and thoughts is 
			to constrain the topic and select the person whom you want to 
			respond (and there's
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u5_training_to_train_tutorials.html#turn">
			more on this in Unit 5</a>).</p>
			<p>You are teaching here but using a Socratic 
			method in part by trying to lead people to a fuller understanding of 
			the topic through a question &rarr; response &rarr; objection &rarr; refined response &rarr; question 
			&rarr; response &rarr; objection process.&nbsp; For more on the Socratic method and an 
			example, see 
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u4_training_to_train_running_sessions.html#socratic">that part of Unit 4</a>.</p>

					<h2>Self-evaluation</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is actually not so much self-evaluation as self-training.<br />
			Before you begin to train in earnest, arrange a couple of dry runs 
			to see how you can apply some of the methods above.<br />
			If people are unwilling to let you experiment with their teaching 
			and their classes, record a language lesson of your own or get hold 
			of a recording of someone you don't know.<br />
			It is slightly bemusing that many people have seen fit to post 
			examples of their teaching on the web and they are readily 
			accessible via platforms such as YouTube (but rarely models of masterly practice).&nbsp; 
			Some have been posted by professional organisations and, while not 
			flawless, are at least professionally conducted.<br />
			It is a resource worth exploiting because you can watch the lesson, 
			such as it is, and apply any number of assessment devices while you 
			do so.<br />
			Then visualise how you would give feedback.&nbsp; There's some 
			advice on visualisation in
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u4_training_to_train_running_sessions.html">
			Unit 4</a> of this course.</p>
			<p>When you've done that a couple of times, you'll be better 
			prepared to do it for real.<br />
			You will never get it all right from the beginning (or ever, for 
			most people) because this is a skill that comes with practice.</p>
			<p>Don't forget, too, to apply your own well-practised 
			self-evaluation skills after a feedback session and ask yourself how 
			it went, whether you felt that you managed to get the points across 
			and whether, crucially, you feel that the trainees in question 
			benefited.<br />
			You could, of course, always ask them that.</p>
