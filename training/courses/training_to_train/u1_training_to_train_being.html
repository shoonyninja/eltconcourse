			<p>
			<img alt="eye" height="207" src="../../images/eye_blue310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Welcome to the most difficult, the most rewarding and the most 
			responsible job in English Language Teaching.</p>
			<ul class="darkgreenbullet">
				<li>The most difficult because you have to know everything (or, 
				at least, a lot more than everyone else in the group put 
				together)</li>
				<li>The most rewarding because you can positively affect the 
				professional and personal lives of your trainees and colleagues.&nbsp; 
				You can also have the opposite effect.</li>
				<li>The most responsible because you are at the top of the 
				pyramid and every teacher you train will employ the skills you 
				provide in every class they teach.&nbsp; That's quite possibly 
				many thousands of learners and you are partially at least 
				responsible for the kind of teaching they get.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Still with us?<br />
			OK.</p>

			<p>What's the difference between a waiter, a chef and a restaurant 
			manager?<br />
			Click on: <a href="#task1">
			<img alt="eye" class="auto-style29" height="16" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'taskpara',0,'style.visibility','visible')" src="../../../gfx/eyeopen.gif" width="16" /></a> 
			when you have an answer.</p>
			<p id="taskpara" style="visibility: hidden">The first is responsible for making sure that the customers gets 
			what they ordered in a timely way with courteous and efficient 
			service.&nbsp; The waiter is also in face-to-face contact with the 
			customers and represents the establishment.&nbsp; Rude, discourteous 
			and inefficient service will mean that people don't come back, 
			however good the food is.<br />
			The chef, on the other hand, may never get to meet a customer, has 
			no need to be courteous but is responsible for the food the 
			customers get.&nbsp; If it's cold, bland or distasteful, they won't 
			come back.<br />
			The manager's job is to train the waiters and negotiate the menu 
			with the chef.&nbsp; She, too, may never actually meet a customer 
			but complaints land on the manager's desk.<br />
			We shan't stretch the analogy too far because it will break but 
			the relationship between teacher, academic manager and teacher 
			trainer is not wholly dissimilar.&nbsp; The most important 
			difference is that the teacher trainer is not in charge of anything 
			so has power without responsibility.<br />
			If people leave your training as better teachers, no learner will 
			thank you.&nbsp; If they are ignorant, inefficient and disorganised 
			teachers, no learner will blame you.</p>

			<p>The first stop is to figure out just what responsibilities 
			teacher trainers have on their shoulders and what skills they need 
			to fulfil them.&nbsp; To do that ...</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tablegreenborder" style="width: 465px">
				<tr>

			<p>You can see from that little exercise that you do not have to 
			learn a wholly new skills set but you do have to learn to do 
			some things that language teachers rarely or never do.<br />
			We won't dwell on some of the rows in the table because they are 
			obvious or no longer relevant to your role.<br />
			In particular, however:</p>
			<ul class="darkgreenbullet">
				<li><strong>Provide models</strong><br />
				<img alt="model" height="133" src="../../images/woman_model200.jpg" width="200" /><br />Language teachers do this all the time, sometimes explicitly, 
				usually just as a matter of course when using the target 
				language.<br />Trainers, too, sometimes have to provide models, not of language 
				but of techniques and procedures.&nbsp; This is especially true 
				of courses for inexperienced teachers or those on initial 
				training courses.&nbsp; Later on, it is unlikely that you will 
				be thanked for explicitly modelling something most trainees can 
				already do quite well.<br />Much is said about so-called loop input for teacher trainers 
				which according to Woodward (2003: 301) is<p class="quote"><em>
				<span class="style_blue">a 
				specific type of experiential teacher training process that 
				involves an alignment of the process and content of learning.</span><span class="style_black"><br />
				</span></em><span class="auto-style12">(Woodward, 2003:301)</span></p>
				The assumption, not without its critics, is that matching the 
				content to the process results in better learning.&nbsp; Here's 
				an example from Woodward's article:<p class="quote">A course module on, say, the Presentation, Practice, Production, 
				or 'Three Ps' method of introducing new language to foreign 
				language students could, if run along loop input lines, have 
				three main phases. The first is where the methods and materials 
				associated with the Three Ps are elicited or taught to 
				participants via texts or talks. The second is where the 
				participants have a chance to try out the methods and materials 
				in very controlled settings, such as micro- and peer-teaching 
				practice. The third would be where they are encouraged to 
				transfer them to situations which would be of use to them in 
				their own classrooms. Towards the end of the module, if 
				participants had not noticed already, the congruity between the 
				content and the process of the module would need to be pointed 
				out by discussion.<br /><span class="auto-style12">(op. cit.:304)</span></p>
				The part at the end about discussion is an important one.&nbsp; 
				Woodward calls this decompression time and avers that it allows 
				for a detailed and very useful consideration of what has been 
				encountered.<br />
				(We shall gloss over the fact that PPP is not a method, although 
				it derives from a methodology.)<br /></li>
				<li><strong>Lecture</strong><br />
				<img alt="lecture" height="133" src="../../images/teaching_lecturer200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Language teachers are often criticised if they lecture rather 
				than lead and it is true that just telling learners about the 
				language or skill rather than getting them to use it is rarely 
				effective.<br />
				However, you are not now, or will no longer be, a teacher.&nbsp; 
				You are a trainer and you will be expected to be able to deliver 
				engaging, concise, orderly lectures as part of your job.<br />
				This does not, of course, mean the freedom to drone on endlessly 
				reading out your notes but it does mean presenting data in a way 
				that people can understand, take notes on and be able to 
				assimilate into their internal databank.<br />
				Data can also be absorbed via discussion, reading, tasks, 
				workshops and in many other ways.<br />
				There is a mini-course in becoming a good lecturer in
				<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u4_training_to_train_running_sessions.html">
				Unit 4</a> of this course.</li>
				<li><strong>Discuss methodology</strong><br />
				<img alt="bridge" height="133" src="../../images/bridge_wooden200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Teachers rarely if ever indulge in discussions of methodology 
				with their learners.&nbsp; Trainers, on the other hand, may do 
				so very frequently.<br />
				Methodologies are ways of getting from here to where you want to 
				be and the word <em>discuss</em> in this section is deliberately 
				chosen.<br />
				Nobody, not even you, knows the right methodology and nobody can 
				be entirely confident that there is only one best way of getting 
				to the targets of teaching.<br />
				Leave your prejudices at the door of the training room and be 
				prepared to discuss the approaches.</li>
				<li><strong>Establish rapport</strong><br />
				<img alt="2" height="133" src="../../images/birds_two_gulls200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Language teachers establish rapport in a number of ways: by 
				being genuinely interested in their learners' lives, by treating 
				people with respect, by being even handed in the classroom and 
				more.<br />
				You can do all of those things, of course, or you wouldn't be 
				considering the move into training.<br />
				There is, however, one more area in which you will have to work 
				to establish rapport: trust in you as an expert.<br />
				Learners generally take for granted that a teacher of a language 
				is an expert in it (however misguided the view sometimes is).&nbsp; 
				Trainee teachers, however, are not usually so trusting even on 
				initial training courses, let alone at in-service level.&nbsp; You 
				will have to demonstrate continually that you know what you are 
				talking about and that means doing good research and mastering 
				the data and materials you intend to use.<strong><br />
				There is no substitute for this and there are no short cuts</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Assess</strong><br />
				<img alt="assess" height="133" src="../../images/assess200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Informally, teachers are assessing their learners' abilities 
				continuously by listening to their output, watching them at work 
				and talking to them.&nbsp; Formally, too, teachers often write 
				progress and summative tests to see where the learners are and 
				what needs to be recycled or revised.&nbsp; Learners are often 
				reassured by that and sometimes motivated to study.<br />
				Yours is now a more formal and much more threatening role.&nbsp; 
				It is so important that an entire unit of this course is devoted 
				to how to do it.&nbsp; No more will be said here.</li>
				<li><strong>Plan</strong><br />
				<img alt="plan" height="133" src="../../images/write_plan200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Of course you know how to plan.<br />
				However, planning for a teacher-training session is not the same 
				as the planning for teaching that you have done up to now.<br />
				Instead of settling on a structure such as PPP or TTT and going 
				from there to set up a series of activities and tasks leading to 
				the mastery of the language or skill, you are now faced with 
				editing and organising data.<br />
				This, again, is such an important area of teacher training that 
				it forms part of a unit to itself.&nbsp; No more will be said 
				here.</li>
				<li><strong>Give and get feedback</strong><br />
				<img alt="feedback" height="133" src="../../images/feedback_board200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Learners expect, and usually get, instant brief feedback on 
				their performance.&nbsp; During training sessions, that still 
				applies because you need to be alert to what people are saying 
				and measure from it whether they have absorbed the data or not.&nbsp; 
				Careful handling of the feedback routines in training sessions is 
				no less important than it is in language teaching but the 
				targets are different.&nbsp; On a training course, feedback 
				concerns the amount and quality of data that people have 
				mastered but in language teaching the feedback is not on mastery 
				of data, it is on performance.<br />
				Feedback on teaching is a different matter because 
				here we are dealing with performance.&nbsp; How to give feedback 
				also takes up a large section of another unit of this course so 
				we'll say little more about it here, except ...<br />
				... feedback on teaching is usually:<ul class="greenroundbullet">
					<li>delayed, because it needs to be properly thought through 
					and the teacher also needs to carry out some kind of self 
					evaluation</li>
					<li>lengthy, because there's a lot to discuss</li>
					<li>spoken and written, because people need the opportunity 
					to discuss and justify as well as having something to take 
					away and digest at leisure</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Observe</strong><br />
				<img alt="eye" height="133" src="../../images/eye_female_open200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				All teachers observe, of course, but they do so looking for the 
				need to intervene or to find out what's going on when learners 
				are working and really good teachers have the ability to observe 
				themselves.<br />
				Your observation of other people teaching is of a very different 
				order.&nbsp; You cannot, must not, interfere even if the process 
				is breaking down irretrievably.&nbsp; You are not a knower, on 
				hand for the learners or the trainee to turn to for help.<br />
				So different is the task you have now to perform that it is 
				treated in a separate unit.&nbsp; No more will be said here.</li>
				<li><strong>Set and manage tasks</strong><br />
				<img alt="manage" height="133" src="../../images/management200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				At last we come to something that is virtually unchanged.&nbsp; 
				The skills you have developed as a task setter and manager are 
				exactly the same ones you need to deploy as a trainer.&nbsp; The 
				content, of course, is very different because you are helping 
				people to acquire knowledge, techniques, ideas and ways of doing 
				things rather than language or skills but the principles of task 
				setting and management are unchanged.</li>
				<li><strong>Explain intricate grammar rules and discus 
				skills</strong><br />
				<img alt="explain" height="133" src="../../images/explain_board200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				All good teachers are adept at explaining a grammar rule 
				in a way that the learners can understand and apply it and all 
				good teachers have broken down skills into manageable components 
				for practice and development.<br />
				Even teachers with a rather superficial understanding of the 
				rules of English and the ways that skills are used can generally 
				stay at least one step ahead of the learners in their care.<br />
				You now fall into a different category because you need to be 
				able to explain grammar and skills far more thoroughly and 
				accurately.&nbsp; It is no longer enough to be a bit better at 
				this than the learners; you have to be <strong>a lot</strong> 
				better.<br />
				This means reading, researching and properly understanding 
				whatever the topic of your session on a course may be.<br />
				It will take time and effort.</li>
				<li><strong>Present research data</strong><br />
				<img alt="data" height="133" src="../../images/data200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is something language teachers almost never have to do 
				unless they are working in quite specialised fields.&nbsp; On 
				initial or pre-service training courses, the skill is also 
				rarely needed.&nbsp; However, as we go up the levels in teacher 
				knowledge and competence, the results of research in the 
				literature need to be presented.&nbsp; That means two things 
				have to happen which require time and thought:<ul class="greenroundbullet">
					<li>You have to read the material</li>
					<li>You have to edit it and present it digestibly</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Read widely</strong><br />
				<img alt="read" height="133" src="../../images/reading_interested200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				There is an old compliant that academics don't teach and 
				teachers don't read.&nbsp; There may be some truth in that but 
				as a trainer you have a foot in both camps so reading widely

			<p>The term training has had a bad press recently because it 
			implies to some a rather mechanical process of getting people to 
			jump through hoops and copy other people's behaviour to reach the 
			goals.<br />
			The term education, on the other hand, has nothing but positive 
			connotations implying thoughtful processes of leading people to 
			developing knowledge and skills in a more certain, considered and 
			flexible way.<br />
			The dichotomy really isn't fair because training can involve thought 
			and a good deal of what passes for education involves mechanical 
			rote learning of facts (and some myths).</p>
			<p>We see in 
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u3_training_to_train_types.html">Unit 3</a> of this course that training or education of 
			teachers at different stages in their careers and for different 
			purposes has to take quite radically different forms.<br />
			On initial, pre-service courses a good deal of training is done via 
			a process of demonstration, imitation and then live practice with 
			real learners.&nbsp; That cannot work well on in-service courses 
			because the backgrounds of the trainees are so different and it 
			would be patronising and unwelcome to ask such teachers to copy 
			their trainers.&nbsp; In many in-house development programmes the 
			case is altered again because such programmes are not designed to 
			transmit data and train in procedures but to get already trained 
			teachers to introspect and set their own aims for mastery.<br />
			If you want to call the first sort of 
			demonstration &rarr; imitation → practice training and reserve the 
			term education for the other two types of, erm, training, then 
			that's a legitimate stand to take because they are very different 
			processes.<br />
			Nevertheless, for simplicity's sake, in this course we will call all 
			the processes training and refer to you as the trainer and to the 
			participants apart from you as the trainees.</p>

			<p>If you cast your mind back to when you were a novice language 
			teacher, it will be surprising if you don't recognise that you were 
			often only one step ahead of the learners when it came to analysing 
			the language.<br />
			You were probably quite capable of explaining that, for example:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use </strong>
			<em><strong>any</strong></em><strong> in questions and negative 
			sentences and </strong><em><strong>some</strong></em><strong> in 
			positive statements</strong></span><br />
			because you had read the relevant bit of a grammar for learners.<br />
			It is possible that you'd be quite thrown when someone pointed out 
			that we say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did some people from the council come round?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn't someone ask?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we have any, it's in that cupboard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She refused any help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like some more time?</em><br />
			all of which appear to break the rules, of course.<br />
			Now, at this stage in your career, naturally, you have a more 
			sophisticated view of assertive and non-assertive forms so can 
			explain quite easily.&nbsp; That knowledge came at a cost in time 
			and energy, not to mention motivation to learn.<br />
			On an initial or pre-service training course, you may feel you know 
			enough to proceed with some confidence but above that level, you 
			probably need to do some serious reading and study.<br />
			Now you are a novice teacher trainer and the process starts 
			again.<br />
			That's OK &ndash; you have done it before.</p>
			<p>Just as you learned back then, you have to have the confidence 
			occasionally to say:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry, I don't 
			know the answer to that but I'll find out and get back to you.</em></span><br />
			Naturally, enough, that won't wash as a response on more than one or 
			two occasions so you will need to build on your knowledge, not just 
			of language forms as in this example, but of methodology, 
			psycholinguistics and learning theory, sociolinguistics and a range 
			of other issues including semantics, pragmatics and morphology.<br />
			This site is a good place to start so you should take some time 
			while you are doing this course and after it to investigate corners 
			of the language that you don't recognise too well.<br />
			Here are some places to begin your journey to better mastery of your

			<p>And so on.<br />
			This list could, of course, be greatly extended and most guides to

			and how people learn languages.&nbsp; Some may arrogate this

			There are some persuasive theories about language and learning but

			good deal less persuasive than others.&nbsp; We cannot discover how

			<p>In many institutions, trainers are drawn from people who have 
			themselves been through the institution's training programme and 
			then gained some greater experience.&nbsp; Now, you may believe that 
			the training you received was exemplary and that you should, as far 
			as possible, try to duplicate what you encountered as a trainee when 
			you set out to train because, after all, it resulted in your current 
			level of great competence and profession skill.<br />
			There are dangers to this sort of process:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Misconceptions, myths and groundless assumptions about 
				language and learning tend to proliferate and are passed on to 
				generations of trainers.</li>
				<li>In the copying process, errors occur which cannot be 
				satisfactorily fixed.&nbsp; For example, once a misunderstanding 
				of the distinctions (or not) between style and register is 
				embedded in a trainee, when that trainee becomes a trainer, the 
				misunderstanding gets passed on to a new generation who may, in 
				turn, become trainers.&nbsp; And so it goes on.</li>
				<li>Progress is glacial or imperceptible because the institution 
				has decided on what it believes best practice to be and no 
				changes are made.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The moral here is to keep an open mind and do your own research

			<p>It is likely, however, that as a new trainer you will be taking

			The comments above are not at all meant to imply that you shouldn't 
			take your colleagues' views seriously, just that you should, from 
			time to time, be prepared to paddle your own canoe with regard to 
			what you say in training sessions and how you understand ideas,

			Many established training teams welcome the injection of new 
			thoughts and the corrective nature of another view.&nbsp; On the 
			other hand, there are trainers who have developed over the years a 
			set of prejudices and assumptions which are not based on authority 
			or research but on personal opinion and, alas, sometimes 
			misunderstood reading.&nbsp; You need to handle this kind of

			taught course, you will often be required to do that.&nbsp; 
			Introspection and reflection are key teaching skills whatever you 
			are teaching.<br />
			You need to look in a mental mirror and assess as honestly as you 
			can where are, where you need to be and how to get there.</p>
			<p>There is one worksheet here with two tasks.<br />
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="worksheets/ELT_Concourse_Training_to_Train_U1_self-evaluation.pdf" target="_blank">
			Click here to download the worksheet</a>.</p>
			<p>What you write in the right-hand column for those two tasks is 
			not predictable but it is to be hoped that occasionally you may 
			write something like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>Do the rest of the units in 
			this course.</em></span></p>
