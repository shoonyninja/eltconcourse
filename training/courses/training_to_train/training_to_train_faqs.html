			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions about Training to Train</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="books" height="207" src="../../images/books_greentint310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p><strong>Q: Is the course certificated?</strong><br />
			A: 
			No.<br />
			Most paid-for courses will be, however, although the value of some 
			certificates for courses which are not independently accredited is 
			somewhat obscure.<br />
			You are welcome to state under oath that you have completed the 
			course but <span class="orange"><strong>ELT</strong></span>
			<span class="style_blue"><strong>Concourse</strong></span> is not in 
			a position to substantiate any claims you may make.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: If I am running or working on a 
			paid-for trainer-training course, can I use the materials from this 
			one?</strong><br />
			A: It is difficult to stop you but it is unprofessional thievery 
			which is not condoned or permitted.&nbsp; You are, of course, welcome to provide 
			your trainees with a link to this course but not in a way that 
			implies that <span class="orange"><strong>ELT</strong></span>
			<span class="style_blue"><strong>Concourse</strong> </span>approves 
			of you or what you are doing.<br />
					You may <strong>not</strong> use this material for 
			commercial purposes and that includes using it on fee-paying teacher 
			training courses.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Is any support available apart from 
			the materials, tests and worksheets?</strong><br />
			A: 
			Not reliably.<br />
			This is not a taught course but some informal support <em>via</em> email is 
			available for all visitors to any area of the site.<br />
			If you have a question or are puzzled about something, have feedback 
			to give or a suggestion to make, feel free to 
			get in touch.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Who wrote it?</strong><br />
			A: It is not the policy of this site to ascribe authorship to any of 
			the materials unless the author specifically requests it.&nbsp; The 
			materials were constructed and are updated and maintained by an 
			author with over 30 years' experience of training teachers at all 
			levels, from those starting out on a career in ELT to those 
			upgrading their knowledge and skills at tertiary educational 
			institutions and on MA courses in both the private and public 
			sectors.&nbsp; In addition, the author has many years' experience as 
			an academic manager and educational consultant running in-house workshops and support programmes 
			for teachers at all levels of experience.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: What does the course cost?</strong><br />
			A: 
			Nothing.&nbsp; Really.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Who is the course suitable for?</strong><br />
			A: It is designed for current English Language teachers or academic managers 
			who want to convert to being a teacher trainer for at least part of 
			their time.&nbsp; This may be someone seeking to train on initial 
			training programmes such as CELTA or the Trinity Cert TESOL or at 
			higher, in-service levels such as on Cambridge Delta or Trinity Diploma 
			courses.<br />
			It is also suitable for those working as academic managers or senior 
			teachers who want 
			to get involved in monitoring, assessing, refining and upgrading the 
			skills and knowledge of the teaching staff in any kind of 
			institution.<br />
			Experienced trainers and those who are concerned with leading 
			workshops and training sessions at conferences and so on may also 
			find something of value in the course.</p>
		
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Can I ask another question?</strong><br />
			A: 
			Yes, of course.&nbsp; Please use the
			<a href="../../../contact.html">Contact page</a>.</p>
