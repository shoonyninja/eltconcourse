			<p>Whether you are designing a training programme from scratch or 
			designing a programme based on someone else's idea of a syllabus 
			(such as Cambridge Assessment English or Trinity College), you are 
			going to have to come to terms with deciding on the content of your 
			programme.<br />
			As a novice trainer it is not usual (although possible) for you to 
			be left to your own devices in this respect but even if the course 
			syllabus is laid down by others, it is still your job to see how the 
			content fits together and addresses the intended outcomes of the 
			programme.</p>

					<h2>Rationale</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Teacher training is a serious business, although it needn't be 
			gloomy, dull and over-earnest, and, like all serious undertakings, 
			it needs a rationale for its existence.<br />
			You should, therefore, be able to tell someone else in accurate and 
			concise terms what your course is for and why it is needed.<br />
			The rationale will include at least:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="darkgreenbullet"><strong>Course type</strong><br />
				Here, we need to say what the essential nature of the course 
				really is.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="greenroundbullet">
					<li >This is a pre-service course to 
					prepare people to teach children at a summer school</li>
					<li >This is an in-service training 
					course to prepare people for the following externally 
					awarded qualification ...</li>
					<li >This is an in-service course for 
					inexperienced teachers to help them broaden their skills 
					base and operate in more specialised teaching settings</li>
					<li >This is an in-house development 
					programme for experienced teachers to share best practice 
					across the institution</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="darkgreenbullet"><strong>Target participants</strong><br />
				Here, we need to have a clear idea of who the course is for.&nbsp; 
				We need, for example, to be clear about:<ul>
					<li class="greenroundbullet">The ages and backgrounds of the 
				participants.<br />Are they school leavers, the newly graduated, experienced 
				teachers, overseas teachers, state school teachers, teachers in 
				private institutions or what?</li>
					<li class="greenroundbullet">The qualifications for entry.<br />Do participants need to have a minimum amount of experience?<br />Do they need a minimum level of educational attainment?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="darkgreenbullet"><strong>Course context</strong><br />
				Here, we need to consider whether the course is purely for a 
				select group, perhaps a single institution's staff, or whether 
				it fits with an already established qualification.<br />
				We also need to consider whether there are elements of public 
				policy with which the course will be aligned.</li>
				<li class="darkgreenbullet"><strong>Course aims</strong><br />
				If you are operating within a syllabus laid down by an external 
				body, this has been done for you.&nbsp; Such bodies are usually 
				quite explicit concerning the aims of the course and the overall 
				objectives it has to meet.&nbsp; For example, the Cambridge 
				Assessment English Handbook for its CELTA scheme sets out the 
				course objectives (which it terms aims, in fact) as:<p class="quote">
				The course enables candidates to:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acquire essential subject knowledge and familiarity with the 
				principles of effective teaching<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acquire a range of practical skills for teaching English to 
				adult learners<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; demonstrate their ability to apply their learning in a real 
				teaching context.<br />
				</p>
				Other public awarding bodies will have similar statements for 
				all qualifications.<br />
				On the other hand, if you are planning the content of a course 
				which is not externally accredited, you have more freedom to 
				choose the content to suit the needs and characteristics of the 
				participants and their institutional setting(s).<br />
				See below for more ideas of the types of knowledge and skills 
				you could aim to improve or establish.</li>
				<li class="darkgreenbullet"><strong>Principles</strong><br />
				Something needs to be said in the rationale about the principles 
				on which the course is based.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="greenroundbullet">
					<li >Does the course explicitly target reflection and 
				introspection skills?</li>
					<li >Does the course set out to provide participants with the skills 
				they need to develop autonomously after the course is finished?</li>
					<li >Is the course intended to provide participants with wholly 
				portable skills or is it culturally based?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>That's the foundation laid.&nbsp; Now we can start to build the 
			content.</p>

					<h2>Four types of knowledge</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Teacher training programmes are complex animals and we need a way 
			to categorise what they intend to achieve.<br />
			Some courses 
			will be severely practical, intent only on providing novice teachers 
			with a set of techniques and procedures to get them through a 
			teaching day.<br />
			Some, for example, in-house programmes, may be 
			focused on sharing ideas with other teachers and setting personal 
			development goals.<br />
			Others may be more sophisticated and 
			endeavour to link procedures and techniques to principles and 
			theoretical models of language and learning.<br />
			Still others will 
			be focused less on the classroom and attempt to provide practising 
			teachers with theoretical knowledge to back up and justify what they 
			already do in the classroom.<br />
			Whichever type you are involved in, there are 
			four areas you need 
			to consider.&nbsp; The mix will vary and some types of knowledge may 
			be prioritised over others but they will all, most probably, be 
			present.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="books" height="133" src="../../images/books_bundle200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Subject knowledge</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There is some doubt on some courses that subject knowledge is 
			treated as thoroughly as other kinds of knowledge but it is still 
			the case that learners expect and sometimes demand that their 
			teachers are masters of the content of the syllabus as well as the 
			practical aspects of teaching.<br />
			Some subject knowledge will accordingly be contained in the content 
			of any serious training course unless it may safely be assumed that 
			the participants have already mastered it (as may, for example, be 
			the case with some in-house programmes for well qualified and 
			experienced teachers).<br />
			On initial and pre-service training courses it is perilous to assume 
			that ability to speak, write and understand the language is an 
			adequate background for teaching it.&nbsp; Even on in-service 
			courses, where one might expect a higher level of initial knowledge, 
			there will usually be a need to for some serious language and skills 
			analysis.<br />
			This will involve these areas (although they will not all be given equal 
			prominence, of course):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Grammar, phonology, lexis and structure<br />
				Trainees at all levels need to absorb at least some data on:<ol class="auto-style7">
					<li>verbs forms</li>
					<li>tense and aspect</li>
					<li>syntax</li>
					<li>discourse and deixis</li>
					<li>morphology</li>
					<li>functions and notions</li>
					<li>lexical relationships</li>
					<li>mood and modality</li>
					<li>phonemic knowledge including transcription skills</li>
					<li>elements of connected speech including prosodic features</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Skills knowledge<br />
				Trainees at all levels need some knowledge of the strategies and 
				subskills concerned with:<ol class="auto-style7">
					<li>Reading</li>
					<li>Writing</li>
					<li>Speaking</li>
					<li>Listening</li>
					<li>Combined / integrated skills</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>General language awareness<br />
				Although not all courses will focus on this area, some will have 
				to, and the area includes:<ol class="auto-style7">
					<li>English as an international lingua franca</li>
					<li>The roots of English</li>
					<li>Varieties of English</li>
					<li>Cultural issues</li>
					<li>Differences between English and other languages 
					(typology)</li>
					<li>The social context of language use</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It's not possible here to determine the relative importance of 
			these areas for any programme on which you may be working but all 
			the areas have to be considered if only to be discarded because they 
			don't match the syllabus, time does not permit or the topic is too 
			advanced or irrelevant.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="cogwheels" height="133" src="../../images/cogwheels_in_wheels200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Methodological knowledge</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is another area where a certain amount of judicious editing 
			and selection is probably wise on almost any programme.&nbsp; 
			However, it is not possible to select and edit if you don't have a 
			reasonably comprehensive grasp of what the area involves.<br />
			It's also important to categorise carefully in this area or 
			everything gets called a method or a methodology and the water is 
			very muddy and undifferentiated.&nbsp; On this site, distinctions 
			are made between:</p>
			<ul class="darkgreenbullet">
				<li>Major theories (such as cognitivism, functional analysis of 
				language, structuralism or behaviourism)</li>
				<li>Hypotheses (such as motivation theories and language 
				acquisition theories)</li>
				<li>Procedures (such as using noticing activities, converting 
				input to intake, scaffolding tasks in the Zone of Proximal 
				Development, Dogme, PPP approaches etc.)</li>
				<li>Techniques (such as various sorts of dictation, 
				information-gap tasks, skills work on texts etc.)</li>
				<li>Classroom solutions (such as concept-checking questions, 
				grouping learners, nomination and class management)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>but, providing you have some clarity, you can decide on your own 
			categories for these items.<br />
			There's more in
					<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="../../inservice/methodology/methodology_refined.html" target="_blank">
					the guide to refining methodology</a>.</p>
			<p>Consideration needs to be given to at least:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The constituents of a methodology</li>
				<li>Theories of language: what it is and how it fits together</li>
				<li>Theoretical assumptions and assertions about learning (see 
				the next section)</li>
				<li>The range of methodologies and methods available currently 
				and in the past</li>
				<li>Natural approaches</li>
				<li>Humanism</li>
				<li>Post-method methodology</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Again, the nature of the course, its participants and its aims 
			and objectives will determine what weight, if any, is given to each of the 
			factors in that list.</p>

					<h3>Psychological knowledge</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is often combined with the last section on many courses or 
			the threads are woven together.&nbsp; It is, nevertheless, a 
			distinct area for consideration and will include:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Learning theory</li>
				<li>Language acquisition theories</li>
				<li>Human data processing theories</li>
				<li>Learning strategies</li>
				<li>Factors affecting learning</li>
				<li>Language interference and facilitation</li>

				<li>Cognitivism and other theories of mind</li>
				<li>The relationship between thought and language</li>
			</ol>
			<p>On pre-service and initial courses, you are probably wise not to 
			dwell on this area but for in-service training, it's essential for 
			people to get a grip on the theories which underlie classroom 
			practice.</p>

					<h3>Procedural knowledge</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Pre-service and initial training courses need to place procedural 
			knowledge at the heart of what they do.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this 
			tends to mean that other areas of knowledge are neglected and 
			participants are left without adequate background understanding to 
			carry their skills forward and build on them in a principled way.<br />
			That's not your fault and on some courses, aiming for recognised 
			initial qualifications, there is little you can do 
			to ameliorate the problem but on others you may be able to do 
			something useful to allow people a certain amount of autonomy.</p>
			<p>Procedural knowledge will include any or all of the following 
			depending on the level of competence and skill the course is 
			intended to enable in the participants.<br />
			The following is in alphabetical order lest you think it's some kind 
			of prioritised list.&nbsp; It cannot be because all courses are 
			different.</p>

			<p>While we are considering the content of training programmes, it 
			is worth taking a little time to consider how myths about the

			usually through some form of training course.<br />
			Myths and errors of fact may be profession wide (such as learning 
			styles and left-right-brain differences) or they may be confined to 
			institutions (such as being unable to distinguish style from 
			register).<br />
			There is a guide on this site which sets out a range of myths about 
			the language and teaching procedures which considers, for example, 
			the efficacy of drilling, the existence of an affective filter, the

					<li>If the aim is to raise in-house competence and extend the

					<li>Short courses will only allow a limited range to be covered 
				so prioritise again using the points under 1. and then editing 
				down the lists to the most relevant topics.</li>
					<li>Longer courses will allow more depth so try to draw threads 
				through the topics that can build up to a mastery of the area 
				from theories of language and learning &rarr; major hypotheses 
					about learning &rarr; procedures &rarr; techniques &rarr; 
					classroom solutions.<br />
					For more on this, see
					<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="../../inservice/methodology/methodology_refined.html" target="_blank">
					the guide to refining methodology</a> (new tab).</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Consider the participants<ul class="greenroundbullet">
					<li>Participants who already have some knowledge of teaching 
					and the theories which underlie what they do in the 
					classroom will be more able to take on new ideas and deeper 
					analysis.</li>
					<li>Teachers who have become routinised in what they do in 
					the classroom may be refreshed by considering new insights 
					from learning and psycholinguistic theories which they can 
					apply to their classrooms to increase variety and 
					engagement.</li>
					<li>Participants who have never taught before or only very 
					little need a grounding in grammar, structure, lexis and 
					phonology before they can begin to plan and teach.&nbsp; 
					Focus there first.</li>
					<li>People with more background will already have a 
					good idea of these matters so aim to extend and deepen their 
					knowledge through research and writing tasks.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Consider the course context<ol class="greenroundbullet">
					<li>Courses aiming at externally accredited qualifications 
					need to match the content to the syllabus which is imposed 
					from the examining body.&nbsp; Match the items above to each 
					of the syllabus elements individually, locate any gaps and 
					fill them.&nbsp; Ignore everything else.</li>
					<li>Courses aiming to prepare people only for particular 
					settings need to be very focused so select with care what's 
					appropriate to cover and cover the areas in depth.</li>
					<li>Participants in many in-house development courses are 
					quite able to set their own agendas for research and 
					discovery.&nbsp; They may need some judicious nudging and direction, 
					however.</li>
					<li>If the institution has set up a course to enhance the 
					teachers' abilities in specific areas, track them down from 
					the lists and focus on them without forgetting to consider 
					any theoretical background which makes them accessible and 
					consistent with principle.</li>
