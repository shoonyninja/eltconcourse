			<p>Teacher training is a varied and unpredictable undertaking.&nbsp; 
			It has many purposes, a range of participant types and an array of 
			possible aims so it is difficult to narrow down the choices of types 
			of training and put them in watertight compartments.<br />
			But we'll try.</p>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In this course we'll consider three basic sorts of training and 
			then, where we need to, subdivide the areas to make a bit more sense 
			of them.<br />
			They are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Initial or pre-service training<br />
				which focuses quite narrowly on equipping people with a toolbox 
				of techniques and procedures which will allow them to provide 
				some focused but not necessarily flexible teaching of the 
				language.<br />
				Benchmark courses of this type include the Cambridge English 
				CELTA scheme and the Trinity Cert TESOL both of which are taken 
				by many hundreds of people and which are considered the minimum 
				requirement for employment as a teacher in many settings.<br />
				Participants on such courses usually have no experience at all 
				or only very limited experience in some settings and are looking 
				for a course which is short, focused and practical.&nbsp; 
				Neither they nor their trainers are very concerned with 
				principle and theory.</li>
				<li>In-service training<br />
				is more variable.&nbsp; It focuses on extending, enhancing and 
				refining teaching ability in people who have already taken some 
				form of pre-service training and have built up, often by trial 
				and error or painful experience, a set of classroom solutions 
				which they can deploy professionally to overcome the 
				deficiencies of their training to date.<br />
				In a sense, this sort of training sets out to repair the 
				problems caused by the very procedurally focused nature of 
				initial training by filling in the theoretical gaps and getting 
				participants to apply theory to practice in a principled way.&nbsp; 
				It focuses particularly on high levels of classroom skill and 
				behaviours as well as attempting to broaden and extend the 
				participants' knowledge of language and methodology.&nbsp; 
				Whether it succeeds is another matter.<br />
				Examples of the aims of such courses are:<p class="quote">A ... 
				qualification ... ideal for practitioners wishing to progress to 
				positions in management, teacher education and examining.<br />
				<span class="auto-style9">(Trinity College DipTESOL factsheet)</span></p>
				or<p class="quote">[the qualification] can prepare teachers for 
				more senior teaching roles and facilitate progression to other 
				qualifications<br />
				<span class="auto-style9">(Cambridge English Delta, Handbook for 
				Tutors and Candidates)</span></p>
				Another form of in-service training often 
				takes place on short intensive courses whose aims are more difficult to define satisfactorily in terms of aims and 
				content.&nbsp; Such courses are often marketed as refresher 
				courses (although what exactly is being refreshed is often 
				obscure) or are courses which pivot around the providing 
				organisation's principal theoretical concerns.<br />
				Many such courses provide participants with the opportunity to 
				get out of the classroom, encounter new ideas, refresh their 
				language skills and practice and (re)invigorate their classroom 
				behaviour.</li>
				<li>In-house training<br />
				is designed to meet an institution's or its teaching staff's 
				specified needs.&nbsp; Such courses are rarely if ever externally 
				recognised.<br />
				Much of the content and organisation of such training is 
				dependent on the level of expertise and experience already 
				present.&nbsp; We shall address below the demands of such 
				programmes for both the experienced and already competent and 
				the newly qualified who need support and consolidation of the 
				training they have had.<br />
				This kind of training usually has some or all of three purposes:<ol class="auto-style7">
					<li>to meet a perceived need in an organisation to provide 
					the teaching team with the skills they need to enter new 
					markets or develop better responses to the changing needs of 
					their current clients</li>
					<li>to refresh and motivate the teaching team through a 
					formal sharing of ideas, practice and understanding of their 
					profession</li>
					<li>to build on initial, pre-service programmes which 
					teachers have taken in order to enhance the teaching team's 
					overall abilities and methodological flexibility.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We are not concerned here with the content of such courses 
			because that is covered in 
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u2_training_to_train_content.html">Unit 2</a> of this course.<br />
			We are also not currently concerned with the design and delivery of 
			individual sessions on these sorts of courses because that forms the 
			topic of 
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u4_training_to_train_running_sessions.html">Unit 4
			</a>of the course.<br />
			We are, however, concerned with investigating the manner of delivery 
			of the content and the structure of the training programme.</p>
			<p>The dividing line in the types of training above lies 
			between area 1. and the other two because in course types 2. and 3. the assumption is that we are dealing with practitioners 
			currently operating as language teachers.&nbsp; Their needs are 
			fundamentally different from the needs of beginners in the 
			profession both quantitatively but, much more importantly, 
			qualitatively.<br />
			This leads to some fundamental differences concerning the nature of 
			the trainer's job.<br />
			Much of what follows is taken from or adapted from the guide in the 
			trainers section of this site and that's an area you may need to 
			investigate (later).</p>

			</table>
			<p>Initial training is premised on the fact that the majority of 
			participants have never taught or, if they have taught, have not 
			taught a language.<br />
			Most initial training on short courses involves three types of 
			activities:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Demonstration</dt>
				<dd>In this, the tutor simply demonstrates the classroom 
				approach which is the focus of the session.<br />
				For example:<ul class="greenroundbullet" >
					<li>if the focus is on teaching vocabulary via a reading 
					text, the tutor can employ a section of an article or book 
					about reading and set the task of identifying some key terms 
					in the text and matching them to definitions provided on a 
					separate worksheet.</li>
					<li>if the focus is on teaching a tense structure, the tutor 
					can demonstrate by introducing the use of the tense via a 
					set of pictures and/or a timeline to explain its key 
					function.</li>
					<li>if the focus is on using Dictogloss, the simplest way is 
					clearly to do one with the trainees and then discuss with them 
					how it worked and what skills they needed to deploy to 
					complete the text.</li>
					<li>the use of teaching an unknown 
					language to the trainees near the beginning of a course to 
					demonstrate techniques such as modelling, drilling, 
					correction and so on as well as alerting them to how it 
					feels to be taught a language from scratch.&nbsp; This is an activity done on most 
					initial training courses.</li>
				</ul>
				The next step is for the trainees to deploy similar techniques 
				in a controlled setting (peer teaching or small-group 
				demonstration) before taking the plunge and using the procedure 
				with a class of learners in teaching practice session.</dd>
				<dt>Experiential learning</dt>
				<dd>This is an extension of demonstration and involves the 
				trainees in firstly experiencing a technique pretending to be 
				learners of the language and then doing it for themselves with 
				their peers.&nbsp; The theory is that the act of using 
				a technique one has seen demonstrated makes the activity more 
				memorable and engaging.</dd>
				<dt>Loop input</dt>
				<dd>This term is defined and exemplified at the beginning of 
				Unit 1 of the course but to repeat:<span class="style_black"><p class="quote">
				<em>Loop input is a 
				specific type of experiential teacher training process that 
				involves an alignment of the process and content of learning.<br />
				</em><span class="auto-style10">(Woodward, 2003:301)</span></p>
				</span></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>There are, naturally, many other ways in which a topic can be 
			taught on an initial training course but the key aspect of such 
			courses is that the trainer (you) is, throughout, demonstrating what the 
			participants need to learn to do.<br />
			It is assumed, therefore, that simply lecturing people about a topic 
			presents a false model of what teaching should be in the classroom.&nbsp; 
			Efforts are therefore made to make the process match the content.<br />
			This is training akin to what frequently happens in commercial and 
			industrial settings in which an apprentice is paired with an 
			experienced worker and learns by deliberate copying of the more 
			experienced colleague's behaviour and actions.&nbsp; This was 
			originally called <strong>sitting by Nellie</strong> or <strong>exposure training</strong> 
			and it looks like this:</p>
			<p>
					<img alt="initial" height="183" src="../../imagesgraphics/initial_training.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>The steps are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Study with the master practitioner (you, in this case) and 
				demonstration and instruction involve:<ul class="greenroundbullet">
					<li>being shown how something is done</li>
					<li>being told why it's useful and effective</li>
					<li>being told how to do it</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Practice with feedback comes in two forms:<ul class="greenroundbullet">
					<li>Micro-teaching and peer-teaching with feedback from 
					peers and the tutor</li>
					<li>Teaching practice with real learners and feedback from 
					tutors primarily and peers secondarily</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Thus competence is based on 
			practical application with a set of volunteer learners.</p>
			<p> 
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u2_training_to_train_content.html" target="_blank">Unit 2</a> of this course deals at some length with the different 
			sorts of knowledge that need to form the content of training 
			programmes for teachers and what we are discussing here is mostly 
			one part of that: procedural knowledge.<br />
			Initial courses will also, especially if the participants are native 
			speakers of English, have to deal with some subject knowledge but usually 
			at a reasonably simple level confined to word class, tense forms 
			and their most common uses, basic syntax, clauses and phrases and so on.<br />
			A fuller list of what be tackled is in 
			Unit 2.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In-service training is different both in terms of the quantity of 
			what people are expected to know and the quality of the data they 
			are asked to master.<br />
			There is, of course, a good deal more to be learned on such courses 
			and included in that will be some focus on procedural knowledge.<br />
			Although participants on such courses have some basic training and 
			may have a good deal of experience, the procedural aspects of such 
			courses can now focus on much more generalised competence rather 
			than setting-specific competence.&nbsp; In other words, the focus on 
			procedural aspects of teaching on in-service training programmes is 
			to equip the trainees with truly portable skills which, because they 
			are based on principle rather than routine, can be adapted to almost 
			any teaching setting.<br />
			Participants are assumed already to have a toolbox of techniques and 
			procedures but now need to relate these to the reasons for their use 
			and thus acquire the ability to use the tools consistently and in a 
			principled manner.<br />
			Such people are not going to be very 
			impressed by being asked to copy the trainer's behaviour and apply 
			what they are learning to teaching their peers under supervision.&nbsp; 
			These people want to take what they learn and use it to enhance 
			their own effectiveness in helping learners to learn.</p>
			<p>The form that training takes is not a matter of seeing, doing and 
			then applying but of the application of experience and theory, reflection 
			and constant improvement.&nbsp; The picture is:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="in service" height="214" src="../../imagesgraphics/in-service_training.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The elements are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Received knowledge refers to:<ul class="brownroundbullet">
					<li>lectures and workshops on the course</li>
					<li>reading and research</li>
					<li>observations of other teachers</li>
					<li>input from colleagues, conferences, workshops, training 
					courses and the like</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Previous experiential knowledge refers to:<ul class="brownroundbullet">
					<li>substantial (often set at a minimum of around 1200 hours of teaching) 
					experience</li>
					<li>personal reflections on what was and was not effective</li>
					<li>the responses and success of their learners</li>
					<li>the content of an initial training course seen in the 
					light of later experience</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The central boxes refer to the process of researching, 
				preparing teaching and reflecting on teaching evaluated by the 
				course participant and by you.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The sort of professional competence as a language teacher which 
			emerges from a process such as this is very different from that 
			which emerges from initial training.&nbsp; It is independent of 
			setting, learners' aims, learners' characteristics and the demands 
			of a syllabus.</p>

			<p>There is
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="../../../academic_management/in-house_development.html" target="_blank">
			a guide in the section for Academic Managers</a> on this site to 
			setting up and running an in-house development programme so you 
			should consult that for more on the management of such programmes 
			and their implementation.<br />
			Here, we are looking at the programme from the point of view of a 
			trainer rather than an Academic Manager (although you may, 
			naturally, be both).<br />
			In-house programmes can, very broadly, be split into two main sorts 
			as we shall see.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<img alt="experienced" height="133" src="../../images/man_beard_long200.jpg" width="200" /></td>

					<h3>In-house development for experienced teachers</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In-house development, rather than training, differs from the other two forms of training.<br />
			It assumes from the outset shared concerns, considerable 
			setting-specific experience, varied levels of expertise, because no 
			teaching team is homogenous, institutional demands and generally 
			negotiated, or at least shared, aims for personal and institutional 
			development.<br />
			It looks, therefore, a bit like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="in house" height="210" src="t-to-t_images/in-house.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>It may look similar to in-service training but the inputs and 
			outputs are very different and the process which happens in the 
			centre is also quite different.<br />
			Your role as a trainer will accordingly be very different.&nbsp; 
			You are not demonstrating how to teach, nor are you supplying 
			methodological data for people to assimilate, you are not in any 
			kind of assessment mode and you do not need to tell people how to 
			research and behave.<br />
			What you do need to do is:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Set the parameters for discussion</li>
				<li>Explain the institutional demands</li>
				<li>Gather the data on shared experiences and concerns</li>
				<li>Facilitate the discussion of issues (and summarise them)</li>
				<li>Facilitate the sharing of solutions (and summarise them)</li>
				<li>Identify the personal and institutional benefits</li>
			</ol>
			<p>That's quite a lot to be going on with and you may add other 
			roles and responsibilities.</p>

					<td class="auto-style5">
					<h3>In-house training for inexperienced teachers</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Some in-house training is not of this nature and has more in 
			common with initial teacher training because the staff is 
			inexperienced and, possibly, newly qualified at pre-service level.<br />
			In this case, your role is much more of a trainer than a 
			facilitator.<br />
			A programme for teachers in this setting may be designed to provide 
			a bridge to more advanced, accredited qualifications (such as the 
			two benchmark diploma-level courses) or may be undertaken to provide 
			the teachers with more classroom options and some understanding of 
			underlying principles which will allow them to develop their 
			competence in a more principled manner than is allowed (or possible) 
			on short, pre-service courses.<br />
			For the content of such courses, you need to refer to the lists and 
			advice in 
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u2_training_to_train_content.html">Unit 2</a> of this course.<br />
			Generally, too, this sort of in-house programme is often, and 
			advisedly, combined with an observation programme which is designed 
			in part to diagnose the areas which need the most attention.&nbsp; 
			In fact, the best way to design such courses is to begin with a 
			series of observations from which a prioritised list of targets for 
			training can be extracted.<br />
			This sort of training looks a little like the set of stages set out 
			in the first diagram above but with some differences because it has 
			two aims:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To increase the participants' range of procedures, 
				techniques and classroom solutions to common issues</li>
				<li>To consolidate the pre-service training by linking it more 
				explicitly to theories of language and language learning which 
				will increase the participants' ability to develop and improve 
				their practice autonomously</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The shape of training resembles:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="in house inexperienced" height="218" src="t-to-t_images/in-house_inex.png" width="465" /></p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Inputs</strong></dt>
				<dd>The first input is the outcome of an observation programme 
				ideally undertaken by the trainer or the trainer's more 
				experienced colleagues.<br />
				The content of the pre-service training people have received 
				forms a key input into the training programme.&nbsp; You are not 
				dealing with beginners.<br />
				On such programmes the participants will share an institutional 
				setting (because that's in the nature of an in-house programme).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Sessions</strong></dt>
				<dd>Training sessions should be a slight mix.<br />
				On one hand, you are endeavouring to refine and extend the 
				participants' classroom approaches and behaviour by providing 
				more options and building on their initial training.&nbsp; To do 
				that, there will probably be some activities in sessions in 
				which you demonstrate the techniques and procedures you know, 
				from observation, people are poor at or don't do at all.&nbsp; 
				You may also be able to access recordings of others doing it 
				well or draw on more experienced colleagues in the organisation 
				to do the demonstrations and explain the value of what they are 
				doing.<br />
				Favoured topics are giving and getting feedback in different 
				ways, monitoring and using noticing and inferencing procedures 
				but the content will be heavily depended on what has been 
				observed.<br />
				On the other hand, you are also concerned to tie the training to 
				some theoretical considerations which have not been covered, at 
				least in any depth, on a pre-service training programme.&nbsp; 
				The object of this is that the participants should not only know 
				what to do in the classroom but also have a basic idea of why 
				they are doing it.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Outcomes</strong></dt>
				<dd>You are aiming for two:<br />
				That the participants should be more engaging and motivating 
				teachers because they have more options in the classroom and can 
				deploy a variety of techniques, activity types and approaches to 
				skills and language systems teaching which will have a positive 
				spin-off in terms of learner motivation and enjoyment.<br />
				That the participants, armed with some theoretical understanding 
				of what they are doing, can develop independently and research 
				and experiment with a variety of approaches for themselves.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>This sort of programme is not likely to be successful as a 
			one-off set of three or four sessions. For it to succeed it needs to 
			be an ongoing and routine part of in-house training.</p>
