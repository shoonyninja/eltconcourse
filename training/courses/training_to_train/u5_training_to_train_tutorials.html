			<img alt="woman" height="207" src="../../images/woman_direct310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Tutorials and seminars are expensive in terms of trainer time so it's 
			important to make the most of them.&nbsp; A series of thirty-minute, 
			one-to-one tutorials with 12 participants burns through six hours of 
			trainer time without considering any preparation or follow-up record 
			keeping (both of which are also important).<br />
			As with most things in teaching, good planning is often the key to 
			the efficient and effective use of time.</p>

					<h2>Open-door policies</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>If you want off-the-cuff, short and possibly unfocused meetings 
			with participants, have an open-door policy so they can drop in and 
			interrupt important planning and liaison meetings at any time.&nbsp; 
			Alternatively, be available only at specified times so that doesn't 
			happen (too often).<br />
			If you feel that being available all the time is important, by all 
			means try to be but the pressure is on you to plan and deliver a 
			coherent and useful training programme and if you never get quality 
			time alone to think, that's unlikely to happen.<br />
			Barring emergencies and critical events in participants' lives 
			(which seem to happen rather too often on most courses) a better and 
			more efficient use of your time is to have occasional one-to-one or 
			one-to-small-group tutorials which can be properly planned into the 
			timetable and prepared (on both sides) with clear agendas.<br />
			This short unit is intended to help you do that.</p>

					<h2>What are tutorials and seminars for?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We'll deal here with only the most popular purposes of these 
			meetings and try to distinguish between a tutorial and a seminar as 
			we go along.&nbsp; 
			Training courses differ dramatically as do the needs of trainees and 
			the demands of courses so you may well think of other purposes for 
			tutorials and seminars which match the setting in which you are training and the 
			aims of what you are doing.&nbsp; That's fine because similar 
			considerations apply whatever the function of the meeting.<br />
			Here's a short-list of possible purposes of tutorials:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>To evaluate progress</strong><br />
				These are usually one-to-one only because you need to address 
				each individual separately and you and the trainee probably do 
				not want other people to hear or be involved.&nbsp; They are not 
				seminars because of their nature which is the opportunity for 
				you to meet with only one course participant and you aren't 
				discussing the content of the course, you are discussing the 
				participants progress and giving them a chance to ask questions 
				and clear up problems.<br />
				There may well be a case for a group summary session which looks 
				at the progress being made overall and how people have responded 
				to the demands of the course in general but that process is not 
				considered here as a tutorial.</li>
				<li><strong>To provide feedback on teaching or written work</strong><br />
				Both of these topics are considered in depth in 
				<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u6_training_to_train_observe_assess.html" target="_blank">Unit 6</a> 
				of this course so we won't dwell on them here.&nbsp; These are 
				normally one-to-one sessions, too, so are tutorials for the most 
				part.&nbsp; Even when they are group events, they still are 
				better described as tutorials because their function is for you 
				put people right rather than discuss possibilities and views.</li>
				<li><strong>To help with planning and research</strong><br />
				Different trainees need different levels of support and 
				it is frequently not possible to address more than one person in this 
				regard.<br />
				However, it is sometimes the case that there are subgroups 
				within the group who have needs and abilities in common and who 
				need the same level of support so it is possible to combine 
				people which may make the meeting less tense and will 
				certainly be a more efficient use of your time.&nbsp; This is a 
				group tutorial because you are the only expert in the room.<br />
				It is also possible that you have set differentiated tasks to 
				complete so you have already identified subgroups and can get 
				the members together to review how they are doing.&nbsp; That, 
				too, is time efficient.</li>
				<li><strong>To operate as seminars focused on aspects of course content</strong><br />
				This is an expensive use of trainer time but, if it's available 
				and the other members of the group are gainfully occupied, can be 
				time very well spent.<br />
				Below, we have some examples of the agenda for something like 
				this but the focus can be very specific or much broader.&nbsp; 
				The advantage is that you are dealing with small numbers of 
				trainees who have undertaken similar or identical tasks and are 
				now charged with reporting on what they have learned and 
				discussing outcomes together under your leadership.&nbsp; This 
				is what qualifies the meeting as a seminar.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We'll consider all of these but under headings of commonalities 
			in all cases.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Pre-meeting agendas</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>If you don't have an agenda for your meetings five 
			things happen, none good.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The meeting meanders across the landscape never following a 
				true course and often doubling back to consider what has been 
				forgotten.&nbsp; Time is taken up chasing non-objectives and 
				following sidetracks.</li>
				<li>It is impossible for anyone to prepare for such a meeting 
				because we don't know what to prepare for.&nbsp; Time is further 
				wasted because people have to think on their feet as each new 
				topic for discussion comes up.</li>
				<li>The meetings will be different for everyone and some people 
				will have a better experience than others.</li>
				<li>It is impossible to have a general feedback summary of a 
				series of meetings because they all followed different tracks.</li>
				<li>Incoherence is almost guaranteed.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>One the other hand, agendas can be restrictive and people may 
			feel unable to raise issues that are important to them but not on 
			the agenda.&nbsp; That's a lost opportunity so an effective way 
			forward is to have an agenda with space for the participants to add 
			items.&nbsp; It may look something like this:</p>
			<table class="auto-style9" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style10" colspan="2">Progress revue 
					tutorials agenda (please see the timetable for these).</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>Assess progress on the course as a whole</td>

					<td>&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>6</td>
					<td>&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style10" colspan="2">Your name:</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Making sure that people assemble their thoughts before you meet 
			is also advisable so the invitation to a tutorial meeting should 
			include a task of some kind such as:</p>
			<p class="auto-style3"><em>The agenda for our tutorial meeting is 
			attached.<br />
			Before we meet, please consider:</em></p>
			<ol class="auto-style4">
				<li><em>On a scale of 1 to 9 (9 being the best), how do you rate 
				your progress so far?</em></li>
				<li><em>Can you think of three ways your teaching has improved 
				or will improve?</em></li>
				<li><em>What do you still need to work on?</em></li>
				<li><em>Where are you with the project?&nbsp; Are you on course 
				to complete it on time?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style5"><em>There is space on the agenda to add 
			issues you want to discuss but I would like to know about them in 
			advance so please get a completed copy of the agenda back to me in the morning 
			of the day before we are scheduled to meet.</em></p>
			<p class="auto-style6"><em>Thanks</em></p>
			<p>Tutorials are not just progress reviews, of course, and the 
			agenda and associated tasks may be radically different.&nbsp; Here's 
			an example of a pedagogically focused agenda and task for a seminar 
			with a group of three or so participants.&nbsp; The 
			assumption behind this is that all the trainees have read the same 
			text but you are getting them to focus only on sections of it for 
			presentation and discussion:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="tutorial" height="277" src="t-to-t_images/tutorial.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Because all the group have read the same text, you can be sure 
			that people's presentations will be understood but the evaluations 
			is where differences may arise.&nbsp; This allows for discussion and 
			consolidation of knowledge.&nbsp; That's what seminars are for, of 
			course.</p>
			<p>Other tutorials or group seminars may be forward looking rather than drawing on the 
			past and focused on activities completed before the meeting.<br />
			An agenda and task for this sort of meeting might look like this:</p>
			<p class="auto-style5"><em>Dear ..............</em></p>
			<p class="auto-style6"><em>For our meeting on .........., please 
			email me the following before the end of .......... and bring hard 
			copies with you:</em></p>
			<ol class="auto-style4">
				<li><em>Your list of aims and objectives.</em></li>
				<li><em>The procedural grid for the lesson</em></li>
				<li><em>The problems you anticipate may arise</em></li>
				<li><em>The assumptions you are making about the group's current 
				abilities</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="auto-style7"><em>Please also feel free to send me a list 
			of particular points you would like to cover or worries you may 
			have.</em></p>
			<p class="auto-style6"><em>Thanks</em></p>
			<p>This way, you can assess some of the work before the meeting and 
			be well prepared with sound advice and <span class="style_underline">
			<strong>constructive</strong></span> criticism.&nbsp; Trying to 
			respond to a set of documents like this off the cuff is usually a 
			recipe for failing to spot important issues and giving 
			ill-considered advice in nobody's interests.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Meeting time</h2>

			</table>
			<p>Before you meet, there are some issues to consider whether the 
			meeting is one-to-one or with a small group.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Formality</strong><br />
				<img alt="smart" height="133" src="../../images/style_smart200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>If you sit behind your desk in your workspace, you are 
				establishing the fact that this is formal and may include an 
				element of assessment.&nbsp; That may, of course, be the message 
				you want to send but it's as well to be aware of it.<br />
				If you sit around a table, sharing the space, you are signalling 
				that this is support, discussion and help.&nbsp; It may still be quite 
				formal, especially if the table is part of your workspace.&nbsp; 
				If the table 'belongs' to none of you, the situation is much 
				more equitable.<br />
				If you sit side by side in a one-to-one tutorial, you are in 
				danger of being too much of a chum and too little of a trainer.<br />
				This is an important issue because this parameter is set in 
				stone at the 
				beginning of any meeting.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Privacy</strong><br />
				<img alt="private" height="133" src="../../images/sign_private_a200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>It is rarely appropriate to meet in public spaces where you 
				may be overheard.&nbsp; Not only is it distracting, it may also 
				make people less willing to speak honestly and openly.<br />
				If facilities are limited in your institution, as they frequently 
				are, it is always possible to meet offsite (which means you have 
				to buy the coffee) where privacy is guaranteed.&nbsp; That 
				sometimes means you have to work a bit harder to maintain the 
				correct level of formality and seriousness.</dd>
				<dt><strong><a name="turn"></a>Turn taking</strong><br />
				<img alt="turns" height="133" src="../../images/board_game200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This clearly only seriously applies to meeting with more than one 
				trainee.&nbsp; If there are only two people involved, you need 
				to make sure that, while you remain in charge of the 
				interaction, you give trainees ample opportunity to say what 
				is important to them.<br />
				You are the trainer and will normally be in charge of turn 
				taking and there are three ways to invite a turn that you should 
				know about:<ol class="auto-style8">
					<li>Selection and constraint<br />
					As the chair, so to speak, of the meeting, you may select 
					the next person to speak and select what they should speak 
					about.<br />
					For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>What do you feel about 
					drilling, John?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's ask the person who did this in her last lesson how she 
					thought it worked.&nbsp; Mary?</em></span><br />
					In these cases, the next speaker has been constrained 
					in terms of the form of his or her turn by what you have 
					said.<br />
					Both the speaker is selected and the topic constrained.<br />
					Selection may also be achieved through gaze, i.e., selecting 
					the next to speak by making eye contact with them but is 
					usually better done by nomination if people are looking at 
					the floor.</li>
					<li>Constraint only<br />
					You may signal the end of a turn by constraining the form of 
					the next utterance but not selecting a speaker to perform 
					it.<br />
					For example,<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone 
					have anything to add about learning style theory?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone want to try defending this proposition?</em></span><br />
					This constrains the next utterance to the expression of 
					information or the expression of ignorance.</li>
					<li>Open-ended turn passing<br />
					You may do neither of the above and simply signal the fact 
					that you are inviting an unconstrained and unselected 
					contribution.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would 
					anyone like to raise any other points?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone have any questions about anything we've 
					discussed?</em></span><br />
					Beware, however, that this comes at an appropriate time 
					because it will often be greeted with an embarrassed 
					silence.</li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Equality</strong><br />
				<img alt="equal" height="133" src="../../images/equal_cups200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Nobody is under any illusions that most tutorials and 
				seminars are 
				equal-partnership events because, after all, you are being paid 
				to lead.&nbsp; It is not useful to try to suggest otherwise 
				because that is transparently untrue.<br />
				The difference, such as it is between group tutorials and 
				seminars is that the latter involve participants in discussion 
				of issues rather than being events in which you teach content.&nbsp; 
				The content should be known and the seminar acts to reinforce 
				and consolidate understanding.<br />
				Within that constraint, however, it is important to give 
				everyone space even if that leads to a bit of unfocused and (for 
				you) frustrating rambling.<br />
				People have different ways of making a point and one of those is 
				to circle around it considering peripheral matters before homing 
				in on the core idea.&nbsp; It's sometimes important to allow this 
				kind of dithery focusing.<br />
				In one-to-one tutorials it is even more useful to allow people 
				time to develop their thoughts and that they are prepared to do 
				so is one of the advantages of your having given them an agenda 
				and a task in good time before the meeting.<br />
				In group tutorials or seminars you simply have to use your already well 
				honed and practised skills in involving quieter people and 
				restraining the more voluble and confident.<br />
				Your leadership role makes that reasonably simple to do.</dd>

			</table>
			<p>Whatever kind of meeting you have had, but especially if it was a 
			one-to-one progress tutorial, it's important to have some kind of 
			record.&nbsp; This both values the event for the participants and gives 
			you and them a way of seeing if you agree about what was said and 
			what happened.<br />
			Moreover, the report you write is a simple way of preparing the 
			agenda for your next meeting especially if it is going to cover 
			similar ground.<br />
			In a short one-to-one tutorial, it's a comparatively simple matter 
			to make notes during the event and / or immediately afterwards from 
			which you can write a brief report.<br />
			Reports of seminars which are subject based do not have to be 
			elaborate and should simply say what happened and be flattering 
			about people's contributions where that's possible.&nbsp; It is 
			unlikely to be an assessed event.</p>
			<p>Reports of progress tutorials should be shared with the trainee 
			involved so there's an opportunity to put any assumptions right.&nbsp; 
			This will alert you to having got the wrong end of the stick 
			sometimes and allows the participant to have an equal say.</p>

			<p>Here you need to ask yourself a few questions to focus you on how 
			things went.&nbsp; The questions may vary depending on the nature of 
			the meeting but you are well enough experienced at 
			self-evaluation not to need much help in inventing better questions.<br />
			You might start with some generic ones:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Did I manage to provide all the information I wanted to get 
				across well enough?</li>
				<li>Was contribution reasonably equitable?</li>
				<li>Did people have something identifiable (and useful) to take 
				away?</li>
				<li>How will the outcomes of this event inform planning for the 
				next one?</li>
				<li>Have I got an agreed record of what happened?</li>
				<li>Was the agenda followed or will it need amending before I 
				use it again?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now think of a few more and make your notes.&nbsp; It takes 
			little time and has positive effects.</p>

			<p>Tutorials and small-group seminars form a part of nearly all

			because if they are part of the course, they should be integrated 
			into its content.</p>
			<p>If you are doing this course because you are preparing for
