			Unit 1</a> of this course considers what skills you need to transfer 
			from language teaching and what new ones you need to develop.&nbsp; 
			That unit also considers the range of roles that a trainer of 
			teachers needs to be able to assume at appropriate moments in the 
			training process.<br />
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u2_training_to_train_content.html" target="_blank">
			Unit 2</a> deals with planning the content of the course.<br />
			Here, however, we are concerned more with the nuts and bolts: 
			delivering what you have planned and using your skills.</p>

			</table>
			<p>
			Nothing that follows should be mysterious to a competent English 
			language teacher because the activities and tasks that are inserted 
			into teacher training programmes are rarely wholly new or unusual.&nbsp; 
			It is the mix, the content and the outcomes which change, of course, 
			because you are aiming at very different targets.<br />
			You cannot, usually, design a training session in the same way that 
			you design a language lesson and you will not be well advised to try 
			shoehorning teacher education into well known language lesson 
			structures such as Present-Practise-Produce or Test-Teach-Test.&nbsp; 
			Task-based learning structures are a different matter and may be 
			appropriate on all kinds of training programmes.&nbsp; There is, 
			naturally, a guide on this site to how such sessions may be planned 
			and conducted.<br />
			How you design a session structure is flexible but certain 
			commonalities with good language-lesson design persist.<br />
			In particular:</p>
			<ul class="darkgreenbullet">
				<li>Setting aims<br />
				<img alt="aim" height="133" src="../../images/aim_snooker200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Just like language learners, trainee teachers like to see what 
				the purposes of sessions are and what they are going to know or 
				be able to do by the need that they don't know now.&nbsp; 
				Setting clear aims and making them explicit allows people to 
				bring their own resources and knowledge to bear on the topic.&nbsp; 
				It is, after all, a session for them, not you.<br />
				This is not to say that you should apply a test-teach-test 
				pattern but to suggest that you set out some clear aims for each 
				session at the beginning and plan on the basis of identifying 
				what each stage or phase contributes to achieving your aims.</li>
				<li>Evidence of learning<br />
				<img alt="footprint" height="133" src="../../images/footprint200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Trainee teachers at whatever level need to know what they are 
				learning and how well they are learning it.<br />
				You need, therefore, to make sure that you assign time at the 
				end and after longer activities which have substantial content 
				to review and identify what has been learned and what it's for.</li>
				<li>Variety of activities<br />
				<img alt="variety" height="133" src="../../images/variety_hats200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Do not abandon your hard-won ability to know when to stop 
				activities, when to change tack, when to alter the pace and when 
				to give people space to think and consider.<br />
				Trainee teachers are no different from all other learners and 
				will become impatient with lock-step, single-paced sessions 
				quite quickly (usually after around 30 minutes, in fact).</li>
				<li>Variety of interaction patterns<br />
				<img alt="variety" height="133" src="../../images/variety_donuts200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				We'll consider the usefulness and possible drawbacks of group- 
				and pair-work shortly but any change of focus and interaction 
				pattern is often a welcome element in a training session, even 
				if it is quite brief.</li>
				<li>Learning curves<br />
				<img alt="curve" height="133" src="../../images/curve_learning200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Just as in a language lesson, we need to watch the steepness of 
				any learning curve and ensure that the level of challenge is 
				only slowly increased as sessions go on.&nbsp; You can no more 
				ask trainee teachers to do the hard things first than you can 
				expect learners of the language to get everything right at the 
				beginning.<br />
				We shall dwell below on levels of cognitive challenge and how to 
				recognise them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This unit is about considering what alternatives are available in 
			most training settings, not about telling you what to do.&nbsp; 
			After all, you are a teacher with considerable experience and you 
			can use your intuition and judgement to decide what sorts of 
			activity and interactions are suitable depending on the content and 
			challenge of the materials and information you are trying to 
			present.</p>
			<p>This is the longest unit in the course because it is so central 
			to making sure that your training actually works.&nbsp; It is also 
			the area that most concerns novice trainers (or should).</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0">
				<tr>

			<p>The following is not intended to evince a startled<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blimey.&nbsp; I'd 
			never thought of that!</em></span><br />
			from you but it may act as checklist for you when you are designing 
			a session so that you inject the right kind of variety, interaction 
			patterns and pace-changing events into your training sessions.<br />
			At the end, we'll consider how challenging these activities might 
			be.<br />
			Sessions on courses vary in length from less than an hour to a whole 
			day but as a rule of thumb, you should make sure that the focus, 
			interaction pattern, challenge and pace are changed at least twice 
			in each hour of training.<br />
			That way, trainees are kept on their toes, energy levels are not 
			allowed to drop (too much) and engagement is maintained for everyone 
			because we all have preferences concerning the kinds of learning 
			activities we find most useful.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Brainstorming</strong><br />
				<img alt="light" height="133" src="../../images/light_orange200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This is essentially an awareness and schema-activation activity 
				at initial training level because it is unlikely that novice 
				teachers will have very much to storm.<br />
				Experienced teachers, of course, are a different matter and a 
				brainstorming session is often a useful activity which can be 
				used to exchange ideas as well as reminding people of things 
				they have forgotten or neglected.&nbsp; Here are two examples, 
				one of each:<p class="indent">In groups of three, list and 
				prioritise in terms of usefulness the ways you think people can 
				be helped to remember vocabulary.<br />
				<br />
				In your groups, identify three things that teachers do in 
				classrooms which reflect a view that language learning is a 
				cognitive process involving the building and later amendment of 
				hypotheses about the language structure.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Buzz groups<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="buzz" height="133" src="../../images/buzz_group_cartoon200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This may be what is happening in the brainstorming session 
				so can be considered a subcategory of that.<br />
				The key with buzz groups is that the question should be simple 
				and the time allowed very restricted so people work fast and 
				generate ideas in an uncomplicated way.<br />
				Buzz groups can also be used as in-session mini-tests to see if 
				the participants can remember what they have just encountered.<br />
				Here are two examples (one easy, one more challenging):<p class="indent">
				You have five minutes to think of one synonym each for this list 
				of words:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>hide, repair, think, revolution, garden, elevator, 
				delicious, nasty, really, incredibly</em><br />
				<br />
				Now you know what assimilation and intrusion are, you have five 
				minutes to work out what is happening in and transcribe:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>ten pin bowling, bed clothes, she ate in, situation</em></p>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Case studies</strong><br />
				<img alt="case" height="133" src="../../images/case200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This is a group or whole cohort activity, usually the 
				former, in which a set of data is presented from which the 
				participants are charged to extract some principles or apply 
				some judgements.<br />
				It is an unusual activity on pre-service courses or courses for 
				inexperienced teachers because it demands high levels of 
				experience to analyse a case effectively.&nbsp; An example might 
				be:<p class="indent">This is a transcript of 5 minutes of 
				classroom interactions.<br />
				What correction strategies is the teacher using and how 
				effective are they?</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Cross-over grouping</strong><br />
				<img alt="crossing" height="133" src="../../images/crossing_road200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>When a group is divided into four for an activity which has a 
				definable product what people will produce is not always fully 
				predictable.&nbsp; Groups A, B, C and D work independently and 
				then one member moves to another group, presents the findings of 
				the original group and then listens to what the new group has 
				produced.&nbsp; When that is done, a different member of each 
				group moves on to another group and the process repeats.<br />
				In this way the products of all groups are made available to 
				everyone without the intervention of the trainer.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Feedback sessions<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="feedback" height="133" src="../../images/feedback_board200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>These come in a number of guises and may be conducted in a 
				variety of ways.&nbsp; It's a good opportunity even on 
				in-service courses for some loop input to demonstrate different 
				ways of giving and getting feedback.&nbsp; For example:<p class="indent">
				After an activity, one member of each group is given the correct 
				answers and must transmit them to the other members without 
				showing them anything.<br />
				<br />
				Feedback is given to the whole group and you by one elected participant 
				from each group for each section of the 
				task.<br />
				<br />
				The suggested answer is projected and the individuals mark each 
				other's answers before giving mutual feedback.<br />
				<br />
				Groups present their findings to other groups in the form of 
				short presentations or mini-lectures (see below).</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Lectures</strong><br />
				<img alt="lecture" height="133" src="../../images/woman_lecturing200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>There is a section below devoted to training for lecturing 
				because it is a skill you may never have actively acquired.&nbsp; 
				It is not a skill you often need as a language teacher, indeed, 
				using it is often disparaged in the language classroom, but it 
				is certainly one you'll need to use as a trainer.<br />
				For now, we can divide lectures into:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>Formal lectures<br />
					are quite rare on most teacher training courses although 
					they occur when groups are large or an invited expert has 
					been asked to talk to the group.<br />
					In such events, interruptions are not welcomed but there is 
					usually time for questions at the end.</li>
					<li>Informal lectures<br />
					are less structured and interruptions 
					for clarification, repetition, questions and so on are 
					welcome.</li>
					<li>Gapped lectures<br />
					are longer events punctuated by 
					one of the other alternatives in this list.&nbsp; There may 
					be opportunity within the lecture for some group work, a 
					test, a series of buzz groups or whatever before the thread is again taken up and the 
					lecture continues.</li>
					<li>Mini-lectures<br />
					are a frequent phenomenon on all types of 
					courses and consist of 5- or 10-minute explanations of an 
					issue or an idea.&nbsp; They are often preceded and followed 
					by associated tasks.</li>
					<li>Participant mini-lectures<br />
					are often a motivating and 
					welcome way of getting feedback from activities.&nbsp; A 
					group or its representative presents the findings of a task 
					to the rest of the trainees.</li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Group work</strong><br />
				<img alt="group" height="133" src="../../images/people_group_a200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Group work is a mainstay of almost all training courses (and 
				language teaching, too, of course).&nbsp; It is so central to 
				all courses, that we will discuss its advantages and 
				disadvantages a little more later on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Projects, Task-Based Learning and Problem-Based 
				Learning<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="working" height="133" src="../../images/working_group_above200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>As an experienced and professional language teacher, of 
				course, you know a good deal about how to run projects and 
				Task-Based Learning lessons (or series of lessons).&nbsp; You 
				may be less familiar with Problem-Based Learning which is an 
				approach developed some years ago in the training of doctors and 
				other medical staff which has since developed into other forms 
				of professional training in the sciences and more recently, the 
				humanities, too.<br />
				The essence for our purposes is that the advantages of such an 
				approach include<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>training in collaborative working with colleagues</li>
					<li>the enhancement of presentation skills</li>
					<li>the development of autonomy in researching language and 
					language teaching</li>
					<li>the fact that it can be based on real-world problems and 
					issues that are relevant to teacher trainers</li>
					<li>the recognition that knowledge can be acquired more 
					easily and effectively than it can be transmitted</li>
				</ol>
				and are all applicable to the training of teachers.<br />
				An example of a Problem-based task is:<p class="indent">The 
				selection of a first- or second-conditional form by a speaker is 
				dependent on the speaker's perception of the likelihood of an 
				event or state transpiring so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I win the lottery, I'll ..</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I won the lottery, I'd ...</em><br />
				are only distinguishable by speaker perception of the likelihood 
				of winning.<br />
				Problem: how do we design a lesson so that speaker perception is 
				made clear and practice of the forms is authentic?<br />
				Supplementary problem:<br />
				The same considerations apply to the selection of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She must've got lost</em><br />
				over<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She might / could've got lost</em><br />
				Can we carry of the same principle from the solution to the 
				first problem to ensure that practice of these forms is 
				authentic?</p>
				For more on this, see
				<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="../../inservice/methodology/tbl.html" target="_blank">
				the guide to Task-Based Learning</a> on this site (new tab) 
				which also includes brief consideration of Problem-Based 
				Learning.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Guided reading<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="reading" height="133" src="../../images/reading_interested200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Guided reading in which course participants are given a text 
				to read and some tasks to accomplish as they read are frequently 
				assigned to individuals outside the course times either as a 
				follow up or in preparation for a taught session.<br />
				That need not be the case because, as a respite from continual 
				talk and chatter, it can be refreshing for people to be asked to 
				read a text in class for 10 minutes or so on then to discuss 
				what they have understood from it, either in groups or in a 
				plenary session.<br />
				Just as texts are frequently handled in the language classroom, 
				the key term here is <strong>guided</strong>.&nbsp; People have 
				to read for a reason so you need to look at the text you are 
				using, identify the most important ideas and invent a task which 
				elicits them.<br />
				Feedback needs to be thorough because the task is part of the 
				session input and may be a key part of it.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Jigsaw activities</strong><br />
				<img alt="jigsaw" height="133" src="../../images/jigsaw_dna200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>These are familiar from the language classroom where they 
				constitute a simulated communicative activity but often 
				neglected in a training setting.<br />
				Giving people partial information in groups and then requiring 
				them to come together (or by using cross-over grouping) to pool 
				their data is often an effective and participant-focused way of 
				introducing complex ideas or competing theories.<br />
				This activity is, of course, an ideal opportunity for a bit of 
				loop input if the participants are unfamiliar with jigsaw 
				activities.&nbsp; Here's an example of a task:<p class="indent">Group 1 
				gets the speaking side of this table and Group 2 gets the 
				writing side:<br />
				<img alt="task 1" height="358" src="../../imagesgraphics/speakwritetaskans.png" width="700" /><br />
				The 
				task is:<br />
				Explain to your partners what you understand by each row in your 
				table and see if you can find a match in your opposite number's 
				table for yours.</p>
				In theory, the groups should both end up with a good 
				understanding of the differences because they have had to engage 
				with the materials and explain the content to others.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Peer teaching</strong><br />
				<img alt="teaching" height="133" src="../../images/teaching_child_point200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This is a common way of getting pre-service trainees to 
				experiment with approaches in safety without causing too much 
				havoc in real learner groups.<br />
				Once the initial embarrassment has worn off, it can be an 
				effective and useful procedure which takes the focus off the 
				trainer.<br />
				At all levels, this can be extended to areas of language 
				analysis in which members of the group explain tricky structures 
				or relationships to others.<br />
				You are never sure if you have fully understood something until 
				you are called upon to explain it to someone else.<br />
				Peer teaching can be a way of covering many disparate areas on a 
				course when time is short because members of the group are doing 
				the research and teaching for you.<br />
				Here are two examples:<p class="indent">A learner (sitting next 
				to you) has just said: <em>Good.&nbsp; John came.&nbsp; Now 
				we can start the game.</em><br />
				Explain clearly with two examples what the error is and get the 
				learner to amend what has been said correctly.<br />
				<br />
				Research the phenomenon of transferred negation, adjective 
				marking, combining forms (etc.) and be prepared to teach your 
				colleagues in groups of three for 10 minutes in the next 
				session.<br />
				(Any more advanced area of grammar, pronunciation or functional 
				meaning can be the focus.)</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Pyramid or snowball grouping</strong><br />
				<img alt="snowball" height="133" src="../../images/snowball_wall200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This can be hard to arrange, although somewhat easier 
				online, and consists of pairs working together on a task or part 
				of a task, coming together to make groups of four and sharing 
				ideas, then combining into groups of eight and continuing until 
				the final group is the whole cohort of participants who will by 
				now have garnered ideas from everyone so feedback can be 
				curtailed.<br />
				You need to monitor this activity carefully to make sure that 
				the target data have, in fact, been identified by the group at 
				the end.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Role play</strong><br />
				<img alt="roles" height="133" src="../../images/roleplay_a200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This can make a pleasing change of interaction and activity 
				type although its utility is often limited.&nbsp; Here's an 
				example:<p class="indent">A: You are a learner of English (at 
				intermediate level) who is unhappy with your progress.&nbsp; You 
				don't believe that what you do in class is helping you.&nbsp; 
				Start by explaining the problem.<br />
				B: You are the teacher and feel that this learner has 
				unrealistic ideas for the progress he/she should be making and 
				is too often sidetracked by trying to use language far about the 
				level.<br />
				Now get together and play out the scene.<br />
				Participant C: Your job is to listen and take notes and decide 
				whether the teacher has managed to explain the issue clearly 
				enough.</p>

				<dt><strong>Self-help groups</strong><br />
				<img alt="help" height="133" src="../../images/helping_up200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>These are a useful adjunct to training courses but setting 
				them up and maintaining momentum can be a challenge.&nbsp; They 
				work best if there is an agenda rather than just an amorphous 
				admonition to help others.<br />
				Such groups need to be constructed with a little care to make 
				sure that the levels of knowledge and experience are either:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As homogenous as possible so that people are not intimidated 
				by more experienced members of the group<br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mixed as possible so that the more experienced can help 
				the less experienced<br />
				and both types have their uses.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Narratives<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="red riding" height="133" src="../../images/woman_red_riding200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Narratives are rarely used on teacher training courses, 
				although they are often a large part of English language 
				teaching lessons.&nbsp; They can be used occasionally for 
				specific ideas, however, and often make a refreshing and 
				engaging change from other trainer-led activities.<br />
				Here are two examples:<p class="indent">
				Now I'm going to tell you a story of a lesson I taught recently.&nbsp; 
				Please listen to it and, as I go along, I will pause 
				occasionally for you to make notes about what went wrong and why 
				it went so badly wrong.&nbsp; OK?&nbsp; Now, ...<br />
				<br />
				I was in a school recently and was wandering around the 
				classrooms, listening, as you do, to what was going on.&nbsp; As 
				I tell you the story, write down what theories of learning and 
				language the teachers I overheard were working from.&nbsp; OK?<br />
				Now, in the first room with the blue door, I heard all the 
				students chanting irregular verbs with the teacher stopping them 
				to model the pronunciation and form when they got it wrong.<br />
				In the next room with the pink door, all the students were 
				sitting round a large table with the teacher.&nbsp; There were 
				no books and no equipment was being used.&nbsp; One student was 
				talking about a terrible journey to work one day and the teacher 
				was saying nothing.&nbsp; The other students were listening and 
				occasionally reacting and asking questions.<br />
				In the last room with the yellow door, all the students were 
				working on designing a new school and trying to figure where 
				everything should go from the kitchen to the classrooms to the 
				toilets and the offices.&nbsp; They had large pieces of paper 
				and were drawing up plans, discarding them and drawing new ones.&nbsp; 
				The teacher was wandering from group to group, staying a while 
				with each and supplying small amounts of language help and 
				advice.<br />
				And so on.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Seminars</strong><br />
				<img alt="seminar" height="133" src="../../images/teaching_seminar200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Seminars differ from simple training sessions insofar as all 
				members of the group (which may be all the participants on a 
				small course) are charged with preparing something to present to 
				you and the other participants.&nbsp; This may be the same task 
				for everyone (and that is often the easiest to handle) or 
				different tasks.<br />
				Seminars are not usually very helpful on pre-service courses 
				because people simply do not yet have the resources to do the 
				research.<br />
				Here's an example of a task for in-service training:<p class="indent">
				Read the attached summary of theories of second-language 
				acquisition and be prepared to argue for the one(s) you believe 
				that, in your experience, are the most likely explanations for 
				the processes of learning an additional language.<br />
				Present anecdotal or case-study evidence of your own to back up 
				what you say.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong><a name="socratic"></a>Socratic questioning</strong><br />
				<img alt="socrates" height="133" src="../../images/socrates200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>In the language classroom, this is often simply called 
				elicitation but there's a bit more to it than that.<br />
				It involves leading people to the truth by a system of question &rarr;
				answer → objection → new question → refined answer → objection → 
				question etc.<br />
				It takes a bit of practice and a certain amount of 
				self-confidence but can be revealing and effective.&nbsp; Here's 
				a short example of the beginnings of one at pre-service level:<p class="indent">
				OK.&nbsp; Now Mary, so far in this session, what constitutes the 
				subject of a clause?<br />
				It's the noun which does the action of the verb.<br />
				OK, but in, <em>The whole class complained this morning</em>, 
				what noun is the subject?<br />
				Class.<br />
				No, that can't be right.&nbsp; What about the words <em>the</em> 
				and <em>whole</em>?<br />
				Oh, I see, the subject is <em>the whole class</em>.<br />
				Yes, but it's not a simple noun so what is it?<br />
				It's a noun phrase.<br />
				Good.&nbsp; Now take this sentence: <em>How John drove 
				frightened me</em>.&nbsp; What's the subject of the verb <em>
				frightened</em>?<br />
				Ah, it must be ...<br />
				and so on.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Tutorials</strong><br />
				<img alt="talk" height="133" src="../../images/talk_informal200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>On many teacher-training courses tutorials are one-to-one 
				events typically held after teaching practice to get and give 
				feedback to the trainee.&nbsp; They may take the form of 
				seminars with participants tasked to present something they have 
				learned about (see above).<br />
				<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u5_training_to_train_tutorials.html">Unit 
				</a><a href="u6_training_to_train_observe_assess.html">
				<span class="auto-style72">5</span></a> of this course covers this area in some depth so no more 
				will be said here.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Workshops</strong><br />
				<img alt="working" height="133" src="../../images/working_group_above200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Workshop sessions are meat and drink to teacher training 
				courses and often form the basis for a session.&nbsp; It is, 
				however, a fact that workshops can be overdone and group work in 
				particular can often be unproductive unless a good deal of 
				thought goes in to the tasks and the participants are alerted to 
				what comes out of them (or should).<br />
				At pre-service levels, workshop tasks can only succeed if you 
				inject the data because, by definition, such groups do not have 
				the data on which to work.&nbsp; In-service courses are a 
				different matter.</dd>

			<p>Group and pair work (which is more or less the same thing but 
			with the minimum group size) is such a mainstay of language teaching 
			that it is carried over without criticism into language teacher 
			training, often with somewhat mixed results.<br />
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="u1_training_to_train_being.html">Unit 1</a> of this course considers at some length the differences 
			between teaching a language and training language teachers and in part of 
			that it was suggested that the targets are different insofar as 
			language teaching involves developing a skill in the learners and 
			allowing them to acquire some competence in using a foreign language 
			but that much of teacher training involves the transmission of data 
			rather than the acquisition of unconscious skill using.<br />
			The outcome of good language training is that the learner is able to 
			apply the language skills unthinkingly and focus on the message not 
			the medium.<br />
			It could be argued that unconscious skill using rather than 
			understanding and deliberate application of knowledge is the outcome 
			of poor, not good, teacher training.<br />
			We <strong><span class="style_underline">want</span></strong> 
			teachers to think about what they are doing and why they are doing 
			it.</p>
			<p>Group work, then, while an effective procedure in a language 
			classroom to make the learned automatic (in other words, to cross 
			the line between input and intake) may not be as effective when the 
			data that teachers need to assimilate are not available within the 
			group.&nbsp; If they were, there would be a lot less need for well 
			educated and informed teacher trainers like you.</p>
			<p>We need accordingly to be a little sceptical of claims that group 
			work is always a good thing or that it is somehow superior to being 
			told things or being led individually through reading, questioning 
			and old-fashioned thinking to the conclusions which seem to lead to 
			effective and workable teaching solutions.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Group work is a very flexible way to organise learning because it 
			can be used for:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Seminars and tutorials<br />
				In which you as the trainer can focus on issues of importance to 
				individuals or small groups of individuals.&nbsp; These sessions 
				can have strict or loose structures and be closely aligned to 
				the needs of the people concerned.</li>
				<li>Inter-group activities<br />
				can be used for carrying out and 
				getting feedback from:<ul class="greenroundbullet">
					<li>buzz groups</li>
					<li>workshop tasks</li>
					<li>brainstorming activities</li>
					<li>reading activities<br />
					and more</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Workshop tasks<br />
				can be done in groups where you can more easily monitor what 
				people are doing, whether they are on task, what help they need, 
				what feedback you should be prepared to give at the end and so 
				on.</li>
				<li>Feedback<br />
				can be efficiently taken from and given to groups 
				because one person can be nominated to supply a range of views 
				and insights.&nbsp; On larger courses, in particular, this can 
				save a considerable amount of time and short-cut the tedious 
				going-round-the-class routine.<br />
				Participants, too, often find group feedback a less threatening 
				and sometimes a more empowering procedure.</li>
				<li>Understanding<br />
				We noted above that you don't know you have understood something 
				or thought it through until you try to explain it to someone 
				else.&nbsp; Group work is, of course, the ideal vehicle for this 
				kind of self-discovery to take place in an unthreatening, 
				environment in which only one's peers are judging the product.</li>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Not all group work is a good thing and there are issues to 
			consider and problems to avoid or at least ameliorate.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Time and expense<br />
				Group, pair and one-to-one tutorials mean that the tutor's time 
				is being spent on, usually, a minority of the group as a whole.&nbsp; 
				This is expensive in terms of time allocation and requires more 
				preparation on the trainer's behalf.<br />
				We can get around this problem to some extent because, as we 
				have seen, not all activities and session tasks need the hands-on 
				presence of the trainer.<br />
				Other subgroups, away from the trainer can get on with some 
				tasks successfully while the trainer's time is devoted to only 
				part of the whole group.</li>
				<li>Input<br />
				Trainees, especially on pre-service or initial training courses 
				may simply not have any data worth imparting to other members of 
				a group and this may also be true of in-service courses.<br />
				The complaint from trainees is that when they are working in 
				groups they are simply pooling their ignorance rather than 
				sharing insights and knowledge.<br />
				To reduce the impact of this sort of problem it is worth 
				considering exactly what the task is that the group are being 
				asked to carry out.&nbsp; Group work is, in other words, a good 
				place to discuss and clarify one's thoughts on an issue but a 
				bad place to learn anything really new.<br />
				Clarification and consolidation in groups should, therefore, 
				follow some real input either from you or from the materials and 
				texts you use.</li>
				<li>Interpersonal failures<br />
				Some groups simply don't 'work' and there are two main possible 
				reasons for that:<ol class="greenroundbullet">
					<li>an imbalance of knowledge or experience may mean that 
					some members of the group feel under challenged because they 
					are operating with people less knowledgeable or less 
					experienced while others may feel uncomfortable because they 
					recognise the imbalance and know they have little to 
					contribute.<br />
					Organising people into groups is more than an exercise in 
					class management, it is also an exercise in social 
					psychology.&nbsp; As far as possible, tasks should fall into 
					people's zones of proximal development (to which there is a 
					guide on this site if you care to learn more).&nbsp; Too 
					easy and the trainees become bored and frustrated; too 
					difficult and anxiety and frustration set in.</li>
					<li>an imbalance of personality types may result in some 
					group members or sometimes only one member dominating 
					discussion and making the aims unachievable.&nbsp; That is 
					worth some thought.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So, no, group work is not always the most effective way of 
			delivering a course and rarely the best way to deliver its content.</p>

					<h2>Lecturing skills</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>To use a little deliberate recycling (a skill you already have 
			and one to think about when training), we saw above that lectures 
			can be divided into five types like this:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>Formal lectures<br />
					are quite rare on most teacher training courses although 
					they occur when groups are large or an invited expert has 
					been asked to talk to the group.<br />
					In such events, interruptions are not welcomed but there is 
					usually time for questions at the end.</li>
					<li>Informal lectures are less structured and interruptions 
					for clarification, repetition, questions and so on are 
					welcome.</li>
					<li>Gapped lectures are longer events usually punctuated by 
					one of the other alternatives in this list.&nbsp; There may 
					be opportunity within the lecture for some group work, a 
					test or whatever before the thread is again taken up and the 
					lecture continues.</li>
					<li>Mini-lectures are a frequent phenomenon on all types of 
					courses and consist of 5- or 10-minute explanations of an 
					issue or an idea.&nbsp; They are often preceded and followed 
					by associated tasks.</li>
					<li>Participant mini-lectures are often a motivating and 
					welcome way of getting feedback from activities.&nbsp; A 
					group or its representative presents the findings of a task 
					to the rest of the group.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The last of these does not concern us but the skills you need 
				to develop are common to the first four.&nbsp; In particular, it 
				is likely that you will need to use b., c. or d. above quite 
				frequently and you need to prepare for that.&nbsp; The skills 
				you need consist of:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Signposting</strong><br />
				<img alt="sign" height="133" src="../../images/sign_information200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Good lecturers and seminar leaders use explicit signposting to 
				keep people informed and let people know what is coming next.&nbsp; 
				Poor ones don't, unfortunately, as you may have discovered on 
				your own educational journey.<br />
				Good signposting allows trainees to take good notes and good 
				notes lead to good learning.<br />
				There are some obvious ways that you as a lecturer can use signposting 
				and they perform a range of important functions:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>Introducing the topic.<br />
					This can be done in many ways and they are mostly quite 
					explicit.&nbsp; A few common ones you should consider using are:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain the 
					relationship between mood and modality like this ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we start to design a task we are going to look at 
					...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, I want to address ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Outlining the structure<br />
					This can be done by saying, for example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three main 
					ideas.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first area we have to consider is ... and then I'll 
					get on to ... and ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Introducing discrete sections.<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to begin by 
					considering ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, ...</em></span><br />
					etc.<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we can move on to ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Signalling transitions<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK.&nbsp; Now let's move on to 
					consider ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have considered this in some detail so now we can ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we need to look at the implications of ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Summing up<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK.&nbsp; Now let me recap the 
					important points.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, we can see that ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary / conclusion, ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three main takeaway points are ...</em></span></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Identifying major ideas and distinguishing them from 
				supporting ideas, examples and hypotheses</strong><br />
				<img alt="finger" height="133" src="../../images/finger_theme_rheme200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				You need to develop the skill of using linguistic clues to help 
				the trainees to listen out for what is really important, ignore 
				irrelevance or detail available elsewhere and take / make good 
				notes.&nbsp; The ways to do this include:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>Helping people to identify the core ideas.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
					session concerns ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main point I want to stress is ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two competing theories ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of this session we will be able to see that ...</em></span><br />
					What follows signals like these will often be used as the 
					basis for note-making subheadings and headings (by well 
					trained participants).</li>
					<li>Explicit signalling of subsidiary points.&nbsp; For 
					example:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may 
					like to know that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incidentally ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A less important factor is ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not concerned today with ...</em></span><br />
					What follows comments like these can safely be left out of 
					the trainees' notes altogether so you may like to ask 
					yourself why you are including them.</li>
					<li>Signalling exemplification.&nbsp; For example (!):<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
					example, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another instance of this is ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another case in point might be ...</em></span></li>
					<li>Using prosodic features to signal important information<br />
					Participants can use these signals to make headings and 
					subheadings in notes.&nbsp; These features include:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stress on particular words: and <span class="style_underline">
					<strong><em>THAT</em></strong></span> is what causes the ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rising intonation across a clause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; higher key on <span class="style_underline"> <sup><strong>
					<em>critical terms</em></strong></sup></span></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Identifying relationships between ideas</strong><br />
				<img alt="relate" height="133" src="../../images/related200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				It is important that that trainees can recognise your intentions 
				concerning the existence and the direction of causality and 
				restrictions on the truth of statements.&nbsp; Here's how:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>subordinating conjunctions<ol class="greenroundbullet">
						<li>condition and concession signals: <em>if, providing, 
					unless, but for, assuming</em> etc.<br />For example:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are teaching very low level learners ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for pre-teaching phase ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming the test is reliable ...</em><br />etc.</li>
						<li>causal connectors: <em>because, as, since, so (that). in 
					order for/to/that</em> etc.<br /><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This happens because ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that learners can ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order for this to be successful ...</em></span><br />etc.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>lexical devices of two types<ol class="greenroundbullet">
						<li>verbal processes such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This allows learners to ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results of your reading and research will lead to ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This error is caused by ...</em></li>
						<li>nominalisation such as:<br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The root cause was ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result of all these conflicting factors was ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The origins of the method lie in ...</em></span><br />etc.<br />
						This sort of nominalisation is sometimes called 
						shell-noun selection because words like <em>cause, 
						problem, origin</em> etc. may be used to encapsulate a 
						set of propositions and ideas and make referencing 
						easier.&nbsp; There is, naturally, a guide to shell 
						nouns elsewhere on this site.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Identifying transitions</strong><br />
				<img alt="crossing" height="133" src="../../images/crossing_street200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Few longer lectures focus on a single topic and, even when they 
				do, there are usually sub-topics contained within the whole. You 
				need to help people to recognise the point at which the topic is 
				changing because that allows them to follow and make / take 
				orderly notes.<br />
				You can do this by using:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>adjuncts:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in practice, the situation has can be described as ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of learner training in listening skills we can ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to now, we have considered ... but we also need to think 
					about ...</em></span></li>
					<li>attitudinal or content disjuncts which signal the 
					speaker's view of the likely truth of a proposition allow listeners to see that you 
					are moving on:<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Obviously</strong>, the next step is to ...<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					And that, <strong>of course</strong>, has implications such as ...</em></span></li>
					<li>conjuncts, used carefully, allow you to:<ol class="greenroundbullet">
						<li>enumerate:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we come to the question of ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step three is ....</em></li>
						<li>rephrase (to signal that the topic is not changing):<br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put another way ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better put, perhaps, ....</em></span></li>
						<li>show results:<br /><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, ....</em></span></li>
						<li>recap (to signal that the topic is not changing)<br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sum up, ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, overall, the situation is ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conclude this section then ...</em></span></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Later in this unit, we will look in a bit of detail at how to 
			incorporate elements of this long list into the planning and 
			delivery of a training session.</p>

			</table>
			<p>When planning input sessions and mixing in tasks with 
			mini-lectures, buzz groups and role plays and so on, it is worth 
			taking a small step back and considering the level of cognitive 
			challenge that you are placing on your trainees.&nbsp; If you begin 
			a session with very challenging activities, you may find that people 
			become tired before they have had a chance to learn anything.&nbsp; 
			On the other hand, it is a good idea to insert more challenging 
			tasks into the times when people are already refreshed, after a 
			break, say, or when energy levels have risen because of a change in 
			interaction patterns.</p>
			<p>For this section, we are going to work from a revision of Bloom's 
			taxonomy of educational objectives.<br />
			There is a guide on this site which will provide you with more 
			detail and the references that it will be worth your while following 
			when you set about the task of planning sessions.<br />
			<a class="trainingtotrainhighlightlink" href="../../inservice/background/bloom.html" target="_blank">
			Click here to open it in a new tab</a>.</p>
			<p>It looks like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="bloom" height="341" src="t-to-t_images/bloom.png" width="200" /></p>
			<p>What it all means is that the cognitive challenge represented by 
			tasks increases from the bottom up.<br />
			This is a strict hierarchical system in the views of some 
			proponents.&nbsp;
			In other words, each level feeds into the next so trainees 
			need to remember something before they can understand it, understand 
			it before they can apply it, apply it before they can analyse it and 
			analyse it before they can evaluate it.<br />
			At the highest level of create, your trainees must have remembered, 
			understood, applied, analysed, and evaluated something before they 
			can create anything new.<br />
			Others are more flexible in their approach and suggest that one can, 
			for example, analyse what has been read or heard without necessarily 
			having already applied it.&nbsp; It is also possible, of course, to 
			evaluate something one has not yet applied but impossible to do so 
			with something one has not remembered or understood and very 
			difficult to do so with something one has not analysed.</p>
			<p>For a bit more on each level, we'll extract the relevant parts of 
			the guide on this site and make adjustments because we are talking 
			about training adults in a specific skill (teaching a language).</p>

				<img alt="forget" height="133" src="../../images/forget200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Rather obviously, this concerns the ability to retrieve 
				relevant knowledge in order to be able to apply other cognitive 
				processes.<br />
				It is not possible, for example, to set about classifying 
				methodologies by the theories of mind and learning which 
				underlie them, if you can't remember what the methodologies are 
				about.<br />
				Equally, it is difficult to see how the tense and aspect 
				structure of English operates unless you can at least remember 
				terms such as progressive, continuous, iterative, habitual, 
				prospective and so on and have some idea what the words mean.<br />
				The first and easiest sort of task in a training session should, 
				therefore be one which reminds people of basic terminology and 
				meanings.<br />
				Buzz groups, matching tasks, card games and more are simple 
				vehicles for this kind of cognitive simplicity.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Understand</strong><br />
				<img alt="aha" height="133" src="../../images/aha200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Understanding requires more than simple recall of salient 
				features.<br />
				For example, you may know that English uses a certain verb form 
				to signal an iterative aspect or changes the word ordering in a 
				predictable way when making a passive structure so you are able 
				to answer questions concerning what it does.<br />
				However, to demonstrate understanding, you need to respond 
				adequately to questions which are aimed how this is done and, 
				most critically, why.<br />
				At initial or pre-service training level, it may be enough to be 
				able to say how a passive is formed or what a causative verb is 
				but without some concept of marking word order and structure, 
				the information is only half absorbed.&nbsp; At more advanced 
				levels, people need to consider how this happens and why a 
				speaker or writer may choose, say, a cleft sentence over a simple 
				one or front an adverbial for effect.<br />
				Methodologically, trainees may remember terms such as <em>
				inductive vs. deductive learning, noticing, inferring</em> and 
				so on but until they have tried to explain it to someone else, 
				we can't be sure that the ideas are understood not just 
				remembered.&nbsp; Sometimes, a bit of Socratic questioning (see 
				above) is a good way to check.<br />
				On training courses, to repeat, understanding has to be checked.&nbsp; 
				How you do it is up to you but buzz groups and short tasks to do 
				in pairs or as a pyramid procedure are other common choices.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Apply</strong><br />
				<img alt="paint" height="133" src="../../images/paint_coat200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Remembering and understanding are not enough.&nbsp; The next step is to 
			apply knowledge to the classroom.<br />
				At pre-service levels it may be adequate preparation for the 
				classroom, for example, to be able to recognise affixes which 
				form nouns is part of factual knowledge, understanding how nouns 
				work to make meaning in combination with verbs and other word 
				classes involves some understanding of the phenomenon but 
				inferring meaning from a text by the recognition of how noun 
				phrases are modified and act as the subjects and objects of 
				verbs requires the application of knowledge and understanding 
				for a communicative end.<br />
				Equally, it may be enough to remember and understand how English 
				deals with modal concepts such as obligation, necessity, 
				advisability, possibility and so on but at higher levels much 
				more is needed so that people can deal coherently with a 
				complicated area and make it accessible for their learners.&nbsp; 
				That almost certainly means applying concepts in the classroom 
				which make sense to learners and to do that, you need some 
				better categorisation than course books usually offer.<br />
				The ability to remember what the key subskills of 
				reading are and understanding how they are used is a 
				good beginning but applying the concepts in the classroom 
				requires good planning and practice.<br />
				A group workshop task, for example, to design a teaching 
				sequence for a given text is one way to encourage the ability to 
				apply recall and understanding.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Analyse</strong><br />
				<img alt="analyse" height="133" src="../../images/analyse_microscope200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>At all levels of training, it should be 
				possible for participants to break down the syntax of English 
				into component phrases so a sentence such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man told John that the house was for sale</em><br />
				is not difficult to remember, understand and apply as a model in 
				the classroom.<br />
				It is another step to understanding that a sentence such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old woman in the corner of the bar deliberately told Mary 
			and her friends that the concert had been cancelled</em><br />
				follows exactly the same pattern with the same phrasal 
				components.<br />
				It is rarely enough too, to take a familiar example, to be able 
				to recognise an error, recall what sort it is and apply some 
				correction techniques.&nbsp; Analysis, however, involves more 
				cognitive challenge in figuring out why the error occurred, and 
				how to prevent its recurrence.<br />
				Similar considerations apply to skills analysis and the ability 
				to break down a skill into component subskills is obviously 
				important.&nbsp; This means that people get away from loosely 
				suggesting that they want to <em>practise reading</em> and so on 
				and are more precise about exactly what micro-skill they are 
				hoping to teach, develop, practice or raise people's awareness 
				of.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Evaluate</strong><br />
				<img alt="evaluate" height="133" src="../../images/thumbs_up_down200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This is a key teaching skill at all levels of training and 
				needs to form a core component of all courses.<br />
				The ability to recognise what went well in a lesson, what needs 
				improvement and so on is a key one but the ability to
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>evaluate</strong></span> 
				the process is even more useful because it leads to improvement, 
				rather than regret.<br />
				Trainees need help and practice to do this well and need to 
				use evaluation skills consistently with regard to their own, and 
				sometimes to other's, teaching performance.<br />
				It is also, of course something that trainers need to do even 
				better.<br />
				This high-level skill applies in training sessions especially 
				when considering a case-study task (see above) or when you are 
				asking people to evaluate materials and procedures.&nbsp; 
				Because evaluation depends on the four lower-level skills, 
				remembering, understanding, applying and analysing, tasks which 
				demand it have to be left until later in sessions or evaluation 
				will fail for lack of knowledge.<br />
				To evaluate something intelligently people need to work from 
				explicit criteria so they aren't just stabbing in the dark or 
				being too impressionistic.&nbsp; It is, therefore, probably not 
				worthwhile just asking, for example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think 
				this is a useful listening text and exercise?</em></span><br />
				but asking instead, something like:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now apply the 
				four criteria we have developed to evaluate listening tasks to 
				this text.</em></span></dd>
				<dt><strong>Create</strong><br />
				<img alt="painter" height="133" src="../../images/painter_landscape200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>This is the most demanding cognitive task because it requires people 
			to deploy all the lower-level skills to make something new.<br />
				Asking a novice teacher, for example, to plan and execute a 
				lesson from scratch is likely to result in frustrating failure 
				because the task does not recognise that the lower-level 
				cognitive skills need to be worked on before something new can 
				be created.&nbsp; It's a little like asking a beginner pianist 
				to write a concerto.<br />
				That is why you do not ask pre-intermediate, A1 learners to 
				write essays about climate change.<br />
				In 
			language teaching, this may involve the combination of language 
			recall, understanding of words and structures, application of 
			language patterns and communicative strategies, analysis of data and 
			the evaluation of the quality and usefulness of the utterances of 
			others.&nbsp; It often requires a synthesis of all those skills.<br />
				In teacher training, the object is to start with the recall of 
				procedural options, an understanding of what they are, the 
				ability to apply them in the classroom, analyse and evaluate 
				their success and then create a fully coherent teaching and 
				learning event&nbsp;
			It is not something to be taken lightly or asked of people without 
			providing a great deal of preparation.</dd>

			<p>Here's a summary:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="outline bloom" height="368" src="../../imagesgraphics/bloom_outline.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>In the guide, too, there is a list of verbs which betray the 
			sorts of cognitive challenge a task requires.&nbsp; For example, if 
			your task is just:</p>
			<p class="quote">With your partner, list the four main component of 
			communicative competence</p>
			<p>then you are only concerned with the lowest level: recall.<br />
			However, if that task also involves, for example:</p>
			<p class="quote">Now discuss what you see as the main differences 
			between functional and strategic competence and form a new group of 
			four to exchange ideas.</p>
			<p>then you have moved up to the next level of understanding the 
			concepts.&nbsp; Then, of course, the task can be extended one step 
			further to:</p>
			<p class="quote">Think of three ways in the classroom that you can 
			focus on strategic communicative competence and explain why they are 
			effective.</p>
			<p>then you have shifted up the gears to application and evaluation.<br />
			The final step might be to plan and carry out a lesson focusing on 
			teaching strategic speaking skills.<br />
			You can see for this that the instruction betrays the nature of the 
			task:</p>
			<ul class="greenroundbullet">
				<li>In the first task, the instruction is merely to 
				<span class="style_blue"><em>list</em></span> things
				&ndash; that's a recall task</li>
				<li>In the second, the trainees are asked to
				<span class="style_blue"><em>discuss</em></span> – that involves 
				understanding</li>
				<li>In the third, the trainees have to think of
				<span class="style_blue"><em>ways in the classroom</em></span> – 
				that involves the ability to see how to apply a concept</li>
				<li>In that task, too, the instruction is to
				<em class="style_blue">explain why they are effective</em> – 
				that requires evaluative skills</li>
				<li>Finally, if the trainees are to go on to a teaching practice 
				session on communicative skills they will be asked to
				<em class="style_blue">create</em> – the highest level task</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At a less advanced level, the same kind of hierarchy of tasks can 
			be used to analyse language which follows a gently rising curve of 
			challenge from low- to high-level cognitive demands.&nbsp; For 
			example:</p>
			<ul class="greenroundbullet">
				<li><span class="style_blue"><em>List</em></span> the 4 most 
				important open word classes</li>
				<li><span class="style_blue"><em>Discuss</em> </span>with a 
				partner which carry the most essential meanings and list them
				<span class="style_blue"><em>in order of importance</em></span></li>
				<li><span class="style_blue"><em>Compare</em></span> your list 
				with a new partner and justify your decision</li>
				<li>Now work together to <span class="style_blue"><em>
				demonstrate</em></span> how you would focus on the most 
				important two categories in a short reading text (attached) in 
				the classroom.&nbsp; Make a list of what you would do and pin it 
				to the wall.</li>
				<li>One of you must now stand by the list and
				<span class="style_blue"><em>explain</em></span> to anyone who 
				asks how you have <span class="style_blue"><em>categorised</em>
				</span>the word-class importance and <span class="style_blue">
				<em>analysed</em>
				</span>the text.&nbsp; The other trainee needs to go to another 
				pair's list and ...</li>
				<li>... <span class="style_blue"><em>judge</em> </span>how 
				effective you think their ways of focusing on meaning in the 
				text will be.<br />
				Then the pairs swap and we repeat this stage of the exercise.</li>
				<li>Later tomorrow, you will be asked to
				<span class="style_blue"><em>plan and teach</em></span> a lesson 
				focused on lexical meaning using this text or another from the 
				bank in the file.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here's an edited version of the list of verbs you may want to use 
			to set tasks so you can see for yourself how demanding you have made 
			them.</p>

					<h2>Planning and visualising a training session</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We've encountered rather too many long lists in this unit so what follows here is a way of 
			planning a lecture or workshop in a way that allows you to 
			incorporate the most important skills and techniques.</p>
			<p>Just like in the design of anything else, interiors, buildings, 
			transport networks, teacher training sessions and so on, the mind's 
			eye comes to the rescue because we need to visualise the end product 
			while we are designing it.<br />
			This is probably the only way we can see, so to speak, whether what 
			we have planned is fit for its purpose.&nbsp; The process looks like 
			this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="session building" height="180" src="t-to-t_images/session_building.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>and it works like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Topic and target</strong><br />
				<img alt="target" height="82" src="t-to-t_images/green_target.jpg" width="78" /><br />
				This may be very closely defined along the lines of, e.g.:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Word classes in 
				English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Top-down vs. bottom-up processing of reading texts</span><br />
				etc.<br />
				or it may allow you a bit more flexibility in have a title such 
				as:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lexis<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading skills</span><br />
				etc.<br />
				If it's of the latter sort, you will have to make a short list 
				of what you are intending to include and leave out.<br />
				At the planning stage, now, you need to think about:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>how you are going to introduce the topic and make the 
					aims of the session clear (see signposting a. above)</li>
					<li>how you are going to start people off with some kind of 
					awareness-raising task using buzz groups or brainstorming in 
					small groups or pairs.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Structure</strong><br />
				<img alt="structure" src="t-to-t_images/green_structure.jpg" /><br />
				This is the core, of course, and this graphic is how you should 
				visualise the activities with the horizontal bars representing 
				how much time to devote to each stage so, for example, the first 
				bar might represent a brainstorming phase, the second a gapped 
				lecture stage with a longish activity to do in the middle 
				followed by a short application task in groups and a final 
				round-up of the key ideas.<br />
				During this bit of the planning process, you need to:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>make sure you have used around three different 
					activities with different interaction forms in each hour</li>
					<li>make sure that none of the stages is unbalanced in terms 
					of its taking too much or too little time</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Visualise</strong><br />
				<img alt="eye" height="72" src="t-to-t_images/green_eye.jpg" width="78" /><br />
				This is key to identifying whether what you have planned will 
				work and the way to do it is like this:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>Read through the session plan and memorise the stages 
					and activities</li>
					<li>Now shut your eyes and see if you can imagine what you 
					will say at the end of each section and the beginning of the 
					next from the opening of the session till the end.<br />
					For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will you begin the session?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will you say?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will the trainees react?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will you raise awareness of the lesson's topic?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will you start the tasks?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What instructions will you give?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How challenging (see above) are the tasks?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the challenge curve about right, too steep or too shallow?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will you do while the trainees are working in groups / 
					pairs?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will you signal that the end of activities and the 
					session?<br />
					etc.<br />
					Make sure you can do this easily for each and every stage.</li>
					<li>Try to see the session as a narrative with facets which 
					concern the participants, some concerning events and some 
					concerning outcomes.&nbsp; It is easier to remember a story 
					than a process.</li>
					<li>Now do it again.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Amend and repair</strong><br />
				<img alt="repair" height="78" src="t-to-t_images/green_repair.jpg" width="78" /><br />
				In your visualisation, you probably discovered things that seem 
				out of order or won't work, possibly because they haven't been 
				prepared, because the trainees won't be able to do the tasks or 
				the level of cognitive challenge is unsuitable at this stage.<br />
				Go back to the plan and do the repair work, reordering, 
				shortening, extending, adding or deleting activities.</li>
				<li><strong>Re-visualise</strong><br />
				<img alt="eye" height="72" src="t-to-t_images/green_eye.jpg" width="78" /><br />
				Follow the outline above but with a bit more care thinking about 
				and through:<ol class="auto-style3">
					<li>What you will say:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; focusing and introducing the topic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instructions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explanations and lecture modes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; questioning<br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>Where you will be:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the board<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with pairs or groups<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; standing out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the front<br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>What you will be doing:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; helping<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taking notes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; listening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lecturing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moving around<br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>What the trainees will be doing:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; listening to you and taking notes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; responding to your questions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talking to each other<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talking in groups<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talking to the whole group<br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>What you will do if:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the equipment breaks down?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the trainees don't understand what to do?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the trainees&nbsp; have more trouble with the tasks than you 
					expect?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the trainees finish tasks more quickly than you expect?</li>
				</ol>
				</li>

			<p>You wrote the plan for the session carefully but you do not want 
			to be continually referring to it in the session for six connected 
			reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It distracts you.</li>
				<li>It encumbers you with a piece of paper in your hand or it 
				means you have to keep returning to your desk / table to check 
				the notes.</li>
				<li>It gives the impression that you are reading from a script 
				and that reduces your trainees' confidence.</li>
				<li>Trainees expect their trainers to be knowledgeable and 
				constantly referring to notes creates a credibility gap.</li>
				<li>It implies that you haven't properly prepared and thought

			<p>What the foregoing was intended to help you achieve is analogous

			One obvious dividend now is that you have committed the session to 
			memory and you won't need notes.&nbsp; That looks like, and is, the

			Most people still have some notes, of course, especially for the
