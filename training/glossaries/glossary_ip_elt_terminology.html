		<h1>Terminology in ELT</h1>

		<img height="207" src="../images/dictionary_abc310.jpg" width="310" alt="abc" /></p>
		<p>All professions have their own special terms and concepts and English 
		Language Teaching is no exception.<br />
		Please don't be tempted to lump the following under 'jargon' (which 
		usually means inappropriate use of technical language or a use intended 
		to obscure meaning).&nbsp; We need some technical language to help us 
		handle concepts peculiar to our profession.</p>
		<p>What follows is not intended to be exhaustive but if you are familiar 
		with most of the following, then you will not be distracted by 
		unfamiliar terminology on an initial training course, at least.</p>

		<p>There are plenty of web-based and print-published resources for this 
		area which invariably list terms in alphabetic order.&nbsp; Two good 
		books are:<br />
		<span class="auto-style4"><span class="smallfont">Scott Thornbury (2006), <em>An A-Z of ELT</em>, Macmillan<br />

		4th edition, Longman</span></span></p>
			<p>Web-based resources in this area are available by simply 
		entering 'ELT glossary' into a reliable search engine, of course.&nbsp; 
		Not all of these are entirely accurate; some are grossly inaccurate, so

			<dt><strong>Acquisition vs. Learning</strong></dt>
			<dd>Acquisition is the 'picking up' of a language through exposure 
			to it and is contrasted with <strong>learning</strong> which 
			involves deliberate study and practice.&nbsp; The distinction is 
			often credited to 
			Krashen.<br />
			For more, see
			<a href="../inservice/methodology/krashen_natural_approach.html" target="_blank">
			the guide to Krashen and the Natural Approach</a>.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Bilingual</strong></dt>
	<dd>noun: a person able to speak a second language as well as if it was his 
	or her first language.<br />
	adjective: describing such a person.<br />
	There are also, of course, trilingual and multi-lingual people.&nbsp;
	In fact, multi-lingual people outnumber mono-lingual people worldwide.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Competence</strong></dt>
			<dd>has two meanings:<br />
			1. it refers to a learner's ability to use the language, e.g., 
			communicative competence (the ability to get and receive messages), linguistic competence 
			(the ability to form accurate language), discourse competence (the 
			ability to handle interaction and text structures) etc.<br />
			2. it refers to the ideal grammar which underlies all speakers' 
			ability to use language.&nbsp; In this meaning, it is contrasted 
			with <strong>performance</strong>.<br />
			For more, see
			<a href="../inservice/methodology/clt.html" target="_blank">the 
			guide to Communicative Language Teaching (CLT)</a>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Errors vs. Mistakes</strong></dt>
			<dd>Error is usually used to refer to a systematic deviation from 
			the rules of language and is seen as part of the learning process.&nbsp; 
			Errors are contrasted with <strong>mistakes </strong>which are 
			usually the result of tiredness, distraction or cognitive overload 
			and are not systematic.<br />
			For more, see
			<a href="../inservice/background/error.html" target="_blank">the 
			guide to error</a>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>First language</strong></dt>
			<dd>usually written as L1 or L<sub>1</sub> referring to the (or 
			one of the) language(s) in which a speaker is completely fluent or 
			learnt first.&nbsp; L<sub>2</sub> is used to refer to the speaker's 
			second language and L<sub>T</sub> (target language) to the language which is being 
			taught/learnt.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Fossilisation</strong></dt>
			<dd>occurs when a learner's language ability ceases to improve.&nbsp; 
			It can also refer to an error that the learner is unable or 
			unwilling to eradicate.&nbsp; This is 
			often the result of a fall in 
			motivation caused by the realisation 
			that the learner's goals have been achieved.<br />
			For more, see
			<a href="../inservice/background/motivation.html" target="_blank">
			the guide to motivation</a>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Generalisation</strong></dt>
			<dd>refers to the learner drawing parallels and making assumption from the 
			evidence available.&nbsp; For example, if you have learned that the 
			past tense is often formed by adding <em>-d</em> or <em>-ed</em> to a verb stem you 
			can generalise from this fact by guessing that the past tense of a 
			verb you have not previously encountered will be formed in the same 
			way.&nbsp; In the case of, e.g., <em>dishearten</em> you would be 
			correct in guessing at <em>disheartened</em> but a false 
			generalisation (or over-generalisation) will lead you to <em>
			*misunderstanded</em>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Interference vs. Facilitation</strong></dt>
			<dd>refer to the negative or positive influences a learner's first 
			language will have on his/her ability to learn another.<br />
			For more, see 
			<a href="../inservice/background/interference_facilitation.html" target="_blank">the the guide to 
			facilitation and interference</a>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Interlanguage</strong></dt>
			<dd>refers to a learner's current command of the target language.&nbsp; 
			The theory is that a learner moves along a cline from no knowledge 
			of the language to full mastery and at any point on this cline we 
			can describe his/her 
			interlanguage as the current competence.<br />
			For more, see <a href="../inservice/background/error.html#2" target="_blank">
			the section in the guide to error</a>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Learning</strong></dt>
			<dd>see <strong>Acquisition vs. Learning</strong> above.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Mistake</strong></dt>
			<dd>see <strong>Errors vs. Mistakes</strong> above.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Noticing</strong></dt>
			<dd>There are two kinds of noticing:<br />
			1. noticing the language one sees and hears.<br />
			2. noticing the difference between what one produces and what one 
			sees or hears (noticing the gap).<br />
			There is
			<a href="../inservice/teaching/noticing.html" target="_blank">a 
			guide to noticing</a> on this site.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Over-generalisation</strong></dt>
			<dd>also called ignorance of rule restriction.&nbsp; See <strong>
			Generalisation</strong> above.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Performance</strong></dt>
			<dd>the actually demonstrated ability to use a language as opposed 
			to the speaker's knowledge about language.&nbsp; The latter is often 
			referred to as <strong>competence</strong>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Transfer</strong></dt>
			<dd>has two meanings:<br />
			1. the influence of other acquired or learned language(s) on the 
			learning of the target language (positive or negative transfer).<br />
			2. the use of skills deployed in one language in the use of another 
			language.</dd>

		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Appropriacy and Appropriateness</strong></dt>
	<dd>refers to the acceptability in the speech community of certain forms and 
	expressions.&nbsp; For example, <em>You are plain wrong </em>might be 
	acceptable informally between peers but wouldn't be appropriate in a formal 
	situation in a work environment with differences in status and roles.<br />
	(<em>Appropriacy</em> refers to levels of formality and register, 
	not simply to whether a piece of material, for example, is appropriate for a 
	particular group of students.&nbsp; In that sense, the correct noun would be
	<em>appropriateness</em>.)</dd>
			<dt><strong>Communication gap</strong></dt>
			<dd>the disparity of information available to people in an 
			interaction.&nbsp; For example, if a speaker perceives a gap of 
			information he/she may well ask for it: <em>Where did you buy that 
			hat?</em>&nbsp; In the classroom, it is often necessary to engineer 
			a communication or information gap in order to encourage some real 
			communication.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Communicative activities</strong></dt>
			<dd>are activities designed to get learners to use the language for 
			real purposes rather than just manipulating the forms.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Communicative competence</strong></dt>
			<dd>a measure of a learner's ability to communicate effectively.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Context</strong></dt>
			<dd>the situation in which the language is used.&nbsp; The nature of 
			the context will affect appropriacy, in particular.&nbsp; It 
			encompasses the topic, the setting and the roles of participants.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Discourse and discourse analysis</strong></dt>
			<dd>the latter is the study of how language works in real situations 
			which goes beyond considerations of form, pronunciation and grammar 
			etc.&nbsp; The former refers to any coherent and 
			<a href="../initial/grammar_essentials/cohesion_essentials.html">cohesive</a> text, 
			written or spoken, which involves language used for interactive and 
			communicative purposes.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Function</strong></dt>
			<dd >the real meaning of language taking into 
			account its context and the intentions of the user.&nbsp; For 
			example, <em>Have you got a pencil?</em> probably is not performing 
			the <a href="../initial/functions/form_function.html" target="_blank">function</a> of asking for information but that of requesting the 
			loan of one.&nbsp; See <strong>illocutionary force</strong> below.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Illocutionary force</strong></dt>
			<dd>the purpose for which language is used or the way it is 
			understood.&nbsp; For example, <em>
			It's cold in here</em> is often not intended as a communication of a 
			piece of information about the temperature but as a request to turn on the heating, close 
			the window etc.&nbsp; See <strong>Function</strong> above.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Interaction</strong></dt>
			<dd >communication between people involving the use of language to 
			maintain social cohesion and rapport.&nbsp; It can be in writing or in spoken language.&nbsp; 
			Compare <strong>transaction</strong>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Markedness</strong></dt>
			<dd>An item of language is said to be marked if it distinguished in 
			some way from the normal, taken-for-granted neutral form.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			The adjective <em>old</em> is unmarked but <em>young</em> is marked 
			because the usual question is<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; How old are you?</em><br />
			not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;How young are you?</em><br />
			The noun <em>lion</em> is unmarked because it implies both sexes of 
			animal but the noun <em>lioness</em> is marked for gender.<br />
			Grammatically,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoyed the dessert</em><br />
			is unmarked, but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the dessert that I enjoyed</em><br />
			is marked by the speaker for special emphasis.<br />
			For more, go
			<a href="../inservice/lexicogrammar/markedness.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
			markedness</a>.</dd>

			<dt><strong>Redundancy</strong></dt>
			<dd>something like half of what we say is actually redundant.&nbsp; 
			For example, in the sentence <em>I<span class="style_black"><strong>'m</strong></span> 
			go<span class="style_black"><strong>ing to the</strong></span> party,
			<span class="style_black"><strong>will you</strong></span> come with<span class="style_black"><strong> 
			me</strong></span>?</em> the bits <strong>in black</strong> are not needed for communication 
			of the essential idea but allow 'information overkill' so that even 
			if the listener misses something, the message still gets across.&nbsp; 
			Redundancy can be lexical (<em>an <span class="style_black"><strong>added</strong></span> 
			bonus</em>), grammatical (<em>He want<span class="style_black"><strong>s</strong></span></em>) 
			and phonological (/p/ can be distinguished from /b/ three different 
			ways).<br />
			Redundancy helps rather than hinders.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Speech act</strong></dt>

		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Audiolingualism</strong></dt>
			<dd>an approach heavily influenced by <strong>Behaviourism</strong> 
			which concerns itself with listen-and-repeat exercises, drilling of 
			form and a focus on accuracy.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Behaviourism</strong></dt>
	<dd>a theory of learning and language which has two strands:<br />
	1. that language is a skill acquired through imitation and the formation of 
	habits.<br />
	2. that learning takes place through the application of a 
	stimulus-response-reinforcement cycle.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Communicative language teaching (CLT)</strong></dt>
			<dd>an approach to teaching which focuses more on successful 
			communication than structural or formal accuracy.&nbsp; There are 
			two forms:<br />
			Weak form: in which the study of grammar is combined with a focus on 
			function but communicative competence remains the objective.<br />
			Strong form: in which there is no study of structure or form at all.&nbsp; 
			Competence in this area is deemed to flow from authentic language 
			use alone.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Cognitivism</strong></dt>
			<dd>an approach to teaching and learning opposed to behaviourism 
			(see above) which focuses on the thinking and problem-solving 
			characteristics of the mind.&nbsp; Theories of cognitivism (as opposed to 
				behaviourism) underlie much of post-behaviourist language 
				teaching.&nbsp;
				Cognitivism is concerned with the investigation of how people 
				think &ndash; their internal mental states.&nbsp; In our field, 
				this means thinking about how people process language and 
				information to construct dependable rules for its use.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Contrastive analysis</strong></dt>
			<dd>an analysis which compares two languages to discover 
			similarities and differences.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Deductive <em>vs</em>. Inductive learning</strong></dt>
			<dd>Deductive: given the rule, learners can deduce how to form 
			accurate language.<br />
			Inductive: learners can work out the rule from examples of correct 
			usage (see <strong>Cognitivism</strong>).<br />
			For more, see <a href="../initial/teaching/learning.html" target="_blank">the guide to how learning happens</a>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Direct method</strong></dt>
			<dd>strictly speaking, any approach to teaching a language <em>
			through </em>the language.&nbsp; More loosely, an approach akin to
			<strong>Audiolingualism</strong><em>.</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Functional approach</strong></dt>
			<dd>an approach to teaching which focuses on language functions 
			(such as requesting, apologising, inviting etc.) rather than on 
			language structures and forms.&nbsp; The approach is akin to <strong>
			Communicative language teaching</strong>.&nbsp; Compare also <strong>
			Audiolingualism</strong> and <strong>Structural approach</strong>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Genre approach</strong></dt>
			<dd>a teaching approach which focuses on 
			the ways in which spoken 
			and written texts are conventionally structured depending on what is 
			being focused on, the intentions of the speaker/writer and the way 
			grammatical choices are made.&nbsp; For more, see
			<a href="../inservice/discourse/genre.html" target="_blank">the 
			guide to a genre approach</a>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Grammar-translation methodology</strong></dt>
			<dd>an approach to teaching in which the learners are given the rule 
			(i.e., a <strong>Deductive approach</strong>) and from that basis 
			can work out how to translate into and from the target language.&nbsp; 
			Originally, the approach was aimed at attaining access to the 
			written literature of the target language rather than the ability to 
			communicate.&nbsp; It is still widely used.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Humanist approaches</strong></dt>
			<dd>an influential range of approaches to teaching which focus on 
			the learners as <em>people</em> rather than students.&nbsp; In most, the 
			teacher takes on the role of counsellor rather than instructor and a 
			'holistic' view of the learners is taken.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Inductive learning</strong></dt>
			<dd >see <strong>Deductive learning</strong>, above.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Learner-centred approaches</strong></dt>
			<dd >include all approaches which are based on the needs of the 
			learners rather than the demands of an externally imposed syllabus.&nbsp; 
			The term also applies to classroom behaviours (e.g., basing feedback 
			on what emerges from the learners) as well as the design of the 
			syllabus and course content.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Notional approach</strong></dt>
			<dd>an approach to the design of a syllabus and teaching that 
			considers the aspects of ideas rather than the functions or 
			structures of the language.&nbsp; For example, the syllabus and 
			teaching focus is on concepts such as <em>duration of time, size, 
			temperature, futurity, likelihood </em>and so on.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Structural approach</strong></dt>
			<dd>teaching the grammar of the language and its individual 
			structures rather than focusing on communicative intent.&nbsp; 
			Contrasted with a <strong>Communicative, Notional</strong> or <strong>
			Functional approach</strong>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Situational language teaching (SLT)</strong></dt>
			<dd>an approach, first developed in Britain, which focuses on 
			language used in specific settings to exemplify and teach the kinds 
			of language required in different settings, e.g., a customer in a 
			restaurant, an enquirer at an airport etc.&nbsp; The approach is 
			influential in the design of teaching materials.</dd>

	<dt><strong>Cognate</strong></dt>
	<dd>a word in one language which looks similar to and has a meaning

	A false cognate is a word that looks similar to a word in another language 
	purely by coincidence.&nbsp; False cognates are not connected in any way or 
	derived from the same source.&nbsp; For example, the German words <em>haben</em> 
	and the Latin <em>habere</em> both mean <em>have</em> but they are derived 
	from completely different sources and not connected.<br />
	False friends are words derived from the same root in two languages and 
	which look similar but actually have different 
	meanings.&nbsp; For example, <em>simpatico</em> in Italian does not mean <em>sympathetic</em> 
	in English.<br />

			<dt><strong>Connotation vs. Denotation</strong></dt>
			<dd>words <em>denote</em> certain basic concepts but may also have

			refers to a type of animal but may also have emotional overtones in 
			different settings.</dd>
			<dt><strong>False friends</strong></dt>
			<dd>Words which look the same as an English word in another language 
			but have, in fact, a different meaning.&nbsp; An example is the 
			English word <em>actualize</em> which a German speaker may be tempted to 
			equate with the German verb <em>aktualisieren</em>.&nbsp; In fact, the 
			German verb means to <em>refresh</em> or <em>update</em>.<br />
