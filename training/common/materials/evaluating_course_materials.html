				<li><strong>Retrospectively</strong>, looking at the material to

			teaching / learning programme so it may be unwise to rely on them too 
			uncritically.&nbsp;

				<dd>Is it clear for whom the material is intended?<br />

			<p>In the same publication, Dougill offers another huge, and 
			arguably unmanageable, set of questions.<br />
			You may also like to consider the assumptions about best practice 
			which underlie some of these questions, too.<br />
			Here they are:</p>
			<ol class="style_black">
				<li><em>Progression<br />
				Is the course linear or cyclical?<br />
				How steep or shallow is it (compared to other courses)?</em></li>
				<li><em>Revision and recycling<br />
				To what extent is this built-in or provided for?</em></li>
				<li><em>Skills<br />
				Is there an integrated skills approach?<br />
				To what extent are all four skills catered for?</em></li>
				<li><em>Cohesion <br />
				Does the course hang together as a whole or is there an 
				imbalance?<br />
				Is there undue weighting on certain aspects?</em></li>
				<li><em>The units<br />
				Is the amount of material commensurate with the intended amount 
				of contact time?<br />
				Does the unit seem forbidding or inadequate?</em></li>
				<li><em>Presentation <br />
				Is the language presented in a clear manner and in an 
				interesting way?<br />
				Is there an inductive or deductive approach?</em></li>
				<li><em>Practice<br />
				Is it sufficient?<br />
				Does it allow for free production?<br />
				Is it meaningful or personalized?&nbsp; (In other words, does it 
				involve the students in any way other than just as a mechanical 
				exercise?)<br />
				Does it ensure that students will be able to generate language 
				on their own outside the classroom?</em></li>
				<li><em>Variety and regularity<br />
				Does each unit follow the same format?&nbsp; If so, is there 
				sufficient variety to maintain student interest?<br />
				If not, is there sufficient regularity for teacher and students 
				to establish a working pattern?</em></li>
				<li><em>Clarity of purpose<br />
				How clear is it what students are expected to do?<br />
				How easy is it for students to carry out what they are supposed 
				to do?</em></li>
				<li><em>Interest<br />
				How likely is the subject matter to hold the students' interest?<br />
				Is there a fact or fiction bias?<br />
				Is it intrinsically interesting, or does it merely serve as a 
				vehicle for the language work?</em></li>
				<li><em>Culture- or age-bound<br />
				Is the material culture specific?<br />
				Is it too childish or too sophisticated for the target-group?<br />
				Is it sexist or racist?</em></li>
				<li><em>Visual appeal<br />
				Are the pages too dense or unappealing?<br />
				Do the layout and typeface aid or hinder the purpose of the 
				material?</em></li>
				<li><em>Motivating<br />
				Is the book likely to have a motivating effect or to put 
				students off?</em></li>
				<li><em>Illustrations<br />
				Do they serve a function or are they decorative?<br />
				Are they clear enough for their intended purpose?<br />
				Are there too many or too few?<br />
				Are they childish, sexist or culturally offensive?</em></li>
				<li><em>Other features<br />
				Are there any extra tables, lists or explanations for the 
				student?<br />
				How useful are they?<br />
				How useful is the book for the student outside the class? Is 
				there a key?</em></li>
				<li><em>The cassette<br />
				How clear is it?<br />
				How natural? To what extent is it authentic?<br />
				Does it necessitate a tapescript?&nbsp; If so, is it available?<br />
				Is it sufficiently demanding?<br />
				Are the passages too long to hold the students' attention?</em></li>
				<li><em>The teacher's book<br />
				Is it aimed at experienced or inexperienced teachers?<br />
				Is it foolproof (i.e. sufficiently methodical to guide the 
				inexperienced teacher through a lesson)?<br />
				Does it provide (imaginative) alternatives?<br />
				Is it 'easy to follow visually?&nbsp; Is it interleaved? If not, 
				is it manageable when used in conjunction with the students' 
				book?<br />
				Does it leave the teacher with a lot of preparing to do?</em></li>
				<li><em>Tests, laboratory drills and workbooks<br />
				Do they accomplish what they set out to do?<br />
				How far are they communicative?<br />
				Do they provide a worthwhile investment, or would teachers be 
				better advised to do without or make up their own?</em></li>

			<p>Now, having answered the 50 or so questions in that list, you can 
			choose your material.&nbsp; Bear in mind, of course, that you will 
			have to answer all the questions for each piece of material you have 
			in mind as a possibility to use.<br />
			That means, if you have three to choose from, you are going to have 
			to take the time carefully to answer 150 questions, record the 
			results and weight them in a way that makes them comparable.</p>

			<p>The main issue (apart from the sheer length of the processes 
			proposed) is that the questions are not prioritised for <strong>you 
			and your setting</strong> so asking the questions in order may not 
			be very productive.<br />
			For example, if your main priority is that the material should be 
			culturally sensitive, relevant and interesting (Breen and Candlin's 
			questions 22 and 23 and Dougill's question 11), then a negative 
			response to those questions is all you need to reject the material.&nbsp; 
			Your time spent answering all the other questions has been wasted.<br />
			It is little surprise that busy teachers, when faced with this kind 
			of overkill, fall back on<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style_black"> It looks nice, it's at the right level 
			and all the bits are available so that's what I'll use.</span></em></p>

			<p>There is much to be said for keeping things simple.&nbsp; Through 
			simplicity, often comes wisdom.&nbsp; And it is wise choices that we 
			are trying to make.<br />
			Here's the patented <strong><span class="auto-style17">ELT</span> 
			Concourse</strong> materials evaluation machine.&nbsp; It is a way 
			of looking at materials which will also allow you to have the time 
			to use them.</p>
			
			<img alt="materials evaluation" height="248" src="../../imagesgraphics/materials_evaluation.png" width="620" /><p>
			This can be slightly elaborated if you have time hanging heavily on 
			your hands.&nbsp; Clicking on
			<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_materials_evaluation_form.pdf" target="_blank">
			this link</a> will allow you to download a simple form that you may 
			find useful.&nbsp; The form can naturally be adapted to include what 
			you see as critical issues by simply weighting the scores in the 
			appropriate sections or for each question (i.e., doubling them, 
			adding 20% to them etc.).</p>
