			<h1>Researching language online: whom do you trust?</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="research" height="207" src="../images/laptop_research310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This short guide is addressed to teachers, trainee teachers and teacher trainers, 
			not learners of English.</p>
			<p>Frequently, teachers are encouraged (or even compelled) to do 
			some research into the language they are teaching or writing about 
			by accessing various website resources.<br />
			Because native speakers of any language can, with some justification, 
			claim to be experts in the language, and also because the language 
			they speak is usually of passing interest to them, there are hundreds, 
			possible thousands, of websites designed, written and maintained by 
			well-meaning people with the intention of helping people to 
			understand the structural and functional characteristics of English.<br />
			Moreover, because English is the most widely used language on earth, 
			there are naturally many thousands of people who are interested in 
			its nature and they, too, have a right to claim some expertise, even 
			if the language is not their first.<br />
			That's all very well, of course.</p>
			<p>The problem comes when what people say on their friendly and 
			sometimes well-designed websites is wrong.<br />
			In what follows, we have withheld the sources of the 
			citations to spare the blushes of their authors.&nbsp; They are 
			pretty easy to track down, but why would you trouble to do so?<br />
			It may be that some of the more egregious examples which follow have 
			been corrected.&nbsp; In that case, they will be removed on request.</p>

			<p><a name="top"></a>The problem is, whom do you trust?&nbsp;

			<p>This section of this guide is a long list of the most egregious 
			and obvious errors that a morning's research identifies.&nbsp; It is 
			nowhere near to being an exhaustive list, of course, because it 
			seems that, when it comes to analysing language, there is more 
			ignorance than knowledge on display.<br />
			If you are content to believe that much of what you read on the web 
			is wrong, partial or misleading and you want to skip to the end for 
			advice concerning where to look for help, 
			click <a href="#skip" style="color:#ff3300">here</a>.</p>

			<p>Let's say, for example, that you are looking for some reliable 
			information about adverbs and prepositions.<br />
			These are major word classes, not just in English, one of which is 
			an open class to which we can make additions (adverbs) and the other of which 
			is a closed-class set of words (prepositions) to which it is very rare for 
			additions to be made.<br />
			An additional distinction is that adverbs qualify verbs in some way 
			(or other adverbs and adjectives) and prepositions form the heads of 
			prepositional phrases and are followed by a complement or, in more 
			functional analyses, an object.<br />
			It should, you would probably agree, be a simple matter to 
			distinguish between them.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, there are people 
			writing or contributing to websites who have a shaky grasp of the 
			difference between adverbs and prepositions.<br />
			Here's a selection of citations from websites.&nbsp; Can you 
			identify the error and correct it?<br />

						It hard to unravel this nonsense which is designed, 
						apparently, to help people with phrasal verb use.<br />
						Firstly, of course, <em>out</em> is usually an adverb 
						and <em>out of </em>is the preposition.&nbsp; <em>Out 
						of</em> can only function as a preposition but <em>out</em> 
						can be either an adverb or a preposition (or an 
						adjective or a verb, incidentally).<br />
						In the first example, the word <em>out</em> is an 
						adverb, some might argue that it's an adjective, but 
						what it is most certainly not is a preposition.<br />
						In the second example, the preposition is <em>out 
						of</em>, not <em>out</em> and that is followed by its 
						object or complement <em>the eastern district</em>.&nbsp; 
						It's an example of a verb followed by a modifying 
						prepositional phrase.<br />
						In the third and fourth examples, we have <em>out</em> 
						as an adverb again and in the last case the adverb is 
						followed by a prepositional phrase.<br />
						In none of the examples (and there are many of them 
						which follow) is the word <em>out</em> used as a 
						preposition on its own although it is possible to use
						<em>out</em> in limited circumstances as a preposition.</div>

						This is slightly confused and misleading.&nbsp; One of the

						include:<ol>
							<li>It is certainly true that learners often do need to pay 
				attention to word class (the correct term for the dear old 
				fashioned 'parts of speech' incidentally) but so do native 
				speakers, particularly the one who wrote this site.</li>
							<li>The assumption is implicit here, too, that one is either a 
				native speaker or not and that disguises all the intermediate 
				steps between being a non-speaker of a language and a completely 
				fluent one.</li>
							<li>A word's grammatical function (if that is what 
							is intended by the term here) is not the same thing 
							as its word class.&nbsp; A noun, for example, can 
							function grammatically as a direct or indirect 
							object, an adverbial or a subject depending on its 
							syntactical properties in the context but that's a

						This is an attempt to see how a sentence can be parsed into 
				its various components.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it's wrong.&nbsp; 
						Here's why:<ol>
							<li>The first problem is that the first word is labelled the 
				subject.&nbsp; It is, of course, but subjects do not form a word 
				class, leave alone a part of speech.&nbsp; It is in fact a 
				simple subject-case pronoun.&nbsp; And pronouns are one of the 
				main word classes (or a subset of nouns in some analyses).</li>
							<li>Secondly, the word <em>my</em> is not a pronoun.&nbsp; It stands 
				for nothing (which is what pronouns do).&nbsp; What it is is a 
				possessive determiner.&nbsp; If you call it a pronoun, you are 
				misleading people.&nbsp; If you tell your learners that, you are 
							misleading them, too.<br />
							The correct word 
				class to assign the word to is determiner.&nbsp; If you want to 
				be very old fashioned, you could even call it a possessive 
				adjective, but it still is not a pronoun.</li>
							<li>Lastly, we have another non-word class classification (obj).&nbsp; 
				Objects are also not word classes, they are words, phrases or clauses 
				which perform a certain grammatical function in a sentence.&nbsp; 
				For example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want what you gave Mary</em><br />contains an object of the verb 
							<em>want</em> but it is <em>what 
				you gave Mary</em> and that is a clause not an example of a word 
				class.<br />
							Objects can be many things but they are not word 
							classes or parts of speech.</li>

			Obviously.<br />
			We do have a range of possessive pronouns in English.&nbsp; They are
			<em>mine, his, hers, ours, yours </em>and<em> theirs </em>(without <em>

			<p>The problem we saw above of the inability to distinguish between 
			a preposition and an adverb is compounded on websites which cannot 
			distinguish between a verb modified by an adverb in the normal way 
			and ones in which the adverb combines with the verb to form a new 
			meaning.&nbsp; Nor can many distinguish a prepositional phrase 
			following a verb from an adverb forming part of a phrasal verb.&nbsp; We 
			get, therefore, all of the following described as containing phrasal 
			verbs:</p>

			<p>None of those sentences contains examples of phrasal verbs.&nbsp; 
			Most have verbs modified by adverbs in the normal way and others 
			are, in fact, verbs with modifying prepositional phrases.</p>
			<p>Multi-word verbs, of which phrasal verbs may be analysed as a 
			subcategory, are certainly quite complicated to analyse and 
			difficult to learn.&nbsp; The ease of neither undertaking is 
			enhanced, however, by analysing every incidence of a verb plus a 
			preposition or adverbial as a phrasal verb.&nbsp; Here's another 
			example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="styleblackbold">Phrasal verbs work by changing the verb’s

			person getting paid back.<br />
			When it’s written as one word, “payback” means revenge.<br />
			“Thanks for getting me lunch when I forgot my wallet at home! I’ll 
			pay you back tomorrow.”</span></p>
			<p>We need to break this down.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Assertion #1:</dt>
				<dd><span class="styleblackbold"><em>Phrasal verbs work by changing 
				the verb’s meaning ... </em></span><br />
				That's half true.&nbsp; The meaning of the verb in a phrasal 
				verb is often (not invariably) altered by the word with which it 
				combines.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Look at that bird!<br />
				</em>is a use of the verb that is transparent in meaning and is 
				an admonition to direct one's eyes towards a bird.&nbsp; 
				However:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Look up that bird in the guide<br />
				</em>is clearly the verb combining with <em>up</em> to form a 
				different meaning concerned with reference to a source of 
				information.</dd>
				<dt>Assertion #2</dt>
				<dd><span class="styleblackbold"><em>... based on the preposition that follows them.</em></span><br />
				Almost by definition, a phrasal verb is not followed by a 
				preposition alone.&nbsp; It combines with an adverb to form a 
				distinct meaning as we saw with our example of <em>look up</em>.<br />
				In that phrase, the verb is <em>look up</em> and is formed by 
				the verb plus an adverb particle, NOT, <em>look</em> plus the 
				preposition <em>up</em>.<br />
				However, in an expression such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look up the chimney to see if it is 
				blocked<br />
				</em>we are not asking someone to refer to a reference book, we 
				are asking someone to look in a certain direction.<br />
				We can follow a phrasal verb with a preposition, of course, so 
				we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look it up in the guide<br />
				</em>in which we have a phrasal verb, <em>look up</em>, followed 
				by a prepositional phrase <em>in the guide</em>.</dd>
				<dt>Assertion #3:</dt>
				<dd><span class="styleblackbold"><em>Come in<br />
			To enter.<br />
			“‘Come in, the door is open!’ said the grandmother to the wolf.”</em></span><br />
				Now, the meaning of the expression <em>come in</em> is correctly 
				identified.&nbsp; It does mean something like <em>enter </em>
				(although it does not mean <em>to enter</em>).<br />
				It is not, however, a phrasal verb and it is not a multi-word 
				verb, either.<br />
				The correct analysis of the phrase is that it is the verb <em>
				come</em> (in its usual meaning of <em>move towards</em>) 
				followed by an adverbial which happens to be an adverb (<em>in</em>).&nbsp; 
				The adverb is modifying the verb to be sure but it is not 
				combining with it to make a new meaning because we can equally 
				have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Come out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come over<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come into the garden<br />
				</em>as well as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walk in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slide in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throw in<br />
				</em>and lots of other expressions which have no effect at all 
				on the base meaning of the verb.</dd>
				<dt>Assertion #4:</dt>
				<dd><em><span class="style_black">P</span><span class="styleblackbold">ay back<br />
			To give someone back money that you owe them—can be separated by the 
			person getting paid back.<br />
			When it’s written as one word, “payback” means revenge.<br />
			“Thanks for getting me lunch when I forgot my wallet at home! I’ll 
			pay you back tomorrow.”</span></em><br />
				There are some other false assertions here although the meaning 
				has been, more or less, identified.<br />
				Yes, the phrase can be separated by "the person getting paid 
				back" but what is missing from that assertion is when the person 
				is represented by a pronoun, separation <strong>must</strong> 
				occur so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I paid Mary back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I paid back Mary</em><br />
				and <br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I paid her back</em><br />
				we do not allow<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I paid back her.</em><br />
				That is not, however, a defining characteristic of a phrasal 
				verb because this is the usual way verbs plus adverbs operate.<br />
				More to the point, the expression <em>pay back</em> is not a 
				phrasal verb any more than <em>come in</em> is a phrasal verb 
				because we can also have, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay over<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay in advance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay by debit card</em><br />
				and thousands of other phrases in which the verb is modified by 
				an adverbial but retains its basic meaning.<br />
				It is also correct that we can form a noun from the verb phrase 
				and arrive at <em>payback</em> but that has little to do with 
				phrasal verbs.&nbsp; The expression can, of course, also mean
				<em>take revenge</em> when it is not formed as a noun so:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll pay him back for his deceitfulness<br />
				</em>also means <em>take revenge</em> on someone.&nbsp; It is a 
				metaphorical use of the verb <em>pay</em> to be sure but not a 
				phrasal verb.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The same site, incidentally, categorises numerous other examples 
			of verbs followed by simple adverbs or verbs followed by 
			prepositional phrases as phrasal verbs.&nbsp; Many are nothing of 
			the kind.</p>
			<p>Confusion over what is and is not a phrasal verb is so common out 
			here that only one more example site's problems will be enough.<br />
			We have left out a good deal of what follows on the site in question (some of which is accurate).</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="styleblackbold"><em>Intransitive phrasal verbs<br />
				[...] intransitive phrasal verbs do not use an object.</em></span><br />
				True but that's the meaning of intransitive and nothing to do 
				with phrasal verbs.<br />
				The example chosen to demonstrate this insight is:<br />
				<span class="styleblackbold"><em>The regional director was late, so 
				the sales team went ahead without her.</em></span><br />
				which is not, unfortunately, a phrasal verb at all.&nbsp; It is 
				simply the verb <em>go</em> used with an adverb, <em>ahead</em> 
				and we can also have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go right<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go in</em><br />
				and a host more which are just the verb used with an adverb and 
				not an example of a mysterious phrasal verb at all.</li>
				<li><span class="styleblackbold"><em>Inseparable phrasal verbs<br />
				Inseparable phrasal verbs cannot be split up and must be used 
				together. </em></span><br />
				with the example:<br />
				<span class="styleblackbold"><em>The wayward son carried on without 
				his father.</em></span><br />
				Now, the verb <em>carry on</em> is actually a phrasal verb in 
				this case (hooray) and the adverb is acting to denote 
				progressiveness just as the adverb <em>up</em> often denotes 
				completion.&nbsp; Aspectual uses of adverb particles are a 
				teachable unit in themselves.<br />
				The problem here is that the example is of an intransitive use 
				of the verb so it cannot be separated by the object because 
				there isn't one (by definition).<br />
				When the verb is used as a transitive verb, it can be separated 
				so we allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She carried the work on alone</em><br />
				so the example is not of an inseparable phrasal verb at all.</li>
				<li><span class="styleblackbold"><em>come up with<br />
				think of an idea, especially as the first person to do so, or to 
				produce a solution</em></span><br />
				with the example:<br />
				<span class="styleblackbold"><em>Sahar comes up with her best story 
				ideas at night, so she writes them down before she forgets them.</em></span><br />
				This is presented as an example of a phrasal verb and it is one 
				but of a special sort called a phrasal-prepositional verb.&nbsp; 
				The correct way to analyse this is, arguably as a phrasal verb 
				followed by a prepositional phrase.</li>
				<li><span class="styleblackbold"><em>count on<br />
				rely or depend on</em></span><br />
				with the example:<br />
				<span class="styleblackbold"><em>If I’m ever making a mistake, I 
				can count on my friends to warn me.</em></span><br />
				This is presented as a phrasal verb but it isn't one, 
				unfortunately.&nbsp; What it is can be called a verb with a 
				dependent preposition or a prepositional verb but not a phrasal 
				verb.&nbsp; Both the expressions used to explain the meaning of 
				the item are also prepositional verbs so the argument is 
				somewhat circular.</li>
				<li><span class="styleblackbold"><em>dive into<br />
				occupy oneself with something; to pore over quickly or reach 
				into quickly</em></span><br />
				with the example:<br />
				<span class="styleblackbold"><em>I’ll dive into that new TV show 
				later tonight.</em></span><br />
				The problem here is that the word <em>into</em> is not an adverb 
				in any circumstances because it requires a complement.&nbsp; It 
				is, therefore, a preposition.<br />
				What we have is a metaphorical use of the verb <em>dive</em> 
				with a prepositional phrase <em>into that new TV show</em>.<br />
				Verbs followed by prepositional phrases, however figuratively 
				they are used, are not phrasal verbs.<br />
				(The expression <em>pore over quickly</em> is also a bit 
				mysterious because the meaning of <em>pore over</em> is not 
				something that one can usually do quickly.)</li>
				<li><span class="styleblackbold"><em>For example, the transitive 
				phrasal verbs </em>get through, come between,<em> and </em>go 
				against<em> are all inseparable, so the direct object comes 
				after them every time.</em></span><br />
				with the examples:<br />
				<span class="styleblackbold"><em>[INCORRECT] Nothing comes us 
				between.<br />
				[CORRECT] Nothing comes between us.</em></span><br />
				This would be a helpful thing to note if only the example was 
				actually a phrasal verb but, unfortunately, it is just a verb 
				followed by a prepositional phrase and not a phrasal verb at 
				all.&nbsp; The word <em>between</em> is only, like <em>into</em>, 
				a preposition and cannot be used adverbially.<br />
				We can have, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put it between the house and the 
				garage<br />
				</em>or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put it between them<br />
				</em>but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He put it them between<br />
				</em>because prepositions in English are followed, not preceded, 
				by their complements (or objects, if you prefer).&nbsp; The 
				meaning of the prefix <em>pre</em>- in <em>preposition</em> 
				contains the clue.&nbsp; There are a few postpositions in 
				English, in fact and other languages use them very extensively.<br />
				What has happened here, it seems, is that the author has spotted 
				that we cannot use the preposition <em>between</em> after its 
				complement or object and, having noted this simple truth, has 
				decided that it must be an inseparable phrasal verb.&nbsp; If we 
				follow that logic,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put it under the table<br />
				</em>would be an example of the use of an inseparable phrasal 
				verb.<br />
				Later on the same page, we encounter
				<span class="styleblackbold"> <em>come between</em></span> as 
				another example of a phrasal verb but it is not, for the same 
				reason.</li>
				<li>In fact, of the 80 or so expressions on this page which are 
				called phrasal verbs we also find<br />
				<span class="styleblackbold"><em>get around, get at, get away, get 
				into, get through, get together</em></span><br />
				which are all examples of the polysemous verb <em>get</em> being 
				used with an adverb, not a phrasal verb at all.<br />
				We also have:<br />
				<em><span class="styleblackbold">leave out, let in, take out, throw 
				away</span><span class="style_black"><br />
				</span> </em>listed as phrasal verbs and they aren't, of 
				course.<br />
				We even have the expression <span class="styleblackbold"><em>let 
				know</em></span> listed as a phrasal verb and it is not even a 
				multi-word verb.&nbsp; It is just the verb <em>let</em> 
				combining with the verb <em>know</em> and we can also have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; let go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let believe</em><br />
				and many more combinations with <em>let</em> which must be 
				separated by the object.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are many other sites which insist that a verb plus a prepositional phrase such as occurs 
			in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get on the bus</em><br />
			contains a phrasal verb.&nbsp; It doesn't, of course, because it's 
			just the verb <em>get</em> meaning move position followed by a 
			simple prepositional phrase.<br />
			The same site suggests that <span class="styleblackbold"> <em>go out, let in, log onto, put 
			together, put on, send back, think back, throw away</em></span> are all 
			phrasal verbs when none is.&nbsp; They are just verbs being modified 
			by adverbs.</p>
			<p>We could go on and there are many hundreds more examples of poor 
			analysis out here (some of which you will find explained in the 
			guide to multi-word verbs).<br />
			When almost any combination of a verb plus an adverb or a verb plus 
			a prepositional phrase is consigned to the category of a phrasal 
			verb two things happen, neither good:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Learners are faced with thousands of combinations that they 
				are asked to remember as single expressions when they are not.</li>
				<li>Learners are denied the opportunity to see how verbs may be 
				normally modified by adverbs or followed by simple prepositional 
				phrases.</li>
			</ol>

				</table>
			<p>This seems, oddly, to be another source of deep confusion for 
			many.&nbsp; It shouldn't be because the area is quite simple.<br />
			However, ...</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>
				One site
				has this:<br />
				<span class="styleblackbold"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some verbs can be followed only by 
				a gerund:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Some verbs with this pattern:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				verbs of liking and disliking: enjoy, like, love, hate, dislike, 
				fancy<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				phrases with ‘mind’ – like ‘I don’t mind‘<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				verbs of saying and thinking: admit, consider, deny, imagine, 
				remember, suggest, recommend<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				other common verbs: avoid, begin, finish, keep, miss, practise, 
				risk, start, stop</em></span><br />
				Well, some of this is correct but it depends what the verb 
				refers to.<br />
				It is perfectly possible to allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like to run in the mornings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate to disappoint you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dislike to be difficult about this</em><br />
				We can also accept:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered to post your letters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She recommended to get there early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We began to worry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They started to complain</em><br />
				The problem also is that some of these verbs can also take a 
				direct nominalised clausal object as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I admit to do it won't be easy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is considered to be the best at her job<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I imagine to be here in the winter is unpleasant</em><br />
				The truth is that many verbs can be used equally acceptably with 
				both forms and some can have distinctly different meaning 
				depending on the following verb form.</li>
				<li>
				Another site has:<br />
				<span class="styleblackbold"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use gerunds (verb + ing):<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				[...]<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				As the subject or object of a sentence - Swimming is good 
				exercise</em></span><br />
				And it's true that we can use the -<em>ing</em> form in this 
				way.&nbsp; However, we can also use the <em>to</em>-infinitive 
				in the same way:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To swim in warm water is extremely 
				pleasant<br />
				</em>We also find:<br />
				<span class="styleblackbold"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use 'to' + infinitive:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				[...]<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I came to London to study English</em></span><br />
				in which, in fact, we have the preposition, <em>to</em>, 
				standing for the more complex <em>in order to</em> so <em>to 
				study</em> in this example is not an infinitive.<br />
				On that site, we also find the admonition always to use an 
				infinitive after the verb <em>hope</em> for example so that 
				disallows:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope speaking at the meeting won't be 
				too stressful for you<br />
				</em>and the same problem has arisen of using the -<em>ing</em> 
				form as the direct object of the verb.</li>

			<p>Another area which seems to cause a lot of difficulty is 
			describing differences and similarities between English and other 
			languages.&nbsp; Here are some examples from three different 
			websites:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="styleblackbold"><em>A false cognate, or false friend, is a word 
			which has a similar form to a word in another language but has a 
			different meaning, like </em>actually<em>, which means
			really in English but
			</em>now<em> is 
			(sic) some European languages.</em></span><br />
				(Typographical error in the original.)</li>
				<li><em class="styleblackbold">A cognate is a word that is basically written 
			the same, with the same meaning, in both languages.<br />
			Sometimes, a word only seems to be the same in both languages, but 
			really has two completely different meanings. These are what we call 
			false cognates, and they’re out there lurking just below the 
			surface, waiting for unsuspecting students to amble by and pluck 
			them up by accident.</em></li>
				<li><span class="styleblackbold"><em>A false cognate is a word or phrase that looks 
			the same in both idioms but has a different meaning.</em></span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>All that seems quite clear until you amble by and notice that 
			they are all wrong.<br />
			A false friend is a word which shares its etymology (that is to say, 
			its origin) with a word in 
			another language but over time the meanings of the words in the 
			languages have drifted apart.<br />
			There are lots of examples on this site so one will do:<br />
			The words <em>aktuell</em> (in German) and <em>actual</em> (in 
			English) share an original source so are cognates but in German, the 
			word means something like <em>contemporary</em> or <em>current</em> 
			and in English it means <em>real</em> or <em>factual</em>.&nbsp; 
			This is an example of a false friend, not a false cognate.<br />
			A false cognate is a word which coincidentally looks and may sound 
			like a word that means the same in another language but the words are wholly 
			differently derived and not related.<br />
			For example, the word <em>occur </em>in English translates as <em>
			okoru</em> in Japanese (起こる) but the surface form is merely a 
			coincidence.&nbsp; The words are not cognates or false friends, they 
			are false cognates.<br />
			Finally, the word <em>administration </em>in English is translated 
			as <em>administration </em>French with exactly the same form 
			(although the pronunciation is different).&nbsp; These are cognate 
			words which are not false friends because the meaning is the same.<br />
			And here's an example from a site to help people speak French which seems unable to 
			translate from French into English and has a page entitled:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="styleblackbold">French English False Cognates - Faux Amis</span></p>
			<p>and, of course <em>faux amis</em> translates better as<em> false 
			friend</em> although French does not distinguish in this case.&nbsp; 
			English does, though.<br />
			For more go to the guide to false friends on this site.</p>

			</table>
			<p>This is from one site 
			but a short search reveals that there are many more sites that 
			cannot distinguish between a determiner and a pronoun.</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="styleblackbold">Demonstrative Pronouns<br />
			The demonstrative pronouns are this, 
			that, these and those. We 
			use them to refer to something specific.<br />
			Example:<br />
			This book is more interesting than that book.<br />
			These shoes fit better than those.</span></p>
			<p>Well, yes and most definitely no.&nbsp; The words <em>this, that, 
			these</em> and <em>those</em> certainly can be demonstrative 
			pronouns (although their uses are quite different in terms of mass 
			<em>vs.</em> count noun uses).&nbsp; However, in the examples here we have 
			three cases of the words acting as demonstrative determiners and 
			only one case (the last) where it is a demonstrative pronoun.&nbsp; 
			To be clear:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book, that book</em> and <em>these shoes</em> 
			contain demonstrative determiners and not pronouns.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>those</em> in the second sentence is a pronoun.<br />
			Well, one out of three isn't all bad.</p>
			<p>Here's another, even stranger one:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="styleblackbold">A determiner usually appears at the beginning 
			of the noun phrases and works as an adjective to modify the nouns.</span></p>
			<p>Well, again, yes and no.&nbsp; Most determiners do occur at the 
			beginning of noun phrases (although <em>e<span class="auto-style19">nough</span></em> 
			is an exception worth mentioning) but they do not work like 
			adjectives, are not adjectives and do not modify the nouns in the 
			way that adjectives do.<br />
			The possessive and demonstrative determiners were once referred to 
			as adjectives but how one could class something like <em>the</em> or
			<em>many</em> as an adjective is rather mysterious, not to say 
			misleading.</p>
			<p>This sort of confusion bleeds over into the nasty habit of sites 
			which prescribe the ordering of adjectives so we get the following, 
			for example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style21">
				<tr>
					<td><em>What the adjective expresses</em></td>
					<td><em>Examples</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><em>Quantity</em></td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><em>Value/opinion</em></td>
					<td><em>delicious, charming, beautiful</em></td>

			<p>It is certainly true as a rule of thumb that determiners precede 
			the adjective and classifiers generally follow the adjective and 
			come directly before the noun they determine.&nbsp; However, to 
			describe <em>four, ten, a few</em> and <em>several</em> as 
			adjectives is misleading (and wrong).&nbsp; They are, of course, 
			quantifying determiners.<br />
			To describe <em>Chinese, glass, silver</em> and <em>wooden</em> as 
			adjectives is also slightly misleading because they are actually 
			classifiers and they work rather differently.<br />
			Incidentally, this so-called rule would mean that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John baked a huge delicious cake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lives in a tiny beautiful cottage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a green round blob on it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a stocky ten-year old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wore my Hawaiian short trousers</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They live in a Mongolian round house</em><br />
			would all be wrong.<br />
			This sort of unusable and unreliable rule is much beloved of some 
			websites, possible because it's easier to state it and test it than 
			to exemplify and justify it.<br />
			It is debunked in the guide to adjectives on this site.</p>
			<p>Lest you think that these are the only example of sites written by 
			the inexperienced and ignorant for the inexperienced and ignorant 
			you should know that in researching this short guide six other 
			similarly confused and unhelpful sites were investigated.&nbsp; It 
			would try your patience too far to include all that was discovered 
			and, anyway, the point has been made.</p>
			<p>On this site, a number of the areas of language analysis carry 
			website warnings and many concern the sorts of issues we have 
			exemplified here.<a name="skip"></a></p>

			</table>
			
			<p>The first thing to do is to get some idea of whom the site is 
			intended to help.&nbsp; There are four sorts of site (although some 
			straddle the boundaries and some are almost impossible to 
			characterise with any confidence).</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Sites designed to help learners of English.<br />
				Many of these are constructed by commercial organisations who 
				want to use them as a free hook in the hope that visitors will 
				go on to access the businesses' main sites and book a course or buy 
				some materials.<br />
				Others are written by people who would like to earn some money 
				from teaching online.&nbsp; They, too, are often obvious hooks 
				intended to encourage people to sign up for courses (and pay for 
				them).<br />
				They have the following main characteristics:<ol class="auto-style15">
					<li>They are often written by teachers on the staff of the 
					organisations who are under-trained or otherwise somewhat 
					ignorant.</li>
					<li>They try to simplify the area because they know that 
					their object is pedagogic rather than to do with training 
					teachers.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with that: many 
					text-based grammar books do the same thing but it is usually 
					clear what the intended audience is.<br />
					If the audience is learners of English, you will find that 
					grammar guides in particular are likely to be simplified to 
					the point of inaccuracy.&nbsp; It is very difficult to 
					remain both accessible and accurate.&nbsp; That is not a 
					criticism; it arises from the intentions of the authors.</li>
					<li>They are often wrong.</li>
					<li>They are usually hurriedly put together and contain 
					quite numerous typographical errors.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Sites designed by publishers for teachers of English.<br />
				It has not escaped the notice of major ELT publishers that 
				teachers are often quite influential when language teaching 
				organisations come to enhancing or replacing their materials 
				banks.&nbsp; Naturally, establishing a resource for teachers is 
				a good way of raising the profile of certain materials and their 
				publishers.&nbsp; Most major materials publishers now have 
				websites which appear quite independent and unaffiliated but 
				are, in fact, paid for and maintained by the commercial 
				organisation which lies behind them.&nbsp; Some are more honest 
				and open about this than others.<br />
				They are variably trustworthy, naturally.</li>
				<li>Sites designed to be areas where learners and speakers of English can 
				discuss their ideas about how the language works.<br />
				These sites are usually places where people can post and answer 
				questions about the language and are open to all.&nbsp; Such 
				sites are not primarily intended for people teaching English or 
				training teachers of the language.&nbsp; They have the following 
				characteristics:<ol class="auto-style15">
					<li>The topics are randomly organised because the structure 
					of the site depends not on any consistent approach to 
					analysis but on the questions people pose and the issues 
					they raise.</li>
					<li>The answers which are provided are supplied by 
					self-selecting people who feel they have some knowledge to 
					impart.&nbsp; Sometimes, this is justified, often it is just 
					a re-hash of half remembered and poorly digested 
					information.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Sites designed for training teachers or other people 
				studying language seriously.<br />
				These sites are often written by people working in higher or 
				further education as a supplement to a face-to-face or online 
				course in linguistics, pedagogy or applied linguistics.<br />
				Others are constructed by large non-profit organisations who 
				have the resources and expertise to be accurate and helpful.<br />
				A few have been written by real experts in the language and 
				teaching who are using the site to promote their own published 
				material or just because they want to be helpful (or both).<br />
				They are:<ol class="auto-style15">
					<li>Usually quite trustworthy because they are written by 
					academics with a reputation to uphold and an understanding 
					of the pitfalls to avoid.</li>
					<li>Often accessibly organised into topic areas and some 
					have an internal consistency which helps people to build on 
					their knowledge as they work or read through the materials.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>If you are reading this, you are probably a teacher of English, a 
			teacher in or considering training or 
			a trainer so the first kind of site is not for you.&nbsp; Some of 
			the materials may be helpful when preparing a particular lesson 
			(because that's the audience they are aimed at) but they are worse 
			than useless if your concern is to analyse the language and research 
			the area.<br />
			The issue here is that you have to check what you are being told 
			very carefully (usually by cross-checking with a proper grammar book 
			or a trustworthy site).<br />
			Do not trust them.</p>
			<p>Sites designed by publishers can be extremely helpful if you are 
			trying to locate a particular set of materials or a worksheet to 
			insert (suitably adapted) into a lesson.&nbsp; They are less helpful 
			when it comes to language analysis because analysis doesn't sell 
			books.<br />
			This second kind of site also requires you to cross-check the 
			information you find.</p>
			<p>The third kind may be quite interesting and sometimes can alert 
			you to information about the language of which you were previously 
			unaware.&nbsp; However, the organisational shortcomings of this 
			sort of site may mean that you can't easily find what you are 
			looking for and when you do, you find it isn't what you wanted.<br />
			Sometimes, as was noted here, the responses to people's questions 
			and the issues raised are accurate, accessible and comprehensive as 
			well as written by people who know what they are writing about.&nbsp; 
			Unfortunately, that is often not the case so a little scepticism is 
			in order.</p>
			<p>The fourth kind of site is the sort you can probably trust.<br />
			This site likes to think it is one of these.</p>
