			</table>
			<p>Until the invention of moveable type and the advent of the 
			printing press in the 15th century, punctuation of any kind in texts 
			was rare.&nbsp; Even spacing between words was unusual and readers 
			were expected to understand the lexemes and syntax of what was read 
			by examining its sense units rather than by marks or spaces to point 
			them out.<br />
			As long ago as the 5th century BCE, however, Greek playwrights were 
			using marks to signal pauses in speech of various lengths as an aid 
			to actors.<br />
			Some other marks were used in the Middle Ages, especially in 
			liturgical texts, to show where pausing should fall and many were 
			marginal notes signalling quotations and other characteristics of 
			the text.&nbsp; Copies of the Bible were designed to be read aloud 
			to a generally illiterate audience so scribes introduced a range of 
			markings to show pausing rather than syntactical relationships.<br />
			Because printed texts have standard symbols for letters, they can be 
			read (aloud and silently) much more quickly.&nbsp; Fast reading 
			precludes the ability to parse sentences and apply syntactical rules 
			in real time so there was an urgent need for some standardised form 
			of punctuation to aid the reader in making sense of the text.<br />
			By the middle of the 16th century some standardised punctuation, 
			including the use of the full stop, the colon and the comma is 
			discernible in Europe.<br />
			Later, the amount of punctuation which was possible in texts was 
			actually reduced by the invention of the typewriter because of the 
			impracticality of having a very wide range of marks.&nbsp; Early 
			typewriters, for example, had no space to include a keyboard 
			containing '!' and that was formed by overstriking a single 
			quotation mark with a full stop.&nbsp; Dashes were reduced to the 
			hyphen and longer dashes by simply repeating it.<br />
			The advent of digital word-processing programs has also influenced 
			modern punctuation and the @ sign, for example, previously rare, has 
			taken on a new life.</p>

			<dt><strong>European languages</strong></dt>
			<dd>Most of these use the same marks as English but conventions vary 
			considerably.&nbsp; In general, languages within the same families 
			(Romance, Slavic, Germanic etc.) will follow similar patterns but 
			even then there are variations.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="smallbluebullet">
				<li>The usual double quotation marks in English ("text") appear 
				in French as « text » and in German as „text” or «text».&nbsp; 
				Russian used both « text » and „text”, the latter, in more formal 
				writing, for citations, but most Slavic languages, 
				including Polish and Russian, prefer direct 
				speech to be preceded and followed by dashes as in &ndash; Come 
				in &ndash;.<br />
				European Portuguese uses the « text » format but Brazilian 
				Portuguese follows the English convention.&nbsp; Both varieties 
				use dashes to enclose direct speech.</li>
				<li>Greek uses ';' as English uses '?' and uses a raised point 
				[·] as a colon or semi-colon.</li>
				<li>Most Slavic languages do not use a colon for a book, paper 
				or article subtitle so, for example: <em>Speaking: a 
				communicative approach</em> becomes <em>Speaking. A 
				communicative approach</em></li>
				<li>In many European languages, including the Slavic and 
				Germanic ones, a comma is used after almost all conjunctions, 
				whether subordinating or coordinating.</li>
				<li>Spanish demands an inverted sign before exclamations and 
				questions as in ¡&nbsp;Text !, ¿ text ?</li>
				<li>Spacing varies with some languages inserting a space before 
				or after marks (notably French and Spanish).</li>
			</ul>
			</dd>
			<dt><strong>Chinese languages</strong></dt>
			<dd>Modern written Chinese uses a range of marks imported from 
			Europe including the comma, semi-colon, colon, exclamation and 
			question mark.&nbsp; It also has some non-European marks derived 
			from older forms including a different form of quotation marks, a 
			different form of the comma when used in lists as well as wavy 
			underlines and separate symbols for titles.&nbsp; The form of the 
			full stop is a small hollow circle.&nbsp; It's complicated.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Japanese</strong></dt>
			<dd>is somewhat similar to Chinese in using a range of punctuation 
			derived from Europe but also some of its own (especially the use of 
			brackets).&nbsp; The form of the full stop is a small hollow circle 
			and the language also employs a middle dot to separate words.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Korean</strong></dt>
			<dd>also has a range of home-grown marks as well as using European 
			conventions.&nbsp; These include the middle dot to separate items in 
			a list and some different forms of quotation marks and brackets.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Thai</strong></dt>
			<dd>uses a range of marks: a separation indicator, an abbreviation 
			indicator, marks which show the beginning of a paragraph or the end 
			of a story and so on.&nbsp; Thai does not normally separate words 
			with spaces.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Arabic</strong></dt>
			<dd>Modern Arabic now uses a reversed comma (denoting a suitable 
			place to pause when reading aloud) and reversed question 
			mark.&nbsp; Earlier forms of Arabic had no punctuation.</dd>

			</table>
		<p>In English, punctuation has sometimes been compared to intonation 
		written down but that's not very accurate as we shall see.&nbsp; 
		Originally, however, as we saw at the outset, punctuation was developed by printers to guide the 
		reading aloud of texts, especially bibles.&nbsp; Conventions which arose 
		from that source are still evident but modern English punctuation use 
		owes more to grammatical than phonological influences.&nbsp; There are, 
		or were, two competing schools of thought:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the elocutionary school which asserted that punctuation 
				should only be used to guide the reader of a text concerning 
				where and for how long to pause when reading aloud</li>
				<li>the syntactic school which asserted that punctuation should 
				have a grammatical function, dividing off clauses, phrases and 
				so on and making it clear where sentences stopped and started as 
				well as denoting questions and exclamations</li>
			</ol>
		<p>Punctuation has two functions, syntactically:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Separation</strong><br />
			Some marks are used to separate units of language.&nbsp; The full 
			stop, the comma and the colon are examples.&nbsp; The separation can 
			occur:<ol class="auto-style3">
				<li>Between units: for example, we use a full stop or a 
				semi-colon to separate discrete sentences or clauses.&nbsp; So we 
				get, e.g.<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun was shining.&nbsp; The overnight rain 
				had stopped<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather was lovely; the rain had 
				stopped</em>.</li>
				<li>Within units: for example, we use the comma to separate out 
				a smaller unit inside a larger one.&nbsp; So we get, e.g.<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
				rain, or what was left of it, finally stopped</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Specification</strong><br />
			Some marks specify the function of language.&nbsp; The most obvious 
			examples are question and exclamation marks but also included would 
			be the apostrophe because that is used to show the function of the 
			noun (possessive or descriptive when used, plural when absent).&nbsp; 
			It also, in English, denotes an ellipted letter or letters.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>We'll consider the most common and troublesome marks one by one.</p>

		<p>The comma is a separation mark but it differs fundamentally from the 
		full stop, the colon and the semi-colon.<br />
		What is that difference?&nbsp; 
		<a href="#comma" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'punc1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have an 
		answer</a>.</p>
		<div id="punc1" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
		
		<p><span class="style_black">The comma is used to separate parts of a 
		sentence.&nbsp; Usually, the colon, the semi-colon and a full stop are used to 
		separate units which can stand alone and be separated by a full stop.<br />
		For example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wanted to tell me the truth: Mary wasn't coming.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		She wanted to tell me the truth; it wasn't going to be nice.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		She wanted to tell me the truth.&nbsp; I knew it wasn't going to be 
		nice.</em><br />
		None of those sentences would be correct with the insertion of a comma.&nbsp; 
		Putting one in results in a comma splice.&nbsp; For more on that, see
		the 
		answer about what comma splices are linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
		A comma, on the other hand, separates off sense units
		<span class="style_underline">within</span> sentences or clauses.</span></p>
			</div>
			<p>By some measures, there are nearly 20 different rules for how we 
			use a comma in English, and we'll deal with some in a minute.&nbsp; 
			We can summarise more easily when a comma 
			<span class="style_underline">is</span> allowed.</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>The sentence parts must be joined together.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The station itself was dark and deserted, but the station bar 
			was warm and inviting<br />
			</em>is correct punctuation use (although the 
			comma is not obligatory).<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The station itself was dark and deserted, the station bar 
			was warm and inviting<br />
			</em>is incorrect because there's a comma splice between two 
			stand-alone clauses.</li>
			<li>The sentence parts must be grammatically similar.&nbsp; It is 
			possible, for example, to have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The station was deserted, and there was no one around to ask<br />
			</em>but not possible to use a comma like this:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The station was deserted, and the workers 
			have been sitting in the bar<br />
			</em>because the change of number and tense makes two sentences 
			conventional.</li>
			<li>We can't leave out verbs in the second part of the sentence 
			and still use a comma so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The station appeared deserted, and filthy<br />
			</em>is not possible 
			although<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The station appeared deserted, and it looked uncared 
			for and dirty<br />
			</em>is OK with or without the comma.<br />
			In the first sentence, leaving out the subject and the verb <em>
			appear</em> makes a comma impossible.</li>
			<li>The parts of the sentence must be connected semantically (in terms of meaning).&nbsp; 
			A sentence such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Victoria station appeared deserted, although 
			it was raining in Tokyo<br />
			</em>is nonsense.</li>

					<h3>Rules of comma use</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: the rules and conventions are different in different 
		languages.&nbsp; Many will demand a comma between all potentially 
		independent clauses.&nbsp; So we get errors such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I think, he's 
		crazy</em>.<br />
		<strong>Note 2</strong>: the comma and the full stop are by far the most 
		frequent punctuation marks in English.&nbsp; The comma, however, is the 
		one which allows the most choice to the writer.&nbsp; Many 
		(non-)insertions of commas are matters of personal preference.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>adverbials</strong></dt>
			<dd>A comma is never wrong, although not always necessary, when an 
			adverbial is placed at the front of a sentence<em>.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Later, they went to the party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At six o'clock, we went home<br />
			</em>but not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They went to 
			the party, later</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The went home, at six o'clock</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>conditional and contingent structures</strong></dt>
			<dd>Commas are conventionally only used when the conjunction is 
			fronted so we allow<em>:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll see her if you come<br />
			</em>but (usually) prefer<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you come, 
			you'll see her</em><br />It is almost always essential to put a comma into the sentence if the fronted 
			adverbial contains a non-finite verb form or no verb at all:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to be sure to meet her, he went to the party<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoping to see her, he went to the party<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In hope of an encounter, he went to the party</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>disjuncts and conjuncts</strong></dt>
			<dd>Disjuncts and conjuncts, wherever they occur within the clause, are 
			separated by commas conventionally<em>:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It is, in my opinion, less than perfect<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She has, however, come round to the idea<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He will not change his mind, whatever you say<br />
			</em>See the 
			guide to adverbials linked in the list of related guides at the end, for more.<br />
			There are times when it is necessary to separate off the adverbial, 
			wherever it comes in the sentence, to avoid confusion, too.&nbsp; 
			For example, remove the commas from this to see what is meant.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He came to the party, hoping to see her, dressed in a gorilla suit</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>relative clauses</strong></dt>
			<dd>If the part of the sentence you are considering can be separated 
			off from the rest by putting brackets around it, it is non-integral 
			to the sense and/or is a non-defining relative clause so commas should 
			be used.&nbsp; See
			the guide to 
			relative clauses linked in the list of related guides at the end, for more.<br />
			So we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met the doctor, who lives near me, in the pub<br />
			</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			met the doctor who lives near me in the pub<br />
			</em>In the first, the fact that the doctor lives near me is 
			additional information; in the second, it defines which doctor we 
			mean.<br />
			Many other languages, incidentally, do not usually distinguish the two 
			types of relative clauses and word-processor grammar checkers are 
			mostly unable to distinguish.&nbsp; Most other European languages 
			require commas in all relative clauses.</dd>
			<dt><strong>in lists</strong></dt>
			<dd>Lists of anything and of any length are separated by commas.&nbsp; 
			Two items may also be connected with <em>and</em> with no comma 
			involved.&nbsp; If there are more than two items, the final comma is 
			optional (and called either the Oxford comma, incidentally, because 
			that is how the style was used by Oxford University Press, or a 
			serial comma).<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She slowly, carefully opened the parcel<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He took a long, deep drink<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			They went in, around(,) and through the garden without meeting<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			They can, may(,) and probably will(,) come to the party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She brought beer, cokes(,) and crisps.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She let herself in, unpacked the shopping, fed the cat(,) 
			and went to bed.<br />
			</em>The Oxford comma is also sometimes referred to as the Harvard 
			comma and, indeed, most American style guides insist on its use.<br />
			There are times when the use of the comma before <em>and</em> can be 
			helpful in avoiding ambiguity.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke confidentially to his old friends, John and Peter 
			and Fred<br />
			</em>may leave the reader wondering whether there are three old 
			friends or two as well as <em>Fred</em>.&nbsp; If the comma is 
			inserted, we get:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; He spoke confidentially to his old friends, John and Peter, 
			and Fred</em><br />
			the ambiguity is lessened at least because most people will assume 
			that the two old friends are <em>John and Peter</em> and <em>Fred</em> 
			does not fall into that category.<br />
			So, even if you do not normally use a serial comma, it is 
			recommended when any ambiguity is avoided by its use.<br />
			Regarding a comma before <em>etc.</em> there is some debate.&nbsp; 
			The line taken by this site is not to use a comma before the 
			abbreviation <em>etc.</em> because the <em>et</em> is Latin for <em>
			and</em> which would result in the use of a serial comma.&nbsp; This 
			site does not use a serial comma so the lack of a comma before <em>
			etc</em>. is consistent with that use.&nbsp; If you use a serial 
			comma, place one before <em>etc</em>., too.</dd>
			<dt><strong>adjectives and classifiers</strong></dt>
			<dd>Multiple adjectives are usually separated by commas so we get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a large, lanky boy</em><br />
			but classifiers are not separated from adjectives by commas so we 
			get:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a large, lanky university student</em><br />
			We can allow, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a beautiful, blue racing car</em><br />
			but not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *a beautiful, blue, racing car</em><br />
			See
			the guide to 
			adjectives linked in the list of related guides at the end, for more.</dd>
			<dt><strong>in apposition</strong></dt>
			<dd>If two items in a sentence denote the same thing (i.e. are 
			co-referential), they are in 
			apposition and are separated off by commas:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms. Smith, my landlady, has raised the rent<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			There are three animals, bears, snakes and tortoises, which 
			hibernate in this country<br />
			</em>There is an exception to the insertion of a comma in some 
			circumstances.&nbsp; When the proper name comes first, the insertion 
			is optional so we get:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jones the butcher is bringing the food<br />
			</em>not<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jones, the butcher, is bringing food.</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>subordination and coordination</strong></dt>
			<dd>When clauses of equal value are coordinated (with <em>and, but, 
			so that, for, yet, or, so</em>) commas are frequently omitted and 
			never obligatory.<br />
			When a main and dependent clause are joined by subordinating 
			conjunctions, commas are usually required.<br />
			We get, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll take you to the station and pick you up 
			when you get back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called for her but she was out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will drive you there(,) although you'll have to pay for the 
			petrol<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the weather was so awful(,) we stayed in the whole 
			day<br />
			</em>In other languages, such as those in the Slavic and Germanic 
			groups, commas are required with all subordinating clauses.&nbsp; 
			This leads to errors such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I think, she's going to be late.</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>salutations and sign-offs</strong></dt>
			<dd>Rules vary across languages and between varieties of the same 
			language but British English uses the comma after any salutation as 
			in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Mrs Jones,</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear John,</em><br />
			and after the conventional endings and sign-offs as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yours sincerely,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regards,</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			AmE prefers the salutation to be followed by a colon (see below).</dd>

			</table>
			<p>We can distinguish here between <em>a full stop</em> (technically 
			referring to the mark at the end of a sentence) and <em>an</em> <em>interpunct</em> 
			which falls not on the base line but in 
			the middle, vertically, of the character row.<br />
			Terminology varies and the full stop is also known as <em>a</em> <em>
			full point, a point, a period </em>or <em>a dot </em>depending on circumstances.&nbsp; 
			AmE usage is usually to refer to <em>a full stop</em> as<em> a 
			period</em>.&nbsp; In IT-speak, it is always <em>dot, </em>so <em>eltconcourse.com</em> is pronounced 
			as <em>e l t concourse dot com</em> (/iː.el.tiː.ˈkɒŋk.ɔːs.dɒt.ˈkɒm/).&nbsp; 
			In mathematics, whether the dot is raised or on the baseline, the 
			term is <em>point</em>.</p>
			<p>The <em>interpunct</em> is also known as the <em>middle dot, 
			middot </em>and <em>interpoint</em>.<br />
			Modern English usage has settled on a baseline point to indicate 
			decimals as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>5.6 </em>(<em>five and six tenths</em>)<br />
			but older usage had a raised point as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> 5&middot;6</em><br />
			for the same number.<br />
			In English, numbers following the decimal point are read 
			individually so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.87</em><br />
			is read as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>ten point eight seven</em><br />
			but in many languages, the convention is to use a comma to signal 
			the decimal and to say them as ordinary 
			numbers so<br />
			<em>10,87</em><br />
			would be read as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>ten comma eighty-seven</em></p>
			<p>English generally uses a comma to separate thousands so, for 
			example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3,100,000<br />
			</em>is<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three million, one hundred thousand</em><br />
			in most other languages that is written as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.100.000</em><br />
			The middle dot or interpunct is used in some languages to separate 
			words or the items in a list (see above).</p>
			<p>The full stop or period has a number of uses:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>at the end of a sentence</strong></dt>
				<dd>If a sentence is not a question or an exclamation, a full 
				stop or period is inserted to signal its end, like this.<br />
				In text messages and other short electronic texts, no end 
				punctuation is conventional with ideas being separated by 
				paragraph marks, instead.</dd>
				<dt><strong>between initials</strong></dt>
				<dd>This use is dying out but one still sees, e.g., both:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S.A.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.V.D</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.K.</em><br />
				etc. and the more modern and common:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The USA<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DVD</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The UK</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>separating initials</strong></dt>
				<dd>AmE usage prefers to separate initial with points such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T. S. Eliot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T. E. Lawrence</em><br />
				etc., with a space between the marks.<br />
				but BrE prefers usually to have no marks and will use:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TS Eliot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TE Lawrence</em><br />
				etc. with a space after the last initial.</dd>
				<dt><strong>ending abbreviations</strong></dt>
				<dd>AmE uses a period at the end of all abbreviations so we 
				have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fred Jones Jr.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Smith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Jones<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adj.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vb.</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				BrE has a more complicated rule:<br />
				If the abbreviation ends with the same letter as the 
				unabbreviated version, no mark is used so we have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fred Jones Jr<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Smith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Jones<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vb</em><br />
				but if the abbreviation does not end with the same letter, a 
				full stop is used as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Mary Smith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rev. Peters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adj.</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>in computing</strong></dt>
				<dd>The full point is a delimiter in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; punctuation.docx<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stop.txt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.168.1.4<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thispage.html</em><br />
				etc. and is always pronounced as <em>dot</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>in discourse</strong></dt>
				<dd>The words <em>full stop</em> and <em>period</em> (in BrE and 
				AME respectively) are used to signal the end of a willingness to 
				discuss something as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not paying for it.&nbsp; Full stop.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not coming.&nbsp; Period.</em></dd>

		<p>Colons are quite rare in English and perform three related

		<ol>
			<li>They indicate that what follows is caused or fulfilled by what 
			came before:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was raining heavily: that's why I didn't go out.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			You are obviously very tired: I should go now.<br />
			</em>In both those cases, the sentences can be split into two 
			independent sentences with no loss of meaning.</li>
			<li>They indicate that a list is to follow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sentence contains two each of these words: verbs, nouns, adjectives and 
			prepositions.<br />
			</em>In some analyses, a colon is only appropriate if the preceding 
			clause ends in a noun, so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need these ingredients: cheese, butter, 
			eggs, flour and sugar<br />
			</em>is correct, but:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We put in: cheese, butter, eggs, flour and 
			sugar<br />
			</em>is incorrect because the colon has been used unnecessarily 
			after a preposition and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need: cheese, butter, eggs, flour and 
			sugar<br />
			</em>is also incorrect because the colon is inserted after a verb.</li>
			<li>They indicate a subtitle, especially for a book or paper so we 
			get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using English punctuation: a users' guide</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>In American English, the colon is used following the salutation in 
		formal letters: <em>Dear Sir:.&nbsp; </em>British English prefers the 
		comma as in, <em>Dear Mary, </em>but other languages such as Russian and 
		Greek frequently use an exclamations mark as in: <em>Dear Customers!</em></p>
			<p>The colon can be replaced by a conjunct, conjunction or other 
		expression:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		It was raining heavily(,) so I didn't go out.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		It was raining heavily.&nbsp; Therefore, I didn't go out.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		It was raining heavily, which meant I didn't go out.<br />

		<p>Semi-colons connect two independent clauses but in other respects, 
		they function to separate ideas just as the comma does.&nbsp; They should 
		be used with care and only when the two clauses are sufficiently closely 
		related to be part of the same sentence.<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was getting soaked through; it was still raining hard.<br />
		</em>but not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was getting soaked through; the rain was easing<br />
		</em>Replacing a semi-colon with a comma results, usually, in a run-on 
		or comma-spliced sentence and is poor style at best, illiterate at 
		worst.</p>
			<p>Semi-colons are also sometimes used to separate two-level lists 
			with semi-colons between larger items and commas between members of 
			the same class within the larger items.&nbsp; That way, confusion 
			can be avoided as in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took my friend, John; his brother, Pete; 
			their parents, Joan and Fred and the neighbours out to dinner on my 
			birthday.<br />
			</em>where, without the semi-colons we would not know that Pete is 
			John's brother's friend, not a separate person and so on.</p>

		<p>Dashes and brackets can be used instead of commas if there's a good 
		reason for doing so.&nbsp; Dashes, in particular, should be handled with 
		care and not used to separate fronted adverbials (and nor should 
		brackets be used that way).&nbsp; So these are unconventional at least:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately &ndash; the rain was easing<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The rain was &ndash; fortunately &ndash; easing<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		(Fortunately) the rain was easin</em>g<br />
		There is sometimes a subtle difference between separating ideas with 
		commas and putting the item in brackets.&nbsp; Brackets are usually taken by 
		the reader to refer to comment on the last phrase but commas are taken 
		to refer to the whole preceding clause.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He first had the idea when he was a child (he 
		claims)</em><br />
		with<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He first had the idea when he was a child, he 
		claims</em><br />
		The brackets denote the fact that it the fact that he was a child when 
		he had the idea that is being questioned but the commas call the whole 
		clause, i.e., <em>that he had the idea as a child</em>, into question.<br />
		Round brackets are also used to indicate alternatives as in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your child(ren) must come on time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any helper(s) will be made welcome</em></p>
			<p>There is a variety of other bracketing conventions including [], 
			{} and &lt;&gt; and they have different uses.<br />
			In particular, square brackets may be used to embed parentheses 
			within parentheses so we get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is (as you have said [but not included 
			in your report]) 
			a serious issue.</em><br />
			They are also used to indicate an insertion, usually by an editor, 
			in a citation so we get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The assumption [which] he made was 
			unwarranted</em><br />
			Square brackets when a quotation has been altered to make the sense 
			clear or the grammar correct, are used for insertions and changes so we see, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, "[The fire] was awful"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru has commented, "[The exercise is] undoable."</em><br />
			and in both cases, the original speaker or writer might have said<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was awful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these exercises are undoable<br />
			</em>so the writer has had to expand the quotation.</p>
			<p>Brace brackets are used to indicate alternative insertions as in, 
			e.g.,<br />
			<img alt="brace" height="75" src="../imagesgraphics/brace.png" width="250" /></p>
			<p>In all cases, closing brackets must always be used.<br />
			If the brackets enclose a whole sentence, the full stop appears 
			within them.&nbsp; If the brackets do not enclose the whole sentence 
			the full stop follows the bracket.</p>
			<p>Dashes are often used instead of brackets but, as with brackets, 
			they must be used in pairs (unless the part following the dash ends 
			the sentence).<br />
			Dashes may be symbolised as -, a simple hyphen, –, an en-dash or —, 
			an em-dash.</p>
			<p>The use of a colon followed by dash (<em>:&ndash;</em>) to precede a list is 
			now obsolete and replaced by the colon alone (see above for the 
			limitations and restrictions) although it is frequently used in 
			standard Indian English texts.</p>

			<p>There are a number of uses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To show that a word has been split at the end of a line.&nbsp; 
				Normally, the hyphen should only be inserted between syllables 
				although house compositors' rules vary from publisher to 
				publisher.</li>
				<li>In written numbers and fractions:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thirty-three, 
				eighty-four, two-thirds, five-sixths<br />
				</em>etc.</li>
				<li>After certain prefixes, especially less frequent ones such 
				as <em>pseudo-, quasi-, post-</em> etc.&nbsp; It is not inserted 
				after commoner prefixes such as <em>ex-, pre-, super- </em>etc. 
				unless the word so formed is very unusual.&nbsp; The convention 
				of using a hyphen when the next morpheme begins with the same 
				letter as the final one of the prefix is dying out so we 
				commonly see <em>cooperate, reenter</em> etc. rather than <em>
				co-operate, re-enter</em>.</li>
				<li>Following the first part of a compound when two related 
				compounds are used as in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the second- and third-placed 
				runners<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the super- and sub-script letters<br />
				</em>etc.</li>
				<li>Compound nouns are variably hyphenated, written as two words 
				or written as solid words and users, publishers, spell-checkers 
				and dictionaries differ.&nbsp; We see, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; windmill, wind-mill, wind mill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gas light, gas-light, gaslight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oceangoing, ocean-going, ocean going</em><br />
				The rule of thumb is that as a combination becomes more frequent 
				the direction of movement is from two words to a hyphenated 
				version to a solid word.&nbsp; Over the years we get the change, 
				for example, from<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; loud speaker</em><br />
				to<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; loud-speaker</em><br />
				to<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; loudspeaker</em><br />
				and, as the spelling changes, so the pronunciation changes, 
				moving the stress from the second to the first item in the 
				compound (/laʊd.ˈspiːkə/ &rarr; /ˈlaʊd.ˈspiːkə/ → /ˈlaʊd.spiːkə/.</li>
				<li>As an abbreviation for <em>to</em> as in, e.g.: <em>the 
				1914-18 war, 16-24 seats</em> etc.&nbsp; In this case, it is 
				common to insert a short en-dash (&ndash;) or em-dash (&mdash;) 
				as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>1943 – 1945<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1943 &mdash; 1945<br />
				</em>instead of<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1943-1945</em> etc.<br />
				en- and em-dashes may or may not be preceded and followed by a 
				space.&nbsp; On this site, we include the spaces, others do not.</li>
				<li>To link two items as in, e.g.: <em>the Smith-Jones match, Mr 
				Rees-King, the London-Paris flight</em> etc.&nbsp; En- and em-dashes 
				are also used this way.</li>
				<li>With double adjectives to signal that they should be 
				considered a single concept as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the red-brick house<br />
				vs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the red, brick house</em></li>
				<li>With other compound expressions used adjectivally or as 
				classifiers, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an up-to-date list<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a hole-in-the-corner relationship</em></li>
				<li>Some currency expressions also include the use of a hyphen, 
				notably in India so 50 rupees is written as <em>Rs 50/- </em>or 
				as<em> Rs 50/=.<br />
				</em>In Britain, pre-decimal (i.e., before 1970) amounts of 
				money also used this convention so two shillings was 
				conventionally written as <em>2/-</em> and this convention was 
				also used in many other nations before any currency reform.</li>

		<p>Most writers in English use double inverted commas for direct speech 
		but some prefer single marks.&nbsp; Whichever is used, the opening and 
		closing marks are both raised.&nbsp; As we saw above, languages are very 
		variable in this regard.</p>
			<p>For a direct quotation within a sentence, single inverted commas are 
		usual:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That sign says 'No smoking'</em><br />
		Publishing houses vary in their conventions concerning the use of double or 
		singular inverted commas for dialogue.&nbsp; The usual convention is:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm glad we could meet," she said</em> (comma inside the inverted 
		commas) or<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, "I'm glad we could meet."</em> (comma after 
		the reporting verb 
		but with the full stop inside the inverted commas).<br />
		If either ! or ? occur inside quotations, no comma or capital letter 
		follows:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go away!" he shrieked.<br />
		</em>In the USA, single inverted commas often mark off direct speech in 
		texts and in Britain, the convention is to use double inverted commas.<br />
		Single inverted commas are conventional in both varieties for the names 
		of programmes, books, films etc., e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sang 'Keep the Home 
		Fires Burning' again.</em></p>
			<p>Conventions vary concerning whether full stops and commas are 
			placed within or outside the inverted commas and many word 
			processing programs allow the user to set the preferences.<br />
			In AmE, it is common to find the full stop or comma outside the 
			inverted commas so we get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go away", he said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary said, "Come in".<br />
			</em>In BrE, that would be punctuated as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go away," he said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary said, "Come in."<br />
			</em>Logic sometimes dictates that the ? goes outside the inverted 
			commas so we get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May I come, too?" she said<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she say, "May I come, too"?<br />
			</em>Occasionally, two ? marks may appear as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she say, "Can I come?"?</em></p>
			<p>When reporting conversations verbatim in direct speech, any 
			change of speaker should be signalled by a new paragraph.<br />
			If a speaker's lines go over two or more paragraphs, the inverted 
			commas are not closed until the end but each new paragraph begins 
			with them.</p>

		<p>The <em>?</em> is, rather obviously, used to show an interrogative but may 
		also be used to show how something has been said in terms of its 
		intonation, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're leaving early?<br />
		</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're leaving 
		early.</em><br />
		Some sentences with subordinate clauses may lose the questions mark 
		(although it is technically required) when the clause is long enough:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you send me an email when you have finished all the work because 
		I need to get my bank to transfer the money into my French account 
		before the end of the financial year.<br />
		</em>The <em>!</em> is tonal rather than grammatical and signals a sharply rising 
		tone or a loudly spoken item.&nbsp; The mark is often used with single 
		words to show that something has been forcefully said.&nbsp; For 
		example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gosh!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blimey!</em><br />
		etc.<br />
		Exclamations marks should not be overused!&nbsp; They are a sign of 
		naive or immature writing!!!<br />
		In English, it is no longer conventional to have a space before either 
		of these marks but in many other languages the convention of doing so is 
		maintained.</p>

		<p><strong>For the genitive</strong> (or possessive to be a lot less precise):</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Singular nouns which do not end in <em>-s</em> take <em>'s</em> to show 
			possession: <em>the man's bicycle, Peter's friend</em> etc.</li>
			<li>Singular nouns which end in <em>-s</em> can be amended both with a simple 
			<em>'</em> or with <em>'s</em> (conventions in publishing houses vary): 
			<em>James' car </em>or 
			<em>James's car, the class' teacher</em> or <em>the class's teacher</em>.<br />
			Pronunciation varies too, with some preferring /dʒeɪmzɪz kɑː/ and 
			others preferring /dʒeɪmz kɑː/ with a middle road of /dʒeɪmzəz kɑː/.</li>
			<li>Plural nouns ending in <em>-s</em> (i.e., most of them) take a simple 
			<em>'</em> 
			after the <em>s</em>: <em>the neighbours' garden, the soldiers' position</em> 
			etc.</li>
			<li>Plural nouns not ending in <em>-s</em> take <em>'s</em>: <em>the men's jobs, the 
			formulae's solutions, the syllabi's main faults, the children's toys</em> 
			etc.</li>
			<li>If two separate entities are imagined, both take the apostrophe:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John's and Peter's houses are in London<br />
			</em>so there are two separate 
			houses<br />
			but in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John and Peter's house is in London<br />
			</em>there is a single 
			house belonging to two people.<br />
			and in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John and Peter's houses are 
			in London<br />
			</em>there is more than one house belonging to the same two 
			people.<br />
			This is called the phrasal genitive, incidentally, and the guide to 
			the genitive has more examples.</li>
			<li>Compound nouns add the apostrophe to the end element:<br /><em>my 
			father in law's house<br />
			my step-sister's houses<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>For contractions</strong>:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>All contracted forms require an apostrophe:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you're [you 
			are], he's [he is], they'll [they will], the horse'll [the horse 
			will]<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>Contracted (i.e. clipped) forms of some words and numbers 
			sometimes take an apostrophe but some clipped forms&nbsp;are so 
			embedded in the language that they have lost it:<br /><em>the '90s </em>(also without the apostrophe)<br /><em>on 
			the 'phone </em>(also without the apostrophe)<br /><em>'flu' </em>(usually without the apostrophes)<br /><em>ad, maths, photos, sitcom, pub</em> (all usually without apostrophes)<br />
			etc.</li>
			<li>Representations of dialect forms also take apostrophes where 
			needed:<br /><em>huntin', shootin' an' fishin'<br />
			'old yer 'orses<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Common apostrophe errors</strong>:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The word <em>its</em> is the possessive determiner formed from
			<em>it</em> and it takes no apostrophe:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cat licked its paws<br />
			</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it's lying in the garden</em>.<br />
			in which the apostrophe denotes the omission of the 'i' in the verb.</li>
			<li>
				<em>one's</em> is the possessive determiner form of <em>one</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			one must try to do one's best<br />
				ones</em> is the plural pronoun form of <em>one</em> meaning 
				referring to nouns and takes no apostrophe:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want the blue one not any of the red 
				ones</em></li>
			<li><em>your</em> is the possessive determiner (<em>your car</em> 
			etc.).&nbsp; <em>you're</em> is the contraction of <em>you are</em></li>
			<li><em>whose </em>is the possessive relative pronoun and <em>wh-question</em> word:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose car is this?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he's the man whose car I hit<br />
			who's 
			</em>is the contracted form of <em>who 
			is / who has</em>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who's done the damage?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who's coming?</em></li>
			<li><em>what's </em>is a contraction of <em>what 
			has, what does <span class="auto-style67">and</span> what is</em> 
			as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>What's he done?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's he do?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's its name?</em></li>
			<li>Abbreviations in the plural do not take apostrophes:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DVDs, 
			TVs, PCs, HDDs<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			In the possessive or with 
			contractions, they function as above:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the DVD's broken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the PC's 
			problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the HDDs' capacities<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>The reciprocal pronouns <em>each other</em> and <em>one another</em> 
			are both robustly singular so the genitive apostrophe use should 
			reflect this.&nbsp; So:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We spent time at each others' houses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We went to one anothers' houses</em><br />
			are incorrect and should be<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We spent time at each other's houses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went to one another's houses</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Disputed areas</strong> (you choose):</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Numbers: we can have <em>the 90's</em> or <em>the 90s</em> or 
			even <em>the '90's</em> or <em>the '90s</em>.</li>
			<li>Letters: is spelt with two<em> t's</em> or with two<em> 't's</em> 
			or with two <em>"t"s</em> or, rarely, with two <em>ts</em>.</li>

		<p>Conventionally, three dots only are all that is required to show that 
		something has been omitted.&nbsp; The omission may be deliberate (as in 
		leaving out irrelevance in a citation) or because it betokens, in

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The possibilities which were mentioned ... were all 
		rejected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may come to the party.&nbsp; Who can say ...<br />
		</em>Publishing houses vary on whether an ellipsis is preceded by a 
		space so both:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can tell you what to do...</em><br />
		and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can tell you what to do ...</em><br />

		<p>The backslash is generally confined to computer file systems and can 
		be ignored (although some students may need to know how to say it 
		aloud).<br />
		The forward slash needs a little care because it sometimes means <em>
		and,</em> sometimes <em>or</em> and sometimes <em>and</em> or <em>or</em>.&nbsp; 
		If it is not clear from the context, you should avoid its use and use 
		the conjunctions.<br />
		So, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any written / spoken text<br />
		</em>means the text can be either but<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This can be completed with a sentence and/or a 
		single word<br />
		</em>implies that both options are possible but that they are exclusive: 
		choose one or the other.&nbsp; However:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's the owner/manager</em><br />
		implies not either or but both.&nbsp; To disambiguate such expressions, 
		many writers prefer to use a hyphen to denote combined roles as in, 
		e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's the actor-director</em><br />
		More rarely, the slash is referred to as<em> stroke</em> or <em>oblique</em>.<br />
		It is commonly used to indicate a time scale overlapping years or months as in 
		e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the 2011/12 course<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Spring/Summer season<br />
		</em>etc.<br />
		Publishing houses and style guides vary in whether a space is used 
		before and after a slash mark.</p>

		<h2>A note on teaching punctuation</h2>
		<p>It is unlikely, and probably unnecessary, that you would devote whole 
		lessons to this area (although a focus on paragraphing conventionally in 
		texts is another matter).<br />
		However, the temptation is either to ignore or simply correct errors in 
		learners' written work and that's not enough.<br />
		You do need to explain to learners where their L1 conventions may differ 
		and make clear what the rules are in English concerning the punctuation 
		which is troubling them.</p>
