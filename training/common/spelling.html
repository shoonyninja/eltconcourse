		<p>We all make mistakes.&nbsp; There are three sorts above.&nbsp; Which

		<ol>

				<li>The first two pictures (<em>shcool</em> and <em>nohing</em>) are 
		just slips and they happen frequently.&nbsp; For the purposes of this 
		guide, we can ignore them because they have nothing to do with spelling 
		rules in English.</li>
				<li>The third picture (<em>excellense</em>) is the result of someone simply 
		not knowing how the word <em>excellence</em> is spelled in English.</li>
				<li>The quotations from the BBC, Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph websites are errors caused by the lack of 
		sound-spelling consistency in English.&nbsp; They are called homophone errors 
		because <em>toe</em> and <em>tow</em>,<em> break </em>and<em> brake </em>and<em> duel</em> 
		and<em> dual </em>sound the same but are differently 
		written and mean different things.&nbsp; News sites are a rich source 
		of such errors because many news stories are submitted by journalists 
		over the telephone.&nbsp; Another example, from the Daily Telegraph, sadly 
		since corrected, is the description of shelves which <em>"<span class="style_black">grown with 
		academic tomes</span>".</em></li>

		<p>Wrong.</p>
		<p>It is often claimed that English spelling is impossible, or at least 
		very difficult, to learn.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>English spelling is probably the most irregular spelling system of 
		all those based on the alphabetic system.&nbsp; Not only can't you tell 
		how to spell a word from hearing it spoken, you can't predict how a word 
		is spoken from the written word either</em></span>.<span class="auto-style3"><br />
		</span><span class="auto-style17">The English Spelling Society</span></p>
		<p>In fact, that is only very partially right because there are clear connections between how a word is pronounced 
		and its spelling despite the fact, which is not arguable, that there are 
		numerous exceptions.<br />
		It is also not a very well-informed opinion because many other languages 
		have a deep orthography (see below) in which the connections between 
		sound and spelling are difficult always to discern.<br />
		Among other languages with a deep orthography like English are, 
		incidentally, Korean (in which only one consonant is pronounced as it is 
		written), Hungarian, Mongolian, Thai and French.<br />
		Even Italian, which has a shallow, i.e., predictable, spelling system 
		has areas of full unpredictability.</p>
		<p><a name="1"></a>To see how intuition and the application of simple rules allows you 
		to predict the sound of a word, try pronouncing these nonsense words.<br />

		<p>You have (probably) never heard the words before but it is a safe bet 
		that you can make a guess concerning their pronunciation and, moreover, 
		most speakers of English will make the <strong>same</strong> guesses.<br />
		It will also work in reverse and most speakers of English can readily 
		write down these words spelling them in the <strong>same</strong> way as other speakers.<br />
		That is a sign of the fact that sound-spelling for the majority of 
		English words is entirely consistent and predictable.&nbsp; Speakers of

		<p>If English really were a language with no predictable sound-spelling 
		consistency as the English Spelling Society claims, that would not have 
		been possible.</p></div>
		<p>To understand what follows, you need to understand that we are 
		considering <strong>sounds not letters</strong>.<br />
		So, for example, the single letter 'p' is represented as a 
		single sound (transcribed, i.e., written as /p/) and even a double 'p' 
		as in <em>pepper</em> still only has a single sound /p/ in the middle 
		and at the beginning.<br />
		Pairs of letters like <em>'</em>sh', 'ch', 'th', 'ck', 'sc' etc. are 
		also often only single sounds as they are in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>shave</em> (transcribed as /ʃeɪv/ with a single symbol 
		[/ʃ/] representing the first two letters)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>school</em> (transcribed as /skuːl/ with a single symbol 
		[/k/] representing 'ch')<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>this</em> (transcribed as /ðɪs/ with a single symbol 
		[/ð/] representing the first two letters)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sock</em> (transcribed as /sɒk/ with a single symbol 
		[/k/] representing the last two letters)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>science</em> (transcribed as /ˈsaɪəns/ with a single 
		symbol [/s/] representing the first two letters)</p>

			Consonant-Vowel-Consonant principle or CVC.&nbsp; It is adhered to 
			in thousands of words and knowing it allows us to predict from the 
			spelling how, for example, all of the following will be pronounced.&nbsp; 
			The CVC principle also allows us to infer the spelling from the 
			sound, even if we have never heard the word.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>combat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; habitat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brickbat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; humdrum</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>driven</em><br />
			and innumerable more words.</li>
			<li>long vowels are represented in two ways:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>by inserting a vowel, often 'e' or 'i', after the consonant: <em>bite, bate, site, 
				stating, hate, kite, cute, driving </em>and so on.&nbsp; This is the 
			Vowel-Consonant-Vowel (VCV) principle.</li>
				<li>by inserting a second vowel letter before the consonant: <em>beat, boat, 
			heat</em> etc.&nbsp; This is the Consonant-Vowel-Vowel-Consonant (CVVC) principle.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Applying to these two principles, along with principle a., allows us 
		to predict how another huge range of words will be pronounced, 
		including, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confuse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dreaming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skating<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defeated<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; considerable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; displeasing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contracting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disambiguation</em><br />
		and thousands more.&nbsp; Again, this will work in reverse: we can make 
		a very good guess at the spellings of these words when we hear them by 
		applying the principles.</p>
			<p>In summary, these three rules are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>CVC: when a single vowel occurs between two consonants, it 
				will be a short sound and that allows us to predict the sound 
				and spelling of, e.g., <em>cat, bat, mat, hatch, flat, fit </em>
				and thousands more</li>
				<li>VCV: when a consonant occurs between two vowels the first 
				vowel sound will be long and that allows us to predict the sound 
				and spelling of, e.g., <em>Kate, bate, mate, inflate, fate, 
				dispute,</em> and thousands more</li>
				<li>CVVC: when two vowels appear between two consonants, the 
				vowel sound, however spelled, will be long and that allows us to 
				predict the sound of, e.g., <em>beat, seat, meet, fleet, boot, 
				cruise, loose, relieve</em> and thousands more</li>
			</ol>
		<p>No English words other than a few colloquial abbreviations ends in 'v' so we always have a following 'e': 
			<em>thieve, save, shave</em> etc.&nbsp; This makes the vowel long, 
		because the VCV rule (above) acts.<br />
		For the rare abbreviations, the CVC rules applies so we pronounce <em>
		rev, spiv </em>and <em>guv</em> with a short vowel.</p>
		<p>There are <strong>exceptions </strong>(of course) and they are 
		common words, usually.&nbsp; They include:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come, done, give, gone, have, live, love, none, one, some</em><br />
		All these have short vowels but end VCV.&nbsp; They are quite simple to 
		learn and learners usually have little trouble pronouncing or spelling 
		them.</p>

		<p>OK, so spelling in English is tough because a) there are lots of 
		confusing rules and b) even when you have mastered the rules, there's 
		always an exception.&nbsp; If you look back at the list above, you can 
		probably find an exception to every single rule.<br />
		English spelling is something of a mess because of its history:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>Early printers were often not native speakers of English, even 
			in England, and the influence of Dutch (their first language, 
			frequently) is seen in, e.g., the insertion of the 'h' in <em>ghost</em>.&nbsp; 
			(Even Caxton, the first well known English printer, had spent 30 
			years outside the country and his grasp of English writing 
			conventions was 
			shaky.)</li>
			<li>English has a higher proportion than most languages of what are 
			called loan words (i.e., words imported from other languages).&nbsp; 
			This means that spelling in English sometimes follows the 
			conventions of Scandinavian languages, French, Latin or Greek among 
			others.&nbsp; Words may retain their spelling but the pronunciation 
			is often Anglicized so the mismatch between spelling and 
			pronunciation arises.&nbsp; The notoriously varied pronunciation of 
			<em>ough</em> (<em>cough, rough, thought, plough, through</em> etc.) is a product of this sort of confusion.</li>
			<li>English does not have a regulating authority to rule on correct 
			spelling or introduce reforms.&nbsp; French and Spanish have 
			and many other languages, German, Portuguese, Norwegian etc. have 
			undergone repeated reforms to try to simplify and codify the 
			spelling of words (often in the teeth of considerable opposition).&nbsp; 
			There are hundreds of such academies around the world, all devoted 
			to formalising, correcting and sometimes reforming the way a 
			language is used and written.&nbsp; For example, we have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Académie française for French<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nederlandse Taalunie for Dutch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rat für deutsche Rechtschreibung for German<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Institut d'Estudis Catalans for Catalan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Accademia della Crusca for Italian<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española for Spanish<br />
			and even<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pontifical Academy for Latin<br />
			as well as at least 12 focused on Arabic of various forms.<br />
			English has never had such an academy (although some have tried to 
			start one) so the language remains unreformed.&nbsp; The sole 
			exception is South African English, by the way (The English Academy 
			of Southern Africa).</li>
			<li>English is spoken as a first or second language by around a 
			billion people and it is an official language in around 60 
			countries.&nbsp; There are small but significant differences in 
			spelling around the world.&nbsp; It is not only a difference 
			between British and American spellings, either.&nbsp; Canadian 
			English, for example, generally prefers <em>color</em> to <em>colour</em> 
			but retains the British <em>centre</em> instead of the American <em>
			center</em>.&nbsp; Indian English usually prefers to follow British 
			spelling conventions as does Australian English (at least nowadays) 
			despite Australians normally using an American computer keyboard layout, by the 
			way.</li>

		<h2>Spelling reform</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>We noted above that apart from South African English, no variety 
			of English has any kind of official body to oversee its usage and 
			form.&nbsp; That has not, however, stopped people from trying to 
			reform what they see as an inconsistent system which is hard to 
			learn and inefficient.<br />
			The arguments behind reform range from making education less time 
			consuming, reducing the amount of printing required (and the amount 
			of paper used), enhancing the use of English as an international <em>
			lingua franca</em> and so on.<br />
			In an effort to make the spelling system easier to learn and enhance 
			the utility of English most reformists focused on making spelling 
			more representative of its pronunciation.&nbsp; For the flaw in that 
			principle, see below.</p>
			<p>In the 16th and 17th centuries a number of attempts to reform the 
			spelling of English were made, none of which met with much success 
			primarily because they were cumbersome and based on a poor 
			understanding of phonology.<br />
			However, the modern spelling of some words was successfully 
			introduced in the 17th century in a minor way with, for example, the 
			spelling of <em>war</em> as <em>warre</em> and <em>town</em> as <em>
			toune</em> falling out of fashion.<br />
			Unfortunately, a number of other reforms were introduced around the 
			same time to make the sound-spelling relationships in English even 
			more obscure so, for example, a silent<em> b</em> was 
			introduced into words such as <em>debt, doubt</em> and <em>subtle</em> 
			to match the presumed Latin origins of the words and a silent <em>c</em> 
			was introduced into words such as <em>scissors</em>.<br />
			Many of these disimprovements were the result of ignorance so, for 
			example, the Old English <em>ake</em> was reformed to <em>ache</em> 
			on the mistaken assumption that it was cognate with the Greek word 
			and the silent <em>s</em> was inserted into <em>island</em> on the 
			basis of a similar error concerning the Latin word.</p>
			<p>Nothing much was achieved until the 19th century when the 
			scientific study of phonemics began to be established.&nbsp; Noah 
			Webster published his first dictionary in 1806 and many of the 
			spelling reforms he suggested then and in later works have become 
			standard in American (and other) varieties of English so we get, 
			e.g., the distinctions between <em>centre / centre, programme / 
			program</em> and so on (see below for more examples).<br />
			Other 19th century attempts to reform the spelling of English 
			foundered on the rock of general resistance or public indifference 
			so words such as <em>call, spelling, well, drill </em>and so on 
			retain the redundant doubled letter <em>l</em> and other words such 
			as <em>are, give, make, given</em> and so on retain the silent <em>e</em>.&nbsp; 
			Silent letters in words such as <em>although, though, through</em> 
			and so on have also resisted attempts to spell them as <em>altho, 
			tho, thru </em>etc. but some are in colloquial and informal use to 
			this day.<br />Other attempts to reform the spelling of, e.g., <em>mixed</em> 
			as <em>mixt</em> also met with no success.</p>
			<p>In the early 20th century, efforts continued to reform the 
			spelling of English and, in the UK, the Simplified Spelling Society 
			(now the English Spelling Society) was founded in 1908 and had some 
			early success in attracting high-profile individuals such as George 
			Bernard Shaw into its ranks.<br />
			In the USA, the Simplified Spelling Board was founded in 1906 with a 
			similar agenda and also attracted important supporters such as 
			Andrew Carnegie, who provided very considerable funding.&nbsp; In 
			1919, Carnegie died without leaving the Board any inheritance and, 
			without funding, it expired the following year.<br />
			Neither organisation has had any appreciable effect on the spelling 
			of Modern English on either side of the Atlantic despite the support 
			of famous figures, among them Charles Darwin, Isaac Asimov, H. G. 
			Wells, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Charles Dickens, Mark Twain and 
			Benjamin Franklin.&nbsp; Even major publishers have been unable to 
			influence change so, although the Chicago Tribune adopted reformed 
			spelling in 1934, it was virtually alone in doing so and 
			discontinued the habit slowly over the next 40 years.&nbsp; Theodore 
			Roosevelt, President of the USA from 1901 to 1909, was also an 
			enthusiastic advocate of reform and was widely mocked for it, too.</p>
			<p>Efforts over the years have varied from focusing on just a few 
			common words whose spelling is seen in need of reform and that has 
			often seen some small successes (hence the modern spelling of <em>
			fantasy</em> instead of <em>phantasy</em>, for example) to 
			suggesting wide-ranging and radical reforms.&nbsp; In the latter 
			case, the Simplified Spelling Board in the United States of America 
			suggested, for example:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style58">

			</table>
			and hundreds more following the same principles.<br />
			None has been accepted.</p>
			<p>Informally, in fact, some spelling reform has taken place in 
			English without the deliberate efforts of reformists.&nbsp; So, for 
			example, <em>music</em> and <em>basic </em>have lost the final <em>
			k,</em> (<em>musick, basick</em>), many words once spelled with an
			<em>our, </em>such as <em>erruor,</em> are now spelled with the 
			simplified -<em>or</em> ending as <em>error</em>, and those which 
			were once spelled with an -<em>re</em> ending, such as <em>chambre</em>, 
			are now spelled with the simpler -<em>er</em> ending as <em>chamber</em>.<br />
			American spelling has taken this a step further than British 
			spelling conventions allow.</p>
			<p>At the extreme end of the reform spectrum come attempts to invent 
			a wholly new alphabet in which English words could be phonemically 
			spelled.&nbsp; George Bernard Shaw left money in his will for this 
			endeavour but the Shavian Alphabet of nearly 50 characters, which 
			bear no resemblance at all to the Latin alphabet in which English is

		<p>One advantage of having a rather odd spelling system is that 
		meaning can often be inferred from spelling.&nbsp; For example, in 
		English, these three words are pronounced the same (they are 
		homophones):</p>
		<p class="auto-style40"><span class="style_black"><em><span class="auto-style7">rite, write, 
		right</span></em></span></p>
		<p>But, because of the different spellings, we can easily see which are 
		connected to the following words and if we know the base word, we can 
		have a good stab at inferring the meaning of the others:</p>
		<p class="auto-style40"><span class="auto-style8"><em>written, ritual, rightness, rights, 
		writing, rites, righteous</em></span></p>
		<p>Reforming English spelling would mean that this handy reference 
		would disappear and all three words would probably be spelled <em>rite</em>.<br />
		Spelling and 
		meaning, in English, are connected and that means, too, the many other 
		homophones such as <em>knightly</em> and <em>nightly</em> are 
		distinguishable by the orthography rather than being spelled 
		identically.<br />
		Spelling reform, many argue, would result in a loss.&nbsp; English, they point out, is not
		<span class="style_underline">meant</span> to have a phonetic spelling 
		system.<br />
		So, next time your students despair of being able to spell correctly, 
		it may be worth pointing this out.</p>
		<p>Another thing to point out to despairing learners is that native 
		speakers also have trouble.&nbsp; We often see, for example, <em>dessicate, 
		acommodation</em> (or <em>accomodation</em>), <em>embarass, wierd, definately</em> and so on.<br />
		You, of course, can correct all those.</p>

		<p>The term diacritic refers to the accent marks which exist in many languages and show a 
		difference in pronunciation (or used to).<br />
		Modern English retains the use of some accent marks on imported words, 
		almost always those from French, but it is often a matter of personal 
		taste.&nbsp; Using <em>role</em> instead of <em>r&ocirc;le</em> is 
		common and <em>h&ocirc;tel</em> is almost never seen, for example.&nbsp; 
		However, in other cases, words more recently or more obviously borrowed 
		from French retain the accents: <em>cliché, caf&eacute;, vis-&agrave;-vis, 
		tête-&agrave;-tête </em>etc.<br />
		When there is a possibility of ambiguity, the convention is to retain 
		the accent markers, so we have <em>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</em> and <em>
		resume</em>.<br />
		Loan words from other languages usually get stripped of their 
		diacritics, although <em>&uuml;ber</em> from German is seen alongside <em>
		uber</em>.&nbsp; The words <em>doppelganger</em> and <em>doppelgänger</em> 
		are in free variation and English usually removes the capital letter 
		obligatory in German on all nouns.&nbsp; The Turkish <em>döner</em> <em>
		kebap</em> is almost always spelled as <em>doner kebab</em> in English.<br />
		The dieresis signalled by two dots over a vowel to denote a separate 
		pronunciation rather than a diphthong is becoming rarer and it does not 
		appear on most computer keyboards so, for example, <em>naive</em> and
		<em>naïve</em> are both seen.&nbsp; The mark appears over the second of 
		two vowels unless it is intended to signify that the final vowel is not 
		silent (as, for example in Brontë).&nbsp; It is retained on many proper 
		names so we see, for example, <em>Chloë, Eloïse, Zoë, Noël, Raphaël </em>
		etc.<br />
		Some publications, notably the New Yorker, retain the mark for 
		separately pronounced vowels in, e.g., <em>reëntry and coöperate</em> 
		but this is increasingly rare and inconsistent.</p>

		<p>English (BrE) and American spelling (AmE) differ as everyone knows 
		but the differences are not huge.&nbsp; The number of words affected is 
		probably fewer than 400.&nbsp; (Given that the 20-volume Oxford English 
		Dictionary contains entries for 171,476 words in current use, and the 
		Oxford website estimates that there are at least 250,000 distinct words 
		in English, that 
		represents a tiny proportion, less than 0.25%.)<br />
		In most cases, the AmE variant is simpler and rooted in Noah Webster's 
		concern to eliminate inconsistencies.&nbsp; In this he was only 
		partially successful.<br />
		Here are the most commonly cited differences with the BrE version given 
		first followed by the AmE version:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="greybullet"><strong><em>o</em> or <em>ou</em></strong><br />
			the 'u' is omitted for the BrE <em>
			colour, favour, parlour </em>etc. to give <em>color, flavor, parlor</em> etc.&nbsp; 
			In fact, the spelling without the 'u' was the normal one in Britain 
			until Shakespeare's time.&nbsp; By the way, <em>glamour</em> is 
			spelled the same in both varieties and both varieties use only -<em>or</em> 
			for people and scientific nouns such as <em>governor, tremor</em> 
			etc.</li>
			<li class="greybullet"><strong>final <em>e</em></strong><br />
			final 'e' is dropped from words like <em>
			axe</em> and when adding a suffix which makes the 'e' silent as in
			<em>ageing</em> (BrE) and <em>aging</em> (AmE).&nbsp; Note, however, 
			that both varieties usually keep the 'e' when losing it would affect 
			the pronunciation of the preceding consonant so both BrE and AmE 
			have <em>changeable, traceable</em> etc.&nbsp; BrE does in fact 
			often drop the 'e' in words like <em>lovable, movable, provable</em> 
			etc.</li>
			<li class="greybullet"><strong>silent endings</strong><br />
			likewise the final silent vowels on words 
			like <em>catalogue</em> and <em>dialogue</em> are dropped to get the AmE <em>
			catalog</em> and <em>dialog</em>.&nbsp; (This does not happen with
			<em>tongue</em> which is spelled the same in both varieties.)</li>
			<li class="greybullet"><strong><em>m</em> or <em>mme</em></strong><br />
			words in BrE which end '-mme' usually end 
			simple '-m' in AmE: <em>programme, program</em> is the only obvious example but 
			some British English speakers use <em>kilogramme</em> and <em>telegramme</em>.&nbsp; 
			That is becoming quite rare.</li>
			<li class="greybullet"><strong>-<em>re</em> or -<em>er</em></strong><br />
			words ending '-re' in BrE are generally 
			spelled with '-er' in AmE: <em>centre, center, fibre, fiber, calibre, 
			caliber</em> etc.</li>
			<li class="greybullet"><strong>-<em>ce</em> or -<em>se</em></strong><br />
			words which end with '-ce' in BrE will 
			often end with '-se' in AmE: <em>defence, defense, offence, offense</em> 
			etc.</li>
			<li class="greybullet"><strong>verb-noun differences</strong><br />
			when BrE distinguishes between the noun 
			(e.g., <em>practice, licence</em>) and the verb (e.g., <em>practise, 
			license</em>), AmE does not, preferring the '-ce' ending for all.</li>
			<li class="greybullet"><strong>-<em>ise</em> or -<em>ize</em></strong><br />
			BrE prefers, on the whole, '-ise' in 
			words like <em>organise</em> but both spellings are acceptable (the '-ize' 
			spellings are those preferred by Oxford University Press, for 
			example, and are preferred by many in synthetic verbs which are 
			formed from adjectives or nouns such as <em>decimalize, modernize</em> 
			etc.).&nbsp; AmE prefers '-ize' on such words although there are 
			exceptions in words like <em>advertise, comprise, exercise, 
			franchise, comprise </em>etc. due to the words' sources (they are 
			not synthetic verbs formed from nouns or adjectives).<br />
			The same 
			consideration affects the small number of words ending in '-yse' / 
			'-yze' where BrE prefers <em>analyse</em> and <em>paralyse</em>, 
			most AmE writers will use <em>analyze</em> and <em>paralyze</em>.&nbsp; 
			Nevertheless, all users still prefer the nouns to be <em>analysis</em> 
			and <em>paralysis</em> because of the way the first 's' is 
			pronounced (/s/ not /z/).<br />
			Some words, 
			such as <em>capsize</em> and <em>prize</em> are spelled with the 'z' 
			in both varieties.&nbsp; In fact, again, the '-ize' ending is the 
			older one and the '-ise' ending a relative newcomer.<br />
			The distinction between the endings has, in fact, nothing to do with 
			the pronunciation, which is unchanged whichever ending is preferred.&nbsp; 
			The distinction is grounded, instead, on the source of the words in 
			question.&nbsp; Those where the -<em>ize</em> ending are allowable 
			are derived from or share a heritage with French -<em>ise</em>, 
			Italian -<em>izare</em> and so on and are often based on Greek words 
			originally.&nbsp; This is the reason, for example, that <em>exercise</em> 
			may not be spelled as <em>*exercize</em>.&nbsp; The word does not 
			derive in the same way as, for example, <em>organise / organize</em> 
			but comes, instead, from the Old French <em>exercice</em>.<br />
			If you are unsure, therefore, whether to use -<em>ise</em> or -<em>ise</em>, 
			always choose -<em>ise</em>.<br />
			On this site, the usual choice is the '-<em>ise</em>' ending.</li>
			<li class="greybullet"><strong><em>-ct-</em> or -<em>x</em>-</strong><br />
			there is a small and not especially 
			interesting debate concerning the alternative spellings of, e.g.,
			<em>connection / connexion, inflexion / inflexion</em> and so on.&nbsp; 
			It was the case that BrE preferred the 'x' spelling but this is no 
			longer standard in most texts.&nbsp; The differences were due to 
			British users' insistence on complying with the words' Latin 
			etymologies.&nbsp; On this site, <em>inflexion</em> is spelled with the 
			'x' alternative but the forms are in free variation in other cases.&nbsp; (There are two exceptions: <em>complexion</em> 
			and <em>crucifixion</em> are spelled with 'x' in all varieties.)</li>
			<li class="greybullet"><strong><em>l</em> or <em>ll</em>, <em>p</em> 
			or </strong><strong><em>pp</em></strong><br />
			BrE doubles the final 'l' in, e.g., <em>
			label - labelled, cancel - cancelled</em> but AmE usually does not (<em>labeled, 
			canceled</em>).<br />
			The consonant 'p' very rarely receives the same treatment, being 
			doubled in BrE: <em>kidnapped, kidnaped, worshipped, worshiped</em> 
			but the double 'p' is also a standard AmE spelling.<br />
			When the morpheme ending in -<em>l</em> occurs in the middle or at the end of 
			words, the AmE spelling prefers a double l and BrE and single l in, 
			e.g.: <em>fulfil, fulfill, fulfilment, fulfillment, instalment, 
			installment, skilful, skillful, wilful, willful</em> etc.<br />
			Consonant doubling is optional and inconsistent in AmE but not so in 
			BrE and both varieties retain <em>rebuffed </em>and<em> rebelling</em>.<br />
			The words <em>parallelled</em> and <em>unparallelled</em> in BrE are 
			spelled as <em>paralleled</em> and <em>unparalleled</em> in AmE 
			although the AmE spelling is often seen in BrE texts and used 
			occasionally on 
			this site.</li>
			<li class="greybullet"><strong><em>ae, oe</em> or <em>e</em></strong><br />
			BrE 'ae' and 'oe' spellings on foreign 
			words are usually reduced to 'e' in AmE so we have <em>encyclopaedia</em> 
			and <em>encyclopedia, anaemia, anemia, foetus, fetus, manoeuvre, 
			maneuver</em> etc.&nbsp; The simpler spelling is 
			becoming more common in BrE.&nbsp; David Crystal's indispensible <em>
			Encyclopedia of Language</em> is spelled that way by its British 
			publishers, Cambridge University Press.</li>
			<li class="greybullet"><strong><em>en</em>- or <em>in</em>-</strong><br />
			This causative morpheme is usually spelled <em>in- </em>in AmE and 
			<em>en</em>- in 
			BrE.&nbsp; In British English, <em>inquiry</em> 
			means a formal investigation and <em>enquiry</em> means simply 
			questioning.&nbsp; In AmE, only <em>inquiry</em> exists.&nbsp; 
			Similarly, <em>insure</em> in British usage means <em>protect 
			against</em> and <em>ensure</em> means <em>make certain</em>.&nbsp; 
			In AmE usage, only <em>insure</em> is used.&nbsp; Other examples are
			<em>enclose, inclose, endorse, indorse</em>.</li>
			<li class="greybullet">There are some other minor, random 
			differences (BrE / AmE):<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>aeroplane / airplane<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aluminium / aluminum<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			cosy / cozy<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; storey / story 
			</em>(for a building)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cheque / check </em>(with a change in meaning from money order to bill)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; furore / furor</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grey / gray<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gaol / jail
			</em>(the latter is now ubiquitous in BrE and the former 
			considered old fashioned)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mould / mold<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			plough / plow<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speciality / specialty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sulphur / sulfur</em> (and derivatives: <em>sulphide</em>,
			<em>sulfide</em> etc.)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tyre / tire<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			jewellery / jewelry</em></li>
			<li class="greybullet">Hyphenation is less frequently used in 
			AmE than in BrE so we get, e.g.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; re-enter / reenter<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			pre-empt / preempt</em><br />
			and so on.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>As a rule of thumb, Commonwealth countries tend to follow the BrE 
		rules although Canadian use is more often influenced by AmE.</p>
		<p>There's no test on all this but there are plenty of spelling tests to

		<h2><a name="writing"></a>Writing systems</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>This survey of English spelling would not be complete (as far as 
		teaching the system is concerned) without some consideration of other 
		people's writing systems.<br />
		All written systems probably developed from an early pictographic system 
		in which the item referred to was represented by a picture (or icon) 
		recognisably depicting the word.&nbsp; The assumption is also made that 
		all European writing systems derive ultimately from the system in use in 
		Mesopotamia from around 4000BCE.&nbsp; So, for example, the sign for <em>
		mouth</em> could be interpreted as<em> mouth, speak, say, word</em> and 
		so on.<br />
		Later, when writing with wedge-shaped tools was adopted, the signs were 
		simplified to what is known as cuneiform but remained essentially 
		ideographic.&nbsp; Gradually, Sumerian took on some alphabetic 
		characteristics because the simplified cuneiform script was developed, 
		through what is known as the rebus principle, to make the sound of a 
		word stand for all instances of that sound in other words.&nbsp; For 
		example the symbol
		<img alt="eye" class="auto-style41" height="16" src="../../gfx/eyeopen.gif" width="16" /> 
		can be made to stand for <em>eye, I </em>and<em> aye</em>, and for the 
		same sound in words such as <em>ice, idle, belie, decry</em> and so on.<br />
		By the rebus principle, the famous<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be or not to be?</em><br />
		can be represented as:<br />
		<img alt="to be" height="75" src="../imagesgraphics/to_be310.gif" width="310" /><br />
		Ideographic and pictographic symbols are still very widely used, of 
		course, or you would know which was the appropriate toilet to use in a 
		culture whose language you don't speak but no modern languages rely on a 
		pictographic script.<br />
		Modern scripts, by contrast, rely on <strong>graphemes</strong> and they 
		are defined in two ways:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style4">
				<li>as the smallest units which represent a sound in a language 
				so, for example, in English:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>th</em> is the grapheme representing the /ð/ in <em>this</em> 
				and the /θ/ in <em>heath</em>.</li>
				<li>as the smallest recognisable units of the written system so, 
				in English:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>t</em> and <em>h</em> are separate graphemes.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You may encounter the word <strong>glyph</strong> which has a 
			connected meaning.&nbsp; A glyph is a readable unit of a writing 
			system and may not be a member of an alphabet in itself so, for 
			example, the letter <em>g i</em>n English can also be written as G 
			and g. &nbsp;The alternative ways to write the letter are 
			called alloglyphs.</p>
			<p>There are three fundamental sorts of writing systems which rely 
			on graphemes and glyphs:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Alphabetic systems<br />
			English has ostensibly an alphabetic system in which individual 
			letters represent individual sounds (phonemes) but, as we saw above, 
			spelling in English is not a good guide often to pronunciation and 
			vice versa.&nbsp; Some sounds in English are represented by digraphs 
			and even trigraphs so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>th</em> is <em>this</em> represents the single sound /ð/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sh</em> in <em>hush</em> represents /ʃ/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>ugh</em> in <em>cough</em> represents /f/<br />
			and so on.<br />
			English may be described as having deep 
			orthography.&nbsp; This means that the system is poor in 
			relation to shallow languages such as German or Serbo-Croat in which 
			there is a good correspondence between spelling and pronunciation.<br />
			Languages having a deep orthography include French, Mongolian, 
			Modern Greek and, of course, English.&nbsp; Languages with shallower 
			orthography include Spanish, Italian and Czech (and even Italian has 
			some notable irregularities).<br />
			Most European languages and many languages which have only recently 
			acquired a written form use an alphabetic system of writing although 
			scripts vary from Latin (in which this is written) through Greek and 
			Cyrillic to many other systems.&nbsp; For obvious reasons, 
			alphabetic systems are sometimes referred to as segmental systems 
			because each word can be broken down into sound segments.<br />
			Although many languages add a range of accents and diacritics to 
			letters to represent certain sounds there are only three alphabets 
			in use in Europe: Cyrillic, Greek and Latin.</li>
			<li>Syllabic systems<br />
			In these writing systems, each grapheme (i.e., independent symbol) 
			represents a syllable rather than a single sound.&nbsp; Examples 
			include Arabic, the Japanese Hiragana and Katakana scripts, Hebrew and Amharic 
			among others.&nbsp; Languages which deploy scripts like these 
			usually have a syllabary (i.e., the total number of available 
			syllables) which is quite limited.&nbsp; English would be ill-suited 
			to such as system as the number of possible syllables is well over 
			10,000 and each would require a separate grapheme to represent it.&nbsp; 
			Japanese, by contrast, makes do with around 100 syllables so the 
			language is suited to this form of written representation.<br />
			The Arabic script is used incidentally, for many other languages 
			unrelated to Arabic (or only distantly so).<br />
			Both Hebrew and Arabic are described as abjad scripts because vowels 
			are not separately represented.</li>
			<li>Logographic systems<br />
			In these systems, each word is represented by a single symbol (or 
			glyph).&nbsp; 
			The most obvious and famous examples are the Chinese languages and 
			these are the only common surviving languages to use a logographic 
			system.&nbsp; For example, the symbol
			<img alt="sun" height="12" src="../imagesgraphics/chinese_sun12x12.gif" width="12" /> 
			represents the concept of <em>sun</em> or <em>day</em>.&nbsp; 
			Egyptian hieroglyphics are another familiar form of logographic 
			writing (developed from a pictographic system).&nbsp; Chinese characters are extensively used in written 
			Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese.<br />
			Despite the fact that to be literate in Chinese it is necessary to 
			learn to recognise around 5000 symbols (which places something of a 
			strain on the educational system), the great advantage of the system 
			is that symbols represent meanings, not sounds, so, even though 
			various Chinese languages are not mutually comprehensible in the 
			spoken form, they are in the written form.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Each type of writing system is processed by readers in a different 
		way and there is good reason to suppose that these processing strategies 
		will, especially in the early stages of learning, be carried over to 
		attempts to read in English.&nbsp; For example, Arabic speakers may be 
		indifferent to vowels (as they are not represented in Arabic) and may 
		confuse, e.g., <em>glass</em> with <em>gallons.</em>&nbsp; Even speakers 
		of languages which use a Latin script such as Spanish may have problems 
		processing words in English because Spanish has a relatively shallow 
		orthography.</p>

		<h2>Spelling sounds</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>One area of clear irregularity in English concerns the spelling of 
		individual sounds rather than whole words.&nbsp; English is not unique 
		in this respect but it is, perhaps, an extreme example.<br />
		Many other languages, including Portuguese and Modern Greek have very 
		weak relationships between sound and spelling.&nbsp; Portuguese, for 
		example, has only 5 vowel symbols but these can be pronounced in 17 
		different ways and the language's 18 consonants have 30 pronunciations.&nbsp; 
		Modern Greek has no fewer than 6 ways to spell the long 'ee' (/iː/) 
		sound.</p>
		<p>This makes 
		writing unknown words down from dictation in English a very challenging and often 
		disheartening business.&nbsp; It is much easier to write down accurately 
		what you hear in some other languages, especially those that have 
		undergone occasional reform of the writing system to get closer to a 
		one-to-one relationship between the sound and the spelling, such as 
		German or Spanish.</p>
		<p>In the in-service section of this site, some detail is provided 
		concerning how consonant and vowel sounds are conventionally spelled in 
		English.&nbsp; For consonants, for example:</p>
		<ul class="bluebullet">
			<li>the sound /b/ can be spelled 'bb' or 'b' as in <em>bubble</em> 
			so there are only two possibilities and <em>bb</em> can only come in the 
			middle of a word.</li>
			<li>the sound /k/, on the other hand, can be spelled <em>c</em> as in <em>cab</em>, 
			<em>k</em> as in <em>kid</em>, <em>kk</em> as in <em>trekker, </em>
			<em>ch</em> as in <em>chord</em>, 
			<em>q</em> as in <em>liquor </em>or <em>cc</em> as <em>account</em> so there are six 
			possibilities.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Vowel sounds are more variable so, for example:</p>
		<ul class="bluebullet">
			<li>the long ee sound, represented as /i:/ can be spelled <em>ee</em> as in
			<em>meek</em>, <em>ea</em> as in <em>beat</em>, <em>ie</em> as in <em>field</em>, 
			<em>ei </em>as in <em>conceive</em>, <em>i </em>as in <em>ski</em>, 
			<em>ey</em> as in <em>key</em> 
			and even <em>oe</em> as in <em>people</em> so there are at least seven 
			possibilities.</li>
			<li>the short vowel in a word like <em>sock</em> is almost always 
			spelled <em>o </em>as in <em>lock</em>, <em>hot</em>, <em>cot</em> etc. but 
			there are some exceptions such as <em>a</em> as in <em>watch </em>
			and <em>au </em>as in
			<em>sausage</em>.</li>
		</ul>
			<p>Both the guide to consonants and the guide to vowels, linked 
			below, consider how 
			the sounds are conventionally written.</p>
