			<h1>Language evolution</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="darwin" height="207" src="../images/darwin310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This is about language, not languages.<br />
			The ways that individual languages change and develop is interesting 
			and relevant to anyone who works with language but it concerns 
			cultural change not evolution in the sense that we will be using the 
			word.<br />
			We are concerned here to outline how and in what circumstances 
			humans may have evolved the ability to use language (not <em>a</em> 
			language &ndash; language).<br />
			The answer, as we shall shortly see, is that nobody really knows but 
			there are some interesting and plausible ideas out there that may be 
			of some interest.<br />
			(In what follows, to avoid too much clumsiness, when the word <em>
			animal</em> is used, we are referring to <em>non-human animals</em>, 
			of course.)</p>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>The first thing we need to do is define our terms and the first 
			of those terms is what we mean when we use the word <em>language</em>.</p>
			<p>Firstly, we are not concerned to define it solely as a means of 
			communication (although it is, quite obviously) because it is more 
			than that.</p>
			<p>Here are some examples of communication which, for our purposes, 
			fall outside the definition of language although they are, in one 
			way or another, forms of communication.</p>

					<h3>Alarm calls</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>Lots of studies have shown that many animal species can not only 
			signal danger (or an alarm) but can also signal the type of danger 
			and, in some cases, its location.&nbsp; Species which exhibit 
			various types of alarm calls have been studied extensively and 
			include macaques, West African green monkeys, capuchin monkeys, 
			meerkats, elephants, prairie dogs, parrots, blackbirds and more.<br />
			It has been clearly shown that vervet monkeys, to take one example, 
			can produce alarm calls that distinguish between three types of 
			predator (pythons, eagles and leopards) (Seyfarth <em>et al</em>, 1980).<br />
			It has also been reported that one species of New World monkeys can 
			not only signal the type of predator in question but also its 
			location (CÃ¤sar <em>et al</em>, 2013).&nbsp; If that is the case, it would 
			imply an ability, albeit rather limited, to use some kind of syntax 
			to combine ideas.&nbsp; As we shall see, that may be significant.</p>

					<h3>Bird song</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>The most obvious message communicated by bird song is "Come and 
			mate with me!" and that is one reason why song styles are species 
			specific, of course.&nbsp; Robins do not want to attract blackbirds 
			but they do want to attract other robins.<br />
			Other meanings which have been attributed to various bird songs and 
			calls include the common one of territory marking and defence but 
			have also been posited as a way to identify specific individuals of 
			the same species.<br />
			It has also been noted that to some extent at least the songs of 
			birds (but not their calls) are learned and that there are dialects 
			within species depending on the songs of others in the area around 
			them.<br />
			If that is true, there are consequences because it would be evidence 
			of cultural transmission rather than a genetically encoded ability 
			to perform certain songs.<br />
			Parrots and many other bird species are also good mimics of other 
			birds and animals, of human speech and of ambient sounds such as 
			certain types of machinery.&nbsp; This is not, however, any form of 
			communication because a parrot does not intend to communicate 
			anything in particular.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>Like bird song, the only certain message that whales are 
			communicating is an invitation to mate although other signals have 
			been proposed including communal hunting organisation and 
			echo-location of prey.<br />
			Whale song, too, shows some evidence of cultural transmission with 
			whales of the same species in certain ocean areas singing very differently from those 
			elsewhere.&nbsp; There is also evidence of variation over time which 
			may suggest that the songs develop.<br />
			The songs are species specific and whales do not show evidence of 
			any cross species development of songs.&nbsp; The songs have been 
			noted as distinct in fin whales, orcas, blue whales and many other 
			species.<br />
			Dolphins and porpoises, too, are sometimes very vocal, producing a 
			range of whistles and clicks which have been shown to communicate 
			some basic messages.</p>

					<h3>Bee dancing</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>The dancing of bees has long been observed but it is only 
			comparatively recently that the message communicated by the form of the dance has 
			been unravelled (von Frisch, 1967).&nbsp; Briefly, bees dance with a 
			significant waggle which transmits two pieces of information about a 
			food source:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the direction is indicated by the direction of the dance and 
				is orientated by the position of the sun (so it has to be done 
				almost immediately before the earth moves too far in relation to 
				the sun)</li>
				<li>the distance to the food source is indicated by the duration 
				of the dance.&nbsp; The longer it goes on, the further away is 
				the food source.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Bee dancing is limited to giving information about a food source 
			but the interesting thing about it is that it refers to displacement from 
			now and displacement from here.&nbsp; The bee is communicating 
			concerning something that is not here and not now, in other words 
			and that is not something any of the other forms of animal 
			communication have been shown to do.</p>

			<p>While we are, of course, very sceptical when a pet owner declares 
			that his dog, cat or ferret is able to understand what he says and 
			that he, in turn, understands the pet, there is no doubt that animals 
			that have lived for many generations among humans have come to rely 
			on them for food and water and have, accordingly, developed ways of 
			telling us humans that they need food, need a walk or need attention 
			in some other way.&nbsp; This is undoubtedly a form of communication 
			but it isn't language as we shall see.<br />
			As has often been pointed out, your cat or dog may be able to tell 
			you that she's hungry but not that she's worried about her weight or 
			that she intends to enjoy a nap in the sunshine later on.</p>

			<p>There are some familiar forms of communication not mentioned 
			above and these usually concern threats, mating rituals or territory 
			marking.&nbsp; Some examples will do because this guide is not 
			centrally concerned with a review of animal behaviours.<br />
			Dogs bark and growl to warn strangers and wag to show pleasure, cats 
			hiss and purr, squirrels rattle, hiss and screech, snakes can do the 
			same and many mammals mark territory with urine or special scent 
			glands.&nbsp; Even some plants have been shown to communicate 
			threats from parasites chemically.</p>

			<p>In order to identify what it is about human language that makes

			communication devices we have outlined stand up to the tests for 
			language.<br />
			There are lots of ways to define the nature of true language but we 
			will focus here on those that seem most important (there are

					<h3>Arbitrariness</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>The sound symbols we use in human language are almost fully 
			arbitrary.&nbsp; While there is, perhaps, some sense in which a word 
			like <em>squish</em> represents in its sound something of its 
			meaning, almost all the words in a language, any language, do not 
			have any connection with what they represent.&nbsp; Even the 
			so-called onomatopoeic words which some aver sound like their 
			referents turn out to be variable across languages although the 
			sound they purport to represent is not.&nbsp; Dogs in English go w<em>oof, 
			woof</em> and in Greek go y<em>av, yav</em>, for example, and in 
			French, that's o<em>auf, oauf</em>, in Spanish <em>guau guau</em>, in German 
			<em>wau-wau</em>, in Czech <em>haf haf</em>, incidentally, and so on in a range of 
			languages few of which use the same formulation for the same noise.<br />
			There is no recognisable connection for example between the flying 
			dinosaur and the word <em>bird</em> (or <em>Vogel, oiseau, pÃ¡jaro, 
			vtÃ¡k, txori</em> and so on for 7000-odd languages).<br />
			(That is not to say that all words in all languages are arbitrarily 
			formed.&nbsp; Many languages, especially Japanese, some African 
			languages and South East Asian languages make extensive use of what 
			are called ideophones which allegedly conjure up the meanings they 
			have and the relationships go beyond sounds, including verbs of 
			movement, textures, smells and tastes.&nbsp; An example in English 
			is <em>zigzag</em> in which the form of the written word represents 
			its meaning (to some extent) although whether someone unacquainted 
			with the word would guess that without context is arguable).<br />
			On the other hand, in animal communication, there is often a clear 
			lack of arbitrariness in the signals that are sent.&nbsp; A dog 
			baring its teeth and growling is leaving you in little doubt about 
			its intentions and it might be said that loud screeching to signal 
			danger is also not arbitrary in the sense that the words <em>eagle, 
			python</em> and <em>leopard</em> are arbitrary symbols).<br />
			Other forms of animal communication, such as bird and whale song are 
			more easily described as arbitrary.</p>

					<h3>Cultural transmission</h3>

			</table>
		
			<p>While there is some evidence for cultural transmission in the 
			form of bird and whale song, other instances of animal communication 
			seem to be genetically inherited and not learned.&nbsp; Bees do not 
			learn to dance; they know how to dance.&nbsp; Even when bird songs 
			can be shown to be culturally transmitted, bird calls are not.&nbsp; 
			All members of a single species will call in a particular manner, 
			making identification of an unseen individual straightforward to 
			those in the know.<br />
			While humans may have a genetically endowed capacity for learning 
			language (an assertion concerning which the jury is still out, 
			incidentally) we do not have a genetically endowed ability to speak 
			any single language and nor will we find some languages easier to 
			acquire than others.</p>

			<p>Words have discrete meanings.&nbsp; The meaning they carry is 
			understood within the speech community in which they occur by mutual 
			agreement.&nbsp; Words are not merely the signs which represent 
			concepts they are symbols of meaning.<br />
			Within animal communication, it is hard to find any single item that 
			one could call a word or symbol with a specific meaning.&nbsp; A 
			dolphin's click may signal <em>I am here</em> (or it may simply be a 
			navigational aid) but there is no way to break down even a series of 
			clicks and whistles into discrete and meaningful units.&nbsp; In 
			other words, the clicks do not mean <em>I am here</em> but they may 
			mean<em> iamhere</em>.</p>

			<p>Language is primarily oral-aural and not visually

			non-verbal systems of human language exist (essentially the various 
			sign languages, braille and the written systems) primacy is given to 
			the oral-aural medium.<br />
			Animal communication, too, is often in the medium of audible signals

			<p>True language is infinitely innovative.&nbsp; All users of any 
			language can invent sentences and utterances never previously seen

			of the language.&nbsp; New words arise in all languages to describe 
			new events and entities or old words are given new meanings.&nbsp; 
			Words die and are born.<br />
			Although some animal communication systems are flexible and show 
			some development over time and space, it is not apparent that the 
			users can innovate to any degree.<br />
			It is possible that something like<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The table is in the corner</em><br />
			has been said and written many times (perhaps thousands of times) 
			but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dogfish's wallet is in the food mixer</em><br />
			has probably never been said and this may well be the only time it 
			has been or ever will be written.<br />
			The communication systems used by animals are fixed and consist of a 
			small number of unchanging messages.&nbsp; Human language is 
			virtually infinite.</p>

			<p>All human languages can refer to things which are not here,

&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John went there yesterday</em><br />
			and efficiently refer to someone who is neither the speaker nor the 
			hearer, who need not be present, who did something not here and not 
			now.<br />
			Bee dances certainly do refer to the not here (in saying 
			in which direction and at what distance a food resource may be 
			found) but no other animal communication systems have been shown to 
			do that.&nbsp; Even bees, of course, are referring to a present food 
			source and not, say, speculating about a future source or ruing the 
			absence now of a past source.</p>

					<h3>Pattern, structural dependence and recursiveness</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Language is patterned.&nbsp; There are patterns of syntax and 
			word combination which are almost infinitely flexible but which are 
			based on a rule-bound system of syntactical relationships including, 
			e.g., noun phrases, verb phrases and so on.&nbsp; These syntagmatic 
			and paradigmatic relationships allow an almost infinite variation in 
			the message which is sent and received.&nbsp; It also means that 
			language is dependent for its meaning on its structure.<br />
			For example, if we take 5 words&nbsp;&ndash; <em>saw, a, woman, unicorn, the</em> &ndash; 
			there are, mathematically, 120 different ways (5!, is the 
			representation for mathematicians) to arrange them 
			but only four out of that number will result in a well-formed and 
			acceptable English sentence.<br />
			Syntax in language restricts in this sense but also allows almost 
			infinite innovation because any of the words in that set can be 
			replaced by others in the same word class to make completely new 
			sentences such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The bus sold a banana<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cod guaranteed the bungee jump<br />
			</em>which, clearly make little sense and have probably never been 
			said or written in English before now.&nbsp; They are, however, 
			comprehensible to a user of English in a way that, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the jump cod bungee a guaranteed</em><br />
			is not.</p>
			<p>Human language is also almost infinitely recursive.&nbsp; We can, 
			for example, embed a noun phrase within another noun phrase as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The headmaster's wife's sister's children's 
			toys</em><br />
			or develop endless series of modifications within modifications as 
			in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house which he sold to his brother who 
			was happy to move in on the day when it suited the removal people's 
			staff who were ...</em><br />
			or we can embed verb phrases endlessly as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>John thinks the shop is open</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I know John thinks the shop is open<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know I know John thinks the shop is open</em><br />
			and so on, literally <em>ad infinitum.</em><br />
			No animal communications system has been shown to do anything like 
			that.<br />
			There is nothing in animal communication in which any pattern of 
			grammatical or structural rule can be discerned.<br />
			Syntax is, in other words, absent from animal communication or so minimal that it is as good 
			as absent.</p>

					<h2>Primate language</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>Humans are primates, of course, but what we are interested in 
			here is whether other primates, specifically chimpanzees, are 
			capable of real, human-like language.<br />
			For that we turn to the two most famous (or infamous) studies, both 
			conducted in the USA concerning Nim and Washoe.<br />
			The earliest of these was Washoe, a chimpanzee brought up as a human 
			child would be and taught around 350 signs for various entities 
			which, it was claimed, she could combine syntactically to make new 
			meanings.<br />
			The failed experiment was with Nim, brought up in a laboratory (and 
			later cruelly abandoned to an animal experimental laboratory where 
			he died prematurely).&nbsp; Nim learned around 125 signs but showed 
			little if any ability to string ideas together in novel ways, using 
			his ability purely functionally to get whatever he desired.&nbsp; 
			Great claims were made that Nim was ordering words syntactically and 
			collections of his signs were published at length.&nbsp; However, as 
			Aitchison (2008:42) concludes:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">It would require a considerable amount of 
			imagination and wishful thinking to detect a coherent structure in 
			such a collection.</p>
			<p>Aitchison also concludes (op cit.:47) that while some primate 
			language seems to exhibit arbitrariness, semanticity and to some 
			extent creativity and displacement, that's as far as it goes.&nbsp; 
			None exhibits patterning and structural dependency and that's a key 
			issue.&nbsp; Additionally, for physiological rather than 
			psychological reasons no primate language can be verbal rather than 
			visual.</p>
			<p>The results of both these studies and many others which have been 
			undertaken with gorillas and orangutans as well as chimpanzees, remain controversial, as do the 
			ways in which both chimpanzees were abandoned as soon as 
			their usefulness was at an end.<br />
			There are some who claim that one or both animals learned enough 
			syntax to cast doubt on the assertion that true language is a 
			human-specific ability.&nbsp; Others see the results as a triumph 
			for self-deception on the part of the investigators and point to an 
			almost complete lack of evidence that any non-human primate has been 
			successfully taught any form of language which could not be taught 
			to a rat or pigeon with adequate amounts of operant conditioning.</p>
			<p>The truth may lie somewhere in the middle but even if it were

			<p>While it may be argued that some forms of animal communication 
			show one or sometimes even two of the seven characteristics listed 
			above, none can be shown to have all of them and many have none at 
			all.<br />
			It is also true that there remains a case to be made concerning 
			whether Washoe and Nim's abilities come close to exhibiting the 
			seven characteristics we have identified here.</p>
			<p>We are dealing, then, with a phenomenon which is truly <em>sui 
			generis</em>, having no known parallel (at least on our planet) and 
			existing in a class by itself.<br />
			Figuring out how language evolved has been frequently described as 
			one of the hardest problems in science so if you have come here 
			looking for the right answer, you will be disappointed.<br />
			What we can do here, however, is map out some of the ideas that have 
			been suggested and what evidence has been assembled to support them 
			and see how they measure up.</p>
			<p>The first thing to do is pose answerable questions.&nbsp; It is 
			of little use simply asking, "How did language evolve?" if we aren't 
			fully sure what it is that evolved.&nbsp; We will, therefore, refine 
			the question in the light of the seven characteristics of true 
			language that we have so far identified and ask, instead:</p>
			<ol class="style_black">
				<li>How did an arbitrary system of meaningful symbolic units 
				arise?</li>
				<li>How did a patterned system of syntax emerge to combine those 
				units in productive ways allowing for innovation, the expression of 
				displacement and recursiveness?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Simple logic would lead us to a first conclusion: symbolic units 
			must have developed before a combinatory system into which they can 
			be organised.&nbsp; If you have no symbols (i.e., words) to employ, 
			syntax has no purpose and nothing to work on.&nbsp; That does not 
			mean that they arose simultaneously or in partnership because the 
			evolutionary history of each may be different.<br />
			It has been suggested (Fisher and Marcus, 2006) that:
			<span class="style_black"><em>at present there is no way to validate 
			the core assumption that lexicons evolved before grammar</em></span> 
			and that may be the case but it really does not need validating for 
			simple logical reasons.&nbsp; It is not possible to see how grammar 
			could have evolved without a lexicon but it is easy to see how it 
			could happen the other way around.&nbsp; Assuming the reverse is 
			akin to assuming that an eye could evolve in total darkness.<br />
			There is, by analogy, an obvious and probably demonstrable route by 
			which a scent organ can evolve but that is not dependent on or connected to 
			an explanation of the evolution of bipedal locomotion.&nbsp;
			The two happened to evolve according to the laws of evolution but 
			they are otherwise unconnected.&nbsp; The ability to detect smells 
			is valuable whether or not one has a bipedal locomotion system and 
			bipedalism is, presumably, as useful a method of moving around 
			whether one has a sense of smell or not.<br />
			Here we must take a short detour to explain what these laws of 
			evolution are so 
			that we can use them to assess the value of our theories.</p>

			</table>
		
			<p>For evolution to occur naturally, three things are needed:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Individuals must vary slightly with respect to their 
				physiology and behaviour.&nbsp; That is called variation in the 
				phenotype.<br />
				Regarding language, this means that some individual hominids 
				somewhere must have had a variation in brain structure, the 
				structure of the larynx or other variations that made them even 
				if only very slightly better able to produce, decode and use 
				speech to express meaning.</li>
				<li>Variation must be passed down the generations.&nbsp; That is, the 
				characteristics must be heritable.<br />
				For language, that means that the abilities to 
				handle speech and symbolic systems as well as process syntax 
				must be reflected in the animal's genome and be subject, as all 
				other genetically determined characteristics are, to 
				hereditability.&nbsp; It is no good, in other words, learning to 
				be better at language if you die without passing on the genetic 
				information that allows the next generation to be better at 
				language.<br />
				It is also no good simply learning more words or developing the 
				muscles to vary your speech because these learned or developed traits are not 
				reflected in your genome and die with you.</li>
				<li>Different characteristics of individuals must confer 
				different rates of survival and reproduction.&nbsp; That is 
				differential fitness.<br />
				Regarding language, this means that the ability to be slightly 
				(only very slightly) better at manipulating language units must 
				have endowed its possessors with a small but visible (to 
				evolution) advantage allowing better health, greater 
				attractiveness, longer lives or a combination of those which led 
				to greater reproductive success and hence the spread of the 
				genes which determine the behaviour.</li>

					<h3>Gene or meme?</h3>

				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p> First, the definitions of what we mean here:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>Non-technically defined, a gene is a biological unit of 
				heredity which has a physical existence.&nbsp; Slightly more 
				technically, It is a sequence of nucleotides forming part of a 
				chromosome.&nbsp; We can see it, analyse it and even manipulate 
				it.<br />
				Genes are, by definition, passed on to later generations of the 
				species so, for example, a gene for eye colour, song form, bark 
				volume or flower shape will be passed down the generations of 
				animals and plants from parent to offspring.&nbsp; Providing 
				only that the gene's actions are beneficial or neutral in 
				effect, the gene will continue to pass down the generations.&nbsp; 
				Any mutation (change to the genome) which is detrimental in 
				terms of reproductive success will be eliminated from the genome 
				as the generations pass.<br />
				Genes can encode for behaviour or physical characteristics but 
				may not do so directly.&nbsp; They may function to affect the 
				actions of other genes (and are called transcription genes when 
				they do that).</li>
				<li>A meme, on the other hand, is a unit of cultural 
				transmission and is not a physical entity.&nbsp; It is an 
				element of culture which is passed from person to person 
				non-genetically.<br />
				So, for example, the habit of wearing a baseball cap the wrong 
				way around or using <em>LOL</em> to mean <em>laughed out loud
				</em>is not a behaviour which is inherited, it is one which is 
				passed indiscriminately from person to person whether they are 
				related or not.&nbsp; Again, memes which confer some benefit, 
				real or perceived, will succeed in reproducing and spreading 
				more widely.&nbsp; Those which are not or which lose their 
				novelty or other benefit will die out.<br />
				By this definition, all lexemes are memes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Memes behave in a superficially similar way to genes: they are 
			passed to others, they compete and they are identifiable as being 
			successful when they have greater reproductive capacity.&nbsp; Some 
			memes, like some genes, are more successful at reproduction than 
			others and are, therefore, more widely distributed.&nbsp; Others may die out 
			when they lose the ability to reproduce &ndash; almost nobody talks 
			about hearing something on the <em>wireless</em> any longer.<br />
			Because <span class="style_underline">a</span> language is a 
			cultural artifact, its development and content may be seen as 
			memetic rather than genetic.<br />
			Language, by contrast, rather than <span class="style_underline">a</span> 
			language, is less easily described as memetic because, although 
			individual words and expressions may be transmitted culturally, the 
			ability to manipulate them is not.<br />
			We need to 
			explain how the ability to process complex syntax and a huge range 
			of symbols for ideas, events and entities emerged in humans and in no other 
			life forms.</p>

			<p> All research and speculation concerning the evolution of 
			language assumes that there is something that can be explained by an 
			appeal to a biologically controlled process.&nbsp; If language is 
			simply a culturally transmitted ability, then no genetic basis for 
			it needs to be assumed and no thought needs to be given to how it 
			has been shaped by millions of years of evolution.<br />
			The distinction that is being made here, and needs another short 
			detour to explain, is that the acquisition of
			<span class="style_underline"><strong><em>a</em></strong></span> 
			language is a memetically determined phenomenon but the acquisition 
			of language, rather than a language, is a genetically determined 
			one.</p>
			<p> If you have followed the guide on this site to first- and second-language 
			acquisition, you will be familiar with Aitchison's six defining 
			characteristics of a biologically rather than culturally determined 
			ability.&nbsp; The six characteristics are set out here
			<span class="style_black">in black</span> with some explanation <em>
			in blue</em>.&nbsp; For more, see the source text (Aitchison, 
			2008:71, drawing on Lenneberg, 1967):</p>
			<ol class="style_black">
				<li>The behaviour emerges before it is necessary.<br />
				<em class="style_blue">Children are fed, clothed and looked after well into 
						life (sometimes until well after puberty).&nbsp; 
						Children do not need language to survive.&nbsp; Walking 
				and upright posture come into the same category.&nbsp; Those, 
				too, are behaviours which emerge before they are needed.</em></li>
				<li>Its appearance is not the result of a conscious decision.<br />
				<em class="style_blue">A child does not suddenly decide to 
						learn a language.&nbsp; You may decide to become a 
				concert pianist at a very early age but the decision is a 
				conscious one which means putting in a good deal of practice.&nbsp; 
				You did not, however, ever decide to learn your language.&nbsp; It 
				simply happened.</em></li>
				<li>Its emergence is not triggered by external events (though 
				the surrounding environment must be sufficiently ârichâ for it 
				to develop adequately).<br />
						<em class="style_blue">Children begin to talk even when 
				their immediate environment is unchanging.&nbsp; They live in the 
				same place with the same people, eating the same food and doing 
				much the same things.</em></li>
				<li>Direct teaching and intensive practice have relatively 
				little effect.<br />
						<em class="style_blue">If you are determined to become a 
				concert pianist, 
						it is quite likely that the amount and quality of teaching and 
						practice you get will be directly related to your 
						eventual skills level.<br />
						Not so with language.&nbsp; Although carers 
						often make explicit efforts to correct children's 
						language production, the evidence is that it has almost 
						no measurable effect.</em></li>
				<li>There is a regular sequence of âmilestonesâ as the behaviour 
				develops, and these can usually be correlated with age and other 
				aspects of development.<br />
				<em class="style_blue">All children develop speech in the same 
				way, reaching certain milestones at approximately the same age.<br />
				For example, at 12 to 18 months, children communicate in single 
				or double words and set phrases but by 18 to 24 months, they 
				exhibit increasing vocabulary and rudimentary grammar.&nbsp; 
				This happens everywhere with every language with all children.</em></li>
				<li>There may be a âcritical periodâ for the acquisition of the 
				behaviour.<br />
				<em class="style_blue">There is a good deal of evidence drawn 
				from cases of feral children denied access to language data or 
				to children who are brain damaged or otherwise hindered in their 
				ability to access language data that the critical period is 
				between 2 and 13 years.&nbsp; If language is not acquired then, 
				it will be only partially acquired in later life, if at all, 
				although there are exceptions and the data are limited, 
				thankfully.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p> There is more on this to the guide linked below to first- and 
			second-language acquisition.</p>
			<p> If it can be shown that language acquisition is not culturally 
			determined but the result of internal genetically-programmed 
			changes, just like the ability to crawl and walk, then we need to 
			explain how the ability arose and for that we have to turn to 
			evolutionary science as the only plausible explanatory mechanism.<br />
			We must not, however, necessarily accept the ways in which the 
			demonstrably biologically determined nature of language acquisition 
			has been extended by some, notably Chomsky, to include a 
			pre-programmed Universal Grammar of all languages whose nature is 
			hard-wired into the brain's structure.&nbsp; That does not 
			necessarily follow.<br />
			Evans and Levinson are, for example, sceptical of the claims of 
			innate grammatical structures and they conclude:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">the great variability in how languages 
			organize their word-classes dilutes the plausibility of the innatist 
			UG position<br />
			<span class="smallfont"><span class="auto-style60">Evans &amp; Levinson, 
			2009:14</span></span></p>
			
			<p> because, as they and others have pointed out, human languages 
			are, in fact much more variable than has been properly recognised by 
			those working within a limited range of, usually, Indo-European 
			languages (and often only one of them).<br />
			For more, see the guide to Chomsky, linked below.</p>
			<p> It is now generally accepted, however, that the ability to learn one's first 
			language is a genetically controlled one but the nature of the 
			language (its words, forms, structures, phonology and so on which 
			are unique to it) is either culturally transmitted or, if one 
			accepts the notion of a Universal Grammar, one which is only 
			variable within pre-determined limits.</p>
			<p> Now, finally, we can start to consider our two questions.<br />
			We will look first at question 1:<span class="style_black"><br />

			</table>
		
			<p> One theory, usually not held by linguists, is that words emerged 
			from animal calls because evolution does not invent things 
			unnecessarily but tinkers with what already exists.&nbsp; If it can 
			be shown that animal calls have some meaning, the theory goes, then
			<strong>arbitrary</strong> meaning can arise from that.&nbsp; This 
			has been called the theory of genre continuism (Bickerton, 
			2005:513).<br />
			This means, for example, that the word <em>snake</em> (which bears 
			no relationship to the animal to which it refers) arose from the 
			alarm call that was in use to alert other members of a tribe to the 
			presence of a dangerous predator.<br />
			There are, however, some very distinct differences between 
			human-language words and animal calls, and the issues are set out by Bickerton (op 
			cit.):</p>
			<ol class="auto-style23">
				<li>Genetic determination<ol class="auto-style23">
					<li class="bluebullet">Calls are genetically determined.&nbsp; All monkey alarm 
				calls, for example, within species are identical and monkeys do 
				not learn what a call means or how to produce it by imitation or 
				education.</li>
					<li class="bluebullet">Words, by contrast are culturally transmitted.&nbsp; They are 
				memes, in fact.&nbsp; The word <em>snake</em> has a significance 
				only to those within the culture that uses it.&nbsp; Other 
				languages do not recognise it: <em>serpent</em> (French), <em>Schlange</em> (German), 
					<em>had</em> (Slovak), <em>serpiente</em> 
				(Spanish), <em>ÏÎ¯Î´Î¹</em> [feedi] (Greek) etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Propositional value<ol class="auto-style23">
					<li class="bluebullet">Calls are propositions so the alarm call means<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out 
				there's a snake<br /></em>the mating call means<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come mate with 
				me<br /></em>the territory call means<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go away or I'll attack<br />
					</em>and so on.</li>
					<li class="bluebullet">Words alone are not propositions; they are made 
				part of propositions by syntax.&nbsp; The word <em>happy</em> 
					for example certainly carries meaning for speakers of 
					English but is not in and of itself a proposition.&nbsp; It 
					can be <strong>made</strong> part of a proposition but that 
					requires syntax and other words as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was not happy</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Symbolism<ol class="auto-style23">
					<li class="bluebullet">Calls are not symbolic; they refer to the here and now and 
				are meaningless in the absence of what they are referring to.&nbsp; 
				The alarm call cannot be used to refer to the danger posed by a 
				snake which is not here and now.<br />A call can mean:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's an eagle overhead<br />
					</em>but it cannot mean<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an eagle overhead<br />
					</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have there recently been any eagles 
				around here?<br /></em>and however complex the call is (and they are usually not 
				complex at all) it cannot be broken down into the element that 
				means <em>eagle</em> and the element that means <em>overhead</em>.</li>
					<li class="bluebullet">Words, on the other hand are symbolic and can refer to something 
				displaced in time and space from the word's use.<br />Even a one-year-old's single utterance of, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear<br /></em>can, depending on context, mean:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want my bear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring me my bear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My bear is here</em><br />and so on.<br />Words take meanings from context, calls are context independent.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p> These are serious problems because the differences between calls 
			and words are not ones of degree, they are <em>qualitatively</em> different.&nbsp; 
			To assume that words (symbols) arose by slow evolution from calls 
			means that you have to demonstrate how these qualitative differences 
			came about.&nbsp; In other words, for example, you have to show 
			which part of a territory-determining call means <em>I live here</em> 
			and which part means <em>No trespassing</em>.</p>

			<p> The idea that an ability to use language was selected for by the 
			demands of group interaction has been around for some time in various 
			forms.&nbsp; The forms it takes are:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style23">
				<li>Language began as an accompaniment to or replacement for 
				social grooming in primates<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are you today?<br />
				</em>Gossip has also been suggested as a way that language evolved in 
				this setting.</li>
				<li>Language began as a way of facilitating the ability to hunt 
				cooperatively<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				You go round the back and drive the antelopes 
				towards us<br />
				</em>kind of thing.</li>
				<li>Language began as a way of training in tool making<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You 
				hit the flint just here with the horn and it flakes this way, 
				you see?</em></li>
				<li>Language arose out of the development of some kind of 
				primitive theory of the mind in which we are aware that others 
				can be fooled or manipulated for us to get our own way<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, 
				I'm not interested at all in that piece of food.&nbsp; Gosh, look over 
				there!</em></li>
				<li>Language evolved when human (or hominid) group sizes became 
				too large for primate grooming to play its usual social cohesion 
				roles<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love you, too</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are problems with most of these theories.</p>
			<ol class="auto-style23">
				<li>Many animals interact in a way that involves social grooming 
				(ponies, horses, cats, baboons, cattle, monkeys, bats, lions and 
				even some insects) but have not developed language as an accompaniment to it.</li>
				<li>Many other animals hunt cooperatively (jackals, wolves, 
				falcons, dolphins, chimpanzees, lions, crocodiles and even some 
				insects) without having 
				developed language to help the process.</li>
				<li>Tool making skills are culturally inherited and passed down 
				through demonstration and imitation and do not need language to 
				facilitate the process.<br />
				Some tool making in animals may be genetically determined 
				behaviour, some may be learned later but none needs language for 
				its transmission from generation to generation.&nbsp; Elephants, 
				for example, may modify branches to use as fly swats, dolphins 
				learn to use sponges to help with catching prey, sea otters use 
				rocks to crack open shellfish, crows and gulls drop prey shelled 
				animals onto hard surfaces to break them open, orangutans use 
				modified branches for many different purposes, including, 
				swatting, scooping, probing and so on and the list can be greatly 
				extended.&nbsp; However, none of these behaviours, either 
				learned or inherited, requires the use of language for its 
				transmission.</li>
				<li>Most apes (and especially chimpanzees) can be shown to 
				possess a theory of mind which allows for the concept that 
				others may not be thinking as we are but have still not 
				developed language to facilitate the conceptual process 
				involved.&nbsp; Successful deception requires, to some extent, a 
				theory of mind so animals may take on the appearance of other, 
				more dangerous or poisonous ones, may feign death or injury to 
				deceive a predator, ravens will cache food in secret, many apes 
				will do the same and may also use bogus alarm calls to deceive 
				or distract others and so on but none of this requires language
				<em>per se</em>.</li>
				<li>There is no evidence that hominid groups actually did grow 
				very large at any time and, in any case, some primate groups are 
				very large without having a concomitant ability to use language 
				instead of physical grooming.&nbsp; Baboons and some monkeys, 
				for example, may live in large multi-level societies in which 
				there are families within clans, within bands within larger 
				troops (up to 250 individuals in baboons) but, again, no language needed to have evolved to manage 
				the socially complex relations.</li>
			</ol>
			<p> Nevertheless, we know from our theory of evolution that there 
			must have been <strong><em>some</em></strong> selective pressure 
			which would lead to greater and greater symbolic vocabularies (a 
			lexicon of sorts) which would have conferred some advantage on its 
			possessors.<br />
			Because the acquisition of more and more symbols does not require 
			any fundamental rewiring of the brain, there seems no reason not to 
			suppose that a slow incremental process of enlarging the vocabulary 
			of language symbols for events and entities could not arise quite 
			slowly and steadily.&nbsp; Once you have one symbolic unit (aka 
			lexeme) there is no impediment to increasing the numbers you can 
			possess.<br />
			It is straightforward enough to imagine that the acquisition of a 
			greater vocabulary, without any syntactical framework would have 
			given its possessors a distinct selective advantage.&nbsp; If, for 
			example, one member of a group has discovered a source of food 
			(fruit, a carcass etc.) the ability to say <em>food</em> and gesture 
			in its general direction will be an advantage but the ability to say 
			what sort of food at what distance away requiring what resources for 
			its exploitation would confer even greater advantages.<br />
			The assumption is, therefore, that while syntax does require some 
			clever rewiring of the human neural system, the acquisition of a 
			greater and greater range of symbolic signs did not.</p>

			</table>
		
			<p> The human proto-language is assumed to have some identifiable 
			characteristics which can be seen in the sorts of language that 
			children use around the age of two and also in some pidgins and 
			other primitive languages which manage without anything we would 
			call syntax.<br />
			It consists of a wide range of symbols with nothing that we can term 
			structure in which to embed the ideas.&nbsp; Nevertheless a 
			proto-language would have some characteristics of what we have 
			defined above as true language:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Symbols would be arbitrary and have specific referents so 
				noun phrases would form the backbone of the language.&nbsp; 
				There would, the theory goes, be specific ways to refer to 
				things of general and specific interest to the group which would 
				be accepted by all speakers of the proto-language (which would 
				not be the same as another group's language).&nbsp; So for 
				example, the language would be able to express:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a lion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a fruit </em>(and name types thereof)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a close relative<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a more distant relative <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warmth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; danger</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>There would have to be some symbols that refer not to 
				physical entities but to actions (what we now call verbs) such 
				as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; share<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cut<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gather</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>There may also have been some symbols referring to abstract 
				entities such as times and directions such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>in that direction<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an hour's walk away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over that hill</em><br />
				etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is not surprising that a proto-language should focus mostly on 
			things and events because that is how the universe is ordered.<br />
			The physical world, as Newton knew, can be described in terms of 
			objects and events.&nbsp; In other words, things do stuff, have 
			stuff done to them or stand in particular relationships to other 
			things.&nbsp; Our pre-Newton ancestors could not have explained the 
			processes but could hardly have failed to notice that some things 
			are heavy, some light, some burnable, others not, some edible, some 
			poisonous and so on.&nbsp; They will also have noticed and taken 
			note that some things are found in particular relationships to other 
			things: fish in water, plants in earth, certain animals in groups 
			and so on.<br />
			In fact, people who rely for their continued existence on successful 
			hunting and gathering usually have a very well developed inventory 
			of objects and relationships.&nbsp; Such knowledge does not help 
			those who rely on working and shopping for their existence and the 
			knowledge has decayed, having no further adaptive function.&nbsp; We 
			know, however, even in a supermarket we have never entered before, 
			that tea is likely to be found in the same area as coffee and sugar 
			will probably not be far away.</p>
			<p>The really critical issue is whether a proto-language would be, 
			in the manner of animal calls, propositions which were embodied in a 
			single expression or whether there would be separate units which 
			could be combined to make meaning.<br />
			A single utterance can, for example, mean:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is danger from a snake</em><br />
			or it can be a set of symbols each carrying its own meaning along 
			the lines of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danger </em>|<em> exists </em>|<em> in this 
			direction </em>|<em> from a snake</em><br />
			in which the utterance is synthetic, being made up of four discrete units 
			(the second of which is redundant) rather than representing a single idea.</p>
			<p>Here, at last, we have an inkling of how syntax may have developed.<br />
			While it is possible to have single utterances which signify 
			danger from a snake, danger from an alligator, food for scavenging, 
			food for collection, place of shelter from predators, place of 
			shelter from rain and so on and on, it is much more efficient to 
			combine units so the term for <em>shelter</em> or <em>danger</em>, for example, 
			remains constant while the phenomenon from which the shelter is 
			available or the danger emanates can be attached to it.&nbsp; So we 
			get paradigmatic relationships forming such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; snake danger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lion danger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fruit food<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meat food</em><br />
			and so on.&nbsp; This still isn't syntax but the way ahead for it to 
			become syntax is clear.<br />
			Just as modern languages can posit a noun collectively to represent 
			all instances of something, so we can attach modification to make it 
			clear which instance we are referring to.&nbsp; Therefore, modern 
			languages do not need a separate symbol to represent each and every 
			instance of a type of entity but can use a generic term for the 
			entity and modify it to identify this instance of its existence.&nbsp; 
			Thus, we can distinguish between<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; car</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my car</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; yellow car</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			The selective advantage of such a system is clear because it 
			multiplies the ability to refer to things without multiplying the 
			memory resources needed to store separate lexemes (or symbols).<br />
			What we do not yet have is a fully synthetic true language but we do 
			have the makings of one because we have:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style23">
				<li>A wide and widening vocabulary of symbols representing both 
				nouns (overwhelmingly) with some verbs and (possibly) 
				directions.</li>
				<li>A primitive but functionally useful way of combining sounds 
				(symbols) to make differences in meaning so we can distinguish 
				between:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dangerfromasnake<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danger </em>|<em> from a snake </em>|<em> yellow </em>|<em> 
				in a tree </em>|<em> above you</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Jackendoff (1999) identifies what he refers to as fossil remains 
			of proto-language in the language of infants and in adult language 
			items such as <em>No!, </em>a generalised prohibition, or <em>Shh!</em>, 
			a specific prohibition.<br />
			These single word (or even single sound) utterances are not 
			combinatorial and do not depend on any form of syntax for their 
			comprehension.<br />
			Infant language (pre-syntax) is often identified as akin to a proto 
			language, a theory that mirrors the idea that ontogeny recapitulates 
			phylogeny (i.e., that the development of the embryo mirrors the 
			stages of the evolution of the adult animal, an idea usually 
			attributed to Ernst Haeckel (1834â1919), and now almost fully 
			discredited).&nbsp; The application to language evolution is that 
			the child's language begins with a set of symbols (a lexicon) and 
			only later does the ability to set the symbols in syntactical units 
			(a grammar) arise.</p>
			<p>Jackendoff also sees, among much else, some logical emergence of what 
			he refers to as agent-first syntax averring that proto-syntax would 
			naturally have assigned the first position in an utterance to the 
			agent of any event so we have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made fire<br />
			</em>not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire he made<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			An immediate objection, of course, is that some human languages do 
			not put the agent first.</p>
			<p>He goes further and identifies phenomena in modern languages which 
			are syntactically quite promiscuous, in particular, disjunct 
			expressions such as <em>in my opinion</em> or <em>unfortunately </em>
			which can occur virtually anywhere in a clause as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She, unfortunately, lost the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, she lost the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lost the money unfortunately<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, he is unhelpful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is, in my opinion, unhelpful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is unhelpful, in my opinion</em><br />
			He does not, however, in that paper, distinguish between disjunct 
			and adjunct use and adjunct use in most languages is far more 
			strictly constrained in terms of syntax.<br />
			He concludes (op cit.:279):</p>
			<p class="indentpara">I have tried to show that (1) there are indeed 
			many special aspects of language, but (2) that they could have 
			evolved incrementally, not unlike the eye and the parts of the brain 
			that the eye serves. Having less than the whole system would still 
			have been useful. What is also new here is the hypothesis that 
			certain design features of modern language might be âfossilsâ of 
			earlier evolutionary stages.</p>
			<p>What is as yet unclear is how the giant steps from a simple call 
			with a single here-and-now meaning to a large vocabulary of 
			arbitrary symbols to a combining mechanism into which to insert the 
			symbols were made.<br />
			It may be the case that other developments in human neurophysiology 
			were recruited to be used for the processing of syntax or that the 
			selective advantages of having the ability to use simple syntax, 
			however nascent, were great enough in themselves to force evolution 
			down the road of creating the mental wiring to allow it to happen.<br />
			Nobody really knows (yet).</p>

					<h2>The emergence of syntax</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p> We can now attack the second question we began with:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="style_black" value="2"><em>How did a patterned system of syntax emerge to combine those 
				units in productive ways allowing for the expression of 
				displacement and recursiveness?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p> Here we are on thin ice.<br />
			How you explain the emergence of fully formed syntax depends, of 
			course, on what you think it is.&nbsp; At its simplest level, syntax 
			may be described as a set of paradigmatic relationships which 
			determine the role of each constituent of a clause or utterance.&nbsp; 
			So, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Share that fruit<br />
			</em>has three components which can each be replaced but only by 
			equivalent concepts so we could also have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make new fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help her carry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid dangerous snakes<br />
			</em>and so on.<br />
			This is deceptively simple because each unit is, in fact, performing 
			a different syntactical function.&nbsp; Syntactical rules, in 
			English in this example, do not allow:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire make new<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carry help her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Snakes avoid dangerous</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			but there is no <em>a priori</em> reason why one type of ordering should be 
			preferred over another, providing only that the message is clear and 
			the conventional arrangement is shared by those who need to use it.</p>
			<p> The selective advantage of having even a basic syntax is quite 
			obvious because it allows the language user to set the lexicon in a 
			context / co-text and that allows a much greater range of messages to be sent 
			and understood.&nbsp; While there may well be an evolutionary 
			advantage to being able to say <em>Food</em> there is a much greater 
			advantage in being able to say what sort of food, where and at what 
			distance.&nbsp; Even greater advantages are conferred by being able 
			to say whose food it is and what we should do with it.</p>
			<p> Although it a relatively easy matter to point out how better 
			syntax (i.e., more flexible and productive syntax) will have been 
			selected for because it confers obvious benefits on its possessors, 
			it is far less easy to say how this ability evolved in the first 
			place.<br />
			It may be the case that for many millennia, a proto-language 
			consisting of large numbers of arbitrary symbols for things and 
			events was all that humans possessed and that syntax evolved very 
			much later and quite suddenly.&nbsp; That is Bickerton's view.<br />
			An alternative idea is that syntax itself began as a rudimentary 
			ordering of symbols and gradually grew in complexity and subtlety 
			over 200,000 to 300,000 years of human evolution.&nbsp; That is the 
			view of Pinker and Jackendoff.<br />
			As yet, the jury is out because there simply isn't enough evidence 
			to decide one way or the other.</p>
			<p> As we saw above, this all begs the question that there is something unusual to be 
			explained, of course, and there are some who would aver that 
			language is memetic not genetic so its acquisition can be explained 
			by recourse to social factors alone.<br />
			This is not a widely held view and most people in the field allow 
			that a child's phenomenal ability to acquire a language with almost 
			complete success in a matter of a few years does have to be 
			explained and that the explanation lies in positing some kind of 
			genetic programming which allows it.&nbsp; In other words something 
			akin to a mental module specifically devoted to language acquisition 
			and use.<br />
			The details are debated and debatable but that there is something 
			unusual to be explained is not now generally debated.<br />
			Elsewhere on this site there are guides to Chomsky and to the 
			various theories underlying first- and second-language acquisition, 
			linked in the list at the end to which you can refer for more.<br />
			From here on the assumptions is that the ability to learn language 
			(any language) is something with which humans are uniquely 
			genetically endowed.</p>

					<h2>Big brain theories</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p> The simplest and most naÃ¯ve way of expressing the idea of a big 
			brain theory is to state:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"> <span class="style_black"><em>People are intelligent because 
			they have big brains and big brains give us the ability to learn 
			language</em></span></p>
			<p> It follows that because we are clever animals, we have the ability 
			to invent and learn language.<br />
			While simple to state, this does not carry the sort of explanatory 
			power that we need.&nbsp; Intelligence may indeed be required to 
			learn a language (any language) and bigger brains have more of it 
			but the direction of causality remains obscure.&nbsp; It is not 
			clear whether the need or advantage of language learning led to 
			larger brains or the other way around.</p>
			<p> Other ideas include the co-opting of already 
			sophisticated neural connections, such as those used for 
			motor-sensory functions, to the use of language.&nbsp; This is the 
			idea that language is not a phenomenon confined solely to certain 
			areas of the brain (the famous two being Wernicke's and Broca's 
			areas) but is handled in a cortex-wide fashion, employing whatever 
			complex neural connections are already present.<br />
			This is a view of the human brain as a kind of general-purpose 
			machine for the ordering and combining of information.</p>
			<p> A related concept concerns what is called exaptation, the phenomenon 
			that some evolutionary changes, adapted for a particular function 
			can be co-opted for a completely different function.&nbsp; An 
			example might be the process by which feathers may have been an 
			adaptation allowing an animal to keep warm but which were later 
			co-opted into part of a mechanism allowing flight.&nbsp; (One old 
			objection to the whole theory of evolution was to ask, for example, 
			"What's the use of half a wing?".&nbsp; Exaptation has been proposed 
			as an answer.)<br />
			In a similar way, adaptations in the human brain which evolved under 
			the pressure to fine-tune motor skills in the making of artefacts 
			might have been co-opted to be used to process syntax.&nbsp; There 
			are compelling similarities, for example, between the ability to 
			imagine a finished artefact and then decide on the precise ordering 
			of steps which must be taken in manufacturing it from the raw material to its 
			completion and the ability to conceive of a message to communicate 
			and then decide on the language items that are required to 
			communicate it and then to arrange the items in such a way that the 
			message is unambiguously sent.<br />
			This is a view rejected by many who support the ideas of a universal 
			grammar and a language acquisition device which have to be embedded in 
			their own specialised language module in 
			the brain.</p>
			<p> Another theory in this general domain is that syntax arose from 
			phonology, specifically the structure of the syllable so a 
			Subject-Verb-Object ordering grew out of the syllable structure of 
			Onset-Nucleus-Coda.&nbsp; This means that complex phonology preceded 
			syntax (a sensible but unproven idea) and that the ability to 
			structure a syllable was simply carried over to the ability to 
			construct syntax but fails to account very well for languages which 
			do not have SVO ordering but any of the other five possibilities, in 
			particular the very common SOV ordering.<br />
			It also leaves out other canonical word orderings concerning 
			adverbials, genitives and more.</p>

			</table>
		
			<p> The problem facing those who support a Chomskyan view that 
			the language-learning ability cannot be explained by simply co-opting other 
			elements of cognition is to explain how and when such a large 
			evolutionary step was taken to allow the sudden appearance of a 
			fully-formed universal grammar.&nbsp; On the whole, evolution does 
			not appear to move in sudden steps but is a very gradual process.<br />
			There are those who suggest that the very sudden flowering of 
			culture and representative art around 40,000 years ago after 
			hundreds of thousands of years of virtual stasis was brought about 
			by the abrupt development of a syntactical system of language which 
			allowed for much greater subtlety and imagination.<br />
			The hidden assumption here is that one needs complex language to 
			have complex thoughts and that is by no means an uncontroversial 
			idea.&nbsp; The guide on this site to language and thought, linked 
			below, considers this in greater detail.<br />
			An additional problem is trying to explain how something as complex 
			as universal grammar or the language acquisition device which 
			accompanies it could have been the result of a single (or at most 
			small number of connected) genetic mutations.</p>
			<p> On the side of gradualism, however, there are also serious 
			problems to overcome.<br />
			There is a need to explain what exactly were the intermediate steps 
			between proto-language and a fully modern syntactical system.&nbsp; 
			After all, if syntax emerged in small steps it ought to be possible 
			at least to suggest what those steps might be between no syntax and 
			fully recursive syntax of the modern sort.<br />
			There is also, of course, the need to explain what the first step 
			was and why it happened.</p>
			<p> The big question for proponents of both gradualism and 
			suddenness used to be to explain why only one species seems to have 
			acquired language but recent research has supported the idea that 
			other species of hominid, particularly Neanderthals, also possessed 
			language.</p>

			<p> This is a gene that, when mutated or damaged in humans results in an 
			inability to handle syntax.&nbsp; In mice and songbirds, too, 
			changes to the gene result in serious effects on the nature of 
			vocalisations and the ability to learn sequences of sounds.<br />
			The protein produced by the gene has remained, according to research 
			cited in Reich (2018: 8), unchanged for the 100 million years which 
			separate the lineages of chimpanzees and mice.&nbsp; However, in 
			both humans and Neanderthals, the gene has evolved much more 
			rapidly, twice in 50,000 years and once again much more recently.<br />
			We should not, of course, run away with the idea that FOXP2 is in 
			any sense 'the language gene' (because, for one thing it does not 
			affect the organism directly, being a transcription gene which turns 
			off or on other genes).</p>
			<p> The existence of FOXP2 and its obvious connection to syntactical 
			ability is, however, significant and may go some way to resolving 
			the gradualist-suddenness debate.</p>
			<p> It is tempting, too, to see mutations in this gene as giving 
			rise to the ability, in humans and closely related species, to 
			handle complex syntax and that might also explain how it is that no 
			other extant species shares the skill.</p>
