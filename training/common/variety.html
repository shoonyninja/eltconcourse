		<h1>Varieties of English and other Englishes</h1>
		<p>
		<img height="207" src="../images/variety_rainbow310.jpg" width="310" alt="rainbow" /></p>
		<p>As a starting point, we'll assert something: teachers need to know 
		about varieties of English and be familiar with the characteristics of 
		the ones their learners are most likely to encounter.&nbsp; Crystal, 
		1998:17, puts it like this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Teachers need to prepare their students for a 
			world of staggering linguistic diversity. Somehow, they need to 
			expose them to as many varieties of English as possible, especially 
			those which they are most likely to encounter in their own locale. 
			And, above all, teachers need to develop a truly flexible attitude 
			towards principles of usage.</p>
			<p>Developing the flexibility that Crystal sees as important implies 
			that teachers should not make an <em>a priori</em> assumption that 
			their own dialect (yes, everyone has one) is the sole norm against 
			which their learners' production should be measured.&nbsp; What is 
			needed is a step back to view the wider world and some understanding 
			of its <em>staggering diversity.</em></p>
			<p>All languages vary.&nbsp; The number of speakers there are, the range 
		of contexts in which the language is used and the geographical spread of 
		the language will determine just how much variation occurs.<br />
			Even those languages which are partially overseen by institutions 
			charged with maintaining linguistic purity (such as the various 
			academies around the world) will vary by region and context as well 
			as between individuals and in those operating in certain fields.<br />
		(The term 'variety' encompasses phenomena such as accent, dialect, 
		sociolect, idiolect and so on which are, in some cases, quite difficult 
		to define.)</p>

			<li>It depends: how do you define <em>standard</em>?<br />

			British English is usually abbreviated to BrE and US English to AmE 
			and that convention is followed on this site.</li>
			<li>Within larger areas where English is spoken, other identifiable 
			forms of the language exist although they may not be recognised as 
			standards in the way that the twelve cited above are.&nbsp; Here's a 
			short list of places where English is widely spoken in a way that is 
			recognisably different from other areas of the world because there 
			are variations in vocabulary, pronunciation and, sometimes, grammar.&nbsp; 
			People unfamiliar with the varieties would probably have 
			difficulty, for example, distinguishing Southern English from 
			Channel Island English, Nepalese English from Indian English or 
			between the varieties which exist in the Caribbean but 
			locals would have no such difficulty.<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style24" style="width: 80%">

		<p>There are a number of factors at work but we can condense them into two

			<p>
			<img alt="summary" height="147" src="../imagesgraphics/variety_overview.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>There are two main factors to consider:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Who is using the language?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Language use will vary depending on where people come from and their 
	social class.&nbsp; The two factors interact so, for example, 
				an upper-class variety in one geographical or political area may 
				differ from a lower-class variety in the same area.<br />
				Ethnicity also frequently plays a role.</dd>
				<dt><strong>What is the language being used for?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Language use will vary by register.&nbsp; Occupational 
			registers include things like jargon and special forms of English 
			(legalese, IT-speak, medical language and so on) and topic-based 
			registers will include things like sports registers, special hobby 
			registers (can you read a knitting pattern?), pastimes and so on.</dd>

			<p>A lect is just another term used by sociolinguistics for a 
			variety of a language.&nbsp; It's a useful neutral term to use, 
			however, because it avoids the connotations that some percieve in 
			terms such as dialect.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

			<h3>Dialect</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
		
		<p>This is not the place to enter into the argument about whether a 
		dialect is a language or not.&nbsp; If you want to know whether a 
		dialect qualifies as a language, check the
		Ethnologue site (linked below).</p>
			<p>As a rule of thumb, a dialect is distinguished from other 
			variations in language use by having unique phonological, 
			grammatical and lexical features but is, nevertheless, still 
			generally comprehensible to speakers of other varieties of the same 
			language.&nbsp; Examples include Dutch, Flemish and Afrikaans, Hindi 
			and Urdu, Czech and Slovak, US and British English and many more 
			varieties of what are essentially the same language around the 
			world.<br />
			For political, social or cultural reasons, speakers of some dialects 
			may like to suggest that their variety constitutes a separate 
			language and should be respected as such and, of course, 
			comprehensibility to users of other varieties exists on a cline from 
			not at all to fully comprehensible.&nbsp; On the other hand, there 
			are similarly grounded pressures in some cultures to minimise 
			differences and class what are barely, if at all, mutually comprehensible 
			languages as varieties of the same language.</p>
			<p>Dialects vary like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The lexicon<br />
				What the United States calls a <em>hood</em>, the British call a 
				<em>bonnet</em>, what Canadians call 
		an <em>automobile</em> or <em>car</em>, Indians might refer to as a <em>motor</em>, what the British call a 
				<em>dunce</em> might be called a <em>bubu</em> in Jamaica, what in parts of the USA are referred to as 
				<em>britches</em> would be <em>pants</em> or <em>trousers</em> elsewhere and 
		so on and on and on.<br />
				Specific words are in use to describe things which exist in the 
				local environment but may not exist elsewhere in the world and 
				the influence of local languages on the vocabulary and grammar 
				of English is often identifiable.</li>
				<li>Grammar<br />
		There are grammatical variations, too.&nbsp; In the USA the question 
		might be<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you just get here?<br /> 
				</em>but in Britain, that would 
		probably be<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you just got here?<br />
				</em>In Southern England,
		<em>you was</em> is common and in the north, <em>I were</em> is similarly 
		frequently heard.&nbsp; Both are considered non-standard forms.<br />
				Other grammatical differences are observable so, for example, in 
				some varieties of English, <em>write</em> can be used with a 
				direct object as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll write him</em><br />
				but in others, that is not allowed and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll write to him</em><br />
				is preferred.<br />
				Both forms will, naturally, be understood by all speakers.<br />
				For more on the grammatical differences between 
		British and American English, see
		the 
				article (linked below).</li>
				<li>Spelling<br />
				The differences between BrE spelling and AmE 
		spelling are mostly traceable to the reforming zeal of the American 
		lexicographer, Webster.&nbsp; In general, AmE spelling is simpler and 
		more consistent.&nbsp; That's not the same as saying that it's any more 
		regular, of course.<br />
				Other varieties, such as Canadian English, often use a mixture 
				of BrE spelling and AmE spelling.</li>
				<li>Pronunciation<br />
				varies regionally, too, of course.&nbsp; Everywhere.<br />
				Depending on the precision with which a local accent is defined, 
				it may be confined to a very small area (a single Caribbean 
				island or, in some cases, areas of large cities which have 
				identifiably different accents from their neighbours).&nbsp; At 
				other times, we may speak of <em>a British accent, an American 
				accent, an Indian accent</em> and so on with no recognition of 
				the very significant differences such descriptions hide.<br />If you are interested in the major differences between British and 
		American pronunciation, see
		the answer linked below.</li>

			<h3>Sociolect</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
		
		<p>This refers to the way that language varies by social class, gender, 
		age or ethnicity.&nbsp; Trudgill, 2003, defines it this way:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">A variety or lect which is thought of as being 
			related to its speakers' social background rather than geographical 
			background. A social class dialect is thus a form of sociolect.<br />
			<span class="auto-style35">(Trudgill, 2003:122)</span></p>
			<p>and he also defines an acrolect as being the highest status 
			variety with basilect the lowest and various mesolects somewhere in 
			between.&nbsp; The situation is not simple and further complicated 
			by people's ability to code switch, alternating between a 
			high-status variety and a lower-status variety as the situation 
			demands.<br />
			Certain settings, for example, church sermons, academic lectures, 
			news broadcasts and so on require, in many cultures, the use of a 
			distinctively different and often higher-status variety of a 
			language than do other settings, such as conversations with family 
			and friends, TV soap operas, personal letters and so on in which the 
			use of slang and colloquialisms is more common and, in fact, often 
			required.</p>
			<p>Some sociolects, such as African American Vernacular English can 
			differ very markedly from other standards, for example in omitting 
			copular verbs so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He here</em><br />
			serves as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is here</em><br />
			In Britain, too, a traditional stratified society, variations in 
			grammar, lexis and pronunciation are very noticeable in acrolects 
			and basilects.&nbsp; For example,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>brother</em> may be pronounced not as /ˈbrʌð.ə/ but as 
			/ˈbrʌv.ə/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>hello</em> may be pronounced without the initial /h/<br />
			and so on.</p>
			<p>This is also not the place to enter the argument about how class is (or 
		even whether it should be) defined.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that it is 
		unlikely that you will hear the British royal family say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gis the 
		salt, mate<br />
		</em>or find <em>Austria</em> pronounced as <em>Orstria</em> 
		or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One wonders where one's drill has got to<br />
		</em>uttered<em>
		</em>on a British building site.<br />
		Grammar varies here, too, with a noted 
		preference in some classes, for example, to use <em>we was</em> instead of <em>we were</em> 
		and <em>ain't</em> instead of <em>isn't</em> and so on.<br />
			There are variations in the lexicon, too, with words 
			such as <em>brill, diss, righto, toodle pip, spiffing, yep, yeah, 
			aye, nah, nope, nay</em> being used variably by certain age groups, 
			socioeconomic groups and so on.<br />
		Pronunciation can vary markedly with social class.&nbsp; For example, 
		pronouncing the 'r' in <em>father</em> is considered high status in some 
		varieties (such as Southern USA) but low status in others (such as 
		Britain and the American East Coast).<br />
		Such considerations go in and out of fashion, of course.</p>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				</tr>
			</table>
			
		
		<p>This is the most obvious form of language variation and we are all 
		familiar with the fact that the origins of speakers of our own language 
		are often identifiable from the way they pronounce the language.&nbsp; 
		Sometimes, people make efforts to reduce the impact of their regional 
		variety in the interests of sounding more educated and at other times, 
		people may deliberately emphasise a regional accent in order to 
		integrate with certain groups.</p>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

			<h3>British and US varieties</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
		
			<p>Setting out all the differences in varieties of accents (and 
			dialects) which have been identified by generations of scholars is 
			neither possible not useful but the maps of two important inner 
			circle areas look like this:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style36">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="uk" height="312" src="../imagesgraphics/uk_accents.png" width="250" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="us" height="312" src="../imagesgraphics/us_accents.png" width="509" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>And they hide quite significant differences, of course, as the 
			speakers of the varieties will make clear if you ask.&nbsp; Borders 
			are not shown between the varieties because, of course, they do not 
			really exist.&nbsp; Each area flows seamlessly into the adjacent 
			regions.</p>
			<p>Accent 
		varies by region and by social class as we have seen but it also varies 
		from person to person.&nbsp; The technical term is that we all have an 
		idiolect and pronounce certain words slightly differently from those 
		around us and that's one of the ways we can know instantly who is 
		telephoning us if it is someone we know well.<br />
		An idiolect may also, incidentally, include certain words that we 
		habitually use and certain types of expression which are unique to us or 
		the people we live with.<br />
		Everybody, incidentally, has an accent whether it is a standard one or 
		not and everyone also has a dialect.</p>

		<p>There is separate guide on this site to
		style and 
		register (linked below).&nbsp; For our purposes we will distinguish them 
		rather crudely like this:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>style</strong></dt>
				<dd>is to do with level of formality and social appropriateness.&nbsp; 
				When is it, for example, acceptable to use a strong regional 
				accent, slang or context-specific lexis and when is an attempt 
				to speak more carefully, choose standard lexis and suppress a 
				local accent more acceptable?</dd>
				<dt><strong>register</strong></dt>
				<dd>is to do with the topic and context of where the language is 
				used.&nbsp; For example, among lawyers, a certain type of lexis 
				and some grammatical structures will be commonplace when they 
				are communicating in a professional context.&nbsp; They are 
				unlikely to use the same forms outside that domain, however.<br />
				IT-speak is notoriously laden with specialised vocabulary and 
				structures with which those outside the field may have no 
				familiarity at all.<br />
				All professions (including ours) have an internal set of lexemes 
				and, in some cases, grammatical structures which are not 
				accessible to outsiders.&nbsp; Familiarity with a topic-specific 
				argot is one of the ways we establish our professional 
				credentials and may claim to be a member of the in group.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Style and register often work in tandem so even slang expressions 
			among certain groups (medics, lawyers, football players, media 
			workers and so on) may be significantly different from those used in 
			other domains.<br />
			The social setting in which 
		the user of a language happens to be will often determine how much 
		subject-specific language, dialect, accent and slang are appropriate.<br />
			The ability to switch codes when the need arises is a common one and 
			often an underestimated communicative and social skill.</p>

			<p>Language variety has been a serious subject of study for may 
			years so it is unsurprising that it has its own set of technical 
			terminology.&nbsp; It has, in fact, an argot, so to speak, which 
			serves to allow scholars in the area to communicate with greater 
			precision than those who are not serious students of language 
			variety and (as with all such things) it excludes others who are not 
			professionals or serious scholars in the field.<br />
			Here's a summary of the main terms you may encounter and a 
			mini-glossary.&nbsp; The fourth column contains a few more examples.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="summary" height="607" src="../imagesgraphics/lects.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>Here's the glossary:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>sociolect</strong></dt>
				<dd>For our purposes, we define sociolect as the dialect used by 
				members of an identifiable social class, for example, British 
				public-school English.<br />
				It is possible to see argots, slang and jargon, standard 
				varieties and registers and styles as sub-categories of this 
				general term but, for clarity's sake, we have separated them 
				here.</dd>
				<dt><strong>argot</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is a term less disparagingly used than jargon to refer 
				to the use of terms specific to a particular group or class, for 
				example, football managers and sports journalists.</dd>
				<dt><strong>slang</strong></dt>
				<dd>This term is often used disparagingly to refer to casual or 
				'wrong' language use.&nbsp; Slangs are generally spoken forms 
				characterised by very informal uses and often confined to 
				certain class and regional groups such as, for example, Cockney 
				Rhyming Slang.</dd>
				<dt><strong>jargon</strong></dt>
				<dd>For most purposes jargon may defined as the use of 
				particular lexemes confined to certain areas of study, trade or 
				interest.&nbsp; A defining characteristic is that such terms are 
				obscure to those unversed in the area of concern.&nbsp; Certain 
				sports have associated jargon and most trades and professions 
				develop jargon terms understood only by those within them such 
				as legal jargon used by professional lawyers.</dd>
				<dt><strong>standard</strong></dt>
				<dd>The online Oxford Dictionary defines the term as <em>
				something used as a measure, norm, or model in comparative 
				evaluations</em> and that definition is adequate for our 
				purposes because a standard form is that which is seen as the 
				baseline from which other varieties differ.&nbsp; Standard 
				Australian English differs, for example, from Standard British 
				English but also differs from the varieties used by members of 
				certain social and occupation groups within Australia.</dd>
				<dt><strong>register</strong></dt>
				<dd>This term is defined on this site above as being language 
				use to do with the topic and context of where the language is 
				used.&nbsp; It is distinguished from style, which refers to 
				levels of formality although certain social settings will also 
				require or allow the use of certain styles.&nbsp; Examples 
				include, IT-speak, medical English, aviation English, athletics 
				language and hundreds more.</dd>
				<dt><strong>style</strong></dt>
				<dd>is defined above as concerned with the level of formality 
				which is seen as appropriate to use in certain settings (so is 
				closely connected to but not synonymous with register).<br />
				Joos (1961) identified five styles: frozen (notices, quotations 
				etc.), formal (precise technical or other forms such as may be 
				used in a lecture), consultative (such as may be used between 
				doctor and patient), casual (as used between equals in 
				non-professional settings), intimate (as used between family 
				members and close friends).</dd>
				<dt><strong>dialect, ethnolect, geolect and regiolect</strong></dt>
				<dd>A dialect may be either regional (such as Jamaican English, 
				Bavarian German and so on) or it may be a sociolect used by 
				certain classes.&nbsp; Often, it is defined in both ways as we 
				find in, for example, educated Lowland Scots.&nbsp; Dialect 
				affects pronunciation, lexis and grammar.<br />
				Other terms in the diagram above are synonymous although often 
				preferred by researchers in certain areas.&nbsp; The term 
				ethnolect is often preferred by those studying ethnic groups, 
				geolect by those concerned with geographical differences and 
				regiolect by those concerned with the study of macro-languages 
				such as Chinese, Malay and Arabic which contain mutually 
				incomprehensible varieties of the same major language.</dd>
				<dt><strong>accent</strong></dt>
				<dd>refer only to differences of pronunciation and may concern 
				regional varieties used by native speakers or the particular 
				characteristics of a second or additional language used by 
				speakers from some language backgrounds.&nbsp; Thus, we may 
				speak, for example, of someone having a southern United States 
				accent or an identifiable English accent when speaking in 
				German.&nbsp; Few adult learners of any additional language 
				succeed in avoiding an accent.</dd>
				<dt><strong>idiolect</strong></dt>
				<dd>An idiolect determines the fact that we can usually identify 
				close acquaintances before they identify themselves simply from 
				their tone of voice, their pronunciation of certain phonemes or 
				their use of particular idiomatic expressions and personal 
				lexis.&nbsp; It is, in other words, a dialect confined to a 
				single person (although members of the same family may have very 
				similar idiolects).</dd>
				<dt><strong>ecolect</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is a rare term which describes more or less the same 
				phenomenon as an idiolect but is a variety used within a family 
				or household.&nbsp; Some, for example, have special words and 
				and phrases unknown to outsiders which describe certain objects, 
				dishes (<em>Aunt Mabel's Potato Fritters</em>) and so on.<br />
				Some have personalised words for other objects and many members 
				of the same families are recognisably so because they use a 
				particular form of words and structures.</dd>

			<p>The most familiar way to classify the varieties of English around 
			the world was developed by Kachru (1985) and looks like this:<br />
			<img alt="kachru" height="348" src="../imagesgraphics/kachru.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>To explain a little:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>the inner circle</dt>
				<dd>consists, as the diagram shows, of the traditional bases of 
				English and their speakers provide the standards against which other 
				varieties are judged.&nbsp; It is from these speech communities, 
				in other words, that the target norms of the teaching of English 
				are derived.<br />
				The majority of the populations of inner-circle nations are 
				native speakers of English.</dd>
				<dt>the outer circle</dt>
				<dd>represents areas in which English is widely spoken as a 
				second language alongside indigenous languages and where the 
				standards of production may vary quite considerably from the 
				standards and norms of speakers in the inner circle.&nbsp; In 
				many of the nations in this circle English is an official 
				language and even where it is not, it is used widely in 
				government, administration and commerce.<br />
				There are few native speakers of English in these nations 
				although there many who are functionally bilingual.</dd>
				<dt>the expanding circle</dt>
				<dd>represents areas in which English is not spoken widely and 
				in which there are few native speakers of English.&nbsp; Use of 
				English is confined 
				to those who have learned it as a foreign language.&nbsp; 
				Usually, the norms at which the teaching of the language is 
				aimed in these settings are those of inner circle countries 
				(predominately the UK and the USA).</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The importance of all this is the concept of <strong>norms</strong> 
			of the language:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The inner circle countries are <strong>norm-setting</strong> nations and it 
				is against their standards that measures of correctness are 
				established.</li>
				<li>The outer circle countries are <strong>norm-developing</strong> areas in 
				which local standards are being set and developed often 
				independently of the inner circle countries.</li>
				<li>The expanding circle comprises countries which are <strong>norm 
				dependent</strong>, usually on the standards developed and maintained in 
				inner-circle nations.</li>

		<p>It is a truth not widely enough recognised that most learners of 
		English are not learning the language to speak to you or even to people 
		like you.&nbsp; Most learners want English as a means of international 
		communication (hereinafter referred to as EIL: English as an International 
		Language).<br />
		Increasingly, the use of EIL is most obviously identifiable in websites.<br />
		There are around 1.2 billion websites out here.&nbsp; What percentage 
		are in English?&nbsp; 
		Click 
		<img alt="eye open" class="verticalalignmiddle" height="16" src="../../gfx/eyeopen.gif" width="16" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'piechart',0,'style.visibility','visible')" />

		<div id="piechart" style="visibility: hidden">
		
			<img alt="languages" height="524" src="../imagesgraphics/internet_languages.png" width="620" /><br />
			
		</div>
			<p >Websites in languages other than English are increasing but 
		the figures are still quite startling.&nbsp; There are, unfortunately, 
			no reliable estimates concerning the first languages of the people 
			who are constructing, developing and maintaining websites which are 
			written wholly or partially in English.&nbsp; At least some, 
			possibly millions, it seems reasonable to conclude from what follows, 
			are written by people whose first language is not English.<br />
		It isn't just out here on the web that English is dominant.&nbsp; In 
		1880, 36% of scientific publications were in English.&nbsp; That had 
		risen to 64% by 1980.&nbsp; By 2000, among journals recognised by 
		Journal Citation Reports, 96% were in English.&nbsp; Some researchers 
		are beginning to complain quite loudly that in order to be published in 
		prestigious journals, one must not only write in English, one must 
		accept prevailing Anglo-American theoretical frameworks.<br />
		Here are some more assertions from 
		the British Council's website:</p>
		<ul class="smallredbullet">
			<li><em>English is the main language of books, newspapers, airports and 
			air-traffic control, international business and academic 
			conferences, science, technology, diplomacy, sport, international 
			competitions, pop music and advertising</em></li>
			<li>
			<em>over two-thirds of the world's scientists read in English</em></li>
			<li>
			<em>three quarters of the world's mail is written in English</em></li>
			<li>
			<em>eighty per cent of the world's electronically stored 
			information is in English</em></li>
		</ul>
			<p>The situation regarding language use becomes clearer when we consider the first 
			languages of the users of the internet and then we get this picture:<br />
			<img alt="users" height="577" src="../imagesgraphics/internet_users.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>And that reveals that although over 60% of websites are, like 
			this one, in English, fewer than half that percentage of people 
			count English as their first language so approximately 1.6 billion 
			people are accessing the internet and often contributing to it in English without having English 
			as a first language.&nbsp; That's a lot of users of EIL.</p>
			<p>Apart from internet users, English as an International Language 
			is a routine means of communication for people who do not share the 
			language(s) of those around them or to whom they need to communicate.&nbsp; 
			Included in that group are:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Expatriate residents in countries where English is not 
				spoken widely</li>
				<li>Tourists and those interacting with them</li>
				<li>Academics in almost any field</li>
				<li>Students studying in Anglophone nations or institutions</li>
				<li>Aviation workers</li>
				<li>Maritime workers</li>
				<li>People travelling on business</li>
				<li>Representatives of companies doing business with others 
				based in non-English-speaking settings</li>
				<li>Workers in the oil and gas industries</li>
				<li>Information technologists</li>
				<li>Medical practitioners</li>
				<li>Workers in some retail outlets</li>
				<li>Media workers</li>
				<li>People involved in entertainment, the arts and cultural 
				concerns</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and many more, of course.</p>
			<p>If we accept, following Kachru and others, that English as an International Language is 
			not part of any of the circles set out above (because it is 
			independent of setting), the question which is begged is:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">If English is being used as an international 
			language, what kind of English is it and against what yardstick is its use being judged?</p>

			<h2>English as a <em>Lingua Franca </em>(ELF) and Cultural Neutrality</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
		
			<p>A<em> lingua franca</em> arises when there is a need for people 
			who do not share a common language to communicate with each other 
			and there have been many such languages throughout history.<br />
			(We should be slightly careful here to distinguish between a <em>
			lingua franca</em> and the <em>Lingua Franca</em> which was a pidgin 
			language based on Italian and Provencal but also containing elements 
			of Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan.&nbsp; It is now extinct but 
			operated for many years as a trading language throughout the 
			Mediterranean area.)<br />
			At one time, Greek and Aramaic both functioned as a <em>lingua franca</em> in 
			the Byzantine Empire and, indeed, throughout the Middle East.&nbsp; 
			Latin was for hundreds of years the <em>lingua franca</em> in Europe 
			and beyond and until the 15th century at least, most works intended 
			for an international audience were written in Latin.&nbsp; French 
			became (and to some extent remains) the <em>lingua franca</em> of 
			diplomacy and politics and is still in its<em> lingua franca </em>role, 
			along with English and, marginally, German, in much of Africa.&nbsp; 
			Swahili, Malay and Hindi also function as <em>lingua francas</em> in 
			wide regions of Africa, Indonesia and the Indian subcontinent 
			respectively.<br />
			Other languages, notably the many varieties of pidgins and some 
			creoles, developed purely for commercial and trade purposes.&nbsp; A 
			pidgin (derived initially from Chinese speakers' pronunciation of 
			the English word <em>business</em>) is a reduced and 
			simplified language used only for commercial or other confined 
			purposes.&nbsp; It may, over time, develop into a full language and 
			then it becomes a creole with a comprehensive grammatical, 
			phonological and lexical system.&nbsp; Unlike a creole, a pidgin is 
			nobody's first language, always having been learned rather than 
			acquired.&nbsp; There are over 20 documented pidgins based on 
			English and many others based on, e.g., French, Russian and Spanish.</p>
			<p>English developed its status as a <em>lingua franca</em> in colonial 
			times and in the post-colonial era, new nations, faced with a range 
			of competing indigenous languages, frequently opted to continue with 
			English as an official language.&nbsp; An obvious example of that is 
			the use of English in India, which is home to nearly 450 languages, 
			many of them spoken by multiple millions of people.&nbsp; Despite 
			efforts to establish Hindi as the national language (a move resented 
			in the mostly non-Hindi-speaking south of the country), 
			parliamentary business is frequently conducted in English and the 
			constitution sets this out clearly.&nbsp; Writing in The New 
			York Times in 2011, an Indian journalist, Manu Joseph, regretfully 
			concluded that:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>English is the </em>de facto<em> 
			national language of India</em></span><br />
			</p>
			<p>The distinction is that English as a <em>Lingua Franca</em> (ELF) 
			differs from English as a Foreign Language (EFL) or English as an 
			International Language in one very important respect: it is not the 
			subject of study, it is a language in use for specific communicative 
			purposes.&nbsp; This means as Seidlhofer (2011: 7) states that ELF is:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">defined functionally by its use in 
			intercultural communication rather than formally by its reference to 
			native-speaker norms</p>
			<p>In this respect, ELF differs from other attempts (all 
			unsuccessful) to simplify the grammar and lexicon of English for the 
			purposes of teaching it as a means of international communication.&nbsp; The best known is 
			Basic English, developed by Ogden in 1930 and designed to be what is 
			termed an auxiliary language which should, it was suggested, be 
			taught to those needing to use English to communicate in an 
			international setting.&nbsp; For a time, Ogden's ideas were quite 
			influential, not least on science fiction writers such as HG Wells and 
			others who saw basic English as the medium of communication in the 
			future and on George Orwell who may have used it as a model for the 
			concept of <em>Newspeak</em> in his novel <em>1984</em>.&nbsp; More or less 
			the only surviving part of Basic English is a variety of word lists 
			from the 850-item basic list up to longer and more sophisticated 
			lists for more advanced learners.<br />
			Such attempts at deliberate simplification differ from ELF insofar as the suggestion was that 
			Basic English should be taught whereas ELF is defined by use rather 
			than pedagogical concerns.</p>
			<p>Following Seidlhofer's characterisation of ELF, it is often claimed that English as a 
			<em>Lingua Franca</em> is culturally 
			neutral insofar as it is not tied to the cultural norms and context 
			of any political or geographical area and that is arguably true, 
			especially when the language is being used between or among non-native 
			speakers who choose it for its cultural neutrality or who are forced 
			to use it, having no alternative means of communication.</p>
			<p>This differs from the kind of English normally taught <em>via</em> course 
			materials constructed in Anglophone countries (usually Britain or 
			the USA).&nbsp; In those, some effort is frequently made to acquaint 
			learners with certain aspects of the target-language cultures and it 
			is assumed that 
			part of the successful acquisition of the language concerns a close 
			approach to native-speaker production and, to some extent, at least, 
			to learning cultural aspects of the language as it is spoken in 
			native-speaker communities.<br />
			ELF, on the other hand requires no such cultural content and will 
			not necessarily hold up native-speaker norms as the targets of 
			production.&nbsp; For ELF to be successful, it merely needs to 
			serve the quite narrow purposes of its transactional use and to be 
			comprehensibly produced.&nbsp; In other words, its aims are not 
			formal correctness but functional effectiveness for the purposes at 
			hand.<br />
			Hülmbauer <em>et al</em> (2008:88) put it this way:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">It is important to stress that ELF, as a use 
			of English, is to be distinguished from the pedagogic subject EFL – 
			English as a Foreign Language. Basically, it can be assumed that the 
			main aim of an ELF speaker is to communicate with other non-native 
			speakers whereas EFL, which is (still) typically learned at school, 
			takes the native speaker as a target and encompasses components of 
			English native-speaker culture.</p>
			<p>We could, then, conclude that ELF is culturally neutral but some 
			have objected that this is not, in reality, the case.&nbsp; They 
			would argue that ELF is actually multi-cultural because wherever it 
			is used its speakers bring with them their own cultural identities 
			and their own cultural baggage.&nbsp; The structure of ELF in some 
			circumstances may also be substantially affected by the structures 
			of the first languages of its users.<br />
			In an article discussing the role of native-speaker norms in China, 
			Wang (2015) concludes:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">However, signs are found in the country to 
			welcome an ELF perspective.&nbsp;Therefore, it can be hoped that 
			Chinese speakers will claim their ownership of English in the near 
			future.</p>
			<p>which strongly implies that, far from being culturally neutral, 
			at least one variety of ELF will be, or should be, Chinese.</p>
			<p>Within multi-national corporations, wherever they are nominally 
			headquartered, it is reasonably common to find a form of English 
			being adopted as the internal language of the entire business.<br />
			Writing in
			The Harvard Business Review, Neeley (2012) cites at least Airbus, Daimler-Chrysler, 
			Fast Retailing, Nokia, Renault, Samsung, SAP, Technicolor, and 
			Microsoft in Beijing as corporations using only English as their 
			internal language.&nbsp; To that list we can add Honda and 
			Volkswagen.<br />
				Non-commercial, governmental and other international bodies also use 
				English as their working language even when they are not based 
				in or conduct most of their activities in English-speaking 
				cultures.&nbsp;
				These include institutions as widely varied as The International 
				Monetary Fund, The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting 
				Companies, The Union of South American Nations, The Council of 
				Europe, World Rugby and The World Trade Organisation.<br />
			It is a matter of debate whether the culture 
			of a business counts as a cultural input into the language.</p>
			<p>It is the case that there are far more users of ELF and EIL than there 
			are first-language users of English and that is a situation that is 
			unlikely to change in the near (or even quite distant) future.</p>

			<h3>Characteristics of English as a <em>Lingua Franca</em></h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
		
			<p>We have seen that ELF differs from EIL in a number of important 
			ways, centrally:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>English as an International Language is, allegedly, 
				independent of culture but its norms of correctness are still 
				based on the inner-circle, native-speaker community albeit stripped of 
				cultural references and much idiomaticity.</li>
				<li>English as a <em>Lingua Franca</em> is, again allegedly, 
				free from Anglophone (or any other) cultural influences but it 
				is also independent 
				in terms of norms of correctness and does not depend on the 
				native-speaker community for judgements concerning correctness.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If this is the case, we now need to look briefly at the nature of 
			ELF.<br />
			Research is still at an early stage but we can already perceive 
			some important characteristics.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>phonology</strong></dt>
				<dd>Traditionally, learners of English are encouraged to 
				approach a native-speaker pronunciation (usually either AmE or 
				southern BrE).&nbsp; Efforts are accordingly made to present 
				native-speaker production as the models in classrooms.<br />
				ELF needs no such constraint because providing the users of the 
				language understand each other deviations, often considerable 
				ones, from native-speaker production norms do not matter 
				as long as there is some agreement about the phonological core.&nbsp; 
				Troublesome sounds for many, such as the distinction between 
				/iː/, /ɪ/ and /i/ and phonemes such as /θ/ and /ð/, the incidence 
				of the schwa, the stress-timed nature of the language and 
				distinctions between /t/ and /d/ or other voiced and unvoiced 
				consonants in certain environments matter little, therefore.<br />
				Prosodic features, such as the intonation contour across tag 
				questions, for example, can be discarded.<br />
				It is often noted by learners of any language that a foreigner 
				speaking the target language is often easier to understand than 
				a native speaker.</dd>
				<dt><strong>lexicogrammar</strong></dt>
				<dd>English has many troublesome grammar traps for the unwary 
				learner which can be (and are) avoided altogether when ELF is used.<br />
				So, for example (drawing on Hülmbauer <em>et al, op cit</em>.):<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li>the usually redundant final <em>-s / -es</em> on 
					third-person verb stems need not be used (and often isn't).&nbsp; 
					For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It break easy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She come tomorrow</em><br />
					are all perfectly comprehensible without the troublesome 
					inflexion.</li>
					<li>the distinction between simple past and present perfect 
					becomes unimportant.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has just arrived</em><br />
					can equally well be expressed as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He just arrived</em><br />
					with no change in the message which is sent.</li>
					<li>the aspectual system of English can be simplified very 
					considerably with very little loss of communicative 
					effectiveness.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had already met him</em><br />
					can be expressed as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She met him before</em><br />
					(as it might be in many other languages) with the adverbial 
					functioning to signal the aspect.<br />
					Equally,<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will finish by then</em><br />
					stands just as well for:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have finished by then</em><br />
					Other aspects, iterative, progressive and durative, in 
					particular, can be signalled by the insertion of simple 
					adverbials without requiring a change to the grammar so, 
					e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He banged on the door many times today</em><br />
					can represent the meaning encoded in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has been banging on the door</em></li>
					<li>the complex choices available to signal prospective 
					aspects of verbs can be reduced to the<em> will</em> +<em>
					</em>base form as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will go to London tomorrow</em><br />
					can serve to express:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to go to London tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to London tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go to London tomorrow</em><br />
					with little if any loss of precision.<br />
					The future can, in fact, simply be referred to in the 
					present with the addition of a suitable time marker and that 
					applies also to the past.&nbsp; We may hear, therefore:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She go tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is arriving yesterday</em><br />
					and both will be instantly comprehensible.</li>
					<li>progressive forms can be used for all verbs so no 
					distinction needs to be made between <em>he came </em>and<em> 
					he was coming </em>which absolves users of the need to 
					differentiate between the aspects and also removes the need 
					to learn irregular past tenses (because the -<em>ing</em> 
					form is <strong>always</strong> regular).</li>
					<li>distinctions between mass and count nouns can generally 
					be ignored so <em>informations, advices, knowledges </em>and 
					so on are all used to no obviously deleterious communicative 
					effect.&nbsp; Indeed, some might argue that they introduce 
					useful concepts.<br />
					This also allows for a reduction in the determiner system 
					so, for example, <em>many</em> is allowed to determine both 
					mass and count concepts.</li>
					<li>the adverb-adjective distinction can be evaded by using 
					the simpler form in all cases so we arrive at:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He do it careful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She talk loud</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>adjective inflexions which follow complex rules can be 
					removed by the insertion of the periphrastic form in all 
					cases so we get:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is more good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is more happy</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>articles can be simplified and often ellipted altogether 
					so, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is manager</em><br />
					operates just as effectively as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is the manager</em></li>
					<li>demonstrative pronouns and determiners can be reduced to 
					the singular <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> so we can say:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that houses</em><br />
					and so on without losing communicative effect.</li>
					<li>prime verbs (such as <em>do, make, take, have</em> and 
					so on) can be regularised or reduced for simplicity's sake 
					so, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make sport<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make the work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make discussions</em><br />
					are encountered in ELF.</li>
					<li>the complexities of tag questions can be avoided by 
					using a simple <em>isn't it?</em> formulation in all cases 
					as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was at the meeting, isn't it?</em></li>
					<li>irregularities in the prepositional system of English 
					can be ironed out so we will get, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We spoke about it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We argued about it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We discussed about it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We considered about it<br />
					</em>etc.</li>
					<li>modal auxiliary verbs can be simplified by, e.g., using 
					only <em>should</em> and <em>must </em>to allow two levels 
					of obligation and dispensing with <em>ought to </em>and <em>
					have to </em>altogether.&nbsp; Equally, to express degrees 
					of likelihood, only <em>can</em> and, possibly, <em>could</em> 
					are required so <em>may</em> and <em>might</em> are 
					effectively redundant.&nbsp; Future and past uses can be 
					simplified by just using the same forms in all tenses so:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must make it last year</em><br />
					stands for<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to do it last year.</em></li>
					<li>marginal and semi-modal auxiliary verbs can be dispensed 
					with altogether because, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was working here once</em><br />
					will serve to express:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to work here</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am eating late</em><br />
					serves to express<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tend to eat late</em><br />
					and in no cases is there a significant signal loss.</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>semantics</strong></dt>
				<dd>Semantically, a great deal of reduction can be achieved by 
			allowing hypernyms such as <em>machine</em> to do service for 
			second-level terms such as <em>engine, motor, device </em>and so on.<br />
				By the same token, what is known as a relationship of troponymy 
				in which all the second-level hyponyms are 
			expressive of the manner of doing something can be reduced to the 
				hypernym so, for example, the verb <em>walk</em> or even <em>go</em> 
				will serve to express <em>saunter, stroll, wander, walk, 
				meander, run, gallop</em> and lots more.&nbsp; If more precision 
				really is required at any time, the resources of the basic 
				adjective set or adverbials can be employed so we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walk relaxed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walk fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go slow</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go around the shops</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>pragmatics</strong></dt>
				<dd>ELF speakers can dispense with idiom and metaphor almost 
				altogether.&nbsp; All idiomatic expressions can be substituted 
				with literal expression so there is no longer a need to learn, 
				for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the bottom line<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						close a deal<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						corner the market</em><br />
				can all be expressed as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the end number<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make contract<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have monopoly</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Phrasal verbs, which are sometimes seen as a subset of idiomatic 
				language because of the opaqueness of many of them can also be 
				reduced, so, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked it up in the dictionary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are you getting on?</em><br />
				can be simplified to:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked it in the dictionary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are you doing?</em><br />
				respectively.<br />
				This means in fact that some native speakers of English, unused 
				to the constraints of ELF and unpractised in its use, may find 
				themselves at a disadvantage communicatively if they persist in 
				peppering their talk with idiomatic language.<br />
				This also means, of course, that native speakers who want to be 
				clearly understood by ELF speakers have themselves to learn to 
				speak ELF.&nbsp; They are, of course, the <strong>only</strong> 
				people who have to learn it.</dd>

			<p>It is sometimes little appreciated by people whose job is to 
			teach English that the majority of learners do not need to learn the 
			language to a high level of mastery.&nbsp; They need to learn enough 
			for their purposes.&nbsp; A knowledge of English is, therefore, an 
			instrument for achieving other aims, not an aim in itself.<br />
			Clearly, if a learner has ambitions to teach the language to others 
			or to integrate seamlessly into an Anglophone culture, high levels 
			of proficiency will be required but that describes a tiny minority 
			of learners.&nbsp; Many millions of learners find that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>a level of mastery at or around the Common European 
				Framework level B1 or B2 is adequate for most day-to-day 
				communication.&nbsp; Indeed, the Common European Framework 
				describes learners at those levels as <em>independent users</em> 
				and that is, functionally, all most learners want to become.&nbsp; 
				They do not need to be proficient, just independent.</li>
				<li>the affordances offered by a limited, inaccurate but usable 
				knowledge of the language are adequate for their professional 
				purposes.&nbsp; Their needs for language are satisfied at that 
				level.</li>
				<li>the time and effort required to move from an Intermediate to 
				an Advanced level of language use outweighs any benefits that a 
				higher level brings.&nbsp; Pareto's Law seems to indicate that 
				the last 20% of progress towards full mastery of the language 
				requires 80% of the effort and time.</li>
				<li>it is better to have a working knowledge of a range of 
				important foreign languages than a high level of mastery of only 
				one.</li>
				<li>any development of language skills can proceed 
				piecemeal once the basics have been acquired and lexical range, 
				in particular, can be increased as and when the need arises for 
				more communicative precision.&nbsp; Such enhancements do not 
				require laborious formal study.</li>
				<li>they have better things to do.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Undoubtedly, there are teachers of English who regret these small 
			facts but that is not really very important.&nbsp; Once we recognise 
			that the motivation to proceed beyond a working knowledge of the 
			language is simply not there, life becomes rather more settled.</p>

			<h3>Criticisms of the use of English as a <em>Lingua Franca</em></h3>

			<p>There are, of course, some native speakers who will decry such 
			alterations to the basic structures and lexemes of English as a 
			corruption or pidginisation of the language but this doesn't really affect anything because ELF has 
			nothing to do with native speakers and they are not in charge of its 
			development.<br />
			As Widdowson (1993: 43) put it</p>
			<p class="indentpara">How English develops in the world is no 
			business whatever of native speakers in England, the United States 
			or anywhere else. They have no say in the matter, no right to 
			intervene or pass judgement. They are irrelevant. The very fact that 
			English is an international language means that no nation can have 
			custody over it</p>
			<p>It is worth noticing, in passing, that Widdowson is actually 
			writing explicitly about EIL, not ELF and it is reasonable to assume 
			that his comment would be even more applicable to the latter.<br />
			Notwithstanding all that, ELF does have some of the characteristics 
			of a pidgin insofar as the grammatical system and the lexicon are 
			much reduced and simplified.&nbsp; Where it differs is in drawing 
			its grammar and lexicon from only one source: English.</p>
			<p>None of this is, incidentally, an argument for <em>teaching</em> 
			ELF directly because, by its nature, ELF is not a subject for study, 
			it is, in its own right, language in use, not language in a 
			classroom.&nbsp; There are, it seems, no language courses anywhere 
			which aim to teach ELF although it clearly could be taught and 
			learned just as people learn any pidgin language.<br />
			One of the reasons for that is that people are unpredictable and so 
			are their needs for language.&nbsp; For example, speakers of English 
			may at some time be involved in communication in ELF because they 
			need to communicate with other users of the variety and then may 
			find themselves in other settings in which the use of ELF would be 
			unacceptable or, at least, inappropriate (such as conversations with 
			native speakers or more advanced speakers of EFL).<br />
			At other times, as we saw above, they may need to access English 
			texts, spoken or written, and that will be made easier with higher 
			levels of sensitivity to idiom and nuance.</p>
			<p>There is, naturally, a danger in using ELF in settings in which 
			more native-like modes of expression are valued.&nbsp; As Swan 
			(2002) has pointed out:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">In some social contexts, serious deviance from 
			native-speaker norms can hinder integration and excite prejudice – a 
			person who speaks ‘badly’ may not be taken seriously, or may be 
			considered uneducated or stupid. Students may, therefore, want or 
			need a higher level of grammatical correctness than is required for 
			mere comprehensibility.</p>
			<p>He is also not alone in noting that deficiencies in grammatical 
			structure can lead to deficiencies in communicative effectiveness 
			and he concludes (<em>ibid</em>.):</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Knowing how to build and use certain 
			structures makes it possible to communicate common types of meaning 
			successfully.&nbsp;Without these structures, it is difficult to make 
			comprehensible sentences.</p>
			<p>The criticism of ELF is, of course, that the simplification of 
			structure and lexis may undermine its apparent purpose &ndash; 
			simple and effective communication independent of exterior norms of 
			correctness.&nbsp; Even leaving out components of English grammar 
			such as articles can result in miscommunication so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is the manager</em><br />
			<em>vs.</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is a manager</em><br />
			are distinguishable and encapsulate some potentially vital data 
			which cannot be signalled with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She manager.</em></p>
