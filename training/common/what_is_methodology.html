			<h1>What is methodology?&nbsp; An essential guide</h1>

			</table>
			
			<p>A dictionary definition of methodology is
			<span class="style_black"><em>a system of methods used in a particular 
			area of study or activity</em></span></p>
			<p>This is a very brief guide.&nbsp; For more in this area, see the 
			list of related guides, linked at the end.</p>
			<p>There are two common ways to define methodology in English 
			Language Teaching and, graphically, this is how they look:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="methodologies" src="../imagesgraphics/methodologies.png" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The left-hand set was developed by Anthony in 1963.&nbsp; The 
			right-hand set was developed from Anthony's definition later and 
			appears in Richards and Rogers, 2001.&nbsp; Briefly:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Approach</strong></dt>
				<dd>For Anthony, an approach was simply a 
				set of principles or ideas about the nature of language learning.<br />
				For Richards and Rogers it was similar but explicitly divided 
				into theories of what language is and theories of how learning a 
				foreign language happens.<br />
				The second of these definitions has the advantage of being quite 
				explicit.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Method or Design</strong></dt>
				<dd>In this section are lesson designs such as 
				Present&ndash;Practice&ndash;Produce or Test–Teach–Test.&nbsp; Those are not 
				methods, they are ways of structuring lessons within methods.<br />
				For Anthony, method described the plan for the presentation 
				of language which is consistent with the approach.<br />
				Richards and Rogers' concept of design is somewhat broader and 
				covered the practical implications in the classroom: syllabus 
				design, activities and the roles of teachers and students.<br />
				These are not all that different but again, the latter one is 
				more explicit.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Technique or Procedure</strong></dt>
				<dd>Technique, for Anthony, was just any teaching trick or way 
				of doing something in the classroom such as eliciting, 
				approaching a reading text, encouraging authentic speaking, 
				drills and so on.<br />
				For Richards and Rogers, too, the term procedure refers to what 
				we see happening in the classroom when a particular approach and 
				design are implemented.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>It actually doesn't matter all that much which breakdown you 
			accept.&nbsp; Both are fairly arbitrary and subjective ways of 
			breaking down a complex area.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="practice" height="166" src="../images/work250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style31">
				<h2>Methodology in practice</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>It is worth pointing out that not all methodologies will fit 
			neatly into the categories above.<br />
			For example, Communicative Language Teaching, the current dominant 
			methodology, has a good theory of language but little to say 
			concerning a theory of learning.&nbsp; Some earlier methodologies 
			such as Situational Language Teaching were similarly deficient but 
			some, audio-lingualism, for example, had very clear theories both of 
			what language actually is and how people learn languages.</p>
			<p>The extent to which, if at all, the various models and concepts 
			of language and learning actually reflect reality is, of course, 
			quite another matter.</p>
			<p>It is, however, often quite possible to work backwards from what 
			is observed in the classroom (techniques and procedures) and deduce 
			the approach a teacher favours or to work from the materials an 
			institution uses (the method or design) to see what principles (the 
			approach) the institution is favouring.&nbsp; The Delta examination, 
			e.g., explicitly asks you to do that.</p>

				<h2>What is not methodology</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>It is common for some ways of doing things to be referred to as 
			method or methodology but this is to misunderstand the terms as they 
			are used in our field.&nbsp; In non-technical language, of course, 
			method just means a way of doing something but that is not how it 
			should be used in ELT.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Structuring a lesson along the lines of Test &gt; Teach &gt; Test 
				or Presentation &gt; Practice &gt; Production is not to use a 
				methodology.&nbsp; It is simply a way to arrange procedures and 
				tasks in a lesson.&nbsp; Both these structures can inhabit very 
				different methodologies.</li>
				<li>Taking an inductive approach in which learners are asked to 
				figure out the patterns and rules from language examples or a 
				deductive approach in which learners are given the rule and 
				asked to apply it to language are just ways to approach making 
				things learnable and accessible.&nbsp; Neither qualifies as a 
				methodology.</li>
				<li>Making lessons learner centred by, for example, negotiating 
				the syllabus with the learners, making feedback routines come 
				from the class rather than the teacher or encouraging 
				peer-teaching and peer-correction does not count as a 
				methodology.&nbsp; It may be an approach to classroom management 
				but it is not a methodology.</li>
				<li>Even approaches taken by people who claim to be employing a 
				methodology may not really qualify.&nbsp; Dogme, for example, is 
				an approach to teaching which sits comfortably within 
				Communicative Language Teaching so it is probably better 
				described as an approach to lesson design rather than grandly 
				calling it a methodology.&nbsp; Task-Based Learning and Teaching 
				is another example of something often called a methodology but 
				one that fits more comfortably into Anthony's concept of a 
				Method or Richards and Rogers' category of Design because the 
				methodology into which it fits is clearly communicative.</li>
			</ul>

			language, hypotheses about learning, procedures and techniques, see
