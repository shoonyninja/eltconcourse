			<p>Few users of this site believe in flying unicorns (presumably).<br />
			It is slightly surprising, however, just how many teachers of 
			English believe in only slightly less credible ideas when it comes 
			to teaching and the English language.<br />
			This guide is an attempt to see us back on the straight and narrow 
			and to stop believing in things for which there is no evidence or 
			for which the evidence is, in fact, almost wholly negative.<br />
			To be entirely fair, calling all these views myths is not always 
			fully accurate because some are simply assertions and nobody knows 
			if they are true or not.&nbsp; Others are real myths which have been 
			proven to be untrue and to which some people still adhere often with 
			confidence arising from ignorance.<br />
			Some of the ideas that are discussed here are hypotheses based on 
			intuition alone so they aren't myths in the strictest sense of the 
			word, but they slip between the status of hypothesis to assertions 
			of fact rather too easily.<br />
			Some, indeed, have become received wisdom on teacher training 
			courses and many otherwise quite helpful websites but they should be 
			treated with a certain amount of caution.</p>

				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Well, we start by looking at the evidence.<br />
			It is an ancient aphorism that we should not be sure that we have 
			the right answer until we are sure we have asked the right question.<br />
			Here, we need what Carl Sagan called a baloney detection kit 
			(others have used a less respectable description of what is meant by 
			baloney).&nbsp; Sagan's rules for the construction of a baloney 
			detection kit are quite elaborate (but well worth reading).&nbsp; 
			Here, we'll just focus on a few of them.<br />
			There are some rules to follow when anyone tells you about a new 
			approach to teaching English or just tells you the right way to do 
			it (with the implication that all the others are wrong).</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Claims are too good to be true<br />
				If an approach, a methodology or whatever makes exaggerated 
				claims for its efficacy and effectiveness, suspect it.<br />
				If something is too good to be true, it probably isn't true.<br />
				An example is some of the outrageous claims made for 
				neurolinguistic programming.</li>
				<li>Vague or inadequately hedged assertions<br />
				As soon as you hear the words <em>generally, usually, in most 
				circumstances </em>and so on, be prepared to think when the 
				assertion does not apply.<br />
				Equally, if you read or hear words like <em>obviously, 
				unquestionably, always </em>and find that the message is couched 
				in the present simple with no hedging or expression of argument 
				rather than simple assertion, pass on by.</li>
				<li>Dressed-up science-like terminology<br />
				If something is proposed in terms which appear scientific, check 
				them out.&nbsp; Learning style theories are a good example, 
				replete as they are with terms like <em>activist, kinaesthetic</em> 
				and so on.</li>
				<li>Appeal to intuition and common sense<br />
				If an assertion or approach is based on what seems or just ought 
				to be true 
				rather than evidence that it is true, it's probably wrong.</li>
				<li>It can't hurt<br />
				Many ideas and approaches are couched in terms which imply that 
				they can do no harm and may well do good.&nbsp; That is not much 
				of a recommendation.</li>
				<li>Falsifiability<br />
				If an idea cannot be falsified, it isn't worth considering.</li>
				<li>Appeal to ignorance<br />
				The other side of this coin is the claim that anything which is 
				not proven to be false, must be true.&nbsp; We cannot prove that 
				there isn't a chocolate teapot orbiting the sun at a distance of 
				six light years but that does not mean there is one.</li>
				<li>The exclusion of the middle<br />
				If an idea or admonition is couched in terms which exclude a 
				middle way, suspect it.&nbsp; A good example is the inductive 
				<em>vs.</em> deductive debate which seems to imply that there is no 
				middle way and, indeed, that one is better than the other with 
				no consideration of how the processes work.</li>
			</ol>

			in two areas and see 
			what's in them.</p>

			or Parisian French provenance but that leaves 26% derived from 
			Germanic languages, 6% directly from Greek and another 10% of 
			various origins.<br />
			The grammar of the language is, however, overwhelmingly Germanic in 
			origin despite having lost nearly all the case and gender inflexions

			important in the pronoun system and also affect how, for example, 
			relative clauses are formed.<br />
			Case considerations are also very important in the analysis of 
			transitivity (obviously).<br />
			The genitive system in English is complex and dative shifting for 
			the indirect object is frequent and frequently misunderstood.</p>

					<h3>English grammar is difficult</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Most people assume that the grammar of their own language is more 
			difficult than that of other languages.<br />
			The truth is that English is extraordinarily simple in many ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Verb forms for regular verbs require the learning of very 
				few rules of spelling and pronunciation because there are so few 
				inflexions.&nbsp; There are no irregular -<em>ing</em> forms at 
				all.</li>
				<li>Irregular verb forms require the learning of only one or two 
				forms for all persons.</li>
				<li>Nouns are only ever inflected for number and plurals, with a 
				few exceptions, are almost universally simple and predictable.</li>
				<li>No changes are made to determiners for case and few for 
				number and countability.</li>
				<li>No adjective or adverb forms change in any way for number, 
				case or gender.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Nevertheless, there are obvious difficulties, not least the 
			aspectual and tense structure of English which is complicated.</p>
			<p>Making matters much worse in this regard is a regrettable 
			tendency to make up rules where no rule exists.&nbsp; Three examples 
			will suffice:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The past perfect is used when one event precedes another.&nbsp; 
				That would make:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She locked herself out and climbed in 
				through the bathroom window<br />
				</em>wrong.&nbsp; There is no doubt that<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had locked herself out and climbed in 
				through the bathroom window<br />
				</em>is correctly formed but it's no better.</li>
				<li>When we set two events in the future, we use the future 
				perfect form to show the ordering.&nbsp; That would make:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll finish this by the time the boss 
				gets back from lunch<br />
				</em>wrong.&nbsp; Again, there's no doubt that<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll have finished this by the time the 
				boss gets back from lunch<br />
				</em>is correctly formed but it's no better.</li>
				<li><em>have to vs. must </em>is fertile ground for the 
				invention of non-rules:<ol class="auto-style19">
					<li>The modal auxiliary verb <em>have to</em> applies to external 
			obligation placed on a person and <em>must</em> is used for internal 
			senses of obligation and duty.&nbsp; It follows that:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to write to my mother<br />
					</em>is an obligation placed on me by another and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must write to my mother<br />
					</em>is a sense of duty I am imposing on myself to commit to an 
			action.<br />
					Not true.&nbsp; Most people use the verbs interchangeably 
					(they are in free variation).</li>
					<li>The verb <em>must</em> refers to a specific obligation 
			and <em>have to </em>refers to more general obligations so, it is averred:<br />&nbsp; 
					<em>&nbsp; I must tell her the truth</em><br />is correct and so is:<br />&nbsp; 
					<em>&nbsp; We have to tell the truth at all times</em><br />but the alternative formulations:<br />&nbsp; 
					<em>&nbsp; I have to tell her the truth</em><br />and<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must tell the truth at all times</em><br />are somehow wrong.<br />
					That is nonsense, of course.</li>
					<li>We use <em>must</em> to 
			refer to duties we impose on others and we reserve <em>have to </em>to imply that the obligation comes from elsewhere (a similar but 
			slightly subtler idea than the external-internal distinction).&nbsp; 
			So, it would follow that we should prefer:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must be careful</em> (<em>because I 
			require it</em>)<br />to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You have to be careful</em> (<em>because other 
			authorities require it</em>).<br />Whether this distinction exists is doubtful and 
			whether it is worth troubling most learners with it is even more 
			doubtful.&nbsp; It is unlikely that most native speakers would wince 
			if the modal auxiliary verbs were used in reverse.<br />
					(For a little more, track down the guide to central modal 
					auxiliary verbs.)</li>

					<h3>Communicative Language Teaching is the best way to teach</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Well, it rather depends on what the learners need, doesn't it?<br />
			There's plenty of evidence to show that people who have been taught 
			the language using a communicative methodology are better at 
			communicating than those who have been taught through a form-based 
			methodology.<br />
			On the other hand, of course, there's just as much evidence to show 
			that people who have been taught through a form-based methodology 
			produce more accurate and acceptable language than those who have 
			not.<br />
			What there is not is any evidence to show that communicative 
			methodologies are more effective overall.<br />
			Many people who have learned the language through very form-based 
			traditional approaches have nevertheless attained an impressive 
			mastery of the language forms and are perfectly capable of using the 
			language accurately and fluently to communicate their ideas.<br />
			It has been suggested that Communicative Language Teaching is 
			popular because:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It absolves many teachers of the need to learn grammar.</li>
				<li>It feels right that people will learn the language in their 
				efforts to communicate in it although how one would acquire the 
				case structures of German or Russian or the 15 or so cases in 
				Finnish that way is obscure.&nbsp; Other structures in English, 
				such as the passive and relative clauses are unlikely to be 
				acquired at all in a purely communicative context because they 
				are more rarely used and have complex grammar.</li>
				<li>It fits well with Anglophone cultures (from which many 
				teachers come) which prize risk taking and faulty but effective 
				communication above accuracy and potential loss of public face.</li>
				<li>It allows teachers to justify an unnecessary and wasteful 
				amount of time being spent on skills work.</li>
				<li>It absolves people of the duty to construct a logical 
				syllabus progression and reinforces the idea that language 
				structure can be taught in unconnected piecemeal gobbets as and 
				when the need arises.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The corollary to this argument is that we should teach function 
			not structure because that's the communicative, and, therefore best, 
			way to teach.<br />
			The problem with the teaching of functions is that it quickly 
			degenerates into a phrase-book approach to teaching anything.&nbsp; 
			It needn't, if it's well handled, but it does.<br />
			Then we get to the stage at which a learner may be told that, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please forgive me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I regret that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excuse me</em><br />
			and so on are all ways to perform the function of apologising (and 
			they are, of course, although they vary in intention and style).<br />
			Unfortunately, however, learning those four simple phrases and 
			clauses tells the learner nothing which is of any further use and it 
			is not possible for any learner to generate, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I apologise</em><br />
			from any of them or even from a combination of them because there is 
			no overt pattern to emulate and manipulate.<br />
			On the other hand, teaching that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgive me, please<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excuse me, please<br />
			</em>are transitive verbs in the imperative and the structure is 
			simply the base form of the verb followed by a direct object (hence
			<em>me</em> not <em>I</em>) which is softened by the use of <em>
			please, </em>does allow any learner to generate:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help me, please<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me, please<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show me, please</em><br />
			and thousands of other perfectly correct imperative-form requests 
			which can perform multiple functions.&nbsp; The learner then has to 
			supply the correct structure (not too hard) and know the meaning of 
			the lexis.&nbsp; That's all.<br />
			With a small nudge, learners may also be able to generate:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell Mr Jones, please<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take Mary to school, please<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the box carefully, please<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write me a letter</em><br />
			and we are still proceeding from the simple pattern of the clause.<br />
			It is not beyond the wit of most learners to see that the meanings 
			of the verbs and the settings in which one might use these clauses 
			will determine the function which is performed.<br />
			The reason is simple: functional language abjures a focus on pattern 
			but structural considerations insist on it.</p>

				varied.</li>
				<li>There are lots of them<br />

				In some, for example, it was found that the article system was

				two others the fourth and in one it was the eleventh item to be 
				acquired.<br />
				One may be excused for thinking that learners of languages which

				that the study which placed articles in eleventh place was 
				conducted with Japanese speakers.</li>
				<li>The focus of such studies is usually on easily identifiable 
				morphemes in the language: the articles system, with no 
				distinction between definite and indefinite, incidentally, the -<em>ing</em> 
				form of the progressive aspect, copula <em>be, </em>regular past 
				tense forms, plurals, contractions, possessive markers and so 
				on.<br />
				No information in the studies was available or looked for 
				concerning other structures such as conditional forms, aspects 
				of tenses, passive clauses, relative pronoun clauses, causative 
				structures and so on.<br />
				It is much less likely that these sorts of structures will show 
				the same standard progression and the outcomes are much more 
				likely to be based on issues concerning the learners' 
				first-language structures.</li>

			What this assumption ignores in the fact that speakers of no

&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary arrived on Thursday.<br />

			<p>This is another classroom ritual.&nbsp; The usual theoretical

			<ol>
				<li>It is assumed, taking a social constructiveness theory of

				activity.&nbsp; Proponents of such theories of learning have 
				failed so far to explain the mechanisms of learning in a 
				persuasive manner.&nbsp; It remains in the status of a 
				hypothesis.&nbsp; Furthermore, it seems to exclude the 
				possibility of learning anything by working entirely alone and 
				that is not a hypothesis which bears much scrutiny.</li>
				<li>It is assumed that learners will get more speaking practice 
				if they work in groups or pairs without the direct intervention 
				of a teacher and that, thus, teacher talk will be diminished and 
				learner talk increased.<br />
				What is often not mentioned is that learner talk to which other 
				learners are exposed is rarely a good model so learning from 
				one's peers may not be a useful way of acquiring accurate and 
				appropriate language.&nbsp; Indeed, it is unlikely that most 
				people's first choice of a teacher would be someone at the same 
				level of mastery of the language as themselves.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>While in theory it may be motivating and interesting to work on a 
			task with others, in practice what happens is that one student will 
			often dominate the exchange and complete the task while others do 
			very little or the task will not be adequately completed by anyone.<br />
			Some learners may actually need a little peaceful space to think and 
			manipulate the language alone and pair- and group-work precludes 
			this possibility.</p>

				</table>
			<p>Much teacher advice and, alas, time in the classroom has been 
			spent encouraging learners to use an English-only dictionary but 
			quite why this should be seen as more efficacious and accurate than 
			using a translating dictionary remains obscure.<br />
			Modern bilingual dictionaries are extremely accurate and helpful in 
			translating both words and phrases across languages and very few 
			people would feel comfortable approaching the task of operating in a 
			foreign language without one.&nbsp; Even teachers who have been 
			convinced on an initial training course that English-only 
			dictionaries are somehow better than the other sort are often seen 
			clutching translating dictionaries when they first get a job working 
			in a foreign country whose language they know only imperfectly, if 
			at all.<br />
			The huge success of published translating dictionaries and phrase 
			books should alert us to the fact that they are actually seen by 
			millions as very useful things.&nbsp; That is, of course, not 
			evidence that they actually are useful.</p>
			<p>Nowadays, of course, we are also in the age of machine translations 
			and some of the software is very impressive indeed, being able to 
			translate the spoken word and also to note issues of style and 
			appropriacy.&nbsp; None of this technology is going away any time 
			soon and it will probably continue to get better and better, so teachers have to learn to use 
			it to enhance learning rather 
			than prohibit its use based on an assumption that cannot be supported by 
			the evidence.<br />
			Many learners will also, when using their knowledge of English, be 
			asked to translate for others and that, of course, is a skill worth 
			acquiring for those people.&nbsp; Not to focus on it would seem 
			slightly perverse.<br />
			Thousands of hours of classroom time may be being wasted by people 
			struggling to explain concepts in English only when a 1-minute 
			excursion into translation would clear a matter up very adequately. </p>

			<p>This is a hangover from the reform movement of the 19th century

			There is no obvious flaw in the idea that it is easier

			That this is always and inevitably the case is much less arguable.<br />
			Some forms of language are, in fact, only ever encountered in a

			unlikely that one would read or have to write something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass the salt, please</em><br />
			because that kind of request is confined to the spoken language.<br />

				</table>
			<p>This is a myth greatly encouraged by well-known teaching 
			qualifications in the profession but one which is hard to maintain 
			in the face of argument.<br />
			The assumption behind it starts from the unproven assertion that 
			learners are incapable of transferring social and written skills 
			from language one to language two.<br />
			It is, naturally, demonstrable that the way texts are organised and 
			the way oral interactions and transactions are conducted does vary 
			across languages.&nbsp; That is primarily a cultural issue, of 
			course, not a linguistic one <em>per se</em> because the culture 
			determines the appropriate language to use, and the appropriate way 
			to structure texts, not the other way 
			around.<br />
			Some time spent, therefore, on the analysis and construction of 
			conventional written texts and focusing on social appropriacy and 
			oral competence is arguably very useful.<br />
			However, the assumption that such a focus is <strong><em>as</em></strong> 
			important as a focus on increasing learners ability to use the 
			structures and lexis of the target language is much more difficult 
			to sustain.<br />
			The same arguments apply to receptive skills with an often unspoken 
			assumption that learners are incapable of transferring skills such 
			as listening or reading for specifics or gist.&nbsp; Most learners 
			are, in fact, perfectly capable of scanning or skimming, monitoring 
			listening or listening intensively for information in their own 
			languages and there is little reason to suppose that the skills 
			cannot be deployed in a foreign-language setting.<br />
			We may need to alert learners to what they should be doing (because 
			operating in a foreign language is cognitively very demanding and 
			people forget) but the presumption that we should be teaching these 
			skills to adults is pushing at the limits of credibility.<br />
			It seems unarguable that without a sound grasp of the systems of the 
			language, learners will be unable either to speak appropriately or 
			write accurately and conventionally.&nbsp; Knowledge of systems, 
			then, has to precede knowledge of speaking, listening, reading and 
			writing.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, it is often quite difficult to separate skills from 
			systems work in a principled way.&nbsp; For example, a focus on how 
			textual cohesion is maintained in writing or on how turn-taking and 
			turn-passing opportunities in spoken interactions are signalled is a systematic 
			endeavour allied to skills development.&nbsp; They cannot be 
			sensibly separated.</p>

					<h3>The focus on grammatical and pronunciation accuracy is

					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>This is a myth much favoured by those who cannot be bothered to 
			learn about the systems of the language they are teaching because, 
			they aver, it is unnecessary to do so.&nbsp; Accurate use will flow 
			from the effort to communicate, they say, and learners will, by a 
			process of induction, come to form internal rules which will allow 
			them to speak and write with acceptable accuracy and in conventional 
			form.<br />
			This may well be true for some of the simpler aspects of the systems 
			of English, such as, for example, the formation of plurals or the 
			pronoun system (both of which are transparently simple) but it is 
			much more difficult to maintain this position when it comes to more 
			complex language such as the formation of passive-voice clauses, 
			causative expressions, relative pronoun clauses, transferred 
			negation, verbal aspects or the use of modal auxiliary verbs.<br />
			The amount of time and effort that would be needed for a learner to 
			work out the rules for any of those structures is simply too great 
			to contemplate.&nbsp; The teacher's job is, therefore, to know the 
			rules and systems better than her students and be able to transmit 
			that information accessibly to her learners.&nbsp; To do that, she 
			has to know how the language works.<br />
			There are times when a focus on teaching the systems of the language 
			is vital.&nbsp; Swan, 2002, put it this way:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Knowing how to build and use certain 
			structures makes it possible to communicate common types of meaning 
			successfully.&nbsp; Without these structures, it is difficult to make 
			comprehensible sentences.&nbsp; We must, therefore, try to identify these 
			structures and teach them well.<br />
			...<br />
			In some social contexts, serious deviance from native-speaker norms 
			can hinder integration and excite prejudice – a person who speaks 
			‘badly’ may not be taken seriously, or may be considered uneducated 
			or stupid.&nbsp; Students may, therefore, want or need a higher level of 
			grammatical correctness than is required for mere comprehensibility.</p>
			<p>In sum, we need grammar to communicate our meanings accurately 
			(to which we could also add the ability to make the sounds of 
			English acceptably and spell it accurately) and we need decent 
			control of grammar (and pronunciation and orthography) to maintain 
			some social credibility.</p>

			<p>Over what?<br />
			Yes, it is, given the data, possible to figure out what the rule is 
			for the use of any language (regarding structural, phonological 
			accuracy or communicative appropriacy) but the key lies in the quiet
			<em>given the data</em> in this sentence.<br />
			A simple example is the plural and past-tense systems in English.&nbsp; 
			Overwhelmingly, we make a plural by adding <em>-s</em> if the word 
			ends in an <em>e</em> and adding <em>-es</em> if it ends any other 
			way.&nbsp; There are about a dozen exceptions.<br />
			We pronounce it as /s/ if it ends in /t/, /p/, /f/, /k/ or /θ/ and a 
			/z/ in all other cases.<br />
			The system is so simple that given enough examples of the correct 
			forms, most learners can figure out the rules for themselves 
			(providing they aren't allowed to become confused with <em>dwarves, 
			wives, wolves and leaves under the eaves</em>).<br />
			Figuring out the rules for nouns which end in <em>f</em> is much 
			less easy because most of them are quite rare and the data are not 
			readily available.&nbsp; It is much easier to be told that the 
			majority of words ending in <em>f</em> form the plural with <em>ves</em> 
			and it's pronounced as /vz/.&nbsp; In other words, even in this 
			simple case, it is arguably easier to supply the rule and let the 
			learners deduce the forms.<br />
			The past-tense forms of regular verbs follow equally simple rules 
			for their formation and pronunciation, as you are aware, and they 
			can also be figured out by most people without recourse to a grammar 
			book, simply by looking at a few dozen examples such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offend-offended<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; point-pointed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depart-departed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smoke-smoked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hope-hoped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provoke-provoked</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Sooner rather than later, the rule will be figured out and retained.<br />
			However, the grouping of the forms of irregular verbs in English by 
			their phonemic characteristics is a much more difficult rule to 
			figure out from the few examples that are likely to cross a 
			learner's path in a month or so.&nbsp; So, it is much easier to be 
			told that, for example, /iː/ often changes to /e/ and /ɪ/ to /ʌ/ 
			than to try to work that out from single instances of verbs such as
			<em>bleed, feed, cling, spin</em> and <em>swing</em>.&nbsp; There 
			are, in fact only 10 or so verbs in each class and encountering them 
			in a single lesson is very unlikely (helpful though it might be for 
			the learners' inductive reasoning processes).</p>
			<p>Even if it is possible to figure out all these rules by a process 
			of inductive reasoning (aided by a bit of judicious guided 
			discovery), there are clearly other rules that are just too complex 
			for that to be done successfully in a way that doesn't take a dozen 
			lessons.<br />
			For example, the rules for forming a passive-voice clause in English 
			are decidedly complex and, even with monotransitive verbs it 
			requires a six-step routine:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Identify the subject and the object</li>
				<li>Raise the object to the subject position</li>
				<li>Remove the erstwhile subject</li>
				<li>Select the correct tense form of the verb <em>be</em> and 
				insert it after the first noun phrase</li>
				<li>Discover the past participle form of the verb and insert it 
				after the verb <em>be</em></li>
				<li>Decide if the clause needs an agent (another multi-step 
				process requiring consideration of communicative and semantic 
				issues) and then insert it after a <em>by-phrase</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">Doing all that for a sentence such as:</p>
			<p class="auto-style14"><em>The committee which meets under the chairmanship 
			of the Vice-Chancellor has been deciding the issue of whether 
			to have a new wing added on the building </em></p>
			<p class="auto-style15">would be nearly impossible if all one had to 
			go on were a few forms such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window was broken by the stone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary was surprised by the ghost</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Even with multiple exposures to the correct formulation for a 
			passive clause, it is unlikely that any learner would be able to 
			arrive at the six-step process without considerable help.&nbsp; The 
			help, naturally, would be to supply some rules so that the learners 
			could deduce the correct forms rather than induce the rules.<br />
			Added to all this, there are many complications and constraints on 
			passive-clause use in English (some quite rare events) and it is 
			vanishingly unlikely that anyone would be able to figure out what 
			they are without exposure to enormous and unwieldy amount of data.&nbsp; 
			We have, therefore, to resort to the old-fashioned and deeply 
			unpopular deductive reasoning processes by supplying some rules and 
			guidelines for when the structural choice is appropriate and then 
			ensuring that the learners get some real communicative practice in 
			applying them.</p>
			<p class="auto-style15">Finally, of course, there is the issue of 
			the middle way.&nbsp; Proponents of inductive approaches often 
			forget to mention that even when learners have figured out a rule 
			from the data supplied by the teacher or the materials, a process 
			said to enhance the chances of the rules staying in the long-term 
			memory and eventually becoming automated, they then have to <strong>
			apply</strong> the rule deductively.&nbsp; There seems little point 
			in putting learners to the trouble of figuring out the rules for 
			themselves if they cannot then deduce what is accurate and 
			well-formed or appropriate to say in the circumstances and that 
			involves deductive reasoning, of course.</p>
