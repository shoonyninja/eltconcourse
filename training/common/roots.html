			<p>English is an Indo-European language.&nbsp; Although this is a 
			debatable issue, this family of languages may have originated in the 
			area of Asia just to the north and west of the Caspian Sea, between 
			it and the Black Sea, in what is now south Kazakhstan.&nbsp; 
			Other theories place the origins of the Indo-European family over 
			6000 years ago in the Eastern Mediterranean area once home to the 
			Hittite civilization.&nbsp; This is the so-called Anatolian 
			hypothesis.<br />
			Modern genetic studies are beginning to indicate that the language 
			family originated with the Yamnaya people who migrated out of the 
			Asian steppes some 4500 years ago, carrying their language with them 
			(along with the wheel and their domesticated horses).&nbsp; 
			Estimates by Reich (2018: 116) suggest that 90% of the erstwhile 
			population of Britain, for example, was replaced by people of 
			Yamnaya heritage around that time.</p>
			<p>There are around 400 languages in the group, spoken in total by over 
			3 billion people.&nbsp; The 
			source of all these languages is known as Proto-Indo-European or PIE.<br />
			Here's the map of the first presumed expansion of PIE from its homeland:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="pie_expansion" height="283" src="../imagesgraphics/PIEexpansion.png" width="465" /><br />
			<span class="smallfont">Source: Wikipedia</span></p>
			<p>
			Here's a bigger picture:<br />
			<img alt="ie" height="523" src="../imagesgraphics/ie_expansion.png" width="930" /></p>
			<p>Indo-European languages include many now spoken in the south and 
			east of that area, which include the Persian languages Sanskrit (now extinct but 
			influential), 
			Hindi, Punjabi and many others, 
			but we are concerned here with the development of English so we'll focus on the western 
			groups of languages.<br />
			Here's the family tree, much simplified and with fewer examples of 
			the languages than you will find in more academic texts.&nbsp; 
			Extinct languages are not included here.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="pie" height="469" src="../imagesgraphics/pie.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>We are talking here about very ancient relationships and languages grow, 
			develop and change.&nbsp; The origins of 
			PIE are obscure but linguistic and genetic studies are beginning to 
			converge on a date around 6000 years BCE (Before Common Era).&nbsp; 
			A lot can happen in 8000 years.</p>
			<p>As you see, there are 5 main branches of western PIE and English belongs 
			to one of them, the West Germanic group which includes Dutch, 
			Flemish and Afrikaans as well as Frisian (its closest relative).</p>
			<p>There are dissenters to this view, notably, but not solely, 
			Embley &amp; Faarlund (2014) who present substantial evidence that 
			English is more closely descended from North Germanic (i.e., early 
			Norse) then West Germanic.&nbsp; The view is based on a number of 
			syntactical as well as lexical data.<br />
			Others see the influence of North Germanic varieties as mostly 
			transpiring from close contacts for trade and other purposes, not 
			least warfare between the English and the Norse invaders / settlers 
			in England.&nbsp; There's a little more below on this.</p>
			<p>Some analyses will 
			differ in minor respects, for example, separating Greek and Albanian 
			or sub-dividing Slavic languages differently as well as including 
			Modern German as a West Germanic language, descending from the now 
			extinct Old High German.&nbsp; By that analysis, English and the 
			other West Germanic languages descend from Low German.&nbsp; Frisian 
			itself, a language spoken today by around 500,000 people, is the 
			closest relative to English and has two main branches: West Frisian, spoken in The Netherlands and East Frisian, 
			spoken in parts of Germany and Denmark.&nbsp; There is also Saterland 
			Frisian, a remnant of a previously widely-spoken dialect.&nbsp; The 
			modern dialects of Frisian are not mutually comprehensible.&nbsp; Old Frisian and Old 
			English were so closely related that their speakers were almost 
			certainly mutually comprehensible.&nbsp; That is no longer the case 
			for the modern forms of these languages.&nbsp; 
			None of this detail matters for what follows.&nbsp; Even today, 
			however, speakers of the English dialects prevalent in North-East 
			England find that they can (more or less) understand some Modern 
			Frisian speech.<br />
			Another, more 
			complex and inclusive, family-tree diagram is in the guide to types of languages, 
			linked below in the list of related guides.</p>
			<p>English grammar, syntax and the lexicon bear witness to its close 
			affinity with other Germanic languages as can easily be seen from 
			the very large numbers of closely similar structures and words in the 
			languages.<br />
			In other words, the grammar of English and its basic lexicon remain 
			identifiably Germanic.&nbsp; Here's an example of what is meant.&nbsp; 
			The right-hand column (French) is there for comparison so the 
			differences are clear.<br />
			The French words for basic concepts and some key functional words 
			bear no resemblance to the other sets, rarely, for example, even 
			sharing a single sound.</p>

			<p>When the Romans arrived in Britain in 43 CE, they encountered 
			people who spoke a range of Celtic languages, as people did across 
			huge swathes of Europe from the Black Sea to the Atlantic coast.&nbsp; 
			When the occupation ended in 410 CE, they left much the same people 
			speaking much the same range of Celtic languages.&nbsp; 
			Only a handful of Latin lexemes survived the Anglo-Saxon invasion 
			which followed and it is not always easy to discern whether the 
			Latin words had already been borrowed into the languages spoken by 
			the later invaders.<br />
			It is noticeable, however, that although Latin, at least, Vulgar 
			Latin, clearly forms the basis of modern-day French, Spanish and 
			other Romance languages, it did not take root at all in Britain 
			despite it being a <em>lingua franca</em> throughout the empire.&nbsp; 
			A very few military and ecclesiastical words (the empire was Christianized 
			during the occupation) did manage to infiltrate the languages 
			spoken after the end of the occupation (including some still present 
			in place names, particularly -<em>castle</em>).<br />
			Overall, however, English would have to wait until much later for 
			its enrichment by Latin borrowings.</p>
			<p>(There is some speculation concerning pre-Celtic culture in 
			Britain and elsewhere in Europe with, for example, Basque being 
			identified as clearly a non-Indo-European language and others which 
			are surmised from fragments and inscriptions.&nbsp; There may even 
			be some evidence from place-name research in Britain pointing to a 
			pre-Celtic language or set of languages but no such language can be 
			confidently identified and there are no traces in any form of 
			English of any non-Indo-European language indigenous to Europe.)</p>

			<p>The country that is now England was the northernmost province of 
			the Roman Empire until around 410 CE (Common Era).&nbsp; Shortly 
			afterwards, migrations from the continent, not always peacefully 
			intended or received, began:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Angles</strong></dt>
				<dd>from whose name the word for the language is derived, from

				<dt><strong>Jutes</strong></dt>
				<dd>from Northern Denmark who settled in South-East England,

			</dl>
			<p>Roughly, because the exact extent of the homelands and the role 
			of the Frisians is not wholly clear, the invasions looked like this:<br />
			<img alt="invasions" height="207" src="../imagesgraphics/anglo-saxon_invasion.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>These migrants brought with them a set of closely related and 
			highly inflected languages which formed the basis of Old English.&nbsp; 
			The first writing in a language identifiable as English dates from 
			the seventh century.</p>
			<p>By the ninth century, if not before, the original Britons, a 
			Celtic-speaking people, had been pushed northwards and westwards 
			and confined to what is now Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, the 
			extreme south west of England and the island of Ireland.<br />
			A very few Celtic words were borrowed by the invading Anglo-Saxon 
			speakers and even fewer have survived in Modern English.</p>
			<p>The languages spoken at that time, under the umbrella term of 
			English were related but not always mutually comprehensible.&nbsp; 
			Northumbrian, spoken in the North West of England and southern 
			Scotland and related to the language spoken in East Anglia, Mercian, widely spoken from the Welsh border eastwards to 
			the western fringe of East Anglia, West Saxon, the language of Wessex in the South and South West of England and Kentish, spoken 
			in the South East of England, are all 
			distinguishable.<br />
			It is only by the tenth century with the writings of a 
			scholar-priest, Ælfric, that an identifiable early standard English 
			emerges.&nbsp; Even so, the majority of people travelled little and 
			continued to speak local dialects of English.</p>

			<p>Old English can be dated to around the 5th to the 11th centuries 
			and is almost impossible to understand for modern English speakers 
			without a good deal of study.</p>
			<p>It was a synthetic, highly inflected 
			language, or, as we saw above, a collection of related languages, in many ways similar to 
			Modern German with case endings, 
			complex verb declensions, a three-gender structure, article changes and so on.&nbsp; The great adventure story of 
			Beowulf (picture) was written in Old English sometime between the 
			8th and 11th centuries.<br />
			The language was written in both runes and, later, the Latin alphabet but 
			some of the letters were different.&nbsp; In particular, Old English 
			used three characters Modern English does not have: thorn (Þ, þ) and eth (ð, Ð) which 
			are both now rendered&nbsp;<em>th</em> and a vowel, 
			æ, known as ash (pronounced approximately as the 'a' in <em>apple</em>).&nbsp; 
			The upper-case version is Æ.<br />
			The modern letter <em>g</em> was written as <em>ʒ</em> and the 
			modern <em>w</em> as the runic
			
			
			<em>ƿ</em> or wynn.<br />
			Other letters, such as 'j' are later, Middle English, introductions 
			from French and <em>q, x</em> and <em>z </em>are almost absent.<br />
			The earlier runic script is assumed to be the so-called futhorc 
			script named after the Old English pronunciation of the first six 
			runes in the alphabet.&nbsp; They were: ᚠ ᚢ ᚦ ᚩ ᚱ ᚳ.<br />
			The Latin alphabet mostly replaced the uses of runic script after 
			the conversion to Christianity starting around the end of the sixth 
			century.<br />
			</p>
			<p>The pronunciation of Old English 
			is, of course, somewhat speculative but it was certainly very 
			different from what we hear today.<br />
			Here's an example of the written form, taken from the Anglo-Saxon 
			Chronicle, a history probably compiled in the reign of Alfred the 
			Great (849-899, reigned 871-899).</p>

			<p>The history of English, conventionally divided into three periods &ndash; 
			Old, Middle and Early Modern &ndash; 
			is one of the gradual loss of 
			inflexion, 
			gender and case and a slow 
			transition to an uninflected and simplified structure.<br />
			In other words, the language has moved from being <strong>synthetic</strong> 
			(i.e., having lots of endings and other affixes to signal case, 
			number, person, gender, tense and so on like Modern German, Russian, Greek, 
			French and Italian) to being <strong>analytic</strong> (i.e., having 
			few such characteristics and preferring one morpheme to represent 
			one idea).&nbsp; Here is an example to make things clear(er):</p>
			<p>In Modern German, the past form of <em>go</em> has the root <em>ging</em> 
			(from the infinitive<em> gehen</em>).&nbsp; The way to say<em> you 
			went</em> is <em>du gingst</em>.&nbsp; The -<em>st</em> ending on the verb 
			shows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It is singular</li>
				<li>It is familiar rather than polite</li>
				<li>It is in the second person</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The -<em>st</em> ending on a verb form will be familiar to anyone 
			who has read the King James Bible or Shakespeare's plays because 
			both use the ending to denote the second person singular familiar 
			form of the verb.&nbsp; Thou hast, of course, read Shakespeare, hast 
			thou not?</p>
			<p>Similar things to German happen in other synthetic languages, like this, 
			e.g., for the past tense:</p>

			<p>In Modern English, by contrast to the other six language examples 
			and Old English, the past form of <em>go</em> is
			<em>went</em> and it is unchanged for all numbers and persons: <em>I 
			went, you went, she went, he went, it went, we went, they went</em>.&nbsp; 
			Here, the only change signalled by the form of the verb is tense.&nbsp; 
			Modern English is at the analytic end of the spectrum, therefore, 
			but many other Indo-European languages along with Old English are 
			clearly at the synthetic end.<br />
			If you are wondering why the past tense of <em>go</em> is so 
			irregular, the answer is that the present form of the verb is 
			derived from the Old English <em>gan</em>, which shares the root of 
			the German <em>gehen</em>, the Dutch <em>gaan</em>, the Swedish <em>
			gå</em> and so on.&nbsp;
			The past tense comes to us by a different root and is derived from 
			the Old English verb <em>wend</em> (as in <em>wend one's way</em>).&nbsp; 
			The past of <em>wend</em> was <em>went</em> and that became the 
			standard past-tense form of <em>go</em> with a new weak, or regular, 
			past tense for <em>wend</em> of <em>wended</em>.</p>
			<p>Modern English is not fully analytic because it still retains some 
			inflexions such as the third-person <em>-s</em> ending for present-simple verb 
			forms (<em>she smoke</em><span class="style_underline"><strong><em>s</em></strong></span>) and the plural
			<em>-s</em> as well as some changes in pronouns (<em>I, me, my, 
			mine, he, him, his</em> etc.).&nbsp; We also denote past tenses with 
			either the <em>-ed / -d</em> ending or by making changes to the 
			vowels in verbs.&nbsp; It is, however, much more analytic than most other Indo-European 
			languages.<br />
			Some languages, such as Mandarin, are even more analytic and usually 
			referred to as isolating languages.</p>
			<p>Similar considerations apply to determiners, nouns and adjectives because in 
			Old English there were a number of endings on articles, nouns and their 
			associated adjectives to signal number, gender and case (often object or 
			subject case but there are other possibilities).<br />
			In Old English, for example, the mistress of a household was 
			expressed as <em>hlǣfdīġe</em> but if the word is used as the object 
			of the verb rather than the subject, it changes its ending to <em>
			hlǣfdīġan</em> to reflect the changed grammatical status.&nbsp; Like 
			Modern German, Old English had four cases for nouns: nominative (the 
			subject), accusative (the object), genitive (the possessive) and 
			dative (denoting movement to and from, usually, as well as 
			identifying the indirect rather than direct object).<br />
			Old English also had three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter 
			and adjective endings as well as the form of articles reflected the 
			gender of the noun.</p>
			<p>In the end, what this change from an inflected to a more or less 
			analytic language has done is to fix the word order in English as 
			Subject–Verb–Object without which, we cannot understand the 
			difference between:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog chased the cat</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;The cat chased the dog</em><br />
			The difference would have been clear to an Old English speaker, whatever the 
			ordering of the words, because in the first case, the word for <em>
			dog</em> would have been <em>docga</em> and in the second case, as 
			the object, it would have been <em>docgan</em>.</p>

			<p>The most obvious effect of the loss of case and inflexion over 
			the centuries is the pronoun system of Modern English compared to 
			that of Old English.&nbsp; If you are unsure about what cases are, 
			here's a brief description for the purposes of understanding Old 
			English (and Modern German, incidentally, along with a good number 
			of other inflecting languages).</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Nominative case</dt>
				<dd>= the subject of the verb (<em><span class="style_black"><strong>She</strong></span> 
			went</em>)</dd>
				<dt>Accusative case</dt>
				<dd>= the direct object of the verb (<em>She broke</em> <em><span class="style_black"><strong>it</strong></span></em>)</dd>
				<dt>Dative case</dt>
				<dd>= the indirect object or the complement of a preposition 
			(<em>She gave</em> <em><span class="style_black">
			<strong>them</strong></span> a book, It is on
			<span class="style_black"><strong>the table</strong></span></em>)</dd>
				<dt>Genitive case</dt>
				<dd>= the possessive (<em>It's <span class="style_black">
			<strong>her</strong></span> book</em>)</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>You will see from this table (which is not complete) that Old 
			English had a separate way of signalling two people as distinct from 
			singular and plural.&nbsp; This dual person disappeared over the 
			centuries and is only just discernible in Modern English in remnants 
			such as the pronouns <em>both, neither</em> and <em>either.</em><br />

			<p>We have noted above that there are scholars who consider that 
			English is better classified as a North Germanic language rather 
			than the usual categorisation which assumes that it is West Germanic 
			(and closely akin to Frisian).&nbsp; Evidence for this is suggested 
			both by syntactical and lexical data (Embley &amp; Faarlund, 2014).</p>
			<p>Others suggest, as we do here, that influences are less 
			derivational and more social and trading based.<br />
			We noted above that by the ninth century, the original Britons had been pushed northwards and westwards 
			to Scotland, Wales and the island of Ireland by Anglo-Saxon invaders.However, the Anglo-Saxons did not have it all their own way, of course.&nbsp; 
			The first recorded Scandinavian raids, remembered today as Viking 
			raids, occurred in 793.&nbsp; From the end of the eighth century and continuing for 200 years, 
			raiders, then settlers from Scandinavia occupied virtually the whole 
			of the east and north of England with the Saxon kingdoms confined to 
			the south and west.&nbsp; Northumberland in the north, which 
			stretched into what is today Scotland, remained English.&nbsp; The 
			invaders spoke another range of northern rather then western 
			Germanic languages, of various levels of mutual comprehensibility, 
			known collectively as Old Norse.&nbsp; The two major dialects were 
			East and West Old Norse and invaders and settlers from the coasts of 
			modern-day Norway, speaking West Old Norse influenced the littoral 
			areas to the north of Scotland, north-west England and parts of 
			Wales and Ireland.&nbsp; Speakers of East Old Norse, from what is 
			today Sweden had more widespread influence in eastern England and, 
			incidentally in Normandy (of which more later).&nbsp; The eastern 
			dialects of Old Norse retained some mutual comprehensibility with 
			continental west Germanic languages.<br />
			The area under Norse control, known as The Danelaw comprised 
			virtually the whole of England from the Scottish border to London to 
			the east of a line drawn diagonally from Liverpool to London.<br />
			Very roughly the picture looked like this with the blue areas to the 
			west and north remaining Celtic speaking:<br />
			<img alt="danelaw" height="300" src="../imagesgraphics/danelaw2.png" width="250" /><br />
			Norse languages influenced the development of English within 
			and beyond the confines of The Danelaw with 
			hundreds of common words dating from the ninth to the eleventh 
			centuries being introduced into English.&nbsp; They include at

			<p>Additionally, all the names of the days of the week in English 
			have cognates in Old Norse.<br />
			It is, in fact, not always clear whether a word is altered in Old 
			English under the influence of Old Norse or derived directly from 
			it.&nbsp; Both languages stem from the same Proto-Germanic source so 
			many words were already quite similar in the two languages.<br />
			It is also the case that the same people and their languages 
			influenced Norman French, of which more later, but to a lesser 
			degree.&nbsp; The Viking invaders were first granted land in 
			Normandy in 911 and the colony expanded over the following decades 
			to encompass much of Brittany.&nbsp; Here, however, the Norse 
			language did not persist and, apart from place names, little 
			remained by the time of the Norman invasion of English in 1066 
			(Parker, 2013:330).</p>
			<p>Place names derived from Norse languages are common in the north 
			of England where names ending in <em>-by, -thorpe </em>and <em>-thwaite</em> 
			occur very regularly.&nbsp; The suffix <em>thorpe</em> translates as
			<em>village</em>, <em>by</em> as <em>town, farm</em> or <em>
			settlement</em> and <em>thwaite </em>as <em>clearing</em> or <em>
			cleared land</em>.&nbsp; Other parts of place names such as <em>holm</em> 
			(<em>small island</em>), <em>wick </em>(<em>bay</em>) and <em>dale
			</em>(<em>valley</em>) are also common in the north and east of 
			England to this day.</p>
			<p>(It is sometimes imagined that Norse languages did not persist 
			for long in Britain after the end of the Viking period (variously 
			dated but conventionally to the Battle of Hastings in 1066).&nbsp; 
			However, Old Norse (or a dialect thereof referred to as Norn) 
			survived as a living language in Ireland until the 13th century, on 
			the Isle of Man until possibly as late as 1500, in Scotland, Orkney 
			and Shetland until perhaps the middle of the 19th century.)</p>
			<p>It has also been suggested that the fact that English developed 
			from a heavily inflected synthetic language to a much more 
			analytical one is attributable, in part at least, to the influence 
			of Old Norse.&nbsp; In particular, apart from the kinds of borrowing 
			listed above, structural words, such as pronouns, prepositions, 
			conjunctions and modal auxiliary verbs show a good deal of 
			Scandinavian influence.&nbsp; This has led some to assert that the 
			structure of Old English became simplified because of the need to 
			find a language mutually comprehensible to both the English and the 
			Norse invaders, later settlers and traders.&nbsp; On the other hand, because both Old Norse and 
			Old English shared a common Germanic ancestry, many of these 
			structural words were already very similar, often identical.<br />
			Old Norse did not, for example, distinguish gender in the form of 
			all pronouns and determiners, although it did distinguish singular, 
			dual and plural (as did Old English).<br />
			Additionally, and slightly more persuasively, Old Norse and Old 
			English shared many items in their lexicons which differed only in 
			the complex inflexions found in Old English.&nbsp; The pressure, 
			within The Danelaw at least, to simplify for the sake of easy 
			communication must have been quite strong.</p>

			<p>Even today, Celtic influences on English have been underestimated 
			or dismissed as sporadic and peripheral and there is no doubt that 
			compared, say, to the influences of Norman French, considered next, 
			the contribution of Celtic languages to Modern English is small, 
			although it is not at all negligible.</p>
			<p>Celtic languages were once dominant across most of Europe, spoken 
			from central modern Turkey, across modern-day Bulgaria, Romania, 
			Hungary, Poland, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, France, 
			Switzerland, northern Italy, Spain and Portugal as well as the 
			modern nations of the British Isles..&nbsp; Nowadays, the evidence 
			of Celtic influences is most apparent in place names.&nbsp; Most of 
			France's main cities have names which derive from Celtic languages 
			(Gaulish in most cases) and the same is true for a large number of 
			place names in Germany, The Netherlands, Spain and 
			so on across many major and minor European states.<br />
			Many place names in The British Isles can be traced to Celtic words 
			for <em>hills, rivers, woods</em> and so on, among them <em>Avon, 
			Axminster, Brentford, Devon, Dover, Leatherhead </em>and literally 
			hundreds more.</p>
			<p>When we get away from toponymy, the evidence is somewhat less 
			obvious, a phenomenon which may, at least in part, be due to the 
			disparagement with which many early scholars treated the notion of 
			Celtic influences on Modern English.&nbsp; In fact, there were two 
			phases of influence:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>When invaders from Europe arrived in the 5th century and for 
				some time later, many Celts were forced to emigrate to the 
				western and northern fringes of Britain where the influence of 
				Celtic languages is still strong: Welsh, Scots Gaelic and, to 
				some extent, Cornish and Manx, for example.&nbsp; The large 
				numbers of place names which survive from those times are still 
				evident but some English words dating from this period have clear Celtic 
				origins (from Irish, Welsh or Scots, mostly).&nbsp; Among them 
				are probably:<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style163">

				Norman French which was itself influenced by the Celtic language 
				spoken in France, Gaulish.</li>
				<li>During the 16th to 19th centuries many Celtic speakers 
				moved into cities in England, especially but not exclusively, to 
				London.&nbsp; Some of the words cited above may have first 
				appeared at this time (written records are unreliable guides) 
				but it has been argued that some peculiarities of English 
				grammar certainly date from this time and that it is no 
				coincidence that these peculiarities also appear in Celtic 
				languages.<br />
				Most other European languages make do with a single verb form to 
				denote the simple and progressive aspects in English.&nbsp; For 
				example, <em>I go</em> and <em>I am going</em> both translate 
				into French as <em>je vais</em>, into German as <em>ich gehe</em>, 
				in Spanish as <em>voy</em>, in Estonian, <em>ma lähen</em>, in 
				Danish,<em> jeg går</em>, in Romanian <em>mă duc</em>, in 
				Italian <em>vado</em>, in Czech, <em>jdu</em> and so on across 
				almost all European languages.&nbsp; Some Slavic languages do 
				distinguish between the two aspects but they are unlikely to be 
				the source of much influence on the development of English.&nbsp; 
				Even Basque, a non-Indo-European language, makes no distinction 
				(the two clauses both translate as <em>banoa</em>).<br />
				However, Celtic languages all make a distinction between three 
				aspects of the verb which may be translated as <em>I go, I am 
				going </em>and <em>I habitually go</em>.&nbsp; In Irish, for 
				example, <em>I go</em> translates as <em>téim</em> but <em>I am 
				going</em> as <em>tá mé ag dul</em>.&nbsp; In Scots Gaelic we 
				find:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I go &rarr; téighim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going →t&aacute; ag dul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I (regularly) go → bím ag dul</em><br />
				<span class="smallfont">(Todd &amp; Hancock 1986:105)</span><br />
				According to many authorities, the progressive aspect was not 
				commonly found in English until the early 17th century, and it 
				follows, for some, that the innovation is influenced by Celtic 
				languages.&nbsp; Celtic languages may, in fact, not be the sole 
				source of this innovation but they are almost certainly a 
				reinforcing factor at the very least.</li>

			<p>A date every British school child is familiar with, if they are 
			familiar with any at all, is 1066, the year of the Norman Conquest 
			of England.<br />
			Unusually for that period of history, the Battle of Hastings (Senlac 
			Hill, to be precise) was 
			decisive: the English King, Harold Godwinson, was killed and the Saxon 
			aristocracy almost wiped out.<br />
			Although the invaders spoke Norman French it should be recalled that 
			many were, in fact, of Scandinavian origin.&nbsp; Normandy itself 
			was settled, none too peaceably, by Norse-speaking Vikings from 911.&nbsp; 
			The people of the region are described as of mixed 
			Scandinavian-Frankish origins.&nbsp; Although apart from place names 
			in Normandy there are few obvious influences on Norman French from 
			Old Norse, whose speakers were never there in a majority.&nbsp; 
			However, the word <em>Norman</em> itself (from the Old French plural
			<em>Normanz</em>) derives from the Norse <em>nordmanni</em> 
			(North-Men or Scandinavians)<em> </em>(Parker, 2014:276).</p>
			<p>What followed was 300 years in which no ruler of England spoke 
			English as a first language (or at all).&nbsp; Although the Norman 
			conquerors never represented more than around 3% of the population, 
			they spoke French and that language, along with Latin, became the 
			language of administration, religion, the court and the land-holding 
			classes.&nbsp; It was the language of power.&nbsp; Naturally enough, 
			anybody with ambitions to rise in the social hierarchy also needed 
			to master French and so began a slow trickle-down of French into the 
			native aristocracy.&nbsp; Many of these people, the civil servants 
			of the day, were bilingual in English and French.<br />
			Especially in areas (i.e., registers) in which the aristocracy were 
			mostly concerned, French was hugely influential in terms of the 
			vocabulary of English.&nbsp; Predominately, the words introduced 
			from French, around 10,000 of them, occur in the following areas 
			(although almost no area was untouched):</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>Warfare:&nbsp; <em>peace, battle, arms, attack</em> 
				etc.</li>
				<li>The church: <em>service, miracle, saint, sacrifice, clergy
				</em>etc.</li>
				<li>Hunting: <em>forest, quarry, falcon, retrieve</em> etc.</li>
				<li>Architecture and houses: <em>carpet, wardrobe, chair, table, 
				joist, arch</em> etc.</li>
				<li>Food: <em>mutton, pork, gammon, onion, peach</em> 
				etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In many cases, the original English words were also retained so, 
			although we now commonly use the French-derived word <em>archer</em>, 
			the English <em>bowman</em> is still extant.&nbsp; By the same 
			token, the names for the animals, which the peasantry raised, were 
			retained and so we have the distinction in English between, for 
			example, <em>beef</em>, from the French word [<em>boeuf</em>] for 
			the meat, and <em>cow</em>, the 
			English word for the animal from which it comes which is a cognate 
			of the German <em>Kuh</em> and the Frisian <em>ko</em>.&nbsp; To refer to 
			food, the French word was used; for the animal whence it comes, the 
			English word was retained.<br />
			For the majority of the population, who continued to speak English, 
			exchanging an English lord for a French one probably had little 
			impact.</p>
			<p>Not all the language was affected and the great mass of the 
			population continued to speak English so the essentials of the 
			language remained unchanged or developed very slowly.&nbsp; Words for 
			kinship terms, <em>father, mother, son, daughter</em> etc., agricultural items,
			<em>land, barn, field, hay</em> etc., numerals and so on are still 
			identifiably Anglo-Saxon in origin and most have cognate words in other 
			Germanic languages which are instantly recognisable.&nbsp; Basic 
			verb forms and very common nouns, too, remained virtually 
			unaffected.&nbsp; For example, again with modern French as a contrast:</p>

			<p>Additionally, closed-class functional words (prepositions, 
			pronouns, conjunctions and determiners) also resisted influences 
			from French and remain Anglo-Saxon in origin and have recognisable 
			cognates in most Germanic languages to this day as the final five 
			rows above show.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, aside from many common and quite basic concepts, the 
			vocabulary of Modern English contains only 15% of words cognate with 
			or derived from Old English (Crystal, 1995:27).&nbsp; This is a 
			slightly deceptive figure because the 15% contains many of the most 
			frequently used words.&nbsp; Nearly all the 100 most common words in 
			spoken English are derived from Anglo-Saxon with recognisable 
			cognates in other Germanic languages.</p>
			<p>However, although Norman French was hugely influential in terms 
			of enriching the lexicon of English, the grammar and structure of 
			the language was almost wholly unaffected.&nbsp; What happened was 
			that the basic structure of Old English was retained with a very large 
			leavening of Norman French lexemes.&nbsp; The technical term to describe 
			this blending of languages is <em>macaronic</em>.</p>
			<p>Later, long after the conquest, new influences from French, this 
			time the French spoken in the Paris area rather than Normandy, begin 
			to appear, especially during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.&nbsp; 
			We'll come to that.</p>

			<p>Middle English describes the language spoken from the 11th to the

			also the time when the influence of Norman French is 
			strikingly clear.&nbsp;

			<p>As we saw above, Modern English inflects for tense (regularly 
			with a <em>-d</em> or -<em>ed</em> suffix) and shows the third person 
			singular in the present (only) with -<em>s</em> or -<em>es</em>.<br />
			Although the language was beginning to lose some of the synthetic 
			elements of earlier forms, it is still the case that verb endings 
			varied to show number more clearly than they do in Modern English.&nbsp; 
			So, for example, the plural form of the verb <em>make</em> was <em>
			maken</em> and the singular form of the verb <em>do</em>, now <em>does</em>, was <em>doth</em>.&nbsp; 
			Nouns, however, had almost completely lost the endings for case that 
			Old English inherited from the Anglo-Saxon languages.</p>
			<p>At the same time as English began to take on some characteristics 
			which may be described as modern, its use became much more 
			widespread as the use of French, especially during and after the 
			Hundred Years' War (1337-1453), declined.&nbsp; Even among the 
			nobility, the decline in the use of French is apparent: Richard I 
			(1189-1199) spoke no English but his successor, John (1199-1216), 
			almost certainly did and his loss of the Norman possessions of the 
			English aristocracy hastened the Anglicizing process.&nbsp; By the middle of the 
			14th century, English was established as the language of the 
			governing elite.</p>
			<p>English continued to accept loan words and the process begins to 
			accelerate around the end of the Middle English period.</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>French, this time the French of the Paris region rather 
				than Normandy, enriched the lexicon of Chaucer's English.&nbsp; Words used in 
				or as, for example:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>administration:<em> authority, 
				constable, coroner, statute</em> etc.</li>
					<li>the law: <em>accuse, 
				assault, convict, estate</em> etc.</li>
					<li>religion: <em>baptism, 
				prayer, salvation, theology</em> etc.</li>
					<li>the military: <em>enemy, lieutenant, sergeant </em>etc.</li>
					<li>food: <em>bacon, cream, 
				sausage, salad</em> etc.</li>
					<li>the arts: <em>dance, minstrel, poet, 
				sculpture</em> etc.</li>
					<li>science: <em>anatomy, physician, treatise, 
				sulphur</em> etc.</li>
					<li>adjectives: <em>active, blue, 
				brown </em>[which lost its Old English sense of <em>brightness</em>, 
					hence <em>burnish</em>, and was applied to colour for the 
					first time]<em>, calm</em> etc.</li>
					<li>verbs: <em>advise, continue, enjoy, 
				prefer</em> etc.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>From Latin, too, loan words continued to enter English 
				although it sometimes difficult to know whether directly or <em>via</em> 
				French.&nbsp; Many of these words were in the learned fields of 
				literature, science, medicine and the law.</li>
				<li>There was also a deliberate attempt to introduce Latin words 
				by those wishing to appear well educated.&nbsp; Such terms, 
				called aureate or less sympathetically inkhorn terms usually 
				died out immediately but some survive in Modern English.&nbsp; 
				The word <em>impede</em>, for example, was deliberately 
				introduced and has survived but its opposite, <em>expede</em>, 
				did not although derivatives such as <em>expedite</em> have had 
				a longer life.<br />
				This deliberate importation of high-sounding words accelerated 
				into Shakespeare's time (see below) and was resisted and 
				contentious even then.</li>
				<li>The rise of mercantilism and international trade during the 
				middle ages also resulted in some loan words entering the 
				language from Dutch (<em>cruise, mast, deck, yacht </em>etc.), 
				Portuguese and Spanish (<em>alligator, banana, potato, tobacco</em> 
				etc.) in particular.&nbsp; In many of these cases, the original 
				word was borrowed by another European language and then entered 
				English from those languages.&nbsp; An example is <em>banana</em> 
				which was probably borrowed by Spanish and/or Portuguese from 
				the West African language Wolof and then entered English through 
				contact with the former languages rather than directly from 
				Wolof.<br />
				Other languages with which travellers, merchants and explorer 
				came into contact also contributed but far less than in later 
				years (see below).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It should also be remembered that this period was one of very 
			limited literacy; most of what was written at the time was intended 
			to be read aloud to those who could not read.&nbsp; Latin was still 
			the language in which laws and charters were written but they were 
			often translated to be read aloud to those whom they would most 
			closely concern.</p>
			<p>An important event which occurred during this period, in 1476, 
			was the introduction of the printing press to England by William 
			Caxton who opened his first workshop in Westminster.&nbsp; Others 
			followed and it is from this period that we can trace the slow and 
			patchy development of a standardised English spelling (and many of its 
			notorious irregularities).</p>

			<p>Early Modern English is the language of Shakespeare (1564-1616) and covers

			It was during this period that many of the modern uses of modal 
			auxiliary verbs and such constructions as the passive became fixed.&nbsp; It 
			was also during this time that the language became greatly 
			simplified and the distinctions between plural and singular pronouns 
			(<em>thou</em> vs. <em>you</em>) began to be lost, although that 
			distinction is maintained to this day in some dialects.<br />
			During this period, too, the first version of what has come to be

			<p>Many writers in English, not least Shakespeare, deliberately introduced foreign words because they felt the need or 
			in an effort to appear erudite and learned.&nbsp; Some have stuck 
			but many have not.<br />
			This phenomenon is closely associated with the Renaissance period in 
			Europe during which science, commerce and the arts expanded 
			dramatically.&nbsp; Estimates of the number of new words entering 
			English during the Renaissance vary but a figure of at least 10,000 
			new words is generally agreed with some claiming three times as many.&nbsp; Shakespeare and his 
			contemporaries were daring and innovative in this regard, 
			introducing words such as <em>agile, allurement, antipathy, 
			catastrophe, critical, demonstrate, dire, discountenance, emphasis, 
			emulate, expostulation, extract, hereditary, horrid, impertinent, 
			meditate, modest</em> and thousands more.<br />
			Many of the words introduced from Latin had very short life spans in 
			English (being criticised, as we saw above, as inkhorn terms which 
			are pretentious and unnecessary additions) and vanished almost as soon as they appeared.&nbsp; Examples 
			of words which have disappeared include <em>deblaterate</em> (<em>babble</em>),
			<em>latrate</em> (<em>bark</em>), <em>devulgate</em> (<em>set forth</em>),
			<em>adminiculation</em> (<em>aid</em>) and <em>consumulate</em> (<em>bury</em>).<br />
			An interesting importation at this time is the word <em>egregious</em>, 
			an adjective imported in the 1530s.&nbsp; It comes from a Latin 
			phrase <em>ex grege</em> which means separated from or rising above 
			the flock and originally meant <em>distinguished</em> or <em>
			excellent</em>.<br />
			However, by the late 16th century the word came to mean its opposite 
			in the modern sense of <em>notably bad</em>, even <em>evil</em>.<br />
			This was, it has been speculated, because the word was used 
			ironically so frequently that people came to believe it meant the 
			opposite of what was intended.&nbsp; It is a neat example of how 
			language changes over time (and not much time in this case) and of 
			how etymology is not a good guide to meaning.<br />
			A modern example is the word <em>salubrious </em>(meaning <em>
			healthy </em>or<em> favourable</em>) which is commonly heard in an 
			ironic sense to imply the opposite (<em>run down and unhealthy</em>).&nbsp; 
			It may be the case that the word will come to mean its opposite in 
			time.</p>
			<p>Many words which were reasonably common in Shakespeare's time 
			have vanished from the language or been repurposed with a different 
			meaning in Modern English.&nbsp; This is a process which has not 
			stopped of course and many words common only a few decades ago are 
			rarely heard.<br />
			Here are some examples of repurposed words (conversions between word 
			classes are quite common):</p>

			<p>Grammar, too, changed quite dramatically during the transition 
			from Early Modern to Modern English.&nbsp; Some examples here are 
			enough:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>nouns</strong></dt>
				<dd>Old English inflexions for case had already been lost by 
				this period but inflexion for number is another matter.&nbsp; 
				During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there is a slow 
				transition from Old English plural forms, often involving 
				changes to central vowels or the addition of the -<em>en</em> 
				suffix to the noun, in favour of the now almost ubiquitous -<em>s</em> 
				or -<em>es</em> endings.&nbsp; There are still some surviving 
				examples as in, e.g., <em>mice, feet,</em> 
				<em>brethren, children, oxen </em> 
				and so on but we have now lost plurals such as <em>eyen</em> (<em>eyes</em>) 
				and <em>shooen</em> (<em>shoes</em>) which were both used by 
				Shakespeare and other writers.</dd>
				<dt><strong>adjectives</strong></dt>
				<dd>This period sees the regularisation of the comparative and 
				superlative forms of adjectives so we no longer use, for 
				example, <em>the most unkindest</em>, <em>valiantest</em> and so 
				on and now reserve the periphrastic forms for longer adjectives 
				and the inflexions for shorter ones.&nbsp; It was only much later 
				that scholars decreed the combination of the -<em>est</em> 
				ending and the word <em>most</em> to be substandard.</dd>
				<dt><strong>pronouns</strong></dt>
				<dd>The period sees the demise of the distinction in Old English 
				between <em>ye</em> and <em>thou</em> (the former plural, the 
				latter singular) and the introduction and persistence of 
				the pronoun <em>you</em> for all forms of address, losing the 
				distinction still apparent in many European languages between a 
				polite and familiar form (<em>du</em> vs. <em>Sie</em>, <em>tu</em> 
				vs. <em>vous</em> etc.).<br />
				This period also sees the formulation of the gender-neutral <em>its</em> 
				possessive determiner whereas previous usage reserved <em>he</em> and 
				<em>she</em> 
				for nouns as in, for example, <em>the sun starts to spread his 
				warmth</em> or <em>the moon shines her beams</em>.&nbsp; The use 
				of <em>it's</em> instead of <em>its</em>, now considered a mark 
				of illiteracy, was common until the beginning of the nineteenth 
				century, incidentally.<br />
				The use of <em>they, them </em>and <em>their</em> to denote 
				singular people unmarked for sex has seen something of a 
				renaissance itself recently but it has a long history and the 
				forms were in regular use in Early Modern English.</dd>
				<dt><strong>relative pronouns</strong></dt>
				<dd>Between Chaucer and Shakespeare, i.e., roughly the 
				transition from Middle to Early Modern English, the use of 
				relative pronouns became more or less standardised.<br />
				In Chaucer's time, a compound relativiser, <em>who that, the 
				who, the which </em>etc. was quite common.&nbsp; The simple pronouns <em>that</em> 
				and <em>which</em> 
				became the ones of choice by Shakespeare's time, as we 
				saw above in:<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a tide in the affairs 
				of men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which, taken on the flood, leads on to fortune</em></span><br />
				the interrogative pronouns, <em>who, whom, whose, which</em>, 
				had taken on the role of relative pronouns but <em>that</em> was 
				still common.<br />
				We find both in use in Shakespeare:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<span class="style_black"><em>Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					That struts and frets his hour upon the stage.<br />
				</em><span class="auto-style147">(from Macbeth)</span></span><br />
				Shakespeare also uses the masculine possessive determiner for 
				the word <em>life</em> which was neuter in Old English, 
				incidentally.</dd>
				<dt><strong>verbs</strong></dt>
				<dd>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Before this period and during it, the periphrastic use of the operator
				<em>do</em> to form simple-tense questions was rare so we have a 
				slow change from forms such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take you the time?<br />
				</em>to 
				the more modern<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you take the time?<br />
				</em>Similarly, 
				the previous use of the negative as in, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know not<br />
				</em>changed to the modern use of<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know</em>.<br />
				The older forms persist in Modern English with modal and other 
				auxiliary verbs:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Must you?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not<br />
				</em>etc.</li>
				<li>The third-person singular ending in Modern English is -<em>s</em> 
				or -<em>es</em> but this form was only common in northern 
				English dialects with the familiar -<em>eth</em> ending 
				being dominant in the south.&nbsp; With the transition from 
				Early Modern to Modern English the -<em>s</em> endings came to 
				predominate.&nbsp; Shakespeare, writing in the middle of this 
				period, used both endings interchangeably.</li>
				<li>Old English distinguished, as does Modern German, between strong 
				and weak verbs and the irregular verbs on classroom charts list 
				the surviving older forms.&nbsp; During this period, however, 
				many verbs which were strong became weakened so the past tense 
				of <em>help</em> changed from <em>holp</em> to what we now 
				consider the regular form <em>helped</em>, for example.&nbsp; 
				The reverse is also the case with some verbs using weak forms 
				during this period of transition (<em>blowed, growed, shined</em> 
				etc.) interchangeably with the strong forms (<em>blew, grew, 
				shone </em>etc.) on which modern usage eventually settled, 
				although <em>shined</em> is still used when the verb refers to 
				polishing.</li>
				<li>A fourth notable change is the introduction of the modern 
				progressive forms of verbs.&nbsp; Before this period, the simple 
				form was frequently used for ongoing or progressive actions and 
				events so, in Shakespeare one finds:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you read?<br />
				</em>rather than<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are you reading?<br />
				</em>By the end of 
				this period the progressive forms were well established 
				including the use of progressive non-finite participles in, 
				e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having done the work, he left</em>.<br />
				There is some evidence based on comparative language studies 
				that this innovation came about through the influence of Celtic 
				language structures (see above).</li>
				<li>It was in the transition to Early Modern English, too, that 
				the use of the present perfect tense became somewhat 
				regularised, although this was a gradual process, not completed 
				until much later.</li>
			</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>prepositions</strong></dt>
				<dd>The use of prepositions changed quite dramatically during 
				this period with, for example, <em>wonder of</em> changing to
				<em>wonder at</em>, <em>done of you</em> changing to <em>done by 
				you</em> and <em>provide of</em> changing to <em>provide with</em>.&nbsp; 
				There are hundreds of other examples and many older uses such as
				<em>bored of </em>survive in dialect or casual speech.&nbsp; 
				Change was slow in this area and well into the 19th century 
				forms such <em>good in you</em> instead of <em>good of you</em> 
				were common.</dd>

			<p>We cannot leave Middle and Early Modern English without 
			considering The Great Vowel Shift.<br />
			First investigated by Otto Jesperson (1860-1943) who coined the term 
			and identified very considerable changes to the pronunciation of 
			vowels in particular but also some consonants (which are variably 
			included in the general term), The Great Vowel Shift began 
			approximately in 1400 and was complete by 1700 with most changes 
			occurring in the first two centuries of that period.<br />
			The reasons for the changes are still contested and theories include 
			population movements, the influence of French pronunciation or 
			conversely, the rejection of French pronunciations and more.<br />
			Whatever the cause, the shift resulted, probably by around the mid-1600s in what we now hear as the modern pronunciation of the long 
			vowels.<br />
			Incompletely, the changes can be shown like this, with the vowels in 
			the first column showing how they were in Chaucer's time and the 
			next column showing how they were by the late 17th century.</p>

			<p>It should be remembered that this is a schematic view and 
			changes did not affect all dialects equally or proceed smoothly from 
			south to north as some analyses seem to suggest.&nbsp; For example, 
			the first sound in that list moved from /iː/ to /ei/ to /ɛi/ 
			before reaching its modern quality of /aɪ/ much later.&nbsp; Other 
			sounds showed similar changes through intermediate forms.<br />
			To this day 
			there are distinct differences in the pronunciation of vowels in 
			particular which are identifiers of English speakers' origins in 
			Britain.</p>
			<p>It is not a coincidence that many of the irregularities of 
			English spelling stem from the fact that it was during the most 
			active period of vowel shifting that printing first became 
			established in Britain (Caxton in 1476 is usually given as the first 
			example).<br />
			It is perhaps unfortunate that the events coincided and, had either 
			the sound shift occurred earlier or printing been introduced later, 
			English spelling might have been much more consistent with English 
			phonology.</p>

			<p>It has been said that Modern English arrives with the invention 
			of the novel as literature.&nbsp; An early exponent of the novel was 
			Daniel Defoe (?1660-1731), whose father, incidentally but 
			revealingly, had Frenchified his name from the original Foe to the 
			more sophisticated Defoe.&nbsp; His most famous work, Robinson 
			Crusoe, was published in 1719 and is as readable today as it was 
			then.<br />
			An attempt to appeal to national prejudices by asserting the purity 
			of English, as common then as now, was cuttingly satirised by Defoe 
			in his only famous poem, <em>The True-born Englishman</em>, 
			published in 1701.&nbsp; The following year, Defoe was imprisoned 
			for six months for writing a satirical prose pamphlet about 
			dissenters.<br />
			Here is an extract from the very much longer original and is a decent summary of the roots of the 
			language Defoe spoke:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The Romans first with Julius Caesar came,<br />
			Including all the Nations of that Name,<br />
			Gauls, Greeks, and Lombards; and by computation,<br />
			Auxiliaries or Slaves of ev'ry Nation.<br />
			With Hengist, Saxons; Danes with Sueno came,<br />
			In search of plunder, not in search of Fame.<br />
			Scots, Picts, and Irish from th' Hibernian Shore:<br />
			And conqu'ring William brought the Normans o'er.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these their Barb'rous Offspring left behind,<br />
			The Dregs of Armies, they of all mankind:<br />
			Blended with Britons who before were here,<br />
			Of whom the Welsh ha' blest the Character.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this Amphibious Ill-born Mob began<br />
			The vain ill-natur'd thing, an Englishman.<br />
			The Customs, Surnames, Languages, and Manners<br />
			Of all those Nations are their own Explainers:<br />
			Whose Relics are so lasting and so strong,<br />
			They ha' left a Shibboleth upon our Tongue;<br />
			By which with easy search you may distinguish<br />
			Your Roman-Saxon-Danish-Norman English.</p>
			<p>As one can see from the poem, spelling, abbreviations and 
			capitalisation are somewhat erratic even at this time.<br />
			From the 18th century onwards, the language becomes recognisably 
			modern and it was during this period that the first attempts at 
			standardisation were made with a good deal of argument about what 
			should be 'correct' and what should be considered 'wrong'.&nbsp; 
			Baugh and Cable (2002:241) describe the attempts to codify the 
			language as the desire:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>(1) to reduce the language to rule and 
			set up a standard of correct usage; (2) to refine it—that is, to 
			remove supposed defects and introduce certain improvements; and (3) 
			to fix it permanently in the desired form.</em></span></p>
			<p>The spirit of the times flowed with such endeavours with the rise 
			of what was called 'polite literature'.&nbsp; The word <em>polite</em> 
			here has nothing to do with <em>politics</em> or <em>courtesy</em>; it is derived from 
			the Latin verb meaning <em>polish</em> or <em>smooth down</em>.&nbsp; Although earnest efforts to establish a kind of Academy to regulate 
			and define the uses of English failed (albeit narrowly) many 
			self-styled authorities arose to condemn, for example, the use of
			<em>had rather</em> (seen as a corruption of <em>would rather</em>).&nbsp; 
			Other forms which became fixed at this time are (<em>op cit.</em>: 
			263):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the preference for <em>different from</em> (rather than <em>
				different than</em> or <em>to</em>, the former standard AmE 
				usage and the latter still common on both sides of the Atlantic)</li>
				<li>the proscription of <em>*between you and I </em>(as an 
				illiterate use of a nominative pronoun after a preposition), 
				preferring <em>between you and me</em></li>
				<li>the differentiation of <em>between</em> and <em>among </em>
				(the former to refer only to two entities and the latter to more 
				than two)</li>
				<li>the use of the comparative rather than the superlative where 
				only two things are involved (<em>the larger</em>, not <em>
				largest</em>, of two)</li>
				<li>the feeling that ungradable adjectives such as <em>perfect, 
				chief, round</em>, should not be compared (<em>more perfect</em> etc.)</li>
				<li>the proscription of the use of <em>you was</em> as a 
				singular (although Webster approved it) and the adoption of <em>
				were</em> as the only correct form, singular or plural</li>
				<li>that the case of the pronoun after <em>than </em>is 
				determined by the construction supplied or understood, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He is 
				older than she </em>[not <em>her</em>]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He likes you better than me </em>[not <em>I</em>])</li>
				<li>the condemnation of the double negative</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There were also those who asserted that any attempt to set down 
			hard rules for English use was doomed to failure.&nbsp; Joseph 
			Priestly (1733-1804) noted (<em>op cit.</em>: 267):</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>In </em>modern<em> and </em>living<em> 
			languages, it is absurd to pretend to set up the compositions of any 
			person or persons whatsoever as the standard of writing, or their 
			conversation as the invariable rule of speaking.&nbsp; With respect to 
			custom, laws, and every thing that is changeable, the body of a 
			people, who, in this respect, cannot but be free, will certainly 
			assert their liberty, in making what innovations they judge to be 
			expedient and useful.&nbsp; The general prevailing custom, whatever it 
			happen to be, can be the only standard for the time that it 
			prevails.</em></span></p>
			<p>The collection of writings from which that citation is taken is 
			referenced in the bibliography at the end and is preceded by over 
			100 pages devoted to <em>The Rudiments of English Grammar</em>, much 
			of which, despite some obscure terms, is still valid and an honest 
			attempt to provide descriptive rather than prescriptive data.</p>
			<p>However, it is certainly true that the rules above and many more 
			persist to this day and are reasserted in grammars and handbooks of 
			use (and written into computer grammar-checking programs).&nbsp; 
			That they are simply the reflection of the views of a few 
			influential people and not based on what people actually said and 
			wrote is often not mentioned.</p>

			<p>It is reasonably straightforward to draw a neat line between Old 
			English and Middle English because we have major events such as the 
			Norman Conquest and the subsequent effects on the lexicon to use as 
			landmarks.&nbsp; We can also date the transition from Middle English 
			to Early Modern English but with considerably more difficulty to 
			around 1500 because we have the advent of the printing press and the rise 
			of English rather than French as the official medium of 
			communication as convenient landmarks.&nbsp; Old English, too, can 
			be reasonably dated as anything English before 1150.<br />
			This is not the case with the transition from Early Modern to Modern 
			English because the lines are blurred.</p>
			<p>There are four possible transition dates:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Around 1600<br />
				This coincides with the completion of most of the Great Vowel 
				Shift although the pronunciation of the language was still 
				anything but standard and the shift was not completely worked 
				through until two hundred years later.<br />
				It is a date, however, to which a major linguistic development 
				can be ascribed.</li>
				<li>Around 1650<br />
				This dates the transition to the Civil War, the Republic and the 
				restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660.&nbsp; At this 
				time, the lexicon of the language was enhanced by more 
				borrowings from French because it was in France that Charles 
				and his considerable retinue had lived until his restoration.<br />
				There is more social and political support for this date than 
				any hard language facts.</li>
				<li>Around 1700<br />
				This dates the transition to the time at which efforts were in 
				train to standardise the forms of the language and impose some 
				order on its grammar and orthography in particular.&nbsp; It 
				was, however, over 200 years later than the introduction of 
				printing to England and some would argue that the damage was by 
				now irreparable.<br />
				The date falls conveniently in the middle of the lives of Daniel 
				Defoe (?1660-1731) and Jonathan Swift (1667-1745).&nbsp; The 
				former's <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> was published in 1719 and the 
				latter's <em>Gulliver's Travels</em> in 1726.<br />
				No Academy was in fact established and no great change in the 
				language can be ascribed to this date so it has more cultural 
				and literary support than linguistic underpinning.</li>
				<li>Around 1750<br />
				Samuel Johnson's dictionary was first published in 1755 and this 
				is often proposed as a turning point in the development of the 
				standardised language.&nbsp; Following the dictionary, there was 
				an upsurge in the number of grammars being published which 
				attempted, with varying degrees of success, to set out 
				(prescribe, in fact) the standard forms of the language.<br />
				However, many of the grammars produced at this time had almost 
				no effect on the language in use and even Johnson's dictionary 
				was not in wide use outside of the literate classes.<br />
				The date is symbolic more than based on historical developments 
				in the language.&nbsp; The period from around 1760 onwards with 
				the development of steam driven machinery and new iron-making 
				techniques is also an important cultural and economic turning 
				point but not one which had as yet much influence on the 
				language.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each of these dates has its supporters and detractors but none, 
			unfortunately, coincides with a discernibly sudden or fundamental 
			shift in the way the language was formed, spoken or written.<br />
			In other words, dating the transition from Early Modern to Modern 
			English to anything between 1600 and 
			1750 is a defensible position to hold.</p>

			<p>As Defoe pointed out, throughout its history, even from the earliest times of Old 
			English, the language has been subject to influences from, 
			especially, Latin, through the influence of Christianity and the 
			role of Latin as the scientific, diplomatic and religious <em>lingua franca</em>, Norman 
			French, through the imposition of a French-speaking aristocracy 
			after the conquest in 1066, Parisian French and Latin, during the 
			Renaissance, more French following the Restoration in 1660, Greek, through the influence of science 
			and religion, and much later other languages indigenous to the 
			British colonies.&nbsp; At various times in history, other languages 
			contributed, notably Dutch for maritime matters, French for clothing 
			and fashion, German for 
			military terms and Italian for musical terms.</p>
			<p>The outcome is a language essentially Germanic in structure but with 
			a huge range of lexical influences.<br />
			Roughly, for the lexicon, the picture is:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="influences" height="348" src="../imagesgraphics/modern_english_influences.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>
			10% of the lexicon is derived from other sources, and in the other 
			languages slice, we 
			must include some Celtic words (and structural elements) set out 
			above.<br />
			Some items come from sources which cannot be traced and are often 
			words borrowed from languages which have been so mangled in 
			transmission that they are no longer recognisable or come from 
			languages now extinct.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Eponyms and Toponyms</strong></dt>
				<dd>are words taken from proper names or places, respectively, 
				and include:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>Trade names such as <em>hoover</em>, <em>escalator, aspirin, lanolin, heroin,

			[from a Bantu language of Angola],<em> gingham</em> [from Malay],
			<em>boondocks</em> and <em>yo-yo</em> [both from Indonesian] etc.</li>
					<li>From other languages in certain areas of academia, 
					especially the humanities, or imported along with cultural 
					phenomena or by immigrant communities (Jewish, South Asian, 
					Chinese and Caribbean in particular):<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; angst, blitz, delicatessen, kindergarten, waltz, rucksack</em> 
					(German)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glitch, chutzpah, kosher </em>(Yiddish)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligentsia, mammoth, glasnost </em>(Russian)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coup d'état, chalet, ballet, rendezvous</em> (French)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; latte, espresso, paparazzi, soprano</em> (Italian)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; robot, howitzer, pistol, dollar</em> (Czech)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; siesta, guerrilla, macho</em> (Spanish)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; karaoke, tsunami, origami</em> (Japanese)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gung ho, chow, ketchup, tycoon, typhoon</em> (Chinese 
					languages)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buffalo, flamingo</em> (Portuguese)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>apartheid, boss, buoy </em>(Dutch or Afrikaans)<br />
					This could be a very long list indeed and, in the way of 
					things, many erstwhile loan words such as <em>boss, ketchup, 
					glitch, dollar </em>and so on are no longer recognised as 
					such.<br />
					Pronunciation is rarely retained from the language whence 
					the words come although the non-pronunciation of final

					Spelling, too, is often Anglicised, even when 
					the word is taken from a language with a similar alphabet.&nbsp; Accent marks and 
					other diacritics in the original language are often lost 
					when the word is Anglicised but some such as the marks on
					<em>café, cliché, vis-à-vis, tête-à-tête </em>are retained 
					(often inconsistently).&nbsp; Accents from other languages 
					such as German and Turkish are almost always lost.<br />

			<p>We saw above that there has been a general tendency in English 
			towards the simplification of many grammatical categories which were 
			once important, especially the loss of inflexions on adjectives, 
			verbs, and case endings on a range of items.<br />
			A phenomenon not confined to any particular period in the 
			development of English is one which has been documented in a range of languages.&nbsp; It is usually referred to as 
			grammaticalisation but it may be called grammartisation or 
			grammatication, too.<br />
			Briefly, it describes a process in which a content word, which 
			carries meaning and may stand alone, is converted into a function 
			word which operates at the level of grammar.</p>
			<p>Content words are generally understood to be nouns, adjectives, 
			adverbs and verbs so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; table<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go</em><br />
			etc. can all stand alone and still carry significance for speakers 
			of the language.<br />
			Function words, on the other hand are generally understood to be 
			determiners, pronouns, prepositions and conjunctions so, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; although</em><br />
			etc. are all meaningless without co-text to appreciate what they are 
			doing in terms of grammar.</p>
			<p>There is a trend, in English and many other languages, for the 
			meaning of some content words to be bleached out so that the 
			original meaning is lost and only the grammatical function remains.&nbsp; 
			Some examples of bleaching will suffice to see the process in action:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em><strong>indeed</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>In Modern English, the word has 
					two functions:<br />
				as an adverb intensifier 
					used to emphasise a statement such as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was indeed difficult to understand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was indeed a man of some intelligence<br />
				</em>as a conjunct adverbial to 
					introduce an additional and unexpected issue such as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ideas interested the management.&nbsp; 
					Indeed, they were implemented quite quickly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She expected it to be hard work and indeed it took a lot 
					longer than two hours<br />
				</em>In earlier times, however, the word was 
				lexical rather than grammatical and appeared as a prepositional 
				phrase, <em>in dede</em>, which meant <em>in fact</em> or <em>in 
				action</em> (cognate with the Modern English <em>deed</em> from 
				the Old English <em>dæd</em>, an action or event).&nbsp; Over 
				time, the meaning has been bleached from the word and all that 
				remains is a function word.&nbsp; The change took place during 
				the 16th century.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>will / would</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>derives from the Old English verb <em>wyllan</em>, meaning
				<em>wish, want</em> or <em>desire</em> and can still be used 
				that way in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He willed his entire fortune to his 
				cousin</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take as long as you will<br />
				</em>In Modern English, however, the verb has be delexicalised (or 
				grammaticalised) and now functions as a future tense marker or a 
				marker of prospective aspect, in other words.&nbsp; In this 
				sense, it parallels the use of <em>have</em> to mark a perfect 
				aspect.&nbsp; The verb has taken on the role of a primary rather 
				than modal auxiliary verb, as 
				in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be 35 years old tomorrow</em><br />
				or, retaining its original meaning, as an expression of willingness (not a future marker) as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll cook supper if you like</em><br />
				The two modern meanings of the verb, one to refer to volition, 
				the other to futurity, cause significant difficulties for 
				learners (and, alas, some teachers and materials writers).<br />
				The verb <em>would</em> in Modern English, derived from the 
				past tense of <em>wyllan, wolde</em>, has undergone a 
				similar process being confined now to a modal auxiliary verb 
				which, standing alone, has no obvious meaning.&nbsp; The verb 
				still, however, demonstrates the same twofold meaning as <em>
				will</em> so we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew he would be late</em> (future in 
				the past)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would do it if you asked</em> 
				(willingness)</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>let</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>Until comparatively recently, this verb simply meant <em>
				allow</em> and is still used that way in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me go</em><br />
				meaning<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to go</em><br />
				However, modern usage has delexicalised the verb and it is now 
				used as a marginal modal auxiliary verb in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's go out</em><br />
				meaning<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why don't we go out?<br />
				</em>The change in use can be discerned in the difference 
				between:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us go<br />
				</em>meaning<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow us to go<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's go<br />
				</em>meaning<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest we go<br />
				</em>In the meaning of <em>suggest</em> the phrase is always 
				contracted.<br />
				The conjunction <em>let alone, </em>meaning <em>not to 
				mention </em>is not attested until the early 19th century and is 
				another example of the grammaticalisation of the verb.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>that</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>Is generally seen as the singular form of the determiner <em>
				these</em> and is used to distinguish between, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like that hat and those gloves</em><br />
				However, the word has been grammaticalised in Modern English and 
				now functions as a relative pronoun in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The books that I gave her</em><br />
				where it is unmarked for plural or singular.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>going</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>is, in many cases, a verb form from the verb <em>go</em> and 
				it carries its usual meaning in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is going to the shops</em><br />
				which can mean<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is currently on her way to the shops</em><br />
				In Modern English, on the other hand, the verb has been 
				grammaticalised and now functions as an auxiliary verb denoting 
				currently planned actions as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to talk to the boss tomorrow</em><br />
				and, in fact, the verb can also refer to a present intention for 
				the future in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's going to the shops</em> (later)<br />
				because of the avoidance of the clumsy <em>going to go</em> 
				formulation.<br />
				The two uses of <em>going</em> can be distinguished because the 
				function word use to signal a prospective event may be 
				pronounced weakly (often spelled as <em>gonna</em>).&nbsp; For 
				example,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to go</em><br />
				may be transcribed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /aɪm.ˈɡənə.ɡəʊ/<br />
				but the lexical form is not weakened, retaining the full 
				pronunciation so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to London</em><br />
				is transcribed as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /ɪts.ˈɡəʊɪŋ.tə.ˈlʌn.dən/</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>have</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>is still used in its original meaning of possess as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has a nice house in London</em><br />
				but the verb has also been grammaticalised:<br />
				to form a perfect tense as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been to New York</em><br />
				to express obligation as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have (got) to go now</em><br />
				The verb <em>have to </em>to mean <em>must</em> is only attested from 
				the late 16th century and the use with the meaningless <em>got</em> 
				is not current until three centuries later.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>to</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>is used in modern English as part of the infinitive of a 
				verb but its origin lies in its use as the subordinating conjunction <em>in 
				order to</em>.&nbsp; In Old English, the infinitive had a 
				special form, ending in -<em>an</em> or -<em>ian</em> but as 
				this was lost, the need was obviously felt for a way to identify 
				the infinitive and the word <em>to</em> was co-opted to fill it.&nbsp; 
				It is now conventionally appended to almost all infinitive 
				forms so we get reference to, for example, the verbs <em>to 
				speak, to understand, to want</em> and so on and in these cases 
				the word carries no significance at all.<br />
				In its grammatical function, the word is bleached of any meaning 
				but it still functions prepositionally in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I conformed to the rules<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She reacted well to the suggestion</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They objected to waiting<br />
				</em>in which cases, we cannot follow <em>to</em> with the bare 
				infinitive of any verb.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>-ly</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>is the usual suffix for the formation of an adverb from an 
				adjective in Modern English.&nbsp; Hence <em>carefully</em> from
				<em>careful</em> and hundreds of others.&nbsp; At one time, it 
				was also the way to make an adjective from a noun (hence <em>
				motherly</em> from <em>mother</em>).&nbsp; The latter use has 
				been replaced by a simple <em>-y</em> suffix.<br />
				It derives, however, from the Anglo-Saxon word <em>lic </em>or
				<em>lich</em> meaning <em>bod</em>y.&nbsp; The suffix has been 
				shortened and grammaticalised to the suffix only.</dd>

			continue to the right is indicative of their continued influence.<br />
			Norman French and Anglo-Saxon, respectively concerning the lexicon 
			and the grammar of English, were far more influential than, e.g., 
			Old Norse.&nbsp; The influence of Greek and Latin rose rapidly 
			during The Renaissance but the languages continue to be important in 
			many scientific and technical writings.<br />
			The influence of the so-called Empire languages is confined to the 
			lexicon.<br />
			American English is not shown separately as an influence but has 
			been a powerful one since around 1940 on the lexicon, grammar and 
			some extent the pronunciation of the language.&nbsp; Other 
			influences such as Australian, Irish and other varieties are also 
			not shown.</p>
			<p>
			We can, naturally, strip out the influences and simply look at how 
			the modern forms of English are descended from the group of 
			languages which were spoken by the Saxons, Jutes, Frisians and 
			Angles when they invaded.&nbsp; There is some controversy concerning 
			whether there ever was a language one could call Proto-West Germanic 
			or whether the languages spoken by these various peoples were 
			already quite distinct.&nbsp; Fortunately, for a history of English, 
			we do not need to decide so we'll just put the languages at the top 
			of the diagram but know that we are probably talking about a range 
			of languages which were only very partially mutually comprehensible.<br />
			Much of this will be slightly speculative but the main outlines are 
			clear.&nbsp; It looks something like this:</p>

			<p>All of the foregoing is directed to explaining how English has 
			changed and developed over the course of its history.<br />
			We have identified two ways in which the language has varied:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>synchronic variation<br />
				refers to varieties co-existing at the same time.&nbsp; 
				Throughout its history, there have been different forms of the 
				language spoken by different classes of people in different 
				places.&nbsp; Sometimes, one variety has been selected as a 
				standard, sometimes another.&nbsp; The reasons are complex and 
				based on economics, cultural factors and social-class 
				differences.<br />
				For more on language variety, see the guide to language and 
				society, linked below.</li>
				<li>diachronic variation<br />
				refers to how the language has exhibited different varieties at 
				different times so, for example, the gradual loss of inflexions 
				in the transition from Old to Middle English is diachronic 
				variation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>But all this 
			actually begs a rather important question:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>Why did English change?</strong></p>
			<p>There is no doubt that the language has evolved from an early 
			highly inflected, synthetic language to its modern form which is far 
			more analytic, carries very few inflexions and is simpler in terms 
			of having neither a clear case structure signalled by the forms of 
			words nor, as other closely related languages have, a sophisticated 
			system for expressing social relationships.<br />
			To put our question another way, why is it that the language changed 
			at all?&nbsp; After all, Old English served for many hundreds of 
			years as a perfectly acceptable means of communication and, with a 
			few tweaks to the lexicon, there seems no overt reason why it 
			shouldn't have continued as the language of the people who lived in 
			the area.<br />
			However, it has evolved and the evolution of anything and 
			everything occurs in accordance with three quite simple 
			pre-conditions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>There must be variation in the entity in question<br />
				In this case, we are talking about the English language rather 
				than considering an organism.</li>
				<li>The variations must cause differential rates of 
				reproduction, survival and extinction<br />
				In other words, changes can persist, because they are reproduced 
				from generation to generation or they can be discarded as 
				unhelpful or even damaging.</li>
				<li>The variation must be hereditable<br />
				In this case, not genetically, because nobody inherits a 
				language that way.&nbsp; A language (rather than the ability to 
				learn and use language) is socially, not biologically 
				transmitted.&nbsp; Language is in the memes, not the genes, in 
				other words.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is not difficult to see how these three criteria are met in 
			the case of this language (or any other):</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Variation</strong><br />
				<img alt="vary" height="133" src="../images/variety_hats200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				From the outset, English was a set of closely related languages 
				which varied in many respects.&nbsp; Although it is credible to 
				suggest that Saxons, Angles, Jutes and Frisians may well have 
				been able to understand each other reasonably well, it is 
				equally clear that the languages they spoke were very different 
				in a number of respects.&nbsp; It is difficult, at this remove, 
				to itemise the differences with any great certainty but 
				significant differences certainly were apparent to the speakers 
				of those languages.<br />
				The selection of one variation over another can happen in two 
				ways:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>synchronic variation<br />
					Regional variations abound in all large and some small 
					languages so, in Britain for example, depending on the level 
					of detail investigated, many hundreds of local varieties are 
					discernible.&nbsp; From time to time, certain regions may become more powerful 
					or highly regarded than others and the variety spoken in 
					that region often becomes a new standard to which speakers 
					of other varieties may aspire or simulate.<br />
					At least five grossly different variation of English are 
					discernible from the earliest beginnings of the language and 
					their influence is still identifiable in modern English 
					regional variations.<br />
					We saw, for example, that the form of English spoken in the 
					triangle formed by the positions of London, Oxford and 
					Cambridge became, in Chaucer's time, a dominant, high status 
					variety simply because the triangle contained both great 
					economic power and also intellectual authority.<br />
					Synchronic variation can also be caused by geographical 
					separation both in the natural world where it leads to the 
					rise of new species but also in language and we have 
					evidence of that in the differences which have arisen and 
					continue to arise between English spoken in Britain, in the 
					Indian subcontinent and in North America and elsewhere.&nbsp; 
					There are also, of course, powerful centralising pressures 
					of mass media and international communication which often 
					act to level out differences.</li>
					<li>diachronic variation<br />
					All languages we know, vary over time and 
					changes are discernible in single generations.&nbsp; English 
					spoken 1000 years ago would be barely comprehensible to 
					someone living today and the process shows little sign of 
					stopping.<br />
					The nation that is now Britain was highly stratified and the status 
					and roles of individuals varied over time depending on who 
					held the most power and when they rose to prominence.<br />
					After the Norman Conquest, for example, the dominant 
					aristocratic class was French speaking and, inevitably, any 
					social advancement above a certain lowly level depended on 
					the ability to speak and understand the French of the ruling 
					class.&nbsp; At the same time, however, native English 
					speakers needed to be controlled and suborned and for that 
					to happen easily, the rulers needed some form of 
					English-language skill.<br />
					Nevertheless, for 300 years all the monarchs spoke no 
					English.&nbsp; An influx, therefore, of French words was 
					assured because they had the greatest utility for the 
					greatest number of power holders.<br />
					Other diachronic influences can also be perceived: changes 
					in religion, changes in national interests, changes in 
					regional power and so on which all pushed the language and 
					its speakers in the direction of conformity with social 
					norms and power.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Differential rates of survival and reproduction</strong><br />
				<img alt="reproduction" height="133" src="../images/birds_ducks200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Some variations in the way English was spoken had higher status 
				and were preferentially selected 
				by speakers as their dialect or language of choice.&nbsp; Some 
				were rejected.&nbsp; This resulted in a differential with 
				some varieties succeeding and going on to reproduce and vary 
				down the generations and some being discarded and going extinct.<br />
				In English, the once almost obligatory use of <em>shall</em> 
				instead of <em>will</em> for first-person subjects is fast dying 
				out and the use of <em>Have you</em> as the question form is 
				going the same way as <em>Have you got</em> or <em>Do you have</em> 
				become more frequent.&nbsp; The word <em>incredibly</em>, once 
				confined to mean <em>not believably</em> has quite rapidly come 
				to mean <em>very</em> and one almost never encounters people 
				describing something as <em>awfully interesting </em>or <em>
				terribly nice</em> as was once, not so very long ago, common.<br />
				The list of quite recent changes 
				in English could be made very much longer but it not always 
				recognised that the process has been occurring throughout the 
				history of the language.<br />
				English coexisted for much of its history alongside Norse and 
				Celtic languages in particular but it was almost always the 
				dominant means of communication.&nbsp; There is some 
				speculation, however, that the influence of another powerful set 
				of languages spoken in the parts of the country ruled by Norse 
				speakers was a powerful driving factor in reducing the 
				complexities of the inflexional system of Old English.&nbsp; In 
				other words, a simpler system had obvious social, commercial and 
				military benefits for the 
				language's speakers and these were preferentially selected and 
				reproduced rapidly.</li>
				<li><strong>Inheritability</strong><br />
				<img alt="inherit" height="133" src="../images/birds_ostrich_and_chick200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Languages are not inherited biologically but they are 
				certainly inherited culturally.&nbsp; A baby taken from one 
				culture and raised in another will speak the language of the 
				culture in which it has been raised, not where it was born.&nbsp; 
				That language changes as it passes down the generations of 
				speakers is not in doubt and beneficial changes will be passed 
				on while neutral or detrimental innovations (or those perceived 
				as such by large sections of the speech community) may flourish 
				for a time and then die out.<br />
				The spread of mass education (a quite recent phenomenon) has 
				added to the momentum because mass education implies adherence 
				to mass standards.<br />
				At one time, of course, it mattered very little whether someone 
				from Northumberland would be understood by someone from Kent 
				because they were very unlikely to meet <strong>unless</strong> 
				they belonged to the ruling elite.<br />
				For the elite, of course, a single language variety was 
				essential if their relationships and power were to be maintained 
				and that elite made sure that its forms of choice and lexicon 
				were handed down through the generations.<br />
				Mass communication, too, tended to enhance the heritability of 
				only certain forms of language.&nbsp; The printing press and, 
				therefore, mass production of written texts began to be in 
				common use around the time of Shakespeare and coincided (some 
				say unfortunately) with the great vowel shift which was also 
				underway and driven by other social factors.&nbsp; Variations 
				were passed on and discarded almost randomly because they were 
				often in the control of printers themselves who were variably 
				educated.&nbsp; By the 18th century, powerful centralising and 
				standardising forces can be perceived with, for example, 
				attempts to standardise the grammar and the spelling system as 
				well as the meaning of words.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			The three conditions for evolution to occur are still extant, of 
			course, so there is no reason to suppose that English spoken, say, 
			in 2600 with be anything like the English in which this guide is 
			written.<br />
			If history is our guide, that language will be as different from 
			this as Chaucer's English is from the English spoken today.</p>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Richness</strong><br />
				<img alt="cake" height="133" src="../images/cake200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Firstly, there is the sheer richness of the lexicon in 
				English which often exhibits subtle but distinct differences between 
				words derived from different sources but which mean more or less 
				the same thing, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anger</em> (Old Norse<em> 
				angr</em>) and<em> rage </em> (Old French r<em>age</em>)<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; begin</em> (Old English <em>beginnan</em>) and<em> 
				commence</em> (Old French <em>comencier</em>)<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bloom </em> (Old Norse <em>blomi</em>) and<em> flowe</em>r (Old French <em>
				flor</em>)<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; child </em> (Old English <em>cild</em>) and<em> infant </em> 
				(possibly via French from the Latin <em>infantus)<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; folk</em> (Old English <em>folc</em>) and <em>people </em> 
				(Old French <em>peupel</em>)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freedom
				</em>(Old English <em>freodom</em>) and<em> liberty
				</em>(Old French <em> liberté</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grow 
				</em>(Old English <em>growan</em>) and <em>expand</em> 
				(Old French <em>espandre</em>)<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holiday
				</em>(Old English <em>haligdæg</em>) and<em> vacation
				</em>(Old French <em>vacacion</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leader
				</em>(Old English <em>lædere</em>) and<em> 
				chief
				</em>(Old French <em>chief</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pig</em> 
				(origin obscure) 
				and <em>swine </em> (Old English <em>swin</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tongue
				</em>(Old English <em>tunge</em>) and<em> 
				language
				</em>(Old French <em>langage</em>)<br />and 
				thousands of other near or partial synonyms distinguished by 
				style, register, connotation, dialect and collocational characteristics.<br />
				A subset of these near synonyms is exemplified by verbs which 
				exist in intransitive and transitive pairs such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>rise</em> (from Old English) vs. <em>raise</em> (from Old 
				Norse)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>lie</em> vs. <em>lay</em> (both from Old English)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sit</em> vs. <em>seat</em> (the latter verb appears much 
				later but both are derived from Old English)</li>
				<li><strong>Three-level synonyms</strong><br />
				<img alt="3" height="133" src="../images/three_glasses200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				A second interesting outcome of the influences of other languages 
				is the existence in English, almost uniquely, of three-level 
				synonym structures.&nbsp; So we have, for example<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ask – question – interrogate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boon – advantage – benefit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; craft – art – science<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eat – consume – ingest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fetch – retrieve – recover<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire – flame – conflagration<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forgiveness – mercy – clemency<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glee – felicity – delight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goodness – virtue – probity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hatred – enmity – animosity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; living – profession – vocation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love – adore – venerate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right – just – legal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rise – mount – ascend</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speak – converse – discourse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wise – prudent – intelligent</em><br />
				and many more where 
				the first word is derived from Old English (sometimes in turn 
				from Old Norse), the second from Old / Norman French and the third 
				from Latin or, occasionally, Greek.<br />
				These are not exact synonyms because they differ in style, in 
				nuance and, sometimes, in their associated grammar (<em>fetch</em> 
				and <em>retrieve</em> are, for example, always transitive but <em>
				recover</em> can be intransitive or transitive).&nbsp; The nouns
				<em>goodness</em> and <em>probity</em> are mass nouns whereas
				<em>virtue</em> is commonly used as a countable noun.</li>
				<li><strong>Style</strong><br />
				<img alt="style" height="133" src="../images/style_smart200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Considerations of style in English are often very important, 
				especially in terms of the lexicon, rather than the grammar, as 
				a glance at many teaching materials will reveal.&nbsp; Such 
				considerations are not at all so important in the teaching of a 
				range of other languages where the choice of words is not 
				confined to issues of formality.<br />
				One outcome is the distinction between multi-word verbs 
				and their Latin- or French-derived equivalents in English so we get, for 
				example<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put off </em>vs. <em>postpone<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look into</em> vs. 
				<em>investigate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call off</em> vs. <em>cancel<br />
				</em>and literally hundreds of others.<br />Again, these are not perfect synonyms because the associated 
				grammar and style is variable.<br />
				Additionally, the selection of a word on stylistic bases is 
				often confined to a choice of a Latin- or French-derived term 
				over that which is more solidly from older forms of English so, 
				for example, we may get pairings such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got your note<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I received your memo<br />
				</em>or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She picked the blue car<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She selected the blue vehicle<br />
				</em>and so on.</li>
				<li>H<strong>omonymy and polysemy</strong><br />
				<img alt="2" height="133" src="../images/two_nets200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Two related phenomena are homonymy (the fact that some words 
				look and sound the same but are not related in sense or 
				origin) and polysemy (words which are used in distinct but 
				related senses and are related in origin).<br />
				Homonymy occurs frequently when two words which now look the 
				same are derived from different sources.<br />
				For example, <em>left</em> (the opposite of <em>right</em>) 
				derives from the Old English <em>lyft</em> which meant <em>weak</em> 
				(as in the weaker hand) but the past tense of <em>leave</em>,
				<em>left</em>, derives from the Old English verb <em>læfan</em> 
				which originally meant <em>allow to remain</em> and only assumed 
				its sense of <em>depart</em> in the thirteenth century.&nbsp; 
				The words look the same but are unconnected in derivation and 
				meaning.<br />
				Polysemous words are related but, over time, some of their 
				senses have diverged.&nbsp; For example, as we have seen <em>
				leave</em> to mean <em>depart</em> and <em>leave</em> to mean
				<em>allow to remain</em> are both used as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She left without paying</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I left the book on the table</em><br />
				The first use is intransitive only and the second always 
				transitive.<br />
				The word <em>set</em> is notorious in having a large range of 
				meanings:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I set a test<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glue set<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I set the alarm clock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She set the dog on him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They set the vase on the mantelpiece</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				In fact, all these uses of the verb <em>set</em> are derivable from the 
				Old English <em>settan</em> (a transitive verb meaning <em>to 
				put in some place</em> or <em>fix</em>).&nbsp; The fact that 
				some of the meanings have diverged to the point at which there 
				is little obvious connection inclines some to classify the uses 
				as examples of homonymy rather than polysemy.&nbsp; Opinions 
				vary.</li>
				<li><strong>Facilitation and interference</strong><br />
				<img alt="help" height="133" src="../images/helping_up200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				A fifth outcome is that learners from certain language 
				backgrounds will be able to access and retain some areas of the 
				English lexicon better than others.&nbsp; Those from Romance 
				language backgrounds will be able to understand and recall words 
				derived from Latin and French and those from Germanic language 
				backgrounds will find the same with the approximately a quarter 
				of the words in English traceable to Anglo-Saxon and other later 
				Germanic languages such as Dutch.<br />Some of the older connections may not at first seem obvious.&nbsp; 
				For example, the Modern German verb <em>reisen</em> (<em>travel</em>) 
				shares a root with the English word <em>rise</em> and originally 
				meant <em>to get up to start a journey</em>.&nbsp; Words also 
				change their meanings in other subtler ways.&nbsp; For example, 
				the English word <em>stove</em> originally meant a warm room for relaxing 
				in and that sense is retained in other Germanic languages (with 
				spelling variations) but only reduced its sense to mean <em>a 
				heating or cooking device</em> in the mid-seventeenth century in 
				English.<br />By the same token, some words derived from Latin, Norman or 
				later French have had time to vary their meanings or to acquire 
				new ones which did not occur in the original.&nbsp; So, for 
				example, the Modern English <em>realise</em> and the Modern 
				French <em>réaliser</em> both clearly derive from the same 
				source but the sense of <em>gain a sudden understanding</em> in, 
				for example:<br />&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I slowly realised the truth</em><br />which the English verb carries is absent in French.&nbsp; French 
				uses <em>prendre conscience</em> to express this meaning, not 
				the verb <em>réaliser.</em><br />In French the 
				verb only shares the English sense of <em>make real</em> as in, 
				for example:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They realised their dream</em><br />The meanings are connected because the verb originally was used 
				in the sense of <em>make real in the mind</em> in the 
				mid-eighteenth century in English and only slowly changed its 
				sense to <em>gain an understanding</em>.<br />The existence of so-called false friends between English and 
				other European languages can usually be explained by these 
				gradual shifts in meaning over the years since the words entered 
				the language.<br />The longer the separation, the more the meaning is likely to 
				have diverged so, for example, words from Greek may appear 
				related (and they often are) to Modern English words but the 
				senses have diverged until they seem no longer connected in 
				meaning.&nbsp; For example, the Greek word for <em>civil</em> 
				(in the sense of to do with citizens) is <em>πολιτικός</em> (<em>poleetikos</em>) 
				which is the source of the English <em>political</em> (to do 
				with government).<br />See
				the guide to cognates and 
				false friends on this site, linked below in the list of related 
				guides.</li>
				<li><strong>Parallelism</strong><br />
				<img alt="lines" height="133" src="../images/rail_lines200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Finally, learners from Germanic language backgrounds will 
				find many of the grammatical and structural phenomena in English 
				relatively easy to understand and form because parallel 
				structures exist in their languages.<br />
				Meaning is, however, often an interference issue because tense 
				forms may look parallel but do not carry the same significance 
				across languages and in the area of modal auxiliary verbs, too, 
				similar-looking structures and verbs will often vary 
				significantly in terms of meaning.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Issues 5. and 6., above, will only, of course, apply to learners 
			whose languages are western Indo-European.&nbsp; Others will have no 
			such easy access to the grammar or the lexicon of Modern English but 
			will also avoid the traps of false friends and false structural 
			analogies.&nbsp; 
			There are obvious consequences arising from that, too.</p>
