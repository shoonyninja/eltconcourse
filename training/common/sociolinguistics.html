			<h1>Language and society: sociolinguistics</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="4" height="207" src="../images/four_talking310.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This is an overview focusing on the nature of the study of 
			sociolinguistics, some of the main ideas and categories of concern.<br />
			It also comments on the implications for English language teaching, 
			as you might expect of this site.<br />
			For more on sociolinguistics in general, and those aspects of ELT 
			most closely influenced by sociolinguistic ideas, please consult the 
			bibliography and related links at the end.</p>
			<p>Sociolinguistics is a very large area of study which overlaps 
			with many others including, but not limited to, anthropology, 
			sociology, ethnology, pragmatics, geography and politics.&nbsp; The study concerns how 
			language use relates to and is influenced by social factors such as 
			nationality, class, ethnicity, sex, 
			regional origin and education.<br />
			It is, or should be, of interest to language teachers because 
			understanding a little of how language use is affected by such 
			factors allows us to select the kinds of language we should be 
			teaching, the settings in which it may be presented and the people 
			we show speaking and writing it.</p>
			<p>In what follows, we'll select the key issues in sociolinguistics, 
			summarise what they are about and indicate the implications they may 
			have for language teachers.</p>
		<p>
		Here's a list 
		of the contents to take you to its various sections if you are looking 
		for something specific.<br />

					<h2>Influence acts on variety</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Sociolinguistics is mostly to do with influences on language use 
			from various sources.&nbsp; Influence, however, acts in two obvious 
			ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It can act to limit variety so, for example, the compulsory 
				wearing of a uniform or a law constraining people's actions both 
				act to limit variety.<br />
				In language, some influences, such as an education system which 
				teaches 'correct' rules for the use of pupils' first languages, 
				act to limit the varieties which would naturally be present and 
				could make people less able to communicate effectively.&nbsp; It 
				is also noticeable that the international spread of mass media 
				such as film, the internet and television and the ease with 
				which people now travel across national borders and encounter 
				speakers of a range of varieties of their own language may also 
				act to homogenise a language and suppress variety quite 
				effectively.</li>
				<li>It can act to change and increase variety so, for example, 
				if musicians are asked what influences have shaped their music, 
				the question really is: <em>How have other people's productions 
				varied your production?<br />
				</em>In language, the further apart people are in terms of 
				culture or simple distance, the more likely it is that the local 
				or regional influences will affect which language people speak, how 
				they use it, 
				their vocabulary, the grammar they employ and the ways in which 
				they speak and write.<br />
				If dialects of a language are separated by geographical, 
				political or cultural barriers, the tendency is clear for them 
				to drift apart while maintaining some commonalities.&nbsp; 
				Eventually, the process leads to a form of speciation which, 
				like species in the natural world, are no longer able to produce 
				viable offspring.&nbsp; In other words, the dialects morph into 
				languages proper and mutual comprehensibility is gradually lost.<br />
				We can watch this speciation happening in real time when borders 
				are inserted into areas once considered single nations so, for 
				example, in erstwhile Czechoslovakia both Czech and Slovak were, 
				for the most part, mutually comprehensible dialects of the same 
				language.&nbsp; With the separation of the country into two 
				republics, many now designate the two varieties as independent 
				languages and the expectation is that they will drift apart and 
				may eventually become less and less mutually understood.<br />
				There are those, for example, who see this process occurring 
				with US and UK varieties of the language but we are not there 
				yet and countervailing influences of mass media, internet use 
				and so on are also acting to homogenise the language.&nbsp; The 
				jury is still out on which influence will be the stronger in the 
				long run.</li>

					<h3>Defining a language</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It's a simple matter to state without fear of successful 
			contradiction that people speak difference languages.&nbsp; So, for 
			example, we can easily recognise that most people born and raised in 
			Japan will speak Japanese and most of those born and raised in 
			Turkey will speak Turkish and so on across the 195 countries 
			normally recognised to have independent existences.&nbsp; So far, so 
			straightforward.<br />
			However, there are over 7000 human languages recognised by, for 
			example, Ethnologue.&nbsp; That's around 36 languages per country.&nbsp; 
			It is, in fact, impossible to identify a single nation on earth in 
			which everyone speaks the same language.<br />
			Even very small countries exhibit dialect and language varieties.&nbsp; 
			For example, San Marino, with a population of fewer than 35,000 
			people has only one official language (Italian) but Romagnol (a 
			dialect or language depending on one's point of view) is widely 
			spoken there as it is across the whole of northern Italy.<br />
			Monaco, a state with around the same population (of whom only a minority of 25% are actually nationals) has French as the official 
			language but Monégasque, a dialect of Ligurian, is widely spoken, as 
			is Italian.<br />
			Papua New Guinea with a population of around 9 million is home to 
			851 different languages.&nbsp; That's roughly one language for every 
			10,500 people.</p>
			<p>The linguistic determiner for the identification of a language is 
			the concept of <strong>mutual intelligibility</strong> and for most 
			purposes, that's a reasonable criterion.&nbsp; It is quite simple, 
			again, to be able to state that English and German are not mutually 
			intelligible so, linguistically, are autonomous languages.&nbsp; 
			Equally, Russian and Urdu speakers cannot communicate with each 
			other using their respective languages because the languages are not 
			in the least mutually intelligible.<br />
			However, mutual intelligibility is not a digital, on-off phenomenon 
			and a little thought reveals that there are degrees of mutual 
			intelligibility.&nbsp; Educated speakers of, for example, Danish, 
			Norwegian and Swedish have very little difficulty understanding each 
			other when they speak their own languages but it is not easy to 
			state that the three languages have no independent existence.<br />
			It is also the case that Hindi and Urdu are mutually comprehensible 
			languages and speakers of them have little difficulty understanding 
			each other.&nbsp; They are, linguistically speaking, dialects of the 
			same language but to assert that they are not independent languages 
			also flies in the face of geographical, political and social facts.&nbsp; 
			The two varieties are written, for example, using mutually 
			completely unintelligible scripts; Hindi in Devanagari and Urdu in a 
			modified Perso-Arabic script.&nbsp; Today, Urdu is the official 
			language of Pakistan and Hindi one of the official languages of 
			India.<br />
			A notorious example is the language (or languages) spoken in 
			erstwhile Yugoslavia.&nbsp; Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and 
			Serbian are, in their spoken forms, mutually almost completely 
			intelligible but political, social and to some extent religious 
			pressures have resulted in their being defined by their speakers as 
			separate languages.&nbsp; All four dialects have in the past been 
			written in a variety of scripts and today the languages are divided 
			by the use of the Cyrillic or Latin alphabets.&nbsp; Bosnian, 
			Montenegrin and Serbian are written using both alphabets but 
			Croatian only in the Latin alphabet.<br />
			Until recently, the varieties were generally subsumed under the 
			umbrella term Serbo-Croat but today the preferred term is, with due 
			respect to alphabetical ordering, 
			Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian.&nbsp; Political pressures are, 
			unsurprisingly, strong in defining the varieties as separate and 
			independent languages.</p>
			<p>The upshot of all this confusion is that we can define a language 
			in three distinct but overlapping ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A language constitutes a separate entity and is not 
				comprehensible to speakers of other languages.&nbsp; French and 
				Swahili are, therefore, separate languages.</li>
				<li>A language is defined socially and politically by its 
				speakers.&nbsp; So, Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian 
				are separate languages and Hindi and Urdu share this 
				characteristic.</li>
				<li>A language is defined politically by the nation in which it 
				is spoken.&nbsp; Danish, Swedish and Norwegian are, therefore, 
				separate languages and Swiss German is separate from German.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To identify to which language a dialect (see below) belongs, we 
			need to look at the notions of correctness which its speakers 
			perceive.&nbsp; For example, in the borderlands between Germany and 
			The Netherlands there are dialects which are mutually comprehensible 
			on both sides of the frontier but speakers of the northern dialect 
			will defer to Dutch as the standard of correctness and south of the 
			line the reference will be to standard German.</p>
			<p>Languages which are often defined as such by non-speakers of them 
			also complicate the picture when the speakers themselves will not be 
			able to understand each other when speaking ostensibly the same 
			language.&nbsp; So, for example, although Arabic is often seen as a 
			single language and Chinese is similarly described, that is merely a 
			convenience because both languages are better described as macro 
			languages and within them the various forms of the language are not 
			100% mutually comprehensible (and, in some instances, not mutually 
			comprehensible at all).&nbsp; By most analyses, there are 14 
			mutually incomprehensible varieties of Chinese and 20 of Arabic.<br />
			The tendency with macro languages is to retain comprehensibility of 
			the written form but for the spoken forms to drift apart.</p>
			<p>Overall the picture looks a bit like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="summary" height="315" src="../imagesgraphics/language_definition.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>and, like most summaries, that hides a good deal of debate, 
			controversy and detail.<br />
			A rule of thumb for the definition of a language is that it is a 
			dialect with an army and a navy.&nbsp; That's not a definition 
			linguists would recognise but it makes some political, national and 
			social sense.</p>

			<p>This is another blurry distinction.<br />
			We have already seen that efforts to differentiate distinct 
			languages from varieties of the same language are fraught with 
			difficulty.&nbsp; So it is with dialects and accents.<br />
			Before we go any further, we should make it clear that <strong>
			everyone speaks a dialect and everyone speaks with an accent</strong>, 
			no matter which language(s) they speak.<br />
			The fact that some dialects and ways of pronouncing a language are 
			considered in some cases to represent a standard form of the 
			language is an accident of history.&nbsp; The standard form is still 
			a dialect and an accent.</p>
			<p>Traditionally, a dialect is a variety of a language which differs 
			from other varieties in three ways: grammar, lexis and 
			pronunciation.<br />
			An accent, however, refers purely to differences in pronunciation.<br />
			So it is that we can talk about someone speaking English (or any 
			other language) with an accent which betrays their origin or, often, 
			their social class and ethnicity in some cases and we can talk of people using specific dialects 
			of the language(s) they speak.<br />
			In this section, we shall mostly be using English as a familiar 
			example, but the same considerations apply to almost any language 
			which has multiple thousands of speakers.</p>
			<p>When it comes to defining and describing the dialects of any 
			language, we encounter the usual problem of trying to draw lines on 
			a continuum: where are the boundaries?<br />
			For British English, for example, this map identifies some main 
			dialect and accent regions:<br />
					<img alt="accents" height="373" src="../imagesgraphics/accents_britain2.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>and most speakers of British English will be able to identify 
			where a speaker comes from very quickly, sometimes from a single 
			word.<br />
			It is less likely, however, that a speaker who uses a 
			non-British dialect of English, say a speaker of an American English 
			dialect, will be able to do so and British 
			speakers themselves are unlikely to be able to draw finer 
			distinctions between the range of accents and dialects which this 
			map does not show, if they are not members of the community which 
			uses the variety in question.&nbsp; Most English people will have 
			difficulty separating Highland from Lowland Scots and many speakers 
			of English from Ireland will be unable to identify the differences 
			between East and West Midland English speakers.<br />
			It is also possible, for example, clearly to distinguish between the 
			three main varieties of East Anglian (Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex) 
			but drawing lines between them on a map is impossible because they 
			merge imperceptibly into each other.<br />
			Speakers of English as a 
			second language may be able to detect differences in pronunciation 
			but identifying what they are and which region they are typical of 
			will probably be beyond all but the most advanced and sensitive of 
			them.<br />
			In sociolinguistics, this familiar problem is called the <strong>
			discreteness-continuity i</strong>ssue.</p>
			<p>The same issue applies to almost any other large language one 
			encounters.&nbsp; Traditionally, for example, German in Germany is 
			divided into three major dialects: Lower, spoken in the north, 
			Central, spoken across the central band of the country and Upper, 
			spoken south of that line.&nbsp; However, each of these gross 
			distinctions can be further divided into numerous subgroups (East Low German, Low Saxon, West Central, East 
			Central, North Upper German, West Upper German and East Upper 
			German) and each of those has been chopped up into finer and finer 
			distinctions which no map can adequately show because of the merging 
			and blurring of borders.<br />
			Italian, to take another example, is traditionally divided into around 14 recognisable 
			dialects (not all of which are spoken within the borders of Italy).</p>
			<p>However, there clearly are languages which we can describe and 
			identify as English or German (or any other) and for that we look to 
			the standard dialect which has, usually for historical reasons, 
			become accepted as the norm to which others may aspire and which is 
			the target of teaching and learning for non-native speakers.&nbsp; A 
			standard form, where such a thing exists, also acts as the base line 
			from which other dialects are said to diverge.</p>
			<p>Not all languages have a widely acceptable standard form to which 
			speakers look for 'correct' usage and pronunciation and that can be 
			a source of a good deal of disagreement and controversy (and 
			occasionally conflict).<br />
			French has a standard form, usually close to that spoken in 
			metropolitan areas and called variously <em>le français standard, le 
			français normé</em> or <em>le français neutre</em> and German 
			similarly has a standard form referred to as <em>Standardhochdeutsch, 
			Standarddeutsch, Hochdeutsch</em> or, in Switzerland, <em>
			Schriftdeutsch</em> (betraying in the last instance the idea that 
			the written form (<em>Schrift</em>) is a standard variety but spoken 
			forms will differ).<br />
			On what makes a dialect a standard form, see below under status.</p>

					<h2>A speech community</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Intuitively, we may define a speech community as a group of 
			people who share the same language but there is more to it than 
			that.</p>
			<p>At its broadest, we may, for example define as a speech community 
			all those who speak English as a first or second language.&nbsp; 
			This would imply a community of over two billion people.<br />
			At its narrowest, we can define a speech community as two people who 
			speak the same language and use and understand terms and vocabulary 
			unique to themselves.<br />
			Clearly there are many variations between these two extremes and 
			they will concern people who share:</p>
			<ul class="brownbulletlist">
				<li>the same first language<br />
				so we may consider all speakers of French, Japanese, Spanish, 
				English or German, for example, as members of the same 
				speech community.</li>
				<li>the same major dialect of a language<br />
				so we may consider all speakers of British English, American 
				English, Australian English, Swiss German, Austrian German, 
				Parisian French, Canadian French, European Spanish, Latin 
				American Spanish and so on as members of the same 
				speech communities.</li>
				<li>a regional dialect of a language<br />
				so we may assign everyone who speaks mid-western American 
				English, Bermudan English, Scottish Highland English, northern 
				British English, Singaporean English, Corsican Italian, Swiss 
				German, Latin-American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese and so on to membership of 
				the same speech community.</li>
				<li>a minor dialect of a language<br />
				so we may consider all speakers of East London English, 
				Bostonian English, Berlin German, Marseilles French and so on as 
				members of the same speech community.</li>
				<li>a non-native dialect of a language<br />
				a very large speech community is that formed by people who learn 
				and use English as a means of international communication or 
				because they live in a country where English is widely used as a 
				legislative or administrative language even though it may not be 
				a recognised official language.&nbsp; This group will also 
				include, for example, people working for major corporations who 
				use English as the in-company means of communication (a large 
				and expanding group).<br />
				So, we can assign anyone learning or using English as an 
				additional language as members of such a speech community (which 
				according to the British Council's estimate would be a community 
				of over 1.5 billion speakers).</li>
				<li>an ethnically identifiable variety of a language<br />
				so we may consider, for example, speakers of London black 
				English or New York Italian English as members of speech 
				communities.&nbsp; This is often a case of self-identification.&nbsp; 
				It is also the case that various dialects often associated with 
				certain ethnic groups are not only spoken by people in those 
				ethnic groups so, for example, the influence of black English 
				(itself a controversial term) is perceptible in other groups who 
				share cultural interests, particularly music.&nbsp; White 
				rappers, for example, often use black English.</li>
				<li>the same topic- or setting-dependent variety of a language<br />
				so we may consider all speakers of any language as it is used in 
				the banking industry, the game of football, the pastime of 
				fishing and so on to be members of a speech community.<br />
				In terms of setting, it has often been noted that people who 
				study or work within certain institutions collectively develop 
				and use a certain dialect with terms and ways of speaking which 
				are common internally but often inaccessible to outsiders.&nbsp; 
				Schools, and even year groups or classes within them often show 
				these distinctive dialects and other large institutions quickly 
				develop setting-specific, often short-hand, terms which are only 
				used in that setting.</li>
				<li>a personal and very specific use of a language<br />
				so we may decide that speakers of a language in the same family, 
				close-knit group of friends or school classmates are members of 
				a speech community.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Clearly, nearly everyone is a member of more than one speech 
			community.&nbsp; For example, someone who lives and was brought up 
			in the south of England may be a 
			member of at least the following speech communities:</p>
			<ul class="smallgreenbullet">
				<li>English speakers</li>
				<li>first-language English speakers</li>
				<li>British English speakers</li>
				<li>southern British English speakers</li>
				<li>London British speakers</li>
				<li>non-native speakers of German (or other languages)</li>
				<li>users of English in the field of English language teaching 
				(or other field of professional activity or leisure pursuit)</li>
				<li>a group of friends who enjoy playing a certain game</li>
				<li>a family of three who have mutually understandable terms for 
				various gadgets and devices unknown outside their home</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is extremely rare for any speaker of a language to be a member 
			of only one speech community.<br />
			You may like to pause here and draw up a list of the speech 
			communities to which you belong.</p>

			<p class="nomarginbottom">Learners of any language have an ambition 
			to join a speech community.&nbsp; The questions to answer are:</p>
			<p class="auto-style4">Membership of which speech community or 
			communities is an 
			appropriate target for them?<br />
			What form(s) of the language will be the most appropriate targets to 
			acquire in order to qualify for membership?</p>
			<p>The answer will depend on a number of considerations and we'll 
			exemplify them here.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The larger the speech community of which membership is the 
				target, the more generalised and less specific will be the 
				language needed to join it.<br />
				Learners who need to operate across a range of cultures 
				(English speaking or using English as a<em> lingua franca</em>) 
				will not be helped by being taught language forms which are 
				specific to any particular setting.<br />
				So such a learner needs a non-regional accent and non-regional 
				lexis and structure to be readily understood by and understand a 
				range of speakers of the language.<br />
				If, for example, a learner of English merely wishes to operate 
				reasonably well in the language and communicate fundamental, 
				non-specialised ideas to other users of the language (native 
				speaking or otherwise), an acceptable knowledge of the systems 
				of a standard form of English will be adequate.&nbsp; The more 
				regionally specific such a standard is, the less useful it will 
				be so the focus will be on an idealised non-regional form.</li>
				<li>The more specialised the field in which a speech community 
				operates, the more register-specific will be the language which 
				is used.<br />
				So, for example, if a learner wishes to become a member of a 
				speech community concerned with the study of astrophysics, 
				psycholinguistics or economics, the acquisition of register-specific lexis 
				and structures will be a priority.</li>
				<li>Learners who wish or need to integrate to any extent, 
				permanently or temporarily, into an English-speaking culture 
				will need to acquire the language specific to that culture.<br />
				So, for example, a learner who needs to live and operate 
				successfully in Australia will have very different needs from 
				one whose ambition is to be part of the culture of a Caribbean 
				island.</li>
				<li>Learners and users of the language as a tool for 
				communication in certain fields (industry- or company-wide for 
				example) will need to be members of an often entirely 
				non-native-speaking group of users of English and for this 
				purpose may not need to control the whole range of structure, 
				have a near-native pronunciation or use very much non-technical 
				language.<br />
				This is English as a <em>Lingua Franca</em> (ELF) or English as 
				an International Language (EIL) and the language used may be 
				severely restricted and almost, some say, pidginised.&nbsp; The 
				guide to varieties of English, linked below, has more on how 
				this variety works.</li>
				<li>Learners who have more than one aim for how they will use 
				the language, for example, as a student of an academic subject in 
				an English-speaking institution, as a member of the wider 
				student body with whom they are studying and as a resident of 
				the country or area in which they are studying have more complex 
				needs and may need to aspire to membership of multiple speech 
				communities.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are further obvious implications, of course, that concern 
			both the teachers' behaviours and the materials that are used.<br />
			If the models the teacher provides, either personally or <em>via</em> 
			the materials used in the classroom, are recognisably those of a 
			limited speech community (by region, class, ethnicity, nationality or field of 
			communication), then learners will be ill prepared to operate 
			successfully outside that community.<br />
			Depending on the learner's need for the language, that may not 
			matter but limiting input to language identifiably of one type of a 
			speech community only will be unhelpful if the speech community's 
			norms are mismatched by the settings in which the learner needs to 
			operate.<br />
			In other words, teaching American English to someone who needs to 
			operate in a British or South Asian community will be 
			counterproductive.</p>
			<p>Most English language teaching materials are produced in what Kachru 
			(1985) defined as an inner circle country.&nbsp; In this regard, 
			these may be limited to the UK, the USA, Canada, New Zealand, 
			Australia and Ireland and are overwhelmingly produced in the first 
			two of those nations.&nbsp; For more on Kachru's helpful analysis, 
			see the guide to variety, linked below.<br />
			The forms of the language that materials writers choose to present, 
			despite their best efforts to eradicate cultural influences, will 
			normally be identifiably of these speech communities.</p>

			<p>Above, we identified the fact that in many countries and language 
			areas (rarely the same thing) one particular dialect of a language 
			is often regarded as the norm from which other dialects differ.<br />
			In British English, this has emerged as the speech and language use of 
			educated southern English people in and around the London area.&nbsp; 
			It was not always so and other dialects of English have variously 
			gone in and out of fashion as providing the standard to which others 
			may, or may be forced, to aspire.<br />
			That this dialect became and remains to a large extent a standard 
			variety is an accident of history dependent on economic factors for 
			the most part but also influenced by the fact that London (and the 
			triangle based on it with its other corners marked by Oxford and 
			Cambridge) has long been the intellectual, commercial, governmental 
			and legislative centre of the country.</p>
			<p>The accent of the standard form of British English is sometimes 
			referred to as RP (Received Pronunciation) and is the pronunciation 
			which for many years was the required norm in public schools, 
			broadcasting organisations and similar settings.<br />
			For example, in southern British a word such as <em>heart</em> will 
			be pronounced as /hɑːt/ with no audible /r/ sound.&nbsp; However, 
			speakers of many regional accents in Britain and elsewhere retain 
			the /r/ sound in such words and they will pronounce the word as /hɑːrt/.&nbsp; 
			That will also, incidentally, be the standard pronunciation in most 
			of north America and in many other English-speaking regions.<br />
			Nowadays, handbooks of pronunciation, unless they are concerned to 
			describe regional differences in British or other Englishes, will 
			use the RP pronunciation of phonemes as the standard forms.&nbsp; 
			Thus, for example a word like <em>bath</em> is transcribed on this 
			site and elsewhere as /bɑːθ/ although very large numbers of people 
			in Britain and across north America with pronounce the word as /bæθ/.</p>
			<p>Along with RP, a standard dialect of English has also emerged 
			with a set of rules of usage which are familiar to most 
			learners and teachers of the language and often enshrined in school 
			textbooks and other reference texts.&nbsp; Dialect differences 
			abound, of course, but are usually described, as here, concerning 
			the ways in which they differ from a presumed standard so, for 
			example, the standard form of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was sitting by the window<br />
			</em>will be, often disparagingly, compared to the non-standard:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was sat by the window<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John needs his hair cut<br />
			</em>will be considered equally as an exception to the standard:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John needs his hair cutting</em></p>
			<p>Standard dialect and standard accent are, however, separable.&nbsp; 
			It is not necessary to speak standard English with an RP accent 
			(and, indeed, quite rarely done).&nbsp; Standard English is spoken 
			in many local and regional accents.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Because these two forms of the language have become standards, it 
			is to them that most learners of English will look for models.&nbsp; 
			Few learners, unless they are very young or very talented, or both, 
			will ever acquire an RP accent in English and most will never get 
			close.&nbsp; However, when the pronunciation of any word is in 
			question, it seems to make some sense to identify it using something 
			akin to an RP accent rather than a regional variety which may be 
			less frequently encountered and may even be seen as of lower status.<br />
			Teachers with particular strong regional accents should, therefore, 
			attempt to move towards RP rather than provide models which are 
			deviant from it.</p>
			<p>The same considerations apply to the grammar and lexicon of the 
			language.&nbsp; Although in many parts of Britain the term <em>nanny</em> 
			refers to a live-in, paid child carer, in many other parts of 
			Britain, the term refers to a grandmother.<br />
			An utterance such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happen he were late to the meeting<br />
			</em>which might be a natural form in the East Midlands and areas 
			further north and east exhibits both lexical and grammatical 
			deviance from standard English and may be translated as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps he was late to the meeting.</em></p>
			<p>Unless we are helping learners whose horizons are limited by 
			residence in particular parts of England and who will not need to 
			use their English in a standard written form or outside limited and 
			defined areas, teaching dialect forms such as these will not be very 
			helpful.</p>
			<p>In other words, to state the case rather too forcefully, whatever 
			variety of English teachers habitually use, they should teach and 
			present as models standard English forms only.<br />
			If that means losing a strong regional accent and learning to use a 
			standard dialect and pronunciation, well, then, it does.</p>

			<p>To start with, we need to get away from the idea that informal 
			speech is somehow less admirable than formal speech.&nbsp; All 
			varieties of all languages can be used in formal and informal ways.<br />
			It is not the case that the use of slang expressions, contractions 
			and other spoken simplifications are somehow indicative of 
			lower-class or uneducated speech.&nbsp; Even less is this an 
			indicator of lazy or incorrect use.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, there do exist social-class dialects in most 
			languages and these are, for native speakers, usually instantly 
			recognisable.&nbsp; In English, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was her what stole it</em><br />
			instead of<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was her who stole it</em><br />
			or even<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was she who stole it<br />
			</em>is, for most people, an indicator of social class differences, 
			the latter two being higher status than the first.<br />
			What we have identified here is known as a <strong>sociolect</strong>.<br />
			English is not alone, of course, in having forms of the language 
			which signal upper-, middle- or lower-class speech as we shall see.</p>
			<p>All societies are, to a greater or lesser extent, stratified.&nbsp; 
			That is the basis of social class analysis.<br />
			Even discussing social class raises some people's hackles and there 
			are as many ways to classify social class as, probably, the number 
			of people investigating the area.&nbsp; Usually, classes are 
			identified in socio-economic terms and that involves measuring, for 
			example, income levels, educational backgrounds, cultural 
			participation, occupations and so on.<br />
			Very loosely, most analyses of western societies divide classes 
			grossly into lower, middle and upper strata but those divisions are 
			also further subdivided into smaller units.<br />
			In other societies, class may be defined by caste, by birth or by 
			occupation very precisely.<br />
			As a working definition we may divide classes in most societies into 
			the traditional three groups and see what effects, if any, class 
			membership has on the types and forms of language that people use.&nbsp;

			<p>There is, naturally, no assertion here that all members of all 
			classes use language in the ways mapped out in this table.&nbsp; 
			After all, the ways one speaks are not written into law and there is 
			no reason why people cannot decide to take on a different dialect 
			and a different accent to suit themselves and their aspirations.<br />
			The point is, however, that this is the way to bet.</p>
			<p>Frequent large studies of the use of language analysed by social 
			class have detected significant differences between people's use of 
			language related to their social class.&nbsp; For example, in 
			English:</p>
			<ul class="brownbulletlist">
				<li>The use of double negatives as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want nothing</em><br />
				rather than the standard forms of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want anything<br />
				</em>or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want nothing</em><br />
				are much more frequent in lower-class speakers, rare in 
				middle-class speakers and unknown in upper-class speakers.</li>
				<li>The use of the non-standard form:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He were here</em><br />
				rather than:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was here</em><br />
				is much more frequent in lower-class speakers than those further 
				up the hierarchy and unknown in those at the top.</li>
				<li>The pronunciation of certain words varies with social class 
				so, for example, the word <em>pure</em> is often pronounced as /pjʊə/ 
				in upper class accents with an intrusive /j/ but as /pʊə/ in 
				middle-class accents and may be regionally influenced as /puːr/ 
				in lower-class accents.</li>
				<li>/h/ dropping increases from top to bottom of the hierarchy 
				so, for example a word such as <em>harvest</em> will more 
				frequently be rendered as /ˈhɑː.vɪst/ in middle- and upper-class 
				speakers but as /ˈɑː.vɪst/ or /ˈɑːr.vɪst/ in lower-class 
				speakers.</li>
				<li>The use of a glottal plosive (/ʔ/) instead of /t/ is much 
				more frequent in middle-and lower-class accents than in 
				upper-class accents so, for example, <em>better</em> may be 
				pronounced as /ˈbe.tə/ among upper-and upper-middle-class 
				speakers but as /ˈbe.ʔə/ among speakers in lower-middle or 
				lower-class groups.</li>
				<li>/ŋ/ to/n/ conversion, as in the pronunciation of <em>walking</em> 
				as /ˈwɔːk.ɪn/ <em>vs</em>. /ˈwɔːk.ɪŋ/ is slightly anomalous.&nbsp; 
				It is frequent in lower-class accents, less so in middle-class 
				accents and emerges again in upper-class accents.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This list could be greatly extended and will vary, except for 
			upper-class accents, depending on regional differences.&nbsp; The 
			general rule is, however, plain: the lower down the social ladder 
			people are, the more likely they are to use regionally affected 
			accents and non-standard grammatical and lexical forms.</p>
			<p>It has been noted in many studies, incidentally, that women are 
			much less likely to use regional dialect forms than men.<br />
			For a little more on why this may be, see the guide to Sex, below.</p>
			<p>We have chosen examples here of the use of English because that 
			is this site's main concern but other language and speech 
			communities will exhibit similar phenomena (although the details 
			will vary, of course).<br />
			In languages such as Japanese, which 
			have complex honorific structures, differences in address patterns 
			will be instantly recognisable and based on perceived status and 
			power differentials.&nbsp; In that language, differences in how a 
			person is referred to or addressed will vary from adults of equal 
			status, people of higher status (including customers), people of 
			junior status, small children, senior colleagues or authority 
			figures such as teachers, doctors and lawyers and so on.<br />
			In other languages, such as Tamil and other Indian languages which 
			developed in a society divided into various castes, there may be 
			differences in the pronoun system and in the forms of the language 
			used between and among people of different castes.&nbsp; Tamil, for 
			example, has very different variants and forms will vary depending 
			on whether the language is being used formally, informally or 
			officially and much of that depends on real or perceived class 
			differences.<br />
			In European languages, similar class-based differences are 
			discernible with a tendency, for example, in French for upper-class 
			speakers to prefer the <em>vous</em>-form over <em>tu-</em>forms 
			more frequently than those in lower classes, even among close 
			friends and relations.&nbsp; In German, there are noticeable class 
			differences in the use of certain case forms for some prepositions 
			and the list could go on.<br />
			The fact that class-based variation exists in English will not, 
			therefore, come a surprise to most learners of English.</p>

			</table>
			<p>It may not be surprising to most learners that class-based differences 
			in language use exist but recognising them will be very challenging.&nbsp; 
			Native speakers of all languages can make quite accurate decisions 
			concerning people's class and background from the way they speak and 
			can often assign people to certain classes and occupational types 
			based on very little linguistic information.&nbsp; From that 
			information, they can adjust their own speech and the topics they 
			choose to discuss to match the perceived status, backgrounds and 
			interests of others around them.&nbsp; They may even feign 
			membership of classes other than their own by a deliberate (or 
			semi-conscious) variation in how they speak to others.<br />
			Many native speakers can also switch codes easily and use, for 
			example, a local accent and dialect in some social settings (in 
			order to emphasise that they belong to a speech community) and avoid 
			such uses in other, usually more formal, settings in which the use 
			of something approximating to standard dialect forms and 
			pronunciation is valued.<br />
			Non-native speakers, even advanced users of a second language, have 
			no such skills for the most part and will depend less on how 
			something is said because they are focusing on what is said.&nbsp; 
			They will usually be wholly unable to switch codes, having learnt 
			only one dialect and one accent.<br />
			In other words, subtle and often unconscious decisions about others 
			based on how they use language cannot be transferred to a second 
			language because the signals are completely different.<br />
			If we wish, therefore, to equip learners with some even very basic 
			sociolinguistic skills, the area has to be taught.</p>
			<p>A more contentious implication concerns the materials which 
			teachers use 
			in classrooms and the signals they send.&nbsp; Coursebook and 
			materials writers are usually concerned to present language which 
			is:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style21">
				<li>a standard variety which has wide acceptance in 
				English-speaking societies worldwide.&nbsp; This usually means 
				either standard American or standard British English.<br />
				In some circumstances, e.g., in the design of materials for 
				teaching immigrant populations, other regional variations may be 
				the targets but the focus will still be on the most widely 
				accepted 'correct' usage.</li>
				<li>presented in a recognisable and authentic social setting.&nbsp; 
				This may mean considering a wide range of roles and occupations 
				for characters in narratives and dialogues making sure that 
				overt class, sex, ethnic or religious bias is minimised.&nbsp; 
				Most modern materials are carefully scrutinised for implicit 
				biases of this sort.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Unfortunately, a. and b. may not be compatible aims.<br />
			If a materials writer presents language spoken by people in the 
			target-language culture from a range of occupational, educational, 
			and social backgrounds, then those depicted as being from lower 
			classes will not authentically be using a standard form or dialect.&nbsp; 
			Survey after survey and investigation after investigation have shown 
			that people from lower social classes will almost always be using 
			non-standard dialect forms and non-standard pronunciation.&nbsp; Any 
			hoped-for authenticity in teaching materials is fundamentally 
			undermined, therefore, if such people are depicted or heard using 
			high-status, standard language forms.<br />
			Published materials will, consequently, either be:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style21">
				<li>inauthentically depicting lower-class workers and families 
				or upper- and middle-class people using the 'wrong' dialect and 
				accent<br />
				or</li>
				<li>presenting authentic language which is unacceptable as a 
				model because it is too divergent from a standard form of the 
				language and provides a non-portable example of the language 
				most learners are concerned to learn.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Some attempts in some materials have been made to square the 
			circle and provide examples of people using a range of regional or 
			national varieties but the accents used in these cases will not 
			usually be particularly strong (and are sometimes fake) with few 
			deviations from the standard which most learners will be indifferent 
			to even if they can discern them.<br />
			Language which deviates from accepted structural norms will very 
			rarely appear and dialect words which have little range socially or 
			geographically will also be avoided.</p>
			<p>This contradiction may not matter too much and is certainly 
			irrelevant for those learners who are unlikely ever to encounter 
			people speaking non-standard forms of the language in a 
			native-speaker environment but for other learners who may wish to 
			travel widely in a native-speaking country and may work with people 
			who speak with a genuinely regional or class accent it is important.&nbsp; 
			When they encounter, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It were him what said it<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We was having dinner with me mam's friends<br />
			</em>it will be somewhat easier for them to follow a conversation if 
			they have been alerted to possible variations in dialect and accent.<br />
			If published course and supplementary materials do not, for 
			commercial if no other reasons, provide this exposure, it devolves 
			on teachers to fill the gap.</p>

			<p>Language, nationality and ethnicity are independent concepts.&nbsp; 
			No person's ethnicity or nationality determines the language they 
			speak and no person's language assigns them to an ethnic group or a 
			nationality.<br />
			It is, for example, not a safe bet to assume that someone born in 
			Argentina speaks Spanish or someone who speaks Spanish as a first 
			language was born in Spain.<br />
			It is, accordingly, nonsense to refer to Germans as if this is the 
			same as German speakers or to Dutch speakers as if they all come 
			from The Netherlands.<br />
			All that said, there are, of course, <strong>connections</strong> 
			between nationality, ethnicity and language but they are 
			connections, not determining factors.</p>
			<p>We noted above that there are no identifiable wholly monoglot 
			nations on earth and even very small nations often have separate 
			speech communities within their borders.&nbsp; The same is, of 
			course, true of ethnic groupings.&nbsp; Some ethnic groupings are 
			very large, straddling national borders and occupying large areas of 
			the earth's surface; others are small and constitute only a part of 
			other nations.<br />
			Ethnic groupings are also blurred at the edges and it is almost 
			impossible to define, for example, what exactly constitutes vague  
			groupings such as Indian British or New York Jewish.&nbsp; Almost any 
			individual one tries to place in a grouping like that is likely to 
			exhibit characteristics which do not fit the stereotype.<br />
			However, for the purposes of sociolinguistic analysis, it sometimes 
			makes sense to operate with vague terms like these to see if there 
			are identifiable language-use characteristics which can be assigned 
			to the influence of ethnicity or nationality.</p>

			<p>In the USA, around 430 languages are spoken (many indigenous) and 
			in the UK, around 300 languages are spoken.&nbsp; Other countries 
			around the world exhibit similar (if not such extreme) 
			characteristics.&nbsp; Germany, for example, is home to at least 
			twelve indigenous languages and another 20 or so are widely spoken 
			by immigrant populations.&nbsp; France is also home to over 20 
			indigenous languages and has significant populations of immigrants 
			speaking a further dozen or so.<br />
			On the other hand, English is spoken as an official language or widely 
			understood and used in over 50 countries around the 
			world, Spanish is an official language in 20 countries and a 
			significant language in another handful and French is spoken in both 
			American continents, throughout western, central and northern Africa 
			as well as in Indo-China and elsewhere in Europe (including, of 
			course, significant dialects in Belgium and Switzerland).&nbsp; 
			Arabic is an official language in 26 countries and a recognised one 
			in many more (although the dialects of the spoken language are not 
			always mutually comprehensible).&nbsp; Other major languages show 
			similar spread although Japanese is nearly confined to the nation of 
			Japan, within which there are, incidentally, a wide range of 
			regional dialects, some so different from standard Japanese that 
			they are barely comprehensible to speakers of other Japonic 
			languages and dialects.<br />
			Russia has around two dozen indigenous languages and Russian 
			speakers also form large minorities in at least a dozen other 
			countries.<br />
			Greek speakers often refer to anyone whose first language is Greek 
			as Greek by nationality although the reality may be very different.&nbsp; 
			Greek itself may be divided into nine major dialects and Greece is 
			also home to speakers of around 10 other languages.<br />
			Even Australia, a notoriously monoglot country, contains significant 
			minorities of speakers of ten other languages and at least 15 
			indigenous languages are still spoken (down from 400).<br />
			Chinese is a catchall term for a group of at least a dozen mutually 
			incomprehensible languages (in their spoken form) and other large 
			languages such as Malay are also better defined as macro-languages 
			containing many mutually incomprehensible dialects.<br />
			This list could be greatly extended.<br />
			It is not, therefore, sensible ever to equate someone's nationality 
			with the language they speak.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, in most of these countries, there is a clear 
			tendency for the major languages to be spoken by almost everyone 
			with other languages often referred to as additional or minority 
			languages.&nbsp; In the UK, for example, over 98% of people speak 
			English but that figure is only 75% for the USA.</p>

					<h3>Ethnicity</h3>

			</table>
			<p>In sociolinguistic terms, ethnicity is usually considered in the 
			ways it affects the dialects or accents of a major language so, for 
			example, in Britain, studies have been made of what is very loosely 
			termed black English.&nbsp; In fact, of the roughly 3% of British 
			people who self-define as black, origins are variable and concern 
			for example, immigrants or their descendants from the Caribbean, 
			Africa, and southern Asia.<br />
			At one time, it was felt that black British could be precisely 
			identified from its pronunciation, lexicon and grammar.&nbsp; Many 
			aspects of the dialect are clearly influenced by Jamaican English 
			and other forms of English spoken around the world but some are 
			unique to the dialect.&nbsp; As is the way of things, the dialect, 
			now called Multi-Ethnic English, is spoken by people from a variety 
			of ethnic backgrounds most of whom reside in London.<br />
			The dialect is recognisable phonemically with many changes to 
			standard English (RP) pronunciations of, for example, vowels and /h/ 
			dropping as well as differences in the pronunciation of some 
			consonants.<br />
			It is also recognisable from having taken on some aspects of London 
			English, including but not limited to using, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We was coming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He were here earlier</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Lexically, there are many differences with over 25 identifiable 
			adjectives not found in standard English including <em>greezy</em> (<em>bad</em>),
			<em>hench</em> (<em>strong, fit</em>) and <em>deep</em> (<em>unfortunate</em> 
			or <em>serious</em>).&nbsp; There are also many nouns which are 
			unique to the dialect including <em>blem</em> (<em>cigarette</em>),
			<em>ends</em> (<em>neighbourhood</em>) and <em>yard</em> (<em>house</em> 
			or <em>dwelling</em>).&nbsp; Verbs, too, have been identified and 
			they include <em>pree</em> (<em>stare</em>), <em>gas</em> (<em>lie</em>) 
			and <em>jack</em> (<em>steal</em>).<br />
			Even pronouns differ so we find <em>man</em> (first or second&nbsp; 
			person), <em>dem man</em> (<em>they</em>) and <em>us man</em> (<em>we</em>).</p>
			<p>Other examples of ethnically influenced dialects of standard 
			forms of languages exist around the world so the French spoken in 
			some parts of southern France in areas of high rates of immigration 
			from Africa is strongly influenced by African languages and in the 
			USA there are identifiable dialects within dialects spoken by people 
			from a range of ethnic backgrounds including Jews, Italians, Latin 
			Americans, Germans 
			and Scandinavians.</p>

			<p>The implications for the classroom are as for the considerations 
			of social-class accents and dialects (see above) and include the 
			need to be aware of the range of differences as well as to avoid 
			assuming that everyone in a particular country speaks the same kind 
			of language or even the same language as everyone else.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, we need to get away from assuming that learners' 
			nationalities will reliably tell us about the language they speak.&nbsp; 
			That may be the way to bet, of course, but not all bets win.</p>
			<p>Whether learners of English need to be exposed to or made aware 
			of the variations in dialect and accent which are influenced by 
			ethnicity is somewhat controversial.<br />
			Undoubtedly, for certain groups, for example learners who are 
			immigrants in the areas of a country where there are strong 
			ethnically-based dialects and accents, an understanding of the 
			varieties is quite important.&nbsp; For others, whose contact with 
			such varieties is likely to be very minimal or wholly absent, no 
			such considerations apply.<br />
			As usual, it is the learners' needs which constitute the defining 
			variable.</p>

					<h2>Register</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Language does not vary on purely personal grounds concerning 
			where people have been brought up, how they have been educated, 
			where they live, what their ethnic background is and 
			to which social class they belong.&nbsp; It also varies in terms of 
			the contexts in which it is used.<br />
			Here, we shall not be using the tern <strong>register</strong> as a 
			sloppy synonym for<strong> style</strong>.&nbsp; Style concerns 
			levels of formality and, while it is clear that certain social 
			settings often require certain levels of formality to be maintained 
			and others allow very informal language use, these are not the 
			defining characteristics.&nbsp; What defines the language use in 
			terms of social setting is register.<br />
			Here are some examples of the registers which may affect, in 
			particular, lexical choices and grammatical structures, notably the 
			former:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Legal register</dt>
				<dd>will often use terms which are not easily understood by 
				people outside the speech community such as <em>mens rea, tort</em> 
				or <em>habeas corpus</em>.&nbsp; Such terms are often derived 
				from Latin but other terms such as <em>occupier, assault, 
				causation</em> and so on are defined very precisely in ways that 
				non-members of the speech community would not immediately recognise.<br />
				Legal register will also affect grammatical choices with a 
				general avoidance of the use of the first person and quite 
				complex nominalisation in, for example, contractual agreements.&nbsp; 
				The use of cohesive markers such as <em>hereinafter, heretofore, 
				notwithstanding</em> and so on are also common.</dd>
				<dt>Medical register</dt>
				<dd>is, in many ways similar, with thousands of terms barely or 
				not understood by non-professionals.&nbsp; Indeed, medical 
				practitioners sometimes receive targeted training in translating 
				medical register into language comprehensible to their patients.<br />
				The use of certain formulaic grammatical structures is also 
				noticeable such as <em>The patient presented with ...</em> and 
				so on.</dd>
				<dt>Academic fields</dt>
				<dd>all exhibit specific uses of lexemes which are often unknown 
				or very differently defined outside the field.&nbsp; A 
				non-specialist would be very challenged, for example, if asked 
				to participate in a conference of specialists in most academic 
				environments.<br />
				Indeed, the distinction between popular-science publications and 
				texts written for fellow specialists often lies in the need to 
				define and even avoid terms rather than in the assumption that 
				the reader will already share register-specific knowledge.<br />
				(<em>On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres</em>, by 
				Nicolaus Copernicus (1473 – 1543) has the forbidding inscription 
				"For mathematicians only".)</dd>
				<dt>English Language 
				Teaching register</dt>
				<dd>is, as a cursory glance at the guides on this site reveals, 
				replete with terms used technically rather in their everyday 
				meanings such as <em>use, usage, function, structure, reference, 
				tense, aspect </em>and so on.&nbsp; There are also many terms 
				which occur not at all or very rarely outside the register such 
				as <em>deixis, noncompositionality, idiomaticity, interlanguage</em> 
				etc.<br />
				In common with other humanity subjects, too, speaking and 
				writing in the field often requires slightly unusual (for some) 
				uses of modal expressions, hedging and reporting verbs.</dd>
				<dt>Games and sports</dt>
				<dd>are notorious for having words and structures unknown 
				outside the field of interest so, for example, the distinctions 
				between <em>court, field, pitch</em> and <em>ground</em> are 
				subtle and professionals will often use terms which even 
				enthusiasts in the areas will not immediately recognise or use.<br />
				The use of the present simple in sports commentaries is also 
				indicative of a register-specific use of tense and aspect.</dd>
				<dt>Institutional settings</dt>
				<dd>often exhibit certain language forms, particular in lexis, 
				which are not in widespread, or any, use outside that setting.&nbsp; 
				For example, in certain schools, and even year groups or classes 
				within a school, a set of often short-hand terms has developed 
				which are only used in that setting by the people affiliated 
				with the institution or a specific part of it.&nbsp; The same 
				considerations apply to colleges, universities, departments 
				within them and other educational settings.<br />
				Companies and other commercial or non-commercial organisations 
				also exhibit a parallel phenomenon so the use of language within 
				even quite small organisations is often, at least to some 
				extent, unique to that setting.&nbsp; Anyone who has joined a 
				large organisation and been forced very rapidly to come to terms 
				with internal jargon, often acronyms or initialisms, has 
				experienced the need to acquire a setting-specific register.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>This list could go on for some time because there is almost no 
			limit to the number of registers which we can identify as having 
			particular lexicons and structural uses.</p>

			<p>Implications are obvious because of the range of language that 
			its use in specific registers may influence.<br />
			In general terms, register affects:</p>
		<ul class="greenbullet">
			<li>Choice of lexis:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			porthole, forward, starboard </em>(seafaring register) vs. <em>
			window, front, right<br />
			</em>So it is important in the teaching of English for Occupational 
			Purposes, in particular.<br />
			The design and delivery of in-house company language programmes also 
			need to consider whether the teaching of setting-specific lexis is 
			required or desirable.</li>
			<li>Collocation:<br />
			Certain combinations of words are more likely to occur with certain 
			registers.&nbsp; For example, the word <em>grow</em> is often used 
			in business registers to mean <em>make larger</em>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grow the market</em><br />
			but in other registers, such as gardening, the verb simply means <em>
			cultivate</em>.<br />
			In unspecific contexts, the verb is intransitive and means <em>get 
			larger</em>.<br />
			Particular collocations, common in certain registers are frequently 
			unknown or will sound very unnatural in other contexts.<br />
			Teaching them and raising awareness of their limitation and 
			specificity is important.</li>
			<li>Choice of grammatical structure: e.g., use of the passive in 
			formal / academic / technical writing and speaking, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The data were analysed vs. We analysed the data<br />
			</em>modality in academic texts, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It may be seen that ... vs. We can imagine that ...</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			So, a focus on the most frequently used constructions is necessary.<br />
			In this regard, there are clear distinctions between the uses of 
			modality in science disciplines and those used in the humanities 
			(with a good deal of cross over).</li>
			<li>Cohesive devices and discourse markers:<br />
			theme-rheme structures in some kinds of 
			writing on certain topics are often marked by the use of rarer conjuncts 
			such as <em>It follows that, ...</em>, <em>Accordingly, ... </em>
			etc.<br />
			deixis and the use of <em>in that place</em> <em>vs</em>., e.g., <em>there</em> 
			etc.<br />
			In terms of discourse marking, within some registers, how speakers 
			manage interactions and exchanges is also register specific with 
			certain types such as<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please feel free to ask questions as we 
			go along<br />
			</em>only occurring in certain registers.<br />
			Teaching these formulaic expressions as learnable chunks for 
			learners of, e.g., English for Academic Purposes, pays dividends.</li>
			<li>Skills deployment:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reading intensively for academic 
			purposes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scanning newspaper articles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; following instructions such 
			as recipes and users' guides etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; writing using appropriate 
			terminology and structures<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; listening for / using register-specific 
			terms<br />
			etc.<br />
			are all areas which need addressing, and, indeed, may form 
			substantial parts of a syllabus in addressing learners' needs to 
			operate in certain registers.<p><a href="#top" style="color:#ff3300">-top-</a></p>

			<p>There are, as Hymes (in Pride and Holmes, 1971:278) pointed out,
			<span class="style_black"><em>rules of use without which the rules

			Unfortunately, the rules, such as they are, are culturally variable 
			and operate differently across languages and dialects of languages.<br />
			This is a huge research field which is frequently revisited so we 
			can only scratch the surface here.&nbsp; Some examples will have to 
			suffice concerning the ways that cultures and other social factors 
			affect the rules of use.&nbsp; Some of these are trivial issues, 
			taught in seconds, but others are subtle and very complex.<br />
			For more, see the guides listed below.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>turn-taking</strong></dt>
				<dd>In many Anglophone countries it is conventional not to 
				interrupt a turn but to wait for a signal that the speaker is 
				giving up a turn or for a suitable point in the exchange, often 
				called a transition-relevance point which allows one participant 
				to take over or start a new turn.<br />
				In other cultures, however, interruption is seen as a normal 
				part of any interaction and will not be viewed as discourteous 
				or unconventional.<br />
				There is evidence that within Anglophone cultures, silence on 
				behalf of a participant in a conversation signals the need for 
				someone else to take a turn and is not tolerated for long.&nbsp; 
				In other cultures, such as those containing speakers of North 
				American Athabaskan or Dene speakers (which includes, e.g., 
				Navajo) silence betokens no such thing and speakers of these 
				languages remain silent without this causing any feelings of 
				discomfort.<br />
				Encounters between English speakers and Athabaskan speakers may 
				result, as Trudgill (2000:132) has suggested in<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athabaskans ... thinking that 
				English speakers are rude, dominating, superior, smug and self-centred<br />
				</span></em>and English speakers finding<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athabaskans 
				rude, superior, surly, taciturn and withdrawn</em></span><br />
				Applying the rules of one's own culture when speaking a 
				different language, especially to a native speaker, or to people 
				who speak a different dialect of the same language is, 
				therefore, fraught with danger.<br />
				In some dialects of English, notably, for example, New York 
				Jewish, continuous interruption is considered a sign of interest 
				being maintained and not at all discourteous.</dd>
				<dt><strong>back-channelling</strong></dt>
				<dd>In many cultures, it is considered unusual if listeners do 
				not, from time to time, signal the fact that they are listening 
				and understanding by providing audible or visible signals to 
				that effect.<br />
				In others, however, back-channelling noises and interjections are interpretable as 
				interruptions and frowned upon.&nbsp; In these cultures, notable 
				in east and south-east Asia, listening in silence is considered 
				polite and deferential.<br />
				Silence in those cultures which rely on back-channelling will 
				soon make a speaker feel uncomfortable.</dd>
				<dt><strong>expressing opinion</strong></dt>
				<dd>In many cultures, one is free to express an opinion in many 
				circumstances and nobody will consider doing so a sign of 
				arrogance or lack of respect.<br />
				In others, personal opinion statements are handled with much 
				greater care and often couched in non-personal terms so, instead 
				of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this is a poor idea<br />
				</em>speakers will prefer something like<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are those who may not like this 
				idea.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>answering the telephone</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is a trivial issue but indicative of cultural 
				differences and the dangers of ignoring them.<br />
				In many cultures, it is possible to have an exchange such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, can I speak to Mary?</em><br />
				but in others, such as Francophone and German-speaking cultures, 
				that would be wildly unconventional and the conversation would 
				normally proceed as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that 66655789?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Annie.&nbsp; I'm sorry to disturb you.&nbsp; Is Mary 
				there?</em><br />
				which is far more deferential.<br />
				In Anglophone cultures, in other words, there is no obligation 
				to identify oneself unless the need arises so the first 
				conversation may continue:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I'm afraid she's out.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, could you tell her than Annie called, please?<br />
				</em>In almost all cultures, incidentally, children are 
				deliberately taught conventional ways of starting telephone 
				conversations and the training embeds the behaviour very firmly.</dd>
				<dt><strong>apologising</strong></dt>
				<dd>Anglophone cultures are notorious for the ways in which 
				speakers apologise when there is no need to, so for example, we 
				may encounter:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry.&nbsp; Can you tell me which 
				bus goes to Sloane Square?<br />
				</em>or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, can I get through here, please?<br />
				</em>Such conversations would sound very odd in most other 
				languages and most other dialects.<br />
				This is, of course, a teachable area but routines like this are 
				learned at a very early age and overcoming a tendency not to 
				apologise in another language or to apologise when speaking 
				English takes a real effort of will.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Gricean maxims</strong></dt>
				<dd>The four maxims identified by Grice (1989) are<ol>
					<li>Quality<br />
					Do not say something for which you have no evidence<br />
					Do not say something which you know to be false</li>
					<li>Quantity<br />
					Be informative enough but do not over inform</li>
					<li>Relation<br />
					Maintain relevance</li>
					<li>Manner<br />
					Avoid obscurity and ambiguity<br />
					Be orderly and brief</li>
				</ol>and breaking any of the maxims is seen as a sign of some 
				deliberate marking or emphasis so, for example, saying<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm getting rather tired</em><br />
				is, on the face of things, over informing, but signals that the 
				illocutionary force of what is being said does not refer just to 
				tiredness but signals a request to stop.<br />
				Equally, breaking into a conversation about organising a party 
				with something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, have you seen Fred recently?<br />
				</em>may seem to be breaking the maxim of relation but signals 
				some important relevance for the speaker that the listener needs 
				to note.<br />
				However, such maxims are based on English speakers and it would 
				be perilous to assume either that they are applicable to all 
				languages, cultures, nationalities and ethnic groups or that the 
				breaking of a maxim will always be a signal of some form of 
				communicative marking.</dd>
				<dt><strong>restricted and elaborated codes</strong></dt>
				<dd>The concept of restricted and elaborated codes we owe to 
				Bernstein (1971).&nbsp; He identified two varieties of language 
				available to its speakers:<ol>
					<li>Elaborated code is used most frequently in formal 
					situations and contains:<ol class="auto-style21">
						<li>a high proportion of subordinate clauses, using, for 
						example, conjunctions such as <em>although, so, because, 
						in order to</em> and conjuncts such as <em>accordingly, 
						subsequently, therefore</em> etc.<br />
						The use of such devices is generally terms hypotaxis 
						(from the Greek meaning to arrange below).</li>
						<li>passive verb clauses using, for example:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was arrested<br />
						</em>instead of<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police took her away</em></li>
						<li>longer and more unusual adjective phrases such as
						<em>the ancient, British people</em>, <em>a difficult 
						but important issue</em> etc.</li>
						<li>less common adverbs, adverb phrases and adverbials 
						such as <em>regrettably, to my astonishment, not wholly 
						surprisingly, without much difficulty</em> etc.</li>
						<li>the use of abstract nominalisation such as <em>
						creation, emergency, issues, calculations</em> 
						and so on.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Restricted code is used in less formal settings and is 
					characterised by:<ol class="auto-style21">
						<li>The use of simpler, and often repeated coordinating 
						rather than subordinating conjunctions such as <em>and, 
						then, but </em>etc and conjuncts such as <em>first, 
						next, later</em> etc.<br />
						This is often referred to as the use of parataxis (from 
						the Greek meaning to arrange side by side).</li>
						<li>The avoidance of passive structures and a consequent 
						increase in the use of subject pronouns such as <em>he, 
						she, they</em> etc.</li>
						<li>The use of tag questions to elicit agreement such as
						<em>wouldn't they?, didn't we?</em> etc.</li>
						<li>Simple adjectives and the avoidance of long 
						adjective phrases so we find more occurrences of, e.g.,
						<em>nice, lovely, pretty, good, bad</em> etc. rather 
						than <em>pleasing, beautiful, stunning, acceptable, 
						disrespectful</em> etc.</li>
						<li>the use of a greater number of concrete 
						nominalisations such as <em>road, car, house, room </em>
						etc.</li>

				</ol>More controversially, Bernstein and others have proposed 
				that the ability to use either code depending on the appropriacy 
				of the setting and the needs of the moment is restricted to 
				middle-class children whereas working-class children are 
				confined in general to the use of restricted code and are 
				therefore educationally and career-wise disadvantaged because 
				elaborated code structures and lexis are required to encode 
				complex relationships.&nbsp; In that view, working-class 
				children suffer from cognitive deficiency because they are 
				unable to think about more abstract and difficult ideas.<br />
				This is a view most strongly held by those who believe that 
				thought is dependent on language but on that hypothesis, the 
				jury is still considering its verdict.<br />
				There is a guide to language and thought, linked below.<br />
				There are two competing views of the way in which the use or 
				non-use of restricted and elaborated codes affects educational 
				outcomes:<ol class="auto-style21">
						<li>Elaborated code is an 
						essential requirement of the educational process which 
						is concerned with the ability to express universal 
						meanings and abstract concepts.&nbsp; So, non-access to 
						elaborated code means:<ol class="auto-style143">
							<li>cognitive deficiency</li>
							<li>inability to handle abstract thought and 
							universalistic concepts</li>
							<li>these students fail more often</li>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li>The use of elaborated code is simply social 
						convention which is conventionally required in 
						educational settings which means that<ol class="auto-style143">
							<li>teachers consider elaborated code appropriate</li>
							<li>students who don’t / can’t use elaborated code 
							are discriminated against by teachers</li>
							<li>these students fail more often</li>
						</ol>This is
						the view held by, e.g., Labov, who presented 
				evidence that even in restricted code the encoding of complex 
				and subtle ideas is perfectly possible, indeed, routinely 
				achieved and no cognitive deficiency can be identified.&nbsp; In 
				this view, elaborated code use  
				has nothing to do with restrictions in cognitive abilities.</li>
					</ol>
				It will not have escaped your notice the the characteristics of 
				restricted code are often noticeable in the speech of learners 
				of English.</dd>

			<p>The list above is enough, hopefully, to alert you to the fact 
			that the conventions of social interactions and settings vary across 
			languages, dialects, cultures and ethnic groups.&nbsp; This means:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>setting language in authentic contexts involves paying 
				attention to issues of culture, class and dialect</li>
				<li>matching language use to communicative intention is not a 
				simple matter and requires sensitivity to sociolinguistic 
				factors</li>
				<li>selecting language forms and appropriate communicative acts 
				needs to take into account the possible settings in which 
				learners need to operate</li>

			<p>In some languages, but not English, men and women use different 
			dialects.&nbsp; In extreme cases, this may affect more than just 
			pronunciation, which is often quite variable in all languages.<br />
			In Thai, for example, the first person pronoun, <em>I</em>, is 
			different for men and women so a man refers to himself as <em>phom</em> 
			and a woman as <em>dichan</em>.<br />
			Other differences have been noted by comparative linguists but they 
			usually concern small and somewhat unusual languages.<br />
			However, we noted above, when discussing regional and class accents, 
			women are substantially less likely to use dialect forms which 
			depend on region or social class, or a combination of those factors.&nbsp; 
			Trudgill sums up the situation like this:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">In all cases so far examined, it has been 
			shown that, allowing for other factors such as social class, 
			ethnic group and age, women consistently use forms which more 
			closely approach the standard variety or the prestige accent than 
			those used by men.</p>
			<p>He backs this up with figures from studies carried out in the USA 
			showing that, for example, the use of a double negative such as
			<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have none</em><br />
			is used by 90.1% of lower-working-class men but by only 58.9%v of 
			women from the same group.<br />
			Nobody really knows why this is the case but there are some 
			interesting and persuasive hypotheses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Women are more status-conscious than men and are thus make 
				an effort, especially when speaking to strangers, to use a 
				higher-prestige dialect and accent.</li>
				<li>Women are more sensitive to dialect and accent than men and 
				more able to switch easily between codes, as they might when 
				taking part in a survey of dialects and accents.</li>
				<li>Working-class speech has connotations of masculinity and 
				toughness to which men aspire more than women and so they are 
				more likely to use the forms.</li>
				<li>Men are more inclined to associate themselves with others of 
				their class and may show a greater tendency to use dialect forms 
				and a non-standard accent to show their class solidarity.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The assumption is that in societies in which sex roles are very 
			clearly demarcated, the tendency for men and women to use different 
			dialects and accents will be stronger than in societies where roles 
			are more fluid and less rigidly assigned.</p>

			<p>Because most Anglophone cultures are <strong>relatively</strong> 
			less strict in assigning social role to sex, the case in English is 
			just one of general tendencies and certainly not something from 
			which one can extract a rule.&nbsp; However, one implication is that 
			if we wish to demonstrate a strong regional accent or dialect, we 
			are probably better off choosing to do so in the speech of working 
			class men than women.&nbsp; Conversely, if we wish authentically to 
			present examples of high-class prestige varieties, we are probably 
			better advised to use the speech of women than men.<br />
