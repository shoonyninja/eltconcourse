			<p>The restrictions on movement and gatherings currently in place 
			around the world mean that face-to-face teaching is not an option 
			and may not be one for a considerable time.<br />
			Teachers worldwide are, therefore, switching to online 
			classrooms.<br />
			Here's some advice about how to do that and how to exploit the 
			materials on this site to help you.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="need" height="166" src="../images/laptop_notebook_pen250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>What you need</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Much will depend on the sort of course you are running and the 
			kind of teaching or training you are doing but here's the rundown of 
			what you really must have before you can begin.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tableblueborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style29" colspan="2">Hardware</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style43">Laptop or desktop<br />
					<img alt="laptop" height="133" src="../images/laptop_ideas200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style42">You can try using a smartphone to 
					run an online classroom but you'd be well advised not to.&nbsp; 
					They are not designed for that kind of continuous use and, 
					while they are pretty smart these days, you'll find the 
					screen size and typing uncomfortable.<br  />
					Your learners may think they can use a smartphone to 
					participate in the sessions but they, too, will find that 
					working on a proper computer with a larger screen and 
					accessible keyboard is what they need.<br  />
					Now is not a time to be cutting corners.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style43">Video equipment<br />
					<img alt="webcam" height="133" src="../images/webcam200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style42">You can use the camera which comes 
					integrated into most computers and monitors or you 
					can invest in a separate camera for better quality.<br  />
					In fact, you do not need very high quality video and may 
					find that a camera capable of producing high definition 
					video will put an unacceptable strain on your broadband 
					connection.<br  />
					If you have such a camera, you may be able to adjust the 
					quality to make sure you can stream the video 
					satisfactorily.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style43">Audio equipment<br />
					<img alt="audio" src="../images/mic_headphones200.jpg" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style42">Again most laptops come with an 
					integrated microphone and speakers and you can use those.&nbsp; 
					However, you may find that people are quite hard to hear 
					(especially if more than one person speaks at a time) so a 
					set of headphones, earphones or external speakers is useful.<br  />
					You may also find that the microphone is not good enough for 
					your voice to be as clear as it should be.&nbsp; A simple, cheap 
					external microphone will help a lot.<br  />
					An integrated headphone with microphone set makes you look 
					like a call-centre worker but is an acceptable alternative.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style43">A dedicated space<br />
					<img alt="space" height="133" src="../images/working_alone200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style42">Do not be tempted to run online 
					lessons from your kitchen table.<br  />
					You need a quiet, comfortable area where you will not be 
					interrupted and where there is no external noise from the 
					environment or other 
					people in your household.<br  />
					In it, you should have all that you need on a proper desk including 
					notebooks, reference materials, pens, paper and any other 
					stationery you normally use.<br  />
					Switch your phone off.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style27" colspan="2" valign="top">Software</td>

				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style43" valign="top">Conferencing facility<br />
					<img alt="conference" height="133" src="../images/conferencing_laptop200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style42">There are good free programs 
					available to download and install on the web and you must do 
					a little research to decide which one is right for you and 
					will work with your computer's operating system.<br />
					All the learners will also need to have the program on their 
					own machines so choose carefully.<br />
					Somewhere to start is:<br />
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_conferencing_software" target="_blank">
					https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_conferencing_software</a><br />
					At the very least, the software should have:<ol>
						<li>Video support so you can see everyone in the group</li>
						<li>Audio support so you can interact</li>
						<li>Desktop sharing so you can display presentations and 
						documents</li>
						<li>A break-out-room facility so that you can group 
						learners and move between rooms to see what's happening.</li>
						<li>A screen-sharing facility so you can ensure that you 
						can use your own computer as a virtual projector and 
						everyone can see the same images or texts.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The ability to upload and share a variety of documents 
					types is very helpful.</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style43">Other software<br />
					<img alt="laptop" height="133" src="../images/laptop200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style42">You'll need word processing 
					software, of course, and it will help if it produces 
					industry-standard file types so your learners can easily 
					access your and each other's documents.<br />
					It should also have the ability to make PDF-format documents 
					because they are sometimes easier for people to read on 
					screen.<br />
					You also need something like Microsoft's PowerPoint program 
					for creating presentations.<br />
					A bonus is a program which will allow you to make quizzes 
					and tests but this can be done with a good word processor, 
					too (and a bit of time).</td>

					<td class="auto-style32">If you do not have your own 
					website, now may be the time to consider it.<br />
					Having your own domain on which you can post messages and 
					invite others to do so is certainly a bonus in any online 
					teaching.<br />
					There are a number of ways to get a website and many are 
					free so you need to do a little research.&nbsp; Free website 
					makers are usually quite straightforward to use to build and maintain 
					a website although they are limited in terms of presentation and 
					templates.<br />
					Be aware that free hosting is not usually well supported and 
					may be financed by a certain amount of advertising.<br />
					Paying for a domain and having someone host it is not a 
					very expensive option.&nbsp; Try

					<img alt="vle" height="133" src="../images/workspace200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style28">A VLE is a Virtual Learning 
					Environment and an LMS is a Learning Management System.&nbsp; 
					They mean much the same for our purposes although there is a 
					difference.&nbsp; The most well-known are 
					Blackboard and Moodle.&nbsp; The latter is free but with all 
					VLEs, you have to have somewhere to host the resources and 
					that means having a website with a good deal of space on it.&nbsp; 
					If your institution is willing, they may be able to host it 
					for you.<br />
					Both allow you to simulate a school by having areas for 
					learners to upload assignments and for you to give feedback 
					as well as create quizzes, contribute to forums, keep track 
					of grades and much more.<br />
					All of this can be done by using emails and so on but having 
					your own VLE/LMS makes your life a good deal easier, once 
					you have learned how to set it up and operate it (and that is not done 
					quickly).</td>

					<td class="auto-style43" valign="top">Cloud storage<br />

					<td class="auto-style28">There's a lot of free storage space 
					on the cloud to be had once you have signed in to the 
					services.<br />
					The principle is quite simple: you can upload almost any 
					files, even large video files and give your learners access 
					to them.&nbsp; They can then download the files, work on 
					them and respond at an online session or to you or each 
					other as you see fit.<br />
					As a place for setting complex tasks and a place to hold 
					large files that you want your learners to access (such as 
					video and audio files), it is a good free solution.<br />
					Use a search engine to browse for 'free cloud storage' and 
					you'll find what you need.&nbsp; Stick to only one if 
					possible because you and your students need to learn how it 
					works.</td>

			<p>In a face-to-face classroom, most of the teaching is synchronous 
			(i.e., it happens all at the same time with everyone together in the 
			same place).&nbsp; The only exceptions are homework and other 
			out-of-class tasks usually and on some courses personal 
			research, revision or project work.<br />
			Online teaching and training can also be managed synchronously so 
			that everyone is logged on together, has access to the same people 
			and data and works on tasks at the same time.</p>
			<p>Online teaching also, however, gives us the opportunity to extend 
			learning beyond the here and now and make a more involving and 
			engaging experience with a little thought.&nbsp; In asynchronous 
			learning, people can work on tasks and absorb data at their own pace 
			in their own environment, freed from the need to respond instantly 
			and allowed the space to consider, reconsider, draft and redraft, 
			write and re-write and 
			do and redo activities as often as they like.&nbsp; There are few time 
			pressures and no need to keep up with peers and the teacher.<br />
			We can also group learners who can interact with each other 
			synchronously and asynchronously to work on tasks.</p>
			<p>In summary, with advantages in green and possible drawbacks in 
			orange:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="summary" height="524" src="../imagesgraphics/synchronous_asynchronous.png" width="620" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Both approaches have advantages and drawbacks.&nbsp; Our task is 
			to enhance the former and ameliorate the latter and one way to do 
			that is to use both synchronous and asynchronous procedures.</p>

					<h3>Planning and delivery</h3>

				</table>
			<p>Teaching online requires good long-term planning skills because 
			you need to know exactly what you want to achieve in synchronous 
			sessions and precisely what people should be doing between them 
			asynchronically to make the most of your materials.<br />
			All your materials will need to be electronically stored (unless you 
			know that your learners have copies of certain materials).</p>
			<p>The principles are the same whether you are delivering online 
			English language courses or online training courses.&nbsp; Only the 
			materials and activities will vary.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Before the sessions: asynchronous on and offline</dt>
				<dd>If a course book is being used, people can be alerted 
				beforehand to which parts to read.<br />
				You can ask people to read materials online (such as on this 
				site) or you can send people materials to look at.<br />
				People can be asked to do awareness-raising tasks which can be 
				electronically distributed.<br />
				Some pre-teaching of key terminology and / or vocabulary can be 
				done via a paper-based task.</dd>
				<dt>Session 1: synchronous online</dt>
				<dd>The topic is presented and the materials and examples are 
				provided.<br />
				Concepts and grasp of ideas can be checked through questioning 
				and elicitation.<br />
				Practice and application can be demonstrated and modelled.<br />
				Questions can be answered and extra exemplification can be 
				given.<br />
				People can be asked to produce and show that they have mastered 
				the material.</dd>
				<dt>Session 3: asynchronous online</dt>
				<dd>A task can be put on a website or a cloud-based resource 
				which everyone has to access when they can.<br />
				A range of tasks can be sent out electronically or placed online for people to 
				do.<br />
				Productive work can be demanded which is sent in or prepared for 
				the next synchronous session.<br />
				An assignment of whatever type or size can be completed and 
				submitted online.<br />
				Pairs or groups can be set up to work together online on certain tasks 
				at times they arrange independently of the main class.</dd>
				<dt>Session 4: synchronous online</dt>
				<dd>Refocusing on aims and objectives.<br />
				Contributions are valued and assessed together.<br />
				Problems with tasks can be highlighted and worked on.<br />
				New materials can be presented to extend practice.<br />
				New tasks can be done together.<br />
				Group spokespersons can report back.<br />
				Discussions and question-and-answer sessions can be conducted.</dd>
				<dt>Session 5: asynchronous offline</dt>
				<dd>Revision and testing tasks can be distributed via a 
				cloud-based resource or electronically (by, say, email).<br />
				Participants work individually on the tasks and submit them 
				electronically.<br />
				Participants are required to pose two questions and present one new idea for the final session.</dd>
				<dt>Session 6: synchronous online</dt>
				<dd>Feedback on the tasks and tests.<br />
				Question and answer session.<br />
				Contributions from everyone can be discussed.<br />
				A plan for the next course section can be presented, 
				discussed and amended if necessary.<br />
				People may be asked to state what they have learned.</dd>
				<dt>After the sessions: asynchronous offline</dt>
				<dd>Tutors / teachers have short one-to-one conferences with all 
				participants to discuss any issues, give feedback and take 
				questions and suggestions.<br />
				A personal learning plan can be instituted, updated or amended.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Naturally, the scheme set out here is almost infinitely flexible 
			but the combination of online and offline work, synchronous and 
			asynchronous sessions seeks to take advantage of the best of both 
			forms of working together and individually.</p>
