			<img alt="gender" height="207" src="../images/sign_gender310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide is about language, primarily, not about cultural 
			issues or issues of gender equality and political and economic 
			power.<br />
			It is, however, difficult to 
			disentangle all the issues and much of this guide is unavoidably 
			concerned with cultural, individual and social issues.&nbsp; So, before we 
			begin, let's get one term straight.</p>

			</table>
			<p>The sixth edition of the Oxford Concise Dictionary (1976) 
				defines gender as</p>
			<p class="indentpara">a grammatical classification ... of objects 
				roughly corresponding to the two sexes and sexlessness.</p>
			<p>Fowler, for long the go-to, final authority on English usage, 
			stated quite firmly:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">gender, n., is a grammatical term only.&nbsp; 
			To talk of persons or creatures of the masculine or feminine g., 
			meaning of the male or female sex, is either a jocularity 
			(permissible or not according to context) or a blunder.<br />
			<span class="auto-style25">(Fowler, 1965:221)</span></p>
			<p>Later dictionaries are a little more daring so, for example, The 
			Cambridge International Dictionary of English (1995) defines the 
			term thus:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">the physical and/or social condition of being 
			male or female, or (specialised) the grammatical divisions of 
			masculine, feminine or neuter into which nouns, adjectives etc. are 
			divided in some languages</p>
			<p>Twenty-five years later, the term is now defined in two ways as:</p>
				<ol class="indentpara">
					<li>either of the two sexes (male and female), especially 
					when considered with reference to social and cultural 
					differences rather than biological ones.&nbsp; The term is also 
					used more broadly to denote a range of identities that do 
					not correspond to established ideas of male and female.</li>
					<li>(in languages such as Latin, French, and German) each of the 
					classes (typically masculine, feminine, common, neuter) of 
					nouns and pronouns distinguished by the different 
					inflections which they have and which they require in words 
					syntactically associated with them.<br />
					<span class="auto-style57">(Google, 2020, definitions supplied by 
				Oxford Languages)</span></li>
					</ol>
				<p>The upshot of all this change and confusion, which can mostly be 
				traced to the 1970s and 1980s, is that there are now three 
				definitions of gender in common use:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style24">
				<li>gender as a grammatical category in some languages</li>
					<li>gender to mean sex or sexual orientation</li>
					<li>gender as a social role</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here, we are mostly concerned with the first of these definitions but, because the term is so loosely and carelessly used, it will not be possible to 
				maintain a strict approach.&nbsp; Nor shall we try.</p>

				</tr>
				
				
				
				
			</table>
			<p>Simplifying things rather too much, there are three types of 
			languages:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Genderless languages<br />
				</strong>Some languages are truly genderless, having no categories at all 
				to denote gender so there are no distinctions between nouns and none 
				between pronouns, either.&nbsp; Such languages may have nouns 
				which are gender specific, such as <em>sister, brother, aunt, 
				uncle</em> etc. but that's where it stops.<br />
				Fully genderless languages include: Armenian, most Austronesian 
				languages (such as the Polynesian languages, Malay and 
				Indonesian and Malagasy), Bengali, Burmese, Chinese languages, 
				Dravidian languages of South India, Estonian, Finnish, 
				Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, Persian (Farsi), Thai, Turkic 
				languages and Vietnamese.</li>
				<li><strong>Natural gender languages</strong><br />
				Natural gender languages are genderless in the sense that they 
				have no marking on nouns or adjectives etc. for gender but may 
				have gender-marked pronouns such as <em>she, he, they</em> 
				(feminine), <em>they</em> (masculine) and so on.<br />
				Natural gender languages include:<br />
				Afrikaans (but not Dutch), English, Swedish and Tamil (which is 
				also considered genderless) and a range of others.</li>
				<li><strong>Gendered languages</strong><br />
				These languages differentiate between at least two and often 
				three genders, usually masculine, feminine and neuter.<br />
				Languages with two genders (masculine and feminine or common and 
				neuter) include: Arabic (most varieties), Danish, Dutch, French, 
				Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Kurdish, Latvian, Lithuanian, 
				Portuguese, Punjabi, Spanish, Tagalog and Urdu.<br />
				Languages which used to have a three-gender system 
				(masculine–feminine–neuter) including Danish and Swedish, for 
				example, have lost the distinctions between masculine and 
				feminine and they have merged in what is called a common gender.&nbsp; 
				So, nouns denoting people are usually of common gender (as in 
				English) but other nouns may be of either gender.<br />
				Languages which differentiate between three genders, as English 
				does but only in the singular pronoun system, include: Belarusian, Bulgarian, 
				Croatian, Czech, German, Greek, Icelandic, Macedonian, Marathi, 
				Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, 
				Telugu, Ukrainian and Yiddish.<br />
				However, the Slavic languages in this list recognise also the 
				distinction between animate and inanimate entities.<br />
				A bewildering range of genders is present in the grammars of 
				other languages including separate categories for animals, 
				countable nouns, inanimate nouns, uncountable nouns, abstract 
				nouns, fluids, edibility <em>vs</em>. inedibility and so on.&nbsp; 
				Swahili has 18 noun classes and some languages have even more.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As a general rule, Indo-European languages which have a gender 
			system base the categories on sex but African languages and others 
			in North and South America have a gender system based on other 
			characteristics, notably animate <em>vs</em>. inanimate but there 
			are many others.</p>

					<h2>Markedness</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				
				
				
			</table>
			<p>Some features of a language are simple and 
			prototypical so they are referred to as unmarked forms but others are 
			distinguished or marked in some way.&nbsp; For example, we do not 
			usually suggest that <em>house</em> is the singular of <em>houses</em> 
			but rather that <em>houses</em> is the plural of <em>house</em>.&nbsp; 
			The plural form is marked (in this case by the '<em>-s</em>' suffix) 
			but the singular is unmarked.&nbsp; That is the normal way plurals 
			are formed in English.<br />
			In other words, markedness refers to the distinguishing form rather than the base 
			form of a word in a language.&nbsp; So, for example, the verb in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary came to the house</em><br />
			is marked (by the mutation of the first vowel from 'o' to 'a' to 
			show the tense) but in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will arrive</em><br />
			the verb <em>arrive</em> is unmarked for tense or person.&nbsp; The 
			whole clause is, however, marked to show future reference with the 
			auxiliary verb, <em>will</em>.<br />
			In:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took the money</em><br />
			we also have a marked form of the verb (<em>took</em>, not the base 
			form <em>take</em>).&nbsp; We also have a marked form of the noun,<em> 
			money</em>, with the definite article, signalling that the hearer is 
			aware of which money is in question.&nbsp; The clause as a whole is 
			not marked because, in English, we have the canonical word order of 
			Subject-Verb-Object and that is what is apparent in this example.&nbsp; 
			On the other hand, we can mark the syntax and say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she take the money?</em><br />
			in which case the clause is marked as a question.<br />
			By the same token, the unmarked form of the adjective is used to ask 
			a question such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How old is she?</em><br />
			because the marked form is the antonym, <em>young</em>, and we do 
			not usually ask<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How young is she?</em><br />
			unless we have a pre-formed idea about her age.&nbsp; Even obviously 
			young entities retain the unmarked form so we ask:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How old is the puppy?<br />
			</em>A good deal more can be found in the guide to markedness, 
			linked below.</p>

				</table>
			<p>Overwhelmingly, any language which distinguishes between 
			masculine and feminine forms of nouns will do so by adding marking 
			to make the feminine form and assuming the unmarked form is 
			masculine.&nbsp; The simple way to determine this is to check the 
			dictionary entries for nouns.&nbsp; Lexicographers of gendered 
			languages will use the masculine version of the noun as the headword 
			and usually note the female endings separately, or in brackets.<br />
			Even in those languages which have three genders, one being neuter, 
			lexicographers will follow this format and dictionaries will usually 
			present the masculine form of, say, an article or adjective, and 
			note the distinctions for feminine and neuter in brackets.</p>
			<p>Plurals, too, are a sign of this so, for example in Spanish, a group 
			of 100 friends which contains a single male representative will be 
			referred to using the male plural ending (<em>amigos</em>, not <em>
			amigas</em>).&nbsp; In French, too, <em>my father's friends</em> 
			will be translated as <em>les amis de mon père</em> with the 
			masculine plural ending on the word <em>ami</em>, not the feminine 
			plural <em>amies</em>.&nbsp; Italian will do the same, using <em>
			amici</em>, not <em>amiche</em> unless it is quite clear from the 
			context that ALL the friends are female.&nbsp; Greek, another 
			gendered language with three genders, will also make the plural of
			<em>friends</em> as <em>φίλοι</em> (<em>feelee</em>), the masculine 
			plural, not <em>φίλες</em> (<em>feeles</em>), 
			the feminine plural, when it is clear that the group contains male as 
			well as female people.</p>
			<p>Genderless or natural gender languages, retain some elements of a 
			gendered noun system so the languages have separate lexemes for male 
			and female relations and some titles, roles or professions.&nbsp; 
			This, too, is variable with some languages distinguishing male from 
			female cousins and some, such as English, making no distinction.&nbsp; 
			It is also true that even internally, most languages are 
			inconsistent so English distinguishes between a <em>host</em> (male) 
			and a <em>hostess</em> (female) but does not distinguish between 
			guests in the same way (there is no word <em>guestess</em>) and 
			while it can distinguish a <em>poet</em> from a <em>poetess</em>, it 
			cannot distinguish the sex of a <em>painter, violinist, composer, 
			teacher</em> 
			or <em>writer</em>.&nbsp; 
			It can also, but very rarely does, distinguish between <em>maestro</em>&nbsp;as 
			a male honorific title and <em>maestra</em>.<br />
			Animals are notoriously inconsistently treated: English, French, 
			Spanish, Chinese and many other languages can distinguish between
			<em>lion</em> (male) ands <em>lioness</em> (female) but many 
			languages, including Bengali, Nepali, Basque, Hausa and Irish do not 
			make a distinction.&nbsp; Those that do distinguish predictably mark 
			the male form in some way (often by affixation) to signal the 
			female.<br />
			There are, of course, exceptions but they are exceptions and they 
			are rare.&nbsp; English, for example, marks the male form when 
			distinguishing between <em>bride</em> and <em>bridegroom</em> and between 
			<em>widow</em> and 
			<em>widower</em>.&nbsp; It is also true that, in English, the words
			<em>goose</em> and <em>duck</em> are unmarked for gender but <em>
			gander</em> and <em>drake</em> are marked male forms.</p>
			<p>Some nouns in English have unrelated structural terms for male and 
			female representatives of people so, e.g., English has <em>king</em> and 
			<em>queen</em>, <em>brother</em> and <em>sister</em>, <em>monk</em> and 
			<em>nun.</em>&nbsp; But, in Spanish, for example, all the words are 
			related to each other very obviously and the language has only three base lexemes with just the endings changed to denote 
			sex.&nbsp; In Spanish, the words are: <em>rey, reina, hermano, 
			hermana, monje</em> and <em>monja</em>, respectively.<br />
			German notes the female by an ending on <em>king</em> (<em>K&ouml;nig-in</em>) 
			but has unrelated terms for the others and so on across languages 
			with Malay having six distinct lexemes like English and others 
			varying in how the words are structurally related, if at all.</p>
			<p>The technical term for gender-neutral words is, incidentally,
			<strong>epicene</strong> so words such as <em>teacher, sibling, 
			cousin, parent, engineer, driver, gardener, player, hotelier</em> 
			etc. 
			may apply equally to male and female people (or, indeed, to any 
			other sexual identity) in English.&nbsp; Languages which are more 
			heavily marked for gender may have male and female versions of all 
			of those and fewer epicene words.</p>

			<p>In most gendered languages, it is compulsory to make the adjective 
			and article forms agree with the noun which governs them so, too, we find the 
			dictionary entries for adjectives in the masculine form and the 
			feminine form denoted, usually in brackets, after it.&nbsp; Even 
			online translating programs will follow this convention (although 
			some are beginning to offer the alternative feminine versions of 
			adjectives).<br />
			The examples above show the system in English, German, Spanish and 
			French.&nbsp; In the latter three cases, the adjectives are marked 
			to show the gender of the noun and the article, too, takes a 
			gender-specific form, masculine in this case because the word for
			<em>pencil</em><span class="auto-style81"> </span>happens to be 
			masculine in all three languages.&nbsp; Change the noun for a noun 
			of a different gender, say,<em> cup</em>, which happens to be 
			feminine in all these languages, and we have to change both the 
			article and the adjective form to get:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eine gebrochene 
			Tasse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; una taza rota<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; une tasse cassée</em></span><br />
			Not so in English, as we know, because it is a natural gender 
			language so we still have:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a broken cup</em></span><br />
			and no changes are made to the article or adjective.</p>
			<p>Within gendered languages, too, there are distinctions so, for 
			example, Romance and Slavic languages generally insist on agreement 
			between the noun and the adjective in all circumstances whereas 
			Germanic languages only make the adjective agree when it is used 
			attributively (i.e., immediately before or after the noun with no 
			linking verb such as <em>be, seem, grow</em> etc.).<br />
			These examples would be very different if we venture beyond the 
			three carefully chosen example languages here because the gender of 
			inanimate nouns is random and arbitrary.&nbsp; In Czech, for 
			example, which, like German, has three genders, the word for <em>
			pencil</em> happens to be feminine and the word for <em>cup</em> is 
			masculine so you need to make different changes to the adjective 
			(but you would be relieved of the need to change an article: Czech 
			doesn't use them).&nbsp; In Greek, it happens that both words are 
			masculine so no changes would be required.<br />
			Nouns for groups of people are variably gendered across languages, 
			so, for example, the German and Greek words for <em>group</em> 
			happen to be feminine (<em>die Gruppe, η ομάδα </em>[<em>ee omada</em>]) and they 
			require a feminine pronoun to represent them, even though all the 
			members of the group may be male.&nbsp; In those languages:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group of men has arrived and it/they have 
			settled in</em><br />
			would translate literally as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group of men has arrived and she has 
			settled in</em></p>

			<p>Gendered languages usually have well-developed pronoun systems 
			whereas genderless languages will not vary the pronouns at all 
			and most natural gendered languages such as English will note gender 
			in the pronoun system only but inconsistently.<br />
			English, for example, can distinguish 
			between <em>he, she</em> and <em>it</em> but has no way to mark 
			gender with <em>they</em> at all.&nbsp; The language does, however, 
			have a singular unmarked third-person pronoun in <em>one</em> but 
			its use is somewhat limited and formal.<br />
			Gendered languages may do things 
			differently and French, for example, distinguishes between <em>they </em>
			feminine and <em>they </em>masculine: <em>elles</em> (feminine)
			<em>vs</em>. <em>ils</em> (masculine) and so does Italian with <em>
			esse</em> (feminine) and <em>essi</em> (masculine). and Spanish with
			<em>ellas</em> (feminine) and <em>ellos</em> (masculine).<br />
			However, within and between gendered languages, the systems vary.&nbsp; 
			German is an example of a gendered language (three genders) in which 
			the word for <em>they</em> is not marked for gender but the pronoun 
			for <em>you</em> takes three distinct forms marked for number and 
			formality but <strong>not</strong> for gender.</p>
			<p>English does not mark the relative pronoun <em>who</em> for gender or 
			number but some language do.&nbsp; Oddly, otherwise quite heavily 
			marked languages such as French and Spanish do not mark gender on 
			relative pronouns but German, because of its habit of using the 
			definite article as the relative pronoun, makes a distinction so, 
			for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's the woman who sold me the shirt</em><br />
			translates as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sie ist die Frau, <strong>die</strong> mir das Hemd verkauft 
			hat</em><br />
			but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's the man who sold me the shirt</em><br />
			translates as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Er ist der Mann, <strong>der</strong> mir das Hemd verkauft 
			hat</em></p>
			<p>Many languages do not mark the second-person pronouns for <em>you </em>for gender 
			but some, such as Spanish, Hindi and the Afro-asiatic family which includes 
			Hebrew, Arabic, Amharic, Berber, and Hausa do.&nbsp; In these 
			languages, the sex of the person one is addressing affects the 
			pronoun use but when addressing a mixed group, again, the masculine 
			form is conventionally used.<br />
			Spanish is also an example of a language which marks the gender on 
			the plural first person, <em>we</em> (<em>nosotros vs. nosotras</em>), 
			making it one of the most heavily gender marked of the Indo-European 
			family.&nbsp; In some languages, such as Vietnamese and some Chinese 
			dialects, forms of the pronoun <em>we</em> may be marked to signal 
			whether it includes <em>you</em> or not so there is a difference 
			between:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We</em> (including <em>you</em>) <em>are going out</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We</em> (not including <em>you</em>) <em>are going out</em><br />
			with a different form of the pronoun for <em>we</em> in each case.<br />
			Even so, however, the pronoun will not be marked for gender.<br />
			The English pronoun,
			<em>we</em>, on the other hand may or may not include the addressee 
			and may even include people not present (i.e., <em>they</em>).<br />
			Italian, another Romance language, doesn't take things quite so far 
			but, in common with many European languages, marks the pronoun <em>
			you</em> for politeness and number.</p>

			<p>Nouns, adjectives and pronouns do not complete the list and in 
			some languages, verbs, too, are gender marked.&nbsp; In Russian, for 
			example, past-tense forms agree with the gender of the subject so,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ate</em><br />
			translates as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Он ел<br />
			</em>but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ate</em><br />
			is<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Она съела</em><br />
			Czech, Polish and most other Slavic languages show parallel 
			distinctions.<br />
			In Hindi, the form of the verb will <strong>always</strong> depend 
			on the sex of the speaker so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I eat</em><br />
			may translate as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; khaata hoon</em><br />
			if the speaker is male but is<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; khaati hoon</em><br />
			if the speaker is female.<br />
			Equally, the verb form will change to distinguish between<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy eats<br />
			</em>and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The girl eats</em><br />
			In other languages, more radical changes are observable and in 
			languages with as many as 10 genders, the situation becomes deeply 
			complex.</p>

			<p>Accusations of sexist use of language are not uncommon and are 
			often based on the assumption that people's selection of grammatical 
			structures reflects the way they think so, for example, to state:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a student enters the college he will be 
			given his personal timetable</em><br />
			is considered unduly to assume that all students are male.&nbsp; In 
			fact, until quite recently (i.e., the last 30 or so years), the use 
			of <em>he, him, his</em> as unmarked pronouns and determiners for all people was 
			conventional as it remains in many gendered languages as we saw 
			above.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The discourse analyst, with his 'ordinary 
			language' data, is committed to quite a different view of the 
			rule-governed aspects of a language.&nbsp; Indeed, he may wish to 
			discuss ...<br />
			<span class="auto-style57">(Brown and Yule, 1983:22)</span></p>
			<p>To suggest that those who 
			used the pronoun <em>he </em>and the determiner <em>his </em>as an unmarked form were assuming that no 
			discourse analyst 
			could be female is patently unreasonable especially considering that 
			Brown's first name is Gillian.&nbsp; It is a fair bet that were that 
			passage to be written today, it would not have been phrased quite 
			like that.<br />
			Another commonly used source, published a year earlier (Seaton, 
			1982) uses <em>he, his, him</em> throughout as the unmarked form to 
			refer to both learners and teachers but it is doubtful whether the 
			author had not at least considered the possibility that some of the 
			teachers and learners he has encountered are female.&nbsp; Here, for 
			example, is Seaton's introduction (<em>op cit</em>.:98) to a 
			discussion of learning theory:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">... the child who learns his mother tongue is 
			at the same time discovering the possibilities of his own organs and 
			exploring his environment&nbsp; ... It is obvious that for him 
			hearing must precede speaking.&nbsp; It is equally obvious that he 
			is dependent on what he hears as he has not yet learned to read and 
			write.</p>
			<p>Nowadays, however, people will usually take one of six routes to 
			avoid accusatory fingers:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>use a plural as in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When students enter the college they will 
				be given their personal timetables</em></li>
				<li>use the unmarked plural pronoun as a singular reference as 
				in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a student enters the college they 
				will be given their personal timetable</em></li>
				<li>insert the alternative as in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a student enters the college he/she (</em>or
				<em>she/he </em>or<em> s/he) will be given his/her (</em>or<em> 
				her/his) personal timetable</em></li>
				<li>remove the determiner or pronoun altogether by using a 
				passive or rephrasing as in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A personal timetable will be given to 
				every student who enters the college</em></li>
				<li>rotate the use of male and female pronouns throughout the 
				text to provide a balance so that this instance may be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a student enters the college she 
				will be given her personal timetable</em><br />
				and the next instance will use <em>he, him</em> and/or <em>his</em>.</li>
				<li>use the feminine forms in all cases to make a 
				socio-political statement of some kind.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The second of these alternatives is not, incidentally, a new 
			invention or a grammatically challenged form.&nbsp; The use of <em>
			they, them, their, theirs</em> as unmarked singular pronouns and 
			determiners has been in 
			common use in English for at least 400 years.&nbsp; At times, for 
			example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever said that doesn't know their facts</em><br />
			it is almost unavoidable.<br />
			The selection of less obviously gendered functional words is 
			determined, however, not by changes in the language but by changes 
			in the people who use the language.</p>

			<p>Others are less easy so many would not accept, for example, <em>
			yachtsperson, middleperson, infantryperson </em>and lots more 
			although we can avoid <em>huntsperson</em> and <em>work person</em> 
			by an easy substitution with <em>hunter</em> and <em>worker</em>.<br />
			When nouns are compounded like this, it is often difficult to find 
			acceptable alternatives so <em>alderman, bogeyman, clergyman, 
			draughtsman, dustman, everyman, freeman, frogman, hangman, hit-man, landsman, 
			manmade, manpower, manslaughter, ombudsman, quarryman, showman, 
			snowman, taxman, watchman </em>along with many others remain without 
			clear alternatives.<br />
			The European Parliament has issued (2018) a list of terms 
			recommended for both sexes in this regard including many of those in 
			the table above, although the advice is unhelpful when it comes to
			<em>fisherman / fishermen</em> because, as the author notes,
			<span class="style_black"><em>'fisher' and 'fisherfolk' are not 
			widely accepted</em></span>.&nbsp; The Oxford English Dictionary, 
			incidentally, labels <em>fisher</em> as an archaic term but it is 
			increasingly seen in academia.&nbsp; It is also noted that
			<span class="style_black"><em>no gender-neutral term has been 
			successfully proposed</em></span> for <em>waiter / waitress</em>.&nbsp; 
			It seems <em>server</em> might suffice as a useful importation from 
			North American usage.<br />
			Fortunately, as we saw above, English is replete with epicene words 
			which need no adjustment.&nbsp; Some languages are not so fortunate.<br />
			Other languages, already heavily gender marked such as German and 
			Spanish are, in fact, proceeding in the opposite direction by adding 
			suffixes to names for people which previously only existed in the 
			male form so, for example, European citizens are now described in 
			official documents in German as <em>Europäische Bürger und 
			Bürgerinnen</em> and in Spanish as <em>Ciudadanas europeas y 
			Ciudadanos europeos</em> which are wordier and clumsier, many 
			maintain, than the previous 
			formulations.</p>
			<p>It was pointed out above that the use of masculine pronouns for 
			all persons does not necessarily betoken the fact that a 
			speaker/writer assumes that everyone is male or that males are 
			superior beings.&nbsp; The use of the masculine forms of pronouns in this way is (was) 
			common to both male and female users of the language.&nbsp; What 
			matters now is that many will assume that such uses do mean that the 
			language user is a prejudiced dinosaur.&nbsp; Why should this be?</p>

			<p>Within the genre of popular science there is an uneasy mix of assumptions

			<p class="indentpara">How we speak affects how we think and how we interpret the world 
			around us. So, as we are working to reimagine our defaults around 
			gender and build a more socially-conscious and inclusive culture, we 
			also need to reckon with language.</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The languages we speak influence how we 
			construct society, and can even set the precedent for gender

			<p>and</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Language reform is possible, but it takes time. This doesn’t 
			necessarily mean dismantling existing systems, but rather making 
			space for more inclusive options. Instead of allowing language to 
			construct how we view the world, we could push in the other 
			direction, questioning how we can reflect our world through our 
			choice of language.</p>
			<p>all citations from Dutta (2020) but even a casual web search will 
			reveal many parallel texts.</p>
			<p>There are three principles at work here, it seems:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Citation 1. implies that our first languages somehow 
				determine our thought processes, <span class="style_black"><em>
				how we think and how we interpret the world</em></span>.&nbsp; The direction of 
				causality is:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; language form &rarr; 
				mental constructs</strong></span></li>
				<li>Citation 2. suggests that cultural factors are determined by 
				the language a culture uses, <span class="style_black"><em>The 
				languages we speak influence how 
				we construct society, and can even set the precedent for gender 
				equality</em></span>, so the direction of causality is:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; language form &rarr; 
				social relationships</strong></span></li>
				<li>Citation three contains two implications:<ol class="auto-style27">
					<li>that how we think determines how we use language (<span class="style_black"><em>how 
					we can reflect our world through our choice of language</em></span>) so the 
					direction of causality is now:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mental 
					constructs → language form</strong></span><br />
					because</li>
					<li>we can change how people think by changing how we use 
					language (i.e., reforming its structural and lexical 
					features to conform to our notions of equality and 
					inclusiveness) <span class="style_black"><em>Instead of 
					allowing language to construct how we view the world, we 
					could push in the other direction</em></span>) so the direction of causality is:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new 
					language forms &rarr; better and more inclusive thought 
					processes</strong></span></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>None of these suggestions is unarguable, of course.<br />
			Two of 
			them are internally contradictory taken alone because we can't have 
			it both ways.&nbsp; Either we start from the hypothesis that our 
			thought processes (what Pinker (2007:82) and others have called mentalese) determine our language use or that our native languages 
			determine how we are <strong>able</strong> to think.&nbsp; The 
			latter assumption underlies attempts to ban what is seen as sexist 
			language use and replace it with genderless or differently gendered 
			forms in order to change how people think: psycho-social 
			engineering <em>via</em> language reform.<br />
			Elsewhere on this site, linked below, there is a guide to theories 
			of language and thought so we won't rehearse all the arguments here.&nbsp; 
			What we can say is that, although the jury is still out, the current 
			trend among many professional linguists, philosophers and 
			neurolinguists is towards rejecting the view that thought is <strong>
			determined</strong> by language.&nbsp; Pinker puts it this way:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">there is no scientific evidence that languages 
			dramatically shape their speakers' ways of thinking.<br />
			<span class="auto-style57">(Pinker, 2007:57)</span></p>
			<p>Here's another citation along the same lines:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">In March 2020, an open letter called on the 
			Oxford Dictionary of English to update its entry for the word 
			‘woman’. The dictionary, which is used in many mobile phones, offers 
			words such as ‘bitch’, ‘bird’, ‘wench’, ‘petticoat’, ‘bint’, ‘mare’, 
			‘biddy’ and ‘filly’ as alternatives to ‘woman’. Under examples of 
			how ‘woman’ could be used in a sentence, it includes the phrase: “I 
			told you to be home when I get home, little woman.”<br />
			The letter explained: “Synonyms and examples such as these when 
			offered without context reinforce negative stereotypes about women 
			and centre men. That’s dangerous because language has real world 
			implications. It shapes perceptions and influences the way women are 
			treated.”<br />
			<span class="auto-style57">(Bedi &amp; Cameron, undated)</span></p>
			<p>The assertion here is plain: <span class="style_black"><em>
			language</em></span> <span class="style_black"><em>... shapes 
			perceptions</em></span>, not the other way around.<br />
			There is, it bears repeating, no consensus among professional 
			linguists but many would dismiss that assertion as arrant nonsense.</p>
			<p>The rejection of the masculine pronouns for unmarked use has been 
			called pronoun envy and has been rejected on the grounds that, as we 
			saw above, gender is a grammatical, not a social or personal, 
			phenomenon.&nbsp; Here's another citation:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">The fact that the masculine is the unmarked 
			gender in English (or that the feminine is unmarked in the language 
			of the Tunica Indians) is simply a feature of grammar. It is 
			unlikely to be an impediment to any change in the patterns of the 
			sexual division of labor toward which our society may wish to 
			evolve. There is really no cause for anxiety or pronoun-envy on the 
			part of those seeking such changes.<br />

			In the novel, Chapter 5, a lexicographer working on a new edition of

			the forefront of efforts to expunge what are seen as gender-biased 
			language items, by legislation if necessary.<br />
			If it is true that we can impose changes to how people think by 
			legislation concerning the language they are allowed to use, then we 
			have a serious ethical issue on our hands.&nbsp; Fortunately, it 
			probably isn't.</p>
			<p>Modern organisations do not go quite as far as Big Brother's 
			lexicographers but there is a consistent and noticeable trend 
			towards imposing language reform from above.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Over the last three decades, supranational 
			organisations such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe and 
			the European Union have become aware of social inequalities between 
			women and men. One of the aspects these organisations have 
			highlighted is that of language and its sociocultural repercussions. 
			These organisations have noted that the systematic use of 
			gender-neutral terminology and wording is an important factor in the 
			attainment of equality between women and men. As a result, they have 
			taken <strong>steps to promote the elimination and avoidance of 
			sexist language</strong>.<br />
			<span class="auto-style57">(Teso, E, 2010:3, emphasis added)</span></p>
			<p>The European Parliament puts it this way:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Using gender-fair and inclusive language also 
			helps reduce gender stereotyping, promotes social change and 
			contributes to achieving gender equality.<br />
			<span class="auto-style57">(European Parliament 2018)</span></p>
			<p>and that is an assumption for which no evidence at all is 
			provided.</p>
			<p>Many, clinging to the presumption that how our language is 
			formed determines how we think, reason that it follows that we can, by reforming 
			the language, reform the thinking of individuals and that will lead to a reformed, more 
			equal and more inclusive society.&nbsp; Some efforts have been 
			made in this direction, as we shall see.&nbsp; The corollary is, of 
			course, that the way a person expresses himself/herself, 
			themselves/themself betrays his/her/their prejudices.<br />
			The evidence seems, however, to show that more equitable modes of 
			thought have already led to significant changes in pronoun use in 
			English, hence the rejection of <em>he, his, him</em> as unmarked 
			pronouns and the consistent attempts by writers in all fields to use 
			plurals or the plural third-person pronouns and determiners to 
			signal a singular gender-unmarked form.<br />
			It is also shown by the falling use of gender-marked nouns such as
			<em>actress, manageress, policeman/woman, cameraman/woman</em> and 
			so on although the process is very slow and only recently detectable 
			in Google Ngram Viewer.<br />
			Both these phenomena are, it seems, indicative of a direction of 
			causality from thought patterns to language choices, not the other 
			way around.</p>

			<p>Nouns belong to an open class and the introduction of new ones

			Pronouns, on the other hand, are a closed-class set of words and 
			the introduction of new ones is a more difficult undertaking.&nbsp;

			<p>There is, of course, a reason why these are probably unfamiliar 
			to you &ndash; almost nobody uses them.&nbsp; Pronunciation is not 
			yet conventionalised and varies.<br />
			Other, simpler systems have been proposed such as the use of <em>
			hizzer</em> instead of the marked <em>his, hers, her</em> and so on.&nbsp; 
			None of those has caught on, either.<br />
			There is some evidence that the use of <em>themself</em> as an

			<p>Pronunciation of these neo-pronouns is also not settled and, when 
			they are used at all, is quite dramatically variable.&nbsp; However, 
			a guideline is:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ne, nem, nir</em> and <em>nirs</em> are 
			pronounced as /niː/, /nem/, /nɪə/ and /nɪəz/<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ve, ver</em> and <em>vis</em> are pronounced 
			as /viː/, /ver/ and /vɪz/<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ze, zie, zir, zirs, hir </em>and <em>hirs</em> 
			are pronounced as /ziː/, /ziː/, /zɪə/, /zɪəz/, and /hɪə/ and /hɪəz/<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xe, xem, xyr </em>and <em>xyrs</em> are 
			pronounced as /ziː/, /zem/, /zɪə/ and /zɪəz/<br />
			If you encounter a need to use these systems, it is probably as well 
			to ask or inform your interlocutor concerning the correct (or, at 
			least, preferred) pronunciations.&nbsp; It will also take a bit of 
			practice.<br />
			<span class="auto-style91">(Reference for this bit: University of 
			North Carolina, n.d. at

			<p>An issue here is that the third-person pronouns are more closely to 
			do with internal text referencing than first- or second-person 
			pronouns which are involved with deixis (to which there is a guide, 
			linked below).&nbsp; For example in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The driver stopped and she walked over to me</em><br />
			it is clear that the speaker wishes to make clear what sex the 
			driver was and to remove that reference makes the language less 
			precise and less effective.&nbsp; This usual anaphoric use of the 
			pronoun system could not be accommodated in a language that did not 
			gender mark pronouns.<br />
			(The only innovation in regard to marking which has been successful 
			is the introduction of <em>Ms</em> to replace both <em>Miss</em> and
			<em>Mrs</em> which is now ubiquitous in most English-speaking 
			cultures but that is, of course still gender marked.&nbsp; No 
			alternative form of address usable with both men and women has been 
			introduced and one still hears <em>Ladies and Gentlemen</em> as 
			often as <em>colleagues, people, y'all</em> and so on.&nbsp; The use of
			<em>fellow workers </em>has been recently disparaged in favour of
			<em>co-workers</em> because of the association of <em>fellow</em> 
			with men.)</p>

			<p>Here we need to bear an important distinction in mind between 
			sexist use of language and gendered language use.<br />
			The former implies language used deliberately or unconsciously to 
			demean or negatively characterise usually female people.&nbsp; The 
			latter is an academic description of a language in use and carries 
			no implication of a deliberate or unconsciously prejudiced approach 
			to other people.&nbsp; People can be sexist or racist and so can a 
			few words but a language cannot be prejudiced any more than a language can be 
			religious, politically right wing or socialist.&nbsp; Confusing or 
			conflating language use and language leads to a certain amount of trouble.</p>
			<p>Advocates of linguistic engineering are sometimes tempted to 
			suggest that gendered languages lead to gender-unequal societies.&nbsp; 
			In other words, gendered languages are sexist languages or, at 
			least, embed sexism in conventional speech.<br />
			What's the evidence?<br />
			There is some from studies which suggest that speakers of languages 
			with two genders only, masculine and feminine, do, in fact, think 
			about things differently depending on whether the object is feminine 
			or masculine.&nbsp; Borodsky, Schmidt and Phillips (probably 
			2003), having asserted in the first sentence that:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Speakers of different languages must attend to 
			and encode strikingly different aspects of the world in order to use 
			their language properly.</p>
			<p>go on to suggest that one of the ways in which first-language 
			learners of a language, i.e., children, acquire a gendered noun 
			system is to focus on what they call the masculine or feminine 
			properties of the object so, for example, they will:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">focus on some property of that noun's referent 
			that may pick it out as masculine or feminine. For example, if the 
			word for "sun" is masculine in one's language, one might try to 
			remember this by conceiving of the sun in terms of what are 
			perceived as stereotypically masculine properties like powerful and 
			threatening. If the word for "sun" is feminine, on the other hand, 
			one might focus on its warming and nourishing qualities.<br />
			<span class="auto-style57">(Op cit.:65)</span></p>
			<p>This may prove efficacious if one accepts such stereotypical properties as 
			being universals but it is less obvious how, for example, one 
			attaches feminine properties to a <em>microbe</em> (as in German) or 
			masculine properties to a <em>table</em> (also German) or feminine 
			properties to the same piece of furniture (as in French and 
			Spanish).&nbsp; The word for <em>a stone</em> happens to be feminine 
			in Spanish and French but masculine in German and Czech and it is 
			unclear how children learning any of those as a first language will 
			be able to assign feminine or masculine characteristics to the word 
			however imaginative we know them to be.<br />
			In Russian, as the same writers point out, <em>Monday, Tuesday</em> 
			and <em>Thursday</em> are masculine and <em>Wednesday, Friday</em> 
			and <em>Saturday</em> are feminine.&nbsp; In Greek, all days of the 
			week are feminine except Saturday so there appears to be no 
			systematic assignment of gender to objects by the characteristics they exhibit 
			(whatever those presumed characteristics are).<br />
			In fact, across languages the assignment of gender to inanimate 
			objects is fundamentally random (or based on, for example, 
			affixation where all diminutives are neuter or whatever).<br />
			There is no obvious reason why <em>the moon</em> should be feminine 
			in French, masculine in German and neuter in Russian.<br />
			There is also some evidence that languages which have only two 
			genders (masculine and feminine) influence their speakers more in 
			assigning certain characteristics to feminine and masculine nouns 
			than languages with three genders including neuter.<br />
			These investigators sound a useful cautionary note:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Evidence collected from such subjective 
			judgments cannot reveal whether gender is actually part of a 
			person's conceptual representation of an object, or whether (left 
			with no other criterion for making the subjective judgment) the 
			person just explicitly decided to use grammatical gender in 
			answering the experimenter's questions.<br />
			<span class="auto-style57">(Ibid: 67)</span></p>
			<p>A different tack is taken by Prewitt-Freilino, Caswell and Laakso 
			(2011) who set out to investigate whether nations with gendered main 
			languages showed differences from those with genderless or natural 
			gender main languages in terms of how equal the societies are in 
			treating people of different sexes.<br />
			They surveyed 111 languages (73 gendered, 12 natural gender, and 26 
			genderless) and took as their measure of (in)equality the 2009 World 
			Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report (the GGG report).&nbsp; 
			The mean score on that scale is .68 and the higher the score, the 
			greater the level of sex equality in the society.<br />
			The results from the table they present are somewhat mixed with, for 
			example, Chile, China, Colombia, Honduras, Hungary, Thailand, 
			Ukraine and Croatia all scoring .69 (i.e., just above average) 
			although China, Hungary and Thailand have genderless languages with 
			the other nations having predominantly gendered languages.&nbsp; It 
			is the case that the four highest scoring (i.e., most equal) nations 
			were Finland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland, all of which have a 
			natural-gender main languages.&nbsp; Of the genderless language 
			countries, 10 scored less than the mean and 16 at or above the mean.&nbsp; 
			None scored higher than the four natural gender languages.<br />
			In addition to the general index, the report looked at other 
			measures of (in)equality concerning economic participation, 
			educational attainment, health and political empowerment.<br />
			The figures presented (p281) show that on all five of these 
			measures, gendered language nations score lower in three cases out 
			of five than natural gender language nations and in four out of five 
			cases when compared to genderless-language nations.&nbsp; Only in 
			terms of health and survival was no difference in equality observed.<br />
			The evidence is patchy and sometimes controversial because social 
			parameters such as equality are notoriously difficult to measure.<br />
			The writers nevertheless concluded:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">it appears that countries that speak gendered 
			languages evidence less gender equality than countries that speak 
			natural gender or genderless languages–especially in terms of gender 
			differences in economic participation—even when other factors that 
			could influence variations in gender equality (e.g., religious 
			tradition, system of government) are taken into account ...<br />
			<span class="auto-style79">and</span><br />
			countries that speak natural gender languages may be even more apt 
			to exhibit gender equality—especially in the form of women’s greater 
			access to political empowerment—than in countries where gendered or 
			genderless languages are spoken.<br />
			<span class="auto-style57">(p278)</span></p>
			<p>These writers finish with the heavily hedged comment that:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Moreover, although language may very well play 
			a role in gender equality and language reform could be a fruitful 
			avenue for improving the status of women, it is important to 
			remember that linguistic modification must be accompanied by social 
			and political adjustments in order to truly change existing 
			asymmetries in gender.<br />
			<span class="auto-style57">(p281)</span></p>
			<p>Which leaves us back where we started with an assumption that 
			language can be reformed in order to reform social relations, not
			<em>vice versa</em>, although there is an admission here that it 
			needs to go hand-in-hand with <span class="style_black"><em>social 
			and political adjustments</em></span>.</p>
			<p>Lest we jump to a conclusion in this respect, it is worth noting 
			that, for example, Chinese, Estonian, Farsi, Finnish, Lithuanian, 
			Mongolian, Turkish and Thai are all genderless languages but the 
			nations in which these languages are overwhelmingly spoken exhibit 
			very different levels of social equality between men and women, 
			ranging from .58 to .83 on the general GGG report index.&nbsp; If we 
			look at the political empowerment figures, the differences are even 
			starker, ranging from .02 to .57 across these 8 genderless-language 
			nations.<br />
			It is also the case, as we saw above that gender concerns more than 
			masculine or feminine divisions, especially in, for example, Bantu 
			languages in which there may be as many as 10 genders, none of which 
			concerns sex.</p>

			<p>Notwithstanding the objections made here to the idea that 
			language reform can precede changes in thought patterns and that 
			these then feed into reforming society to make it more equitable, it 
			does seem to be the case that once more equitable and enlightened 
			ways of thinking become more widespread, the door is opened (or at 
			least pushed ajar) for a reformed use of the language to become the 
			accepted convention.&nbsp; What this implies is that people should 
			wait until social customs and attitudes have changed enough before 
			trying to introduce language changes to match the new norms.<br />
			Many public and private organisations already have 
			gender-neutral language policies in place but these, it should be 
			emphasised, usually get imposed <strong>after</strong> new social 
			constructs and attitudes have become embedded.&nbsp; They are the 
			result, not the cause, of changes in attitudes.<br />
			It is certainly the case, for example, that the singular, unmarked 
			use of the pronouns <em>they, them</em> and <em>theirs</em> and the 
			possessive determiner <em>their</em> is gaining widespread acceptance.&nbsp; It 
			is now quite clear to nearly all users of the language that using
			<em>he</em> to subsume reference to <em>she</em> is not acceptable 
			and will grate on many readers and listeners.<br />
			It is a comparatively straightforward change to make in English, of 
			course, because only four words already in common use need to be 
			reassigned and none needs to be reconfigured.<br />
			In other languages, where pronouns take different forms depending on 
			case, number and gender, it is a more complicated procedure and 
			removing the marking from languages which apply gender to all nouns 
			is a significant step which, as yet, few are willing to take.<br />
			We saw above that many languages, including most Slavic ones, mark 
			verbs for gender and removing that morphological phenomenon is a 
			challenging task.<br />
			Peninsular Spanish is often held up as a clear example of the 
			difficulties of reforming a language which is very heavily marked 
			for gender.&nbsp; Research by Lomotey (undated) showed that despite 
			attempts to impose, from above, anti-sexist language rules, 93% of 
			the examples investigated showed continuing use of sexist language.&nbsp; 
			The most obvious cases were of masculine plurals for groups including 
			both males and females.&nbsp; From that paper, for example:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">Some of the words which appeared most 
			frequently in the masculine generic form were ciudadanos 'citizens', 
			españoles 'spaniards', empleados 'employees', amigos 'friends', 
			padres 'parents', hijos 'children', funcionarios 'workers', 
			hombre(s) 'mankind', jóvenes 'youth', lector 'reader' and políticos 
			'politicians'.<br />
			<span class="auto-style57">(Lomotey, n.d.:173)</span></p>
			<p>Partly, Lomotey points out (p169) this is caused by the 
			continuing opposition to language reform by, among others, The 
			Spanish Royal Academy which is concerned to maintain the purity of 
			the Spanish language.</p>
			<p>There is clearly a long way to go and, while English is very 
			weakly gender marked in comparison to many languages, it is still 
			proving very difficult to introduce change.&nbsp; The challenge for 
			linguistic engineers in other languages is much greater.</p>

			<p>It would do our learners a disservice to be too careful about 
			what we teach and what language we suggest they use to avoid any 
			accusations of sexist language and the use of gender-marked forms 
			because our aim is, probably, to supply our learners with the 
			language that native speakers naturally use.&nbsp; Much of that is 
			gender marked, some wisely and some unavoidably so.<br />
			Teaching the Spivak pronouns would, therefore, seem 
			counterproductive however much we want to appear equitable and 
			inclusive in our language use.<br />
			Fortunately, unlike Spanish and many other languages, English has 
			quite low levels of gender marking, most of which can be avoided 
			easily by rephrasing or using a single lexeme for both male and 
			female entities and a single pronoun for male and female referents 
			regardless of number and sex.<br />
			This does not mean, however, that we do not need to show some 
			sensitivity to the ways people try to keep unnecessary and possibly 
			biased gender marking out of their language use.&nbsp; Choosing or 
			designing materials which do not use, for example, terms such as <em>
			spaceman, manageress, workman</em> and so on in favour of those that 
			use <em>astronaut, manager </em>and<em> worker</em> is a 
			straightforward matter.&nbsp; It is also straightforward to teach 
			the use of <em>they, them, theirs, their</em> as singular pronouns 
			and a possessive determiner, along 
			with some notification that it may be frowned on in formal academic 
			writing.</p>
			<p>(Teaching <em>themself</em> as an unmarked singular reflexive 
			pronoun may currently be a step too far because most authorities 
			note that it is <em>rare, disputed</em> or <em>not widely accepted </em>
			(oed.com) or <em>remains quite rare in published, edited text</em> (merriam-webster.com).<br />
			It 
			has been noted that <em>themself</em> was the normal form of the third 
			person plural reflexive pronoun until about 1540.&nbsp; It had 
			disappeared by about 1570.&nbsp; Later, <em>themselves</em> became 
			the standard form.<br />
			The form may be re-emerging but an expression such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The manager may consider themself an expert</em><br />
			will still not be widely welcomed in formal writing.)</p>
			<p>It is also the case that students of the language who need it for 
			more than informal chitchat will be well advised to avoid upsetting 
			their socially or grammatically sensitive hearers and readers by 
			selecting genderless items over gender-marked terms.<br />
			A little awareness raising through simple practice is called for.&nbsp;
