			<p>Philosophy may seem somewhat removed from the day-to-day concerns 
			of language teachers.&nbsp; However, if you have ever been faced 
			with learners who simply cannot manage to grasp a concept in English 
			or you have encountered a concept in a language you are learning 
			which runs so counter to your own way of thinking that it seems 
			impossible to comprehend, you may not be alone in thinking that language 
			and mental processes, cognition, if you will, are intimately 
			connected.<br />
			That they are connected is not in much doubt, the uncertainty lies 
			in exactly <strong>how</strong> and <strong>to what extent</strong> they are connected.<br />
			If you have come here hoping for the definitive answer to that 
			question, you may well be disappointed.</p>

					<h2>Two schools of thought</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are two ways of looking at the connection between thought 
			and language.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Language determines thought.&nbsp; The language we speak and 
				the concepts we are able to use to think about the world and 
				those in it is the determining factor.</li>
				<li>Thought exists independently of language.&nbsp; Humans think 
				and their ability to do so does not depend on the language they 
				speak but is expressed separately in 'thought language', 
				sometimes referred to as 'mentalese'.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Like most dichotomies, this one is quite possibly false.&nbsp; It 
			is, however, a place to start.&nbsp; There are two outcomes for 
			language teachers already.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>If hypothesis 1. is true, learning a new language means, in 
				part at least, learning new ways to conceptualise the world and 
				new ways to think.&nbsp; The more remote the language you are 
				learning is from the structures, lexis and cultural background 
				of your first language(s), the more difficult and extreme will be 
				job of grasping new ways to think about the world.</li>
				<li>If hypothesis 2. is true, then both teachers and learners share a common way of thinking about the world which is 
				independent of the languages they speak.&nbsp; All that is 
				needed is to learn how to express universal thoughts in another 
				language.</li>
			</ol>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>As is often the case, there are proponents of both hypotheses 
			about the connection between conceptual categories and the 
			language(s) one speaks.&nbsp; Proponents tend, as is the way of 
			things, to be somewhat extreme, denying any internal and universal 
			grammatical and lexical systems on one hand (hypothesis 2.) or 
			averring that all thought is determined by language (hypothesis 1.).<br />
			The issue can be summarised as either:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style4">
				<li>The structure of human thought determines how a language 
				develops and is structured<br />
				or</li>
				<li>The structure of language determines human thought</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You don't have to choose.&nbsp; It may be the case that both 
			hypotheses are correct.&nbsp; On one hand there are universals of 
			thought that determine, e.g., that all languages distinguish between 
			noun and verb phrases and so on and that any language which evolves 
			determines the way people think about the world and that, in turn, determines 
			how they <strong><em>can</em></strong> think about the world.</p>

					<h2>Theorists</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Theorists fall into two main camps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Those who accept that language wholly or partially 
				determines how we think: no language = no thought</li>
				<li>Those who see language as emerging from the basic structures 
				of the human mind: language structure = inherent mental 
				structure.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>They cannot both be right.&nbsp; Here are some ideas from both 
			camps, divided into the lingualists who take a language-first view 
			of human thought and the cognitivists (often simply termed 
			Chomskyists) who take the second view.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Language determines thought<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.&nbsp; This is something of a misnomer 
				in that Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf did not collaborate on 
				any publication and were not working together.&nbsp; The hypothesis 
				was named by a student of Sapir.<br />One quotation will suffice to get a feeling for what was said:<p class="auto-style59">
					<span class="style_black">We dissect nature along lines laid 
				down by our native language. The categories and types that we 
				isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because 
				they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the 
				world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions which 
				has to be organized by our minds—and this means largely by the 
				linguistic systems of our minds. We cut nature up, organize it 
				into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely 
				because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this 
				way—an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and 
				is codified in the patterns of our language.<br />
					<span class="auto-style7">Whorf and Carroll, 1956:213</span></span></p>
					</li>
					<li>Vygotsky:<br />Lev Vygotsky was an early advocate of language determining thought.&nbsp; 
			Here's what he said:<p class="auto-style59">Thought is not merely expressed in words; it 
			comes into existence through them.<br /><span class="auto-style64">Vygotsky, 1986:214</span><br />Consciousness is reflected in a word as the sun in a drop of water. 
			A word relates to consciousness as a living cell relates to a whole 
			organism, as an atom relates to the universe. A word is a microcosm 
			of human consciousness.<br /><span class="auto-style7">Op cit.:256</span></p>
					</li>
					<li>Other writers:<br />
			Others, non-professional linguists for the most part, have had 
			similar thoughts on the topic.&nbsp; Here's a bit from Percy Bysshe 
			Shelley in Prometheus Unbound:<br />
					<span class="auto-style59">He gave man speech, and speech created thought, Which is the measure 
			of the universe</span><br />
			Sapir and Whorf were not, of course, the first to make a connection 
			between language and thought, the first determining the second.&nbsp; 
			They were following a long tradition.&nbsp; Herbert von Humboldt, a 
			German Romantic philosopher stated in 1820 that:<br />
					<span class="auto-style59">The diversity of languages is not a diversity of signs and sounds 
			but a diversity of views of the world.</span><br />but this was in an effort to assert that western languages were 
			superior and that led to a superior social condition.</li>
					<li>Ubiquity:<br />
					There are many, usually not professional or informed 
					linguists for whom the connection between thought and 
					language appears so obvious that no support for the theory 
					is offered.&nbsp; The literature, both lay and academic, it 
					littered with assumptions such as<p class="auto-style59">Each language is a way of 
					thinking, expressing and perceiving the world.<br />
					<span class="auto-style7">(Parara, 2021)</span></p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Thought 
			determines language<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>Chomsky was a very influential thinker who asserted (among much 
			else) that language and language structure springs from the innate, 
			biologically determined nature of the human mind.&nbsp; In this view, the 
			nature of language is dependent on the inherent structure of the 
			mind.&nbsp; Hence, the positing of a universal grammar which encompasses 
			all human languages and grows out of the structure of the mind.<br />In that we have deliberately used the word human to classify 
				language.&nbsp; It is interesting to speculate what a non-human 
				language might be like.&nbsp; There's an article on this site 
				doing just that.&nbsp;
					<a href="../../articles/articles1/ELT_Concourse_How_to_speak_to_an_alien.pdf" target="_blank">Get it here</a>.</li>
					<li>Stephen Pinker is another influential thinker in the same school and 
			he stated:<p class="auto-style59">The idea that thought is the same thing as language is an 
			example of what can be called a conventional absurdity: a statement 
			that goes against all common sense but that everyone believes 
			because they dimly recall having heard it somewhere and because it 
			is so pregnant with implications.<br /><span class="auto-style7">Pinker, 2007:58-59</span></p>
			Earlier in the same text, he has:<p class="auto-style59">there is no scientific evidence 
			that languages dramatically shape their speakers' ways of thinking. 
			... The idea that language shapes thinking seemed plausible when 
			scientists were in the dark about how thinking works or even how to 
			study it. Now that cognitive scientists know how to think about 
			thinking, there is less of a temptation to equate it with language 
			just because words are more palpable than thoughts. By understanding 
			why linguistic determinism is wrong, we will be in a better position 
			to understand how language itself works<br />
					<span class="auto-style7">Op Cit.:57</span></p>
			Elsewhere (p82), Pinker puts the argument for mentalese, this way:<p class="auto-style59">Knowing a language, then, is knowing how to translate mentalese into 
			strings of words and vice versa.</p>
					The counter argument is that some languages do not have what many 
			would consider really fundamental categories such as <em>blue, leg, if
					</em>and <em>here</em>.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The two standpoints outlined here are not merely of theoretical 
			interest.&nbsp; In particular, many of the arguments around the use 
			of what is called gendered language in English start from an <em>a 
			priori</em> assumption that the structures of a language affect how 
			people think about male and female social roles and, moreover, that 
			it is possible to change how people think by reforming the language 
			they are compelled to use.<br />
			There is a guide on this site, linked below, to how languages handle 
			gender marking.</p>
			<p>A further consideration concerns the sociolinguistic concepts of
			<strong>restricted and elaborated codes</strong>.&nbsp; These 
			concepts of we owe to Bernstein (1971), who identified two varieties 
			of language available to its speakers:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Elaborated code is used most frequently in formal situations 
				and contains:<ol class="auto-style21">
					<li>a high proportion of subordinate clauses, using, for 
					example, conjunctions such as <em>although, so, because, in 
					order to</em> and conjuncts such as <em>accordingly, 
					subsequently, therefore</em> etc.<br />
					The use of such devices is generally terms hypotaxis (from 
					the Greek meaning to arrange below).</li>
					<li>passive verb clauses using, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was arrested<br />
					</em>instead of<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police took her away</em></li>
					<li>longer and more unusual adjective phrases such as <em>
					the ancient, British people</em>, <em>a difficult but 
					important issue</em> etc.</li>
					<li>less common adverbs, adverb phrases and adverbials such 
					as <em>regrettably, to my astonishment, not wholly 
					surprisingly, without much difficulty</em> etc.</li>
					<li>the use of abstract nominalisation such as <em>creation, 
					emergency, issues, calculations</em> 
					and so on.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Restricted code is used in less formal settings and is 
				characterised by:<ol class="auto-style21">
					<li>The use of simpler, and often repeated coordinating 
					rather than subordinating conjunctions such as <em>and, 
					then, but </em>etc and conjuncts such as <em>first, next, 
					later</em> etc.<br />
					This is often referred to as the use of parataxis (from the 
					Greek meaning to arrange side by side).</li>
					<li>The avoidance of passive structures and a consequent 
					increase in the use of subject pronouns such as <em>he, she, 
					they</em> etc.</li>
					<li>The use of tag questions to elicit agreement such as <em>
					wouldn't they?, didn't we?</em> etc.</li>
					<li>Simple adjectives and the avoidance of long adjective 
					phrases so we find more occurrences of, e.g., <em>nice, 
					lovely, pretty, good, bad</em> etc. rather than <em>
					pleasing, beautiful, stunning, acceptable, disrespectful</em> 
					etc.</li>
					<li>the use of a greater number of concrete nominalisations 
					such as <em>road, car, house, room </em>etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>More controversially, Bernstein and others have proposed that the 
			ability to use either code depending on the appropriacy of the 
			setting and the needs of the moment is restricted to middle-class 
			children whereas working-class children are confined in general to 
			the use of restricted code and are therefore educationally and 
			career-wise disadvantaged because elaborated code structures and 
			lexis are required to encode complex relationships.&nbsp; In that 
			view, working-class children suffer from cognitive deficiency 
			because they are unable to think about more abstract and difficult 
			ideas.<br />
			This is a view most strongly held by those who believe that thought 
			is dependent on language but on that hypothesis, the jury is still 
			considering its verdict.<br />
			This assertion has been disputed by, e.g., Labov, who presented 
			evidence that even in restricted code the encoding of complex and 
			subtle ideas is perfectly possible, indeed, routinely achieved and 
			no cognitive deficiency can be identified.&nbsp; In this view, 
			elaborated code use is simply a social convention and has nothing to 
			do with restrictions in cognitive abilities.<br />
			It will not have escaped your notice the the characteristics of 
			restricted code are often noticeable in the speech of learners of 
			English.</p>

			<p>To add to the mix, many theorists claim that the 
			environment in which a language is born, evolves and changes is 
			determined by the cultural needs of the speakers.&nbsp; This is 
			particularly, but not solely, relevant to the study of lexis.<br />
			The theory here is that a language evolves and adapts to the 
			exigencies of the environment and culture in which it has developed 
			and encodes not all possible thought but those which its speakers 
			need to survive and prosper.&nbsp; Changes in location and ways of 
			surviving will be mirrored in changes in the language.<br />

			<h3>Kinship</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>If you are born into a culture in which kinship 
			relationships are particularly important, it will be unsurprising if 
			your first language has an elaborate and complex way of expressing 
			familial relationships.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>In English a distinction is made between siblings and 
				cousins so the children of one's mother's siblings or father's 
				siblings, 
				of either sex, are distinguished lexically from the children of 
				one's parents.&nbsp; Hence we distinguish between <em>brother, 
				sister</em> and <em>cousin</em>.&nbsp; Hawaiian, on the other hand, does not make 
				this distinction so brothers and sisters are referred to in the 
				same way as cousins.&nbsp; English does not distinguish between 
				male and female cousins but, for example, German and other 
				Germanic languages do, so the German for a female cousin (<em>die Kusine</em>) and a male cousin (<em>der Vetter</em>) may be used.<br />
				Other languages do things differently and Sudanese, for example, 
				makes distinctions between the children of one's mother's 
				sister, one's mother's brother, one's father's sister and one's 
				father's brother, producing a four-way distinction not seen in 
				many languages.</li>
				<li>English has only one word for a male sibling, <em>brother</em>, 
				but other languages, including Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Turkish, 
				Sinhalese, Chinese languages, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, 
				Tagalog, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Nepalese, and more distinguish 
				between older and younger brothers or sisters, having different terms to 
				refer to each.</li>
				<li>English uses the catchall term <em>nephew</em> to refer to 
				any male child of a sibling and does not distinguish between 
				blood relationships and relationships by marriage in this 
				respect or between the sexes of the sibling parent.&nbsp; So, in 
				English, a nephew may be the son of your sister or the son of 
				your brother or the son of the spouse of either of them.&nbsp; Other 
				languages may make distinctions between the children of one's 
				sister or brother and between nephews who are older than oneself 
				or younger.</li>
				<li>
			Tamil, an ancient South Indian language has specific kinship 
			terms rendered by only two lexemes in English:<br />
			<em>aunt</em>: <em>chitthi </em>(mother's younger sister)<em>, periyamma </em>
			(mother's elder sister)<em>, mami </em>(uncle’s wife)<em>.<br />
			uncle: chithappa </em>(father's younger brother)<em>, periyappa </em>
			(father's elder brother).</li>
				<li>
				Other languages may be even <strong>less</strong> informative than English.&nbsp; Some 
			Hawaiian languages, for example, do not distinguish between sibling 
			and cousin at all.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Although all languages are capable in theory of expressing any 
			thought, the constraints produced by language in terms of kinship 
			are clear.&nbsp; Most speakers of English, for example, are 
			unconcerned whether someone's sister is older or younger than the 
			person in question but this is clearly significant information in 
			other cultures and reflected in the language forms.</p>

			<p>Evidence for culturally determined names for animals comes

				and, instead, has three broad categories: edible, harmful and 
				those which are useless (being neither edible nor harmful) (Op 
				cit:39).</li>
				<li>English and many other languages 
				share a categorisation into plants and animals because that is 
				useful in the cultures in which the languages developed and, 
				despite evidence from biological sciences to the contrary, the 
				distinction is adhered to by most speakers of these languages.&nbsp; 
				In fact, the actual genetic relationships reveal a fourfold 
				distinction between animals, fungi, slime moulds and plants.&nbsp; 
				The latter distinctions may be more scientifically accurate but 
				the former, folk taxonomy is more useful for day-to-day 
				purposes.<br />
				It is also the case that English and thousands of other 
				languages distinguish three kinds of animals: mammals, birds and 
				reptiles but this, too, is inaccurate folk taxonomy.&nbsp; The 
				real distinction should show a major split between animals and 
				reptiles with turtles, lizards and birds forming 
				sub-categories of reptiles.&nbsp; Everyday experience, however, 
				does not lead most people to refer to birds as reptiles (or 
				dinosaurs).</li>
				<li>People whose habitat and culture are 
				deeply reliant on seafood and fishing will often refer to fish 
				not by appearance (as many languages do) but by habitat, method 
				of trapping and usefulness as food.</li>
				<li>People living in tropical rainforests 
				in, e.g., in Venezuela, may have as many as 17,000 words to describe 
				elements of the world around them, most of which cannot be 
				translated easily into any other than a local indigenous 
				language.</li>
				<li>Even English, when it matters, has 
				extensive words for animals above and beyond those used by 
				ignorant town dwellers.&nbsp; For example, most English speakers 
				can distinguish between <em>sheep, ewe, lamb</em> and <em>ram</em> 
				but few would be able to define <em>wether, tup, hogget, 
				shearling, gimmer, theave</em> or <em>teg, </em>because 
				they don't need to do that.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Again, the conclusion has been reached by some that the language 
			a speech community uses develops to include concepts which are 
			important at the time and loses those which are less significant as 
			social changes come into effect.<br />
			Unless one is a horse breeder it is unlikely in modern 
			English-speaking settings that there is a need to distinguish 
			between <em>colt</em> to describe a young male horses, <em>foal</em> 
			for a horse of either sex under one year old, a <em>yearling</em>, a
			<em>filly</em>, a <em>mare</em>, a <em>stallion</em> or a <em>
			gelding</em>.<br />
			Such was not the case, arguably, before the advent of transport 
			systems unreliant on horses.</p>

			<p>This does not refer to the way that people draw complex diagrams 
			as a way of understanding and remembering facts.&nbsp; It is to do 
			with how we conceptualise distances, relative positions and 
			directions of travel.&nbsp; In other words, we are considering maps 
			in the mind.<br />
			Here are some examples:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>In the majority of cultures, distance 
				is measured in a linear fashion (in <em>miles, chains, rods, 
				furlongs, kilometres, leagues, verst</em> 
				etc.) but in the languages of people who live in unforgiving and 
				rugged landscapes, distances may be measured in the amount of 
				time and effort it takes to get from A to B, not in how far they 
				are apart.<br />
				For example Sherpa speakers in Nepal are more interested in the 
				vertical distance between places than the horizontal because 
				that better describes the time and effort needed to travel 
				between them.&nbsp; Words in such languages do not readily 
				translate into the linear concepts used by other languages.</li>
				<li>In some languages, rather than using 
				speaker-centric views of place such as <em>behind, left, right, 
				in front</em> etc., speakers will adopt objective measures 
				corresponding to compass points (<em>north, west</em> etc.), points 
				relative to wind directions or whether the speaker is referring 
				to movement towards or away from land, upstream on a river or 
				down.</li>
				<li>Even a simple verb such as <em>go</em> 
				may have various renditions depending on the speakers' view of 
				the action.&nbsp; A Vanuatuan language, for example, has three 
				forms of the verb depending on whether one is travelling by boat 
				or on land, towards or away from the sea, upwards or downwards.&nbsp; 
				Additionally, suffixation is used to denote both direction and 
				destination, resulting in no fewer than nine alternative 
				renditions of the verbs <em>go</em> and <em>come</em>.&nbsp; 
				Before using either verb, speakers need to consider a range of 
				factors unknown to speakers of many other languages.<br />
				Tuvan, a Siberian language, selects from five possible words for
				<em>go</em> dependent on whether one is ascending or descending, 
				going up- or down-stream, on foot or on horseback.<br />
				Even in modern German, there is a distinction between the 
				concept of travelling by vehicle (<em>fahren</em>) or on foot (<em>gehen</em>) 
				which is absent in English.&nbsp; Speakers of English use the 
				verb <em>go</em> for either mode of transport and reserve the 
				verb <em>drive</em> for the specific activity of controlling a 
				vehicle.&nbsp; So, for example, in German:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to the shops</em><br />
				implies <em>walking</em> but in English it does not.</li>
				<li>Strikingly, cultural demands in living in large and 
				inhospitable landscapes have, it seems, provided the people who 
				live there with <span class="style_black"><em>enhanced orientation 
				skills</em></span> (Harrison, op cit:131).&nbsp; He goes on to 
				discuss the ways in which speakers of some languages are able 
				to locate themselves and well-known (but invisible) landmarks 
				with extraordinary precision and accuracy whereas speakers of 
				English and many other languages become disoriented and lost within a matter of a few 
				hundred yards into unknown territory.<br />
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If this is true, far from 
				mental images being expressed in language or language 
				determining mental images, the effect of culture and the 
				language which arose to operate within it has been to 
				change cognitive processes directly.&nbsp; All the examples 
			above imply that before a speaker of a language can use concepts 
			such as these he or she is forced to consider a range of different 
			variables.</p>
			<p>If, as some assert, thought is independent of language, it 
			becomes difficult to reconcile how different ways of expressing 
			simple concepts have originated and persist.</p>

			<p>There is some agreement that humans have an innate number sense.&nbsp; 
			Evidence for this is the fact that even very small babies show 
			surprise when two puppets are shown, another added and then only one 
			is revealed at the end, running counter to the assumption that 2 + 1 
			= 3.<br />
			Most large, especially western, languages use a base 10 to calculate 
			so, for example, 9 + 3 is determined as 10 + 2 or 12.<br />
			(Non-mathematicians may like to know that most of us count in base 
			10 which means simply that as soon as one gets above 9, it is 
			necessary to shift to the next unit up and begin again from 1.&nbsp; 
			Hence, 8 + 8 is perceived as 8 + 2, making 10 and then the remainder 
			(6) being placed in the empty column resulting in 16.&nbsp; If 
			people had 6 rather than 10 fingers we might use base 6, in which 
			case 8 would be express as 12 (we have filled the left-hand slot 
			when we get to 6 and placed a 1 in the left-hand slot and the 
			remainder (2) in the right-hand slot.&nbsp; So the sum 8 + 8 will be 
			the same as imagining 12 + 12 and the result will be 24.<br />
			As it turns out, this is not just an exercise in mathematics because 
			some Niger-Congo languages and some from Papua New Guinea do, in 
			fact, have base-6 mathematics systems.<br />
			Those old enough to remember the time when a shilling in Britain 
			(and elsewhere) was divided into 12 pennies will be familiar with 
			base-12 mathematics in which, for example, a sum such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add 1 shilling and 10 pence to 2 shillings and 4 pence (in 
			old notation, 1s.10d + 2s.4d)<br />
			means filling the first, right-hand slot when 12 is reached and 
			placing 1 in the next slot to the left so we get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 shillings (1 + 2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plus 14 pence (10 + 4) = 1 shilling (12 pence) and a 
			remainder of 2 pence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add 1 more shilling to the left-hand slot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place the 2 pence in the right-hand slot<br />
			The answer is, therefore, 4 shillings (the original 1 + 2 with the 
			extra 1) and the remainder (2 pence).&nbsp; 4 shillings and 2 pence.<br />
			That would have been written as 4/2 or 4s.2d.)</p>
			<p>There 
			are other possibilities and evidence for the effects of language on 
			mathematical ability:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>A Californian indigenous language, 
				Yuke, counts in base 4 because speakers use the gaps between the 
				fingers rather than the tips of the fingers to calculate while a 
				New Guinean language, Arapesh uses base 6, counting all the 
				fingers, the thumb and the thumb joint.&nbsp; Base 20 systems 
				are widely reported in which, e.g., 63 is expressed as <em>three 
				x base + 3</em> whereas in English and most languages it is 
				expressed as 6 x base (60) + 3.<br />
				If this is true, far from 
				mental images being expressed in language or language 
				determining mental images, the effect of culture and the 
				language which arose to operate within it has been to 
				change cognitive processes directly.<br />
				It is common for the word <em>hand</em> to denote the integer 5.</li>
				<li>Most languages use a simple 
				multiplication or addition system for larger numbers, so we get, 
				e.g., 37 expressed as 3 x 10 + 7, but not all do so.&nbsp; Some 
				languages use a system of over-counting which visualises where 
				on the way from the last set of 10we are on the way to the 
				next.&nbsp; For example, the number 22 may be expressed as <em>
				two towards 30</em>.</li>
				<li>Many large languages, including 
				Cantonese and Japanese have complex sets of classifiers obliging 
				their speakers to consider what it they are counting before they 
				can even begin.&nbsp; The numerals used to count people may 
				differ, therefore, from the numerals used to count books.</li>
				<li>One language, Aiome (a Ramu language of Papua New Guinea), uses only the 
				numbers one and two so 4 is expressed as <em>two and two</em> 
				and 5 as <em>two and two and one</em>, for example.&nbsp; 
				Speakers of such languages would find it cumbersome and possibly 
				impossible to deal with numbers higher than around 10.&nbsp; The 
				argument is that if the culture required them to do so, the 
				language would adapt to allow it.</li>
				<li>There is some evidence, reported in 
				Harrison, op cit.:190, that children whose languages are 
				explicit about the way bases work in mathematics such as 
				Mandarin and Welsh are quicker to grasp the essence of base-10 
				computing than those whose languages are more obscure in this 
				respect, such as English.&nbsp; In English, a number like <em>
				thirty-five</em> does not state what base is being used but 
				expressing the number as <em>three-tens and five</em> would make 
				the base explicit and, the argument goes, allow speakers better 
				access to the mathematical concept.&nbsp; That is exactly what 
				happens in Modern Welsh, Japanese, Korean and Chinese languages 
				is which the base is made explicit so 47 is expressed as <em>
				four-ten-seven</em>) and there is evidence from other studies 
				(e.g., Miura <em>et al</em>., 2016) that children whose first 
				language make the base explicit (Japanese and Korean in this 
				case) may perform better at tasks requiring them to identify 
				place values.<br />
				Another study (Dowker and Roberts, 2015) showed that children 
				taught mathematics in Welsh (which, in its modern form has a 
				transparent counting system, unlike English) performed better at 
				place-value tasks, especially for numbers over 20.<br />
				Their conclusion was that:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>... the regularity and 
				transparency of the Welsh counting system may help children not 
				only in learning the correspondence between written and oral 
				representations of number but also in the development of 
				non-verbal numerical magnitude representations.</em></span></li>
				<li>English happens to use an addition system that works by 
				adding the smaller number before the larger so we get, e.g. <em>nineteen</em> to represent 9 + 10 [<em>teen</em>].&nbsp; Other languages, 
				such as Spanish and Greek, do the reverse and add the smaller 
				number after the larger so 19 becomes <em>diecinueve</em> or <em>δεκαεννέα</em> [dekaennaya], for example, 
				or <em>ten-nine</em>.&nbsp; Doing the work 
				this way makes the base (10) explicit.</li>
				<li>The base of 10 used to be made explicit in most Germanic languages 
				such as English so, for example, the terms <em>eleven</em> and
				<em>twelve</em> are derived respectively from the Old English
				<em>enleofan</em> and <em>twelf</em> which mean respectively,
				<em>one left</em> and <em>two left</em> (i.e., having subtracted 
				the base 10).&nbsp; Old Norse, Old German and a range of other 
				languages had similar terms.&nbsp; Lithuanian (not a Germanic 
				language) also retains this system using it for all numbers up 
				to 19.</li>
				<li>Roman numerals work in the opposite way (one reason why they 
				are cumbersome for mathematics of even the simplest sort).&nbsp; 
				In that system, originally, the numbers up to 4 were expressed a 
				i, ii, iii, iiii and 5 was v with vi as 6, vii as 7, viii as 8 
				viiii as 9 until we get to x for 10.&nbsp; Only later was the 
				complication of reversing the mathematics and subtracting the 
				first symbol from the second resulting in iv for the old iiii 
				and ix for the old viiii.&nbsp; (The mental image requires the 
				understanding to be 1 before 5 and 1 before 10 respectively.)&nbsp; 
				The number 29 is therefore expressed in Latin numerals as xxix 
				meaning 10 + 10 + (10-1) = 29.<br />To cut down on the cumbersomeness of the system, it was 
				necessary to invent symbols for 50 (L), 100 (C), 500 (D) and 
				1000 (M).&nbsp; This still makes things difficult as a number 
				such as 2,754 has to be written as MMDCCLIV and higher numbers, 
				e.g., 27,548 become almost impossible to express.<br />Because the Roman system was in use in Europe long after the 
				demise of the Roman Empire, this awkwardness was overcome by a 
				very complex system of place bars over symbols to represent 
				multiples of 1000 thereof so, for example:<table cellspacing="0">
					<tr>
						<td>IV</td>
						<td class="auto-style63">=</td>
						<td class="auto-style62">4</td>

				</table>
				and so on.&nbsp; There has been some speculation that this 
				numeral system held back western science <strong>and thinking
				</strong>by many hundreds of years because of its inability to 
				handle large numbers.<br />The Roman system also had no concept of the zero and that was 
				not introduced into European thinking until the 12th century.&nbsp; 
				It was many hundreds of years later before it was in common use.&nbsp; 
				The inability to express the concept in words or numerals 
				arguably disabled European mathematical thought for nearly 1000 
				years.<br />According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the first use of 
				the word <em>zero</em> was in 1598.<br />If you have no word for 0, perhaps you have no way of thinking 
				about 0.</li>
				<li>Many languages (but not all) use a multiplication system, 
				too, taking the base, multiplying by the appropriate number and 
				then adding the smaller number so, e.g., in English 45 is 
				expressed as (4 x 10) + 5 (<em>forty-five</em>).&nbsp; Other 
				Germanic languages, Dutch and German, for example, see things 
				slightly differently and render 45 as 4 + (4 x 10) (<em>vyf en 
				veertig</em> in Dutch) and 93 as <em>dreiundneunzig</em> 
				(German).<br />French mixes systems and reverts to a base 20 for numbers above 
				79 and then adds in the numbers above 10 to get to, e.g. <em>quatre-vingt-dix-sept</em> (97) which is (4 x 20) + (10 + 7).</li>
				<li>The Pirahã language of Brazil has 
				often been cited as evidence of the effect of language on 
				thought.&nbsp; The language has no terms at all for numbers 
				higher than 3 and the existence of even terms for <em>one</em> 
				and <em>two</em> is in doubt.&nbsp; Consequently, it is 
				asserted, speakers of the language are unable to carry out quite 
				simple mathematical procedures such as taking 6 away from 10.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Counting systems would, on the face of it, provide strong 
			evidence for the way in which linguistic constraints impact the 
			ability to think in certain ways.<br />
			It has been averred, for example, that children educated in Britain 
			prior to the decimalisation of the currency in 1971 were more 
			comfortable operating in base 12 (pennies in a shilling) and base 20 
			(shillings in a pound) and would find adding 7 shillings and 10 
			pence to 3 pounds, 15 shillings and 4 pence quite a simple task 
			beyond similar children used only to dealing with base 10 
			mathematics.&nbsp; (The answer = 4 pounds, 3 shillings and 2 pence, 
			or £4.3s.2d, by the way.)<br />
			Even today, British people are probably more comfortable operating 
			in base 3 (feet and yards) and some to working with base 16 (ounces 
			and pounds) than others from base-10 measuring systems.&nbsp; This 
			is, arguably, an effect of language on thought.</p>

			<p class="nomarginbottom">Humans have developed ways of keeping track of time for at least 
			40,000 years and quite likely longer.&nbsp; How they have done it 
			varies from time to time and culture to culture and this may 
			influence how people perceive time and how they cut it up into 
			manageable chunks.&nbsp; That, of course, will have implications for 
			things like tense structures and other ways in which verb forms 
			express time.</p>
			<p class="auto-style59">people in different cultures or groups have 
			been shown to differ in whether they think of time as stationary or 
			moving, limited or open-ended, horizontal or vertical, oriented from 
			left to right, right to left, front to back, back to front, east to 
			west, and so on.<br />
			<span class="auto-style7">Fuhrman, <em>et al</em>, 2011:1306</span></p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>English and many other European languages views time 
				horizontally as if it were moving from behind us to in front of 
				us.&nbsp; In English, this generates expressions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm behind time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm looking forward to seeing you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's work on until the end of the day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've put the argument behind us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking back, I see you are right</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Other languages, such as Mandarin, view time vertically: meaning 
				that its speakers perceive time as moving from above to below 
				us.&nbsp; This generates, roughly translated, expressions such 
				as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The up month</em> (instead of <em>the next month</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The down semester</em> (instead of <em>the last semester</em>)<br />
				and so on.<br />
				Fuhrman <em>et al </em>conclude (op cit.:1325):<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>It appears that patterns in 
				language and culture can induce differences in thought in even 
				such fundamental conceptual domains as time.</em></span></li>
				<li>English and many other languages, such as Swedish and German view time 
				in terms of distance so we have expressions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a long time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a short pause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a lengthy job</em><br />
				etc., 
				all of which can be translated directly.<br />
				But there is evidence that other languages, such as Greek and 
				Spanish, view time in terms of size so the equivalent expressions 
				would be<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a big time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a small pause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a large job</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				It demands an effort of will to begin to think of time as 
				proceeding from left to right and in terms of length rather than 
				size.&nbsp; Trying to do both of these things if your first 
				language does neither is truly challenging.</li>
				<li>Not all languages have a tense distinctions in the way verbs 
				are used, relying instead on adverbials and aspect markers to 
				conceptualise time.&nbsp; Most Chinese languages fall into this 
				bracket and speakers may struggle to see how indications of time 
				need to be expressed through changes to verb forms.</li>
				<li>Some languages, such as French and other Romance languages, 
				distinguish between a past incomplete event (the imperfective)&nbsp;and a past complete event (the perfective) which English and 
				many other Germanic languages do not do.</li>
				<li>English has two fundamental tense types not recognised in 
				many other languages: relative and absolute tenses.&nbsp; English 
				distinguishes relative or relational tense forms, such as the present perfect 
				and the past perfect which link two events in time (the present 
				to the past and the past to a time before the past, 
				respectively) from absolute tenses such as the past simple and 
				future with <em>will</em> which set events at particular times 
				independently of other events..&nbsp; Other languages may rely 
				solely on absolute tense forms and their speakers will struggle 
				to conceptualise relative aspects of tenses.</li>
				<li>Some languages reserve certain tense forms for today only 
				and have separate verb forms for times after and before today.</li>
				<li>Some languages (such as Italian) distinguish between the 
				recent and distant past.</li>
				<li>Today, most cultures around the world have adopted the 
				modern second, minute, hour (all base 60), day (base 24), week 
				(base 7), month (base 12) and year of 364.25 days (roughly) but that is 
				not the only way to reckon time and many indigenous languages 
				still rely on more mobile units, such as a set of four to nine 
				days centred around today or a lunar cycle of 13 months in a 
				year.<br />
				Even English and many other western languages actually does not 
				have a single word to denote a period of 24 hours because the 
				sense of <em>day</em> includes the sense of <em>light</em>.&nbsp; 
				Hence, of course, <em>during the day</em> does not include the 
				night but two days from now is 48 hours, not just two periods of 
				daylight.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Grasping the ways in which the language you are learning divides 
			time and sets events and states in time past, present or future is 
			not easy.&nbsp; It often requires a different way to conceptualise 
			events and states.<br />
			The problems that many learners encounter with English temporal 
			concepts often arise from the ways in which aspect and relative 
			forms are used in English.&nbsp; This is especially true for 
			speakers of languages which do not focus at all on aspect and rely 
			entirely on context and co-text to signal perfect, progressive, 
			iterative and other aspects.</p>

			<p>It was argued at the outset that the hypotheses one accepts will 
			affect how one views the process of acquiring or learning a new 
			language.&nbsp; It is either learning how to express universal ideas 
			in a new language or it is a process of learning to think in new 
			ways because the language one is learning deals differently with the 
			world.<br />
			It need not be dichotomised in such simple terms, fond as theorists 
			are of creating unsustainable either-or distinctions.</p>
			<p>The extreme form of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis has probably been 
			abandoned for good but the jury is still out on whether and to what 
			extent language exerts constraints on the ways in which the people 
			who speak them think.&nbsp; Despite Pinker's dismissal of the 
			Sapir-Whorf hypothesis as "<span class="style_black"><em>wrong, all wrong</em></span>" (op cit:57), there is 
			evidence, not least from the sadly diminishing number of indigenous 
			languages around the world, that the ways one's language encapsulates 
			real-world states and events really does enhance or diminish one's 
			ability to do certain types of thinking.<br />
			One alternative view is that languages reflect the things that their 
			speakers need to talk about and as new needs arise, language alters 
			to allow speech to reflect a changed reality.</p>
			<p>Here are some examples of some serious implications for 
			language learning and using:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Terminology<br />
				If, for example, my 
			language can encode <em>a male domesticated reindeer in its third year 
			and first mating season, but not yet ready for mating</em> in a single 
			word, <em>d&ouml;ng&uuml;r</em>, as the Tofa language of Siberia allows me to do 
			(Harrison, op cit:57), do I have a better way to think about 
			reindeer of this sort than the clumsy circumlocution in English does 
			not allow?<br />
			On the other hand, if my language lacks a way of expressing numbers 
			above 10 (or in extreme cases, numbers greater than two) is my 
			ability to do mathematics severely limited by the fact?&nbsp; If 
			language affects mathematical abilities across cultures, it must 
			be because we have learned it that way, not because language ability 
			is innate.</li>
				<li>Concepts<br />
				One of the most difficult systems for speakers of some languages 
			to acquire in English is, notoriously, the article system.&nbsp; 
			Those who suggest language and thought are separate domains would 
			aver that this is simply because the system is difficult to learn 
			yet speakers of, e.g., German have far fewer difficulties than 
			speakers of Russian.&nbsp; Those who see clear connections between 
			language and thought might respond that it is precisely because some 
			languages do not require a speaker to consider the notions of 
			specificity and indefiniteness that lie at the heart of the English 
			article meaning system so they need to learn to think differently 
			about the world to get it right.&nbsp; That is not easy.</li>
				<li>Classification<br />
				In a connected domain, it is difficult for English speakers to 
			acquire the complex system of classifiers that exist in many 
			languages simply because English speakers are not habituated to 
			think about the physical and social characteristics of what they are 
			counting when they say, e.g., <em>ten people</em> or <em>ten tables</em>.<br />
				On the other hand, English partitive expressions such:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a rasher of bacon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a slice of bread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a grain of sand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a speck of dust</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a heap of work</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				become more accessible to speakers whose languages classify 
				extensively.</li>
				<li>Number and case<br />
				If your language demands that you consider the number of a 
				noun and its function grammatically in a clause (as subject, 
				object, addressee, location etc.) before you select the right 
				forms, you are obliged to consider the world very differently 
				from someone whose language demands no such choices.<br />
				The misuse of pronouns is an obvious consequence as is the loss 
				of focus on word ordering which, in a language such as English, 
				often determines which is the subject and which the object of a 
				verb.</li>
				<li>Countability<br />
				If, as in English, you are required to consider whether a 
				noun is to be understood as a mass concept or a countable one 
				before you can select the correct determiner (e.g., <em>a few</em> vs. <em>a little</em>) 
			you will have difficulties doing so if your own language makes no 
			such distinction.</li>
				<li>Gender<br />
				Many languages have gender systems which often determine how other 
			structures agree with the noun in question.&nbsp; French has two and 
			these are reflected, for example, in adjective endings and the forms 
			of determiners such as the articles.&nbsp; Some languages have as 
			many as five or more separate genders and not all distinguish 
			masculine from feminine from neuter.&nbsp;
			There is some evidence that languages such as French and German that 
			arbitrarily classify, e.g., the noun<em> fork</em> as feminine will apply 
			adjectives to an example of it differently from those whose 
			languages make it masculine or genderless (Spanish and English, for 
			example).<br />
				Referring to a fork as <em>she</em> is a natural consequence of 
				thinking of it as feminine and, maybe, calling the moon <em>
				handsome</em> rather than <em>beautiful</em> may be another 
				consequence of referring to it as masculine.</li>
				<li>Metaphor<br />
				Some metaphorical uses in English are so common as to pass 
				almost unnoticed but there is ample evidence that parallel 
				notions are not universal in all languages.&nbsp; English, for 
				example, often equates:<br />
				argument with warfare so we:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shoot down arguments<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attack weaknesses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defend ideas</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				life with a journey so we:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are on the road to success<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getting on with life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making onward progress</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				For more in this area, see the guide to synonymy and related 
				concepts, linked below.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>On the other hand, there is ample evidence to suggest that humans 
			are genetically equipped to learn language (any language) and that 
			babies do not learn by imitation or trial and error alone.&nbsp; 
			Word and phrase categories are often cited in this respect as 
			elements of a universal grammar and the notions of noun phrase, verb 
			phrase and so on are probably truly universal.&nbsp; However, some 
			languages (such as Moken, an Austronesian language) seem to get by happily without anything 
			like an adjective phrase as speakers of other languages would 
			understand the item.</p>

			<p>What if all the hypotheses are right (or none of them)?&nbsp; 
			Because the jury is still out (and may remain so for some time) 
			when trying to reach a verdict on whether:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style4">
				<li>Language determines thought</li>
				<li>Language influences thought</li>
				<li>Thought determines language</li>
				<li>Language categories and forms are innate</li>
				<li>Languages share a common universal grammar</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and allied questions, it would be perilous to ignore the 
			classroom consequences.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>If hypothesis a. is correct, we need to do more than concept 
				check (because checking a concept your learners do 
				not have and can probably only grasp with a great deal of effort 
				and exposure is possibly futile).&nbsp; It seems sensible to suggest, 
				instead, that we supply a great deal of real-life communicative 
				practice to help our learners internalise concepts that are 
				outside their current mental schemata.</li>
				<li>If this weaker form, hypothesis b. is correct, then the same 
				considerations apply but concept checking becomes more valuable 
				because an influence, however strong, can be overcome with some 
				effort and application in a way that a truly determining factor 
				cannot.</li>
				<li>If hypotheses c., d. and e. are correct (even partially), 
				then we need to single out the innate categories of universal 
				grammar and the human-wide ways of conceptualising the universe 
				for special attention.&nbsp; This may mean, for example, 
				focusing on the universal concepts of verb, noun, preposition 
				and adjective phrases (unless, of course, one's learners happen 
				to be speakers of languages like Moken which does not have the 
				last of these).</li>
				<li>If hypothesis e. is correct then Pinker is right when he 
				states, following Chomsky:<p class="auto-style59">According to Chomsky, a visiting 
				Martian scientist would surely conclude that aside from their 
				mutually unintelligible vocabularies, Earthlings speak a single 
				language<br />
				<span class="auto-style64">Op cit: 232</span></p>
				However, studies in comparative linguistics reveal that the 
				existence of language universals is questionable.<br />
				Evans &amp; 
				Levinson 
				put it this way:<p class="auto-style59">Languages are much more diverse in 
				structure than cognitive scientists generally appreciate. A 
				widespread assumption among cognitive scientists, growing out of 
				the generative tradition in linguistics, is that all languages 
				are English-like, but with different sound systems and 
				vocabularies. The true picture is very different: languages 
				differ so fundamentally from one another at every level of 
				description (sound, grammar, lexicon, meaning) that it is very 
				hard to find any single structural property they share. The 
				claims of Universal Grammar, we will argue, are either 
				empirically false, unfalsifiable, or misleading in that they 
				refer to tendencies rather than strict universals.<br />

			<p>So, is it a matter of <em>Take your pick</em>?<br />
			To some extent, yes.&nbsp; If, for example</p>
			<ol class="auto-style57">
				<li>You are teaching a multilingual group of learners whose 
				first languages are very diverse, you may well take the view 
				that focusing on language difference will only be partially 
				relevant part of the time.&nbsp; In this case, you may be better 
				advised to focus on elements of supposedly universal grammar 
				which you believe will be commonalities in the group.&nbsp; That 
				will include, <em>inter alia</em>, a focus on word and phrase 
				class, case and so on.</li>
				<li>You are teaching a mono-lingual group or a group of learners 
				whose languages share characteristics (such as Indo-European 
				languages) you could take the view that a focus on particular ways 
				of thinking and language differences is a productive way to 
				proceed.&nbsp; This may, for example, take the form of a focus 
				on how English conceptualises time, space and number as well as 
				on issues such as deixis.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is, some would say, an empirical approach that needs to be 
			taken because there is, as yet, no consensus concerning which 
			view(s) of the connections between language, thought and culture 
			is/are correct.<br />
			Others might see it as unprincipled eclecticism, of course.</p>
