			<p>There are two different ways to use these:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>As input materials:<br />
				Language teachers have long used these aids and, with DVD players 
			and CD players, they have become easier to use.&nbsp; The trick is 
			to be fully acquainted with the equipment so you don't waste time 
			playing with the controls and trying to find the bit on the CD you 
			want to play.&nbsp; Practise.<br />
			Beware, too, of overly long sequences.&nbsp; The maximum is around 5 
			minutes before audio recordings start to wash over people or video 
			recordings become just passively watching TV.&nbsp; At lower levels, 
				one minute is probably the limit.<br />
			You need to set the learners clear tasks to achieve before they 
			listen or watch, while they are listening or watching and after they 
			have listened and watched.&nbsp; Make sure there is a purpose to it.<br />
			These are aids, not substitutes for the teacher.</li>
				<li>To record learners' output:<br />
				This use needs a bit more care and expertise to set up but it 
				can be very rewarding to hear oneself speaking a foreign 
				language accurately and comprehensibly.&nbsp; On the other hand, 
				it can be acutely embarrassing to hear oneself speaking it 
				poorly and incomprehensibly.<br />
				Handle with care.</li>

			<p>Bringing real objects into the classroom can be engaging and 
			motivating (especially if the learners have brought them).&nbsp; 
			Consider, for example,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Real texts:<br />
				A letter / email from a friend or relative of yours or one of 
				the learners is immediately more intriguing than something made 
				up in a coursebook.</li>
				<li>Objects:<br />
				If your aim is to teach vocabulary for things like fruit, 
				stationery, colours, clothes etc. then having real objects to 
				talk about and describe is motivating and memorable.&nbsp; The 
				same applies to lots of adjective teaching, of course.</li>
				<li>Notices, adverts and mini-texts:<br />
				Many institutions have places for people to post notices.&nbsp; 
				Exploit them.</li>
				<li>Newspapers, brochures and magazines:<br />
				can form the basis for a huge range of lessons (not just those 
				focused on reading skills).&nbsp; Get your learners to gather 
				them, if possible.</li>
				<li>Don't forget that most of us carry 15 or so items with us at 
				all times.<br />
				In a class of ten, you have a potential 150 objects to talk 
				about, explain and describe.</li>
				<li>Personal things:<br />
				A useful set of lessons can be built around the learners 
				bringing to class a small object that is, in some way, 
				significant for them and explaining to others what it is, how 
				they acquired it and why it's significant.</li>
				<li>Even if you are teaching in a non-English speaking environment 
			(i.e., you are in the huge majority), there will usually be large 
			numbers of examples of English-language posters, signs and texts.<br />
			Get your learners to gather them up and exploit the language in the 
			classroom.<br />
			If you are fortunate enough to be teaching in an English-speaking 
			environment of course, the possibilities and opportunities to 
			interact with the language and its speakers are much greater.&nbsp; 
			Research projects, surveys, service encounters and so on are all 
			exploitable tasks.&nbsp; There is mileage, for example, in sending 
			learners to real service offices (such as estate or travel agencies) 
			to get real information.</li>

			<p>These are variously called self-access centres (SACs), learning 
			and resource centres (LRCs), often combined with libraries (see 
			above) and so on.&nbsp; We'll stick to the term Learning Centre.<br />
			Unlike a VLE, a learning centre has a physical existence.&nbsp; It 
			can be anything from a small cupboard to an elaborate multimedia 
			learning centre.</p>
			<p>Proponents of Learning Centres will often point to the 'facts' 
			that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>People learn better when they control the pace and type of 
				learning they do.</li>
				<li>Classroom learning involves being controlled by the pace and 
				interests of the majority of the learners (and the teacher) and 
				that depersonalises the experience.</li>
				<li>Learning centres encourage people to take responsibility for 
				their own learning and that democratises the process.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Even those less enthusiastic about Learning Centres will often 
			agree that they are very helpful resources to supplement what 
			happens in classrooms (or in VLEs, of course).</p>
			<p>What one finds in LCs varies dramatically and depends on the 
			resources available to the institution and its level of commitment 
			to the centre.&nbsp; Typically, however, one finds a mixture of 
			authentic, semi-authentic and contrived materials including:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Print-based materials such as self-study texts, 
				dictionaries, encyclopaedias, journals, magazines newspapers, 
				graded readers and so on</li>
				<li>Audio and video materials including recordings of TV and 
				radio programmes</li>
				<li>Computers with internet access along with tasks to perform 
				and work to do on line</li>
				<li>Quiet study areas and an area to relax and talk to 
				colleagues</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Often, as was mentioned above, LCs are combined with libraries.</p>
			<p>Using LCs requires a bit of thought.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Learners need advice, training and encouragement to take 
				advantage of the resources or they can become lost, disheartened 
				and bewildered.</li>
				<li>Many institutions provide explicit guidelines (sometimes 
				called learning threads) to help learners find appropriate 
				materials and resources.</li>
				<li>Some even provide individual counselling to help learners to 
				map out personal ways forward and plans for their own learning.</li>
			</ol>
