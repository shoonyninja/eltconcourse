						</strong>Published materials are designed to appeal to a

						As a result, the language presented in course materials 
						is often concerned with imaginary situations, characters 
						and places.&nbsp; It cannot be otherwise.<br />
						However, teaching materials designed by the teacher can 
						be specific to the context of the learners.&nbsp; You 
						can make materials which are about people the learners 
						know, places they are familiar with, situations in which 
						they may find themselves and even about the learners 
						themselves.&nbsp; This makes the material more engaging, 
						motivating and memorable.</td>

						Contemporariness<br />
						</strong>Published materials deliberately avoid anything 
						that is current and may, all too soon, become dated and 
						unbelievable.&nbsp; Reference to 10-year-old films, 
						pictures of people in dated fashions and so on all serve 
						to make some published materials seem irrelevant and 
						unbelievable.<br />
						Reference to current cultural phenomena, current people 
						in the news (or in the class) and current events can, on the other hand, 
						make materials engaging, relevant and lively.</td>

						Personalisation and focus<br />
						</strong>Materials writers and publishers are very 
						careful to avoid writing materials which are culturally 
						specific.&nbsp; Often, this limits them to the bland and 
						banal.&nbsp; You have no such limitations.<br />
						You can make materials specific to your learners in your 
						setting which focus on their needs.&nbsp; If, for 
						example, you teach in a mono-lingual setting, you can 
						make materials which focus on problems your learners 
						have caused by their first language or their cultures.&nbsp; 
						You can, of course, also make materials which focus very 
						precisely on what you have done recently in your lessons 
						and the targets you have set.&nbsp; (An added spin-off 
						here is that your learners will see that that you have 
						taken time and trouble to prepare.)</td>

					<h3>Text-based material</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>These are the simplest to make but there are still some important 
			considerations.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Fonts and text sizes<br />
				Large text in silly fonts can appear patronising for adults 
				(although children respond well sometimes).<br />
				Compare these, for example:<br />
				<img alt="fonts and illustrations" height="226" src="../imagesgraphics/fontsmaterials.png" width="450" /></li>
				<li>Images<br />
				Graphics appeal and are memorable but should reflect the content 
				of the text in some way (even metaphorically) so choose with 
				care.&nbsp; See the choices made on this page, for example.<br />
				Providing you are only using a picture for non-commercial 
				purposes with your class, there are no serious copyright issues.<br />
				Current estimates are that there are 350 billion images out here 
				on the web (and the number is rising fast).&nbsp; You should be able 
				to find something appropriate.</li>
				<li>Test and exercises<br />
				These sorts of materials can be very finely tuned and targeted 
				at exactly what the content of the lesson is.&nbsp; However, 
				they don't have to be dull and untidy.&nbsp; Compare these:<br />
				<img alt="gap-fillexamples" height="226" src="../imagesgraphics/gapfillexamplesmaterials.png" width="450" /><br />
				Notice:<ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li>The first text is handwritten and difficult, especially 
					given the level and especially for people whose first 
					language does not have a Roman script (i.e., most people).</li>
					<li>The gaps in the first text do not give a clue about what 
					should go in them and are too small for people to write in 
					terms like <span class="style_brown"><em>opposite</em></span> 
					or<em> <span class="style_brown">in front of</span></em>.</li>
					<li>The second text has a little illustration to provide the 
					instruction and allows the learners to decide whether or not 
					a preposition is appropriate (the first text invites an 
					error with <span class="style_brown"><em>fill __</em></span>).</li>
					<li>The second text also suggests how long and of how many 
					words the inserts should be and that helps a lot.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Purposes<br />
				Think very carefully about what you are going to use the text 
				for.<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>If you intend to project it, can it be read from the 
					back of the room?</li>
					<li>If you are going to ask the learners to read it 
					individually, is it the right length for the time you've 
					allowed?</li>
					<li>If you want people to read for a purpose, have you 
					provided / will you elicit one?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>

					<h3>Audio and video material</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Audio 
			and video materials are now quite simple to record and take little 
			time.&nbsp; They can be carefully targeted and are often more 
			intriguing and interesting if they contain recognisable voices and 
			images.<br />
			However, you need to consider issues here, too:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Quality</strong><br />
				Recording in a noisy environment or on rinky-dink equipment may 
				result in the unusable.&nbsp; It may sound OK when you play it 
				to yourself but you are going to be using it in a classroom and 
				may need extra volume for a large room.&nbsp; The louder it is, 
				the more the flaws are audible.<br />
				For video, in particular, if you plan to project a home-made 
				video, try it on the big screen to check for quality.</li>
				<li><strong>Naturalness</strong><br />
				Many people either freeze or become unnatural and sound false 
				when a microphone and/or camera is put in front of them.&nbsp; 
				Choose the colleagues with whom you want to make a recording 
				carefully and have a couple of practice run-throughs to set them 
				at ease.&nbsp; When you record, think about these questions and 
				if the answer to any is <em>No</em>, start again:<ol>
					<li>Are the speakers using natural contractions?</li>
					<li>Is the intonation too flat or exaggerated?</li>
					<li>Is the word stress clear (and accurate)?</li>
					<li>Are both speakers equally audible?</li>
					<li>Is the language natural, correct and appropriate?</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Purposes and time</strong><br />
				Are you taking an hour to prepare the first 5 minutes of the 
				presentation?&nbsp; If you are, there has to be a better way.</li>
			</ol>
