			<p>In 'normal' use, the word is an either-or, on-off adjective.&nbsp; 
			There are no degrees of <em>genuine</em> or <em>undisputed</em>.&nbsp; 
			You can't have a painting which is a bit genuine and that is either 
			a genuine Stradivarius violin you are playing or it isn't.<br />
			On the other hand, in English language teaching, the term is used 
			somewhat differently.&nbsp; In our profession, material can be judged 
			on a scale from truly inauthentic to truly authentic.&nbsp; Like 
			this:<br />
			<img alt="authenticity cline" height="92" src="../imagesgraphics/authenticcline.png" width="400" /></p>
			<p>What follows is one take on trying to classify and make sense of 
			this.&nbsp; The terms one should use to describe materials in this 
			area are disputed.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="two" height="166" src="../images/two_parrots250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style34"><h2>Two types of authenticity</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In most cases 'authentic' simply describes materials used for 
			teaching which were not originally intended for that purpose.&nbsp; 
			So authentic material is</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Designed for native speakers to hear or read.</li>
				<li>Written or spoken for a real communicative purpose by people 
				who have a message to impart to an audience.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Even this simple definition has a problem insofar as there are 
			materials out here on the web and certainly on the radio which are 
			written for a truly communicative purpose but also simplified to 
			appeal to and be accessible to non-native speakers of English.<br />
			A common written example is material published by a 
			language-training institution to provide information, (e.g., a 
			prospectus), set out policies (e.g., school rules, codes of conduct, 
			payment terms and so on).&nbsp; All of these documents may be 
			simplified bearing the non-native-speaking audience in mind but all 
			have a real communicative purpose.&nbsp; They are authentic in 
			purpose but may still appear contrived and unauthentic to a native 
			speaker.</p>
			<p>In what follows we are following Lee (1995) in distinguishing between
			<strong>text authenticity </strong>and <strong>learner authenticity</strong>.&nbsp; 
			In Lee's words:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>‘text authenticity’ is defined in terms 
			of the origin of the materials, while ‘learner 
			authenticity’ refers to the learner’s interaction with 
			them, in terms of appropriate responses and positive psychological 
			reaction<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style35">(Lee, 1995: 323)</span></p>
			<p>Lee goes on (<em>op cit.</em>):</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>Looking at authenticity in this way, we 
			can conclude that textually authentic non-textbook materials will 
			not necessarily be learner authentic, and that textually unauthentic 
			textbook materials will not necessarily be learner unauthentic.</em></p>
			<p>So:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>Text authenticity refers to the text itself:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>Designed for non-teaching purposes</li>
					<li>Written or spoken for a real-world (i.e., non-teaching) 
					communicative purpose</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Learner authenticity refers to the purposes for which the 
				text is used:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>The original purpose of the text vs.</li>
					<li>The classroom use to which it is put</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In what follows, we are looking at the two types of authenticity 
			separately but the relationship between them should be borne in 
			mind.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="text" height="166" src="../images/old_text250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style34"><h2>Text authenticity</h2>
					<h3>The origin and purpose of the text</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Here are some examples.&nbsp; Think about the differences between 
			the text types in terms of authenticity and then click on the table 
			when you have some way of describing them.</p>
			<p>
			<img id="img1" alt="authentic?" height="411" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'../imagesgraphics/authenticlist2.png')" src="../imagesgraphics/authenticlist1.png" width="550" /></p>
			<p>To qualify as truly authentic material, the source <strong>and</strong> 
			the use must be authentic.&nbsp; We have, therefore, 4 degrees of 
			authenticity:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Authentic materials</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are sourced authentically <strong>and</strong> used for their original 
				purposes.&nbsp; They are quite rare.&nbsp; Examples might 
				include:<br />
				A learning styles questionnaire<br />
				Materials used on an academic, scientific or occupational 
				English course<br />
				A TV guide (see above)<br />
				Fire drill instruction in a school<br />
				Class excursion planning materials taken from websites 
				advertising local attractions<br />
				Texts on how to study and remember facts</dd>
				<dt><strong>Quasi-authentic materials</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are materials originally intended for communicative 
				purposes but whose <strong>use</strong> is changed.&nbsp; They are very common.&nbsp; 
				Examples might include:<br />
				Texts taken from various genres for analysis of their structure, 
				staging and language content in the classroom.&nbsp; These could 
				be narratives, reports, procedures, recipes, letters etc.<br />
				Texts taken from published sources as the basis of examination 
				tasks<br />
				Other sources of texts are: advertisements, visitor guides, 
				social website posts, notices, packaging, menus, blogs, 
				T-shirts, maps, political slogans and a host more.</dd>
				<dd>Audio materials are less commonly available but will include 
				radio and TV broadcasts, YouTube and other internet-based video 
				sources, on-line lectures and presentations, voice mails, 
				recorded messages and so on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Semi-authentic materials</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are based on authentic materials but are <strong>simplified</strong> in 
				some way to make them accessible, especially to lower-level 
				learners.&nbsp; These are usually written because it is so much 
				more difficult and often impossible to simplify audio and video 
				recordings.&nbsp; Examples might include:<br />
				Graded readers<br />
				Texts based on magazine and newspaper articles<br />
				Teacher-written texts based on other information (often a 
				compilation of some sort)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Contrived, unauthentic materials</strong></dt>
				<dd>Even when these make an effort to <strong>appear</strong> authentic, they are 
				recognisably not authentic and they might include:<br />
				Tests for students<br />
				Language exercises<br />
				Texts, both spoken and written, intended to exemplify certain 
				language features (structures, lexis, discourse etc.)<br />
				Spoken dialogues, telephone conversations, interviews etc. intended to exemplify 
				communicative acts and functions<br />
				Emails purporting to be from a friend</dd>
				<dd>Most examination materials</dd>
				<dd>Task instructions</dd>

					<td class="auto-style34"><h2>Learner authenticity</h2>
					<h3>The nature of the user's interaction with the text</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In addition to deciding how authentic a text actually is there are other considerations:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>For whom is it authentic?</strong></dt>
				<dd>To have much learner authenticity, the text needs to be 
				directed at the sorts of people the learners actually are.&nbsp; 
				There's little point in using irrelevant materials, however 
				authentic they are.</dd>
				<dt><strong>What are the text's purposes?</strong></dt>
				<dd>The tasks that learners are set need to match the text's 
				purposes to be truly authentic in terms of their use.<br />
				For 
				example, if a questionnaire is used simply to analyse question 
				structures, then its use is not authentic to the learners, who 
				may well be interested in answering the questions.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>In addition to those two factors, the same considerations apply 
			to authentic texts, of whatever degree of text authenticity, as 
			apply to all classroom materials choice.&nbsp; Briefly:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Does it appeal?</strong><ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li>Is it relevant to the learners now?</li>
					<li>Is it relevant to the learners' future needs for 
					language?</li>
					<li>Does it look / sound interesting and engaging</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Is it centred on <span class="style_underline">these</span> 
				learners?</strong><ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li>Is it accessible, given the learners' current level of 
					skills?</li>
					<li>Does it really do what we think it does?</li>
					<li>Does it lead to real communication?</li>
					<li>Is there potential for extending its communicative use?</li>
					<li>Are the sorts of communicative acts the text stimulates 
					ones which the learners actually need?</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Does it contribute to learning?</strong><ol class="greybulletlist">
					<li>Is it compatible with the syllabus?</li>
					<li>Is it compatible with the course objectives?</li>
				</ol>
				</li>

			<p>Many writers in the field point to the fact that authentic 
			materials are positively viewed by learners.</p>
			<p><span class="style_black"><em>Learners find it extremely 
			motivating to hear something that has not been simplified: they feel 
			that they are getting to grips with real language.</em></span><span class="auto-style2"><br />
			(Field, 1997, p49)</span></p>
			<p>Motivation is usually 
			measured or judged in terms of</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li class="greybulletlist">interest and enthusiasm</li>
				<li class="greybulletlist">persistence with tasks</li>
				<li class="greybulletlist">perceived enjoyment</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and, anecdotally at least, many assume or assert that authentic 
			materials contribute to motivation.&nbsp; One study (Peacock, 1997) 
			showed that motivation did increase but learners found authentic 
			materials actually less interesting than contrived ones.<br />
			As there is almost certainly a link between motivational levels and 
			achievement, then the use of authentic material has to be A Good 
			Thing ...</p>

			<ol id="but" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li><strong>Help! I'm drowning!<br />
				</strong>Authentic texts are, by their nature, ungraded for 
				level so learners may feel overwhelmed by the amount of unknown 
				lexis in particular.&nbsp; At lower levels, with learners 
				untrained in using good reading and/or listening skills, this 
				can result in frustration, demotivation and anxiety.&nbsp; The 
				tasks learners are asked to perform have to be very carefully 
				graded to make them achievable.</li>
				<li><strong>I'm not interested in this</strong><br />
				Authentic texts may have been carefully chosen for their 
				features but if the subject matter is not interesting, they will 
				serve to disengage the learners from the tasks.&nbsp; By 
				definition, no authentic material has been developed with your 
				learners in mind.<br />
				For example, a class of Business English students in their 20s 
				may not be very interested in a text aimed at people in their 
				60s planning retirement even though it contains much language 
				that they will need to deploy in business settings.</li>
				<li><strong>What am I learning?</strong><br />
				Learners need to know where materials are taking them.&nbsp; 
				With most contrived (e.g., coursebook) materials, this is clear 
				because there is some sense of internal development.&nbsp; 
				Authentic materials, unless they are carefully inserted into an 
				obviously purposeful and orderly lesson, will often leave 
				learners wondering why they have focused so hard on them.</li>

			<p>It is often asserted that authentic materials are better than 
			contrived materials at reflecting real language used by real 
			speakers and writers.&nbsp; This is seen as positive because</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li class="greybulletlist">authentic language use is the aim of 
				most teaching</li>
				<li class="greybulletlist">models presented to learners should 
				reflect the real use of the target language</li>
				<li class="greybulletlist">learners need exposure to real 
				language as early as possible to prepare them for the 
				out-of-classroom experiences</li>

			<p>
			<a href="#40" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'but0',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have thought of a couple of buts</a>.</p>
			<ol id="but0" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li><strong>What the focus?<br />
				</strong>Because authentic texts are not written with any 
				language or skills target in mind, they are often quite poor at 
				representing them.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				A text may contain a number of examples of a target structure 
				but, unless it is very unusual and/or carefully adapted, the 
				frequency of the target items is likely to be much lower than 
				that found in contrived materials.&nbsp; There may, for example, 
				be 5 uses of <em>going to </em>for future intentions in a 
				listening text but if the learners have to listen for 10 minutes 
				to lots of other, less relevant language, the focus may be lost 
				and the learners may not notice the targets at all.</li>
				<li><strong>Style and register</strong><br />
				Authentic texts are often written or spoken for some rhetorical 
				effect and with a specific audience in mind.&nbsp; They may 
				represent real language, of course, but may also assume a level 
				of prior knowledge in the audience which your learners do not 
				have.<br />
				For example, a text intended to be amusing or quirky may contain 
				so much that is culturally dependent that the effect is lost on 
				those from different cultures.<br />
				Equally, a text designed for a specific interest group such as 
				readers of certain kinds of magazine may assume knowledge that 
				your learners simply don't have.&nbsp; The result will be 
				confusion and frustration.</li>
				<li><strong>Non-standard language</strong><br />
				Authentic texts often contain examples of non-standard grammar, 
				word use and word ordering.&nbsp; As the amount of language that 
				learners can encounter in the classroom from which to notice 
				such things is very limited, it makes little sense if much of 
				what they see and hear is non-standard or unusual use for 
				effect.<br />
				For example, a song lyric which contains <em>If you ain't got 
				nothing, you ain't got nothing to lose</em> may be emotionally 
				effective but as a model for low-level learners to understand 
				and use negatives and conditional clauses it is arguably less 
				effective.</li>
