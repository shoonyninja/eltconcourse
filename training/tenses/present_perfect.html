		<p>The distinction in English between the simple and perfect forms of 
		all tenses is the key to understanding how English conceptualises time.<br />

		</table>
		<p>Many languages have verbs forms selected to represent the speaker's 
		view of the time an action took place or a state existed &ndash; that is what tenses do.&nbsp; However, they differ 
		in terms of what they see as the important distinctions.<br />
		Some languages, such as 
		Mandarin, have no changes to verbs to signify time at all, relying on 
		adverbials, particles and the context to signal time concepts.&nbsp; It 
		is perfectly possible to be understood (at least on a basic level) and 
		use no tense forms at all.&nbsp; So:<br /><em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go tomorrow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I come yesterday<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always do this<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrive recently<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		I finish work at 6 last week</em><br />are all perfectly comprehensible even if they need a little 
		interpretation from the listener.</p>
			<p>The perfect aspect is signalled in English through the use of a 
			form of the verb <em>have</em>.<br />
			When the forms are used, it means that the user of English is 
			relating one time to another so, for example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>Mary has made lots of money</em><br />
				means that she is rich now and that relates a past activity, 
				making money, to a present state, being wealthy.</li>
				<li><em>Mary had made a lot of money</em><br />
				means that she was wealthy then because of a previous activity, 
				making money.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sometimes, languages may have forms which look 
			superficially similar to the perfect aspect in English but which do 
			not signal a relational sense.<br />
		German, for example, can form a 
		sentence like<em class="style_brown">:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ich habe es gemacht<br />
		</em>roughly translatable as<em class="style_brown"><br />
		</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em class="style_brown">I have done it<br />
		</em>but this does not necessarily signify present effect and could be translated as<span class="style_brown"><em>:<br />
		I did it</em></span>.</p>
			<p>Many languages do not distinguish a perfect aspect at all and 
			rely on adverbials and other time markers to make the connections 
			between times even when they bother with the concept at all.<br />
			Other languages content themselves with 
			the use of the past simple form to cover both the past simple and 
			the present perfect in English.&nbsp; Speakers of these languages 
			may not even see the need to distinguish.<br />
			Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch, Persian languages, French, Hungarian, Italian, Khmer, 
			Lithuanian, Luxembourgish, Mongolian, Portuguese, Slovak, Somali, 
			Tajik, Telegu, Turkish, Ukrainian, Yiddish and Zulu for example can 
			all encode both:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have done it<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did it</em><br />
			in precisely the same way, making no aspectual difference at all.</p>
			<p>Italian distinguishes between distant 
		past time and recent past time and all languages have ways of dividing 
		and classifying time which may or may not overlap or run parallel with 
		how English does it.<br />
			This is one reason why the present perfect is problematic for many 
			learners whose first languages have a similar form carrying a 
			different kind of message.<br />
			Speakers of languages which do not have a parallel forms may also be 
			confused by the use of primary auxiliary verbs, such as <em>have, 
			be, do</em> etc. to make tense forms which encode specific 
			relationships.</p>

		Fundamentally, the tense is a <strong>present</strong> tense, not a past

		Another way of putting that is that it refers to the past <strong>within</strong> 
		the present.<br />

				fixes the event in time but <em>yet</em> is open ended.&nbsp; 
				This does not mean 
				that the time expression controls tense use.&nbsp; It is the 
				other way around: the tense meaning permits some time references 
				and not others.</td>
			</tr>

				<td class="auto-style87"><em>He ran for the bus.</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style79">The running was a progressive action in

			<p>The key point to grasp in all of this (and the one your learners 
			need to get hold of) is that the past action has <strong>changed the 
			present</strong> in some way.&nbsp; There are many times when it 
			actually signals that a present event would not have happened or a 
			present state would not exist if a past event or state had not.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The money has arrived so we can buy the car</em><br />
			signals the fact that but for the arrival of the money, the action 
			of buying the car would not have occurred at all.<br />
			Many course books and websites will focus on a rather nebulous 
			concept of <strong>present relevance</strong> but it's hard to 
			define that because <em>relevance</em> is a gradable concept.&nbsp; 
			If we get away from that term and focus on how the past has <strong>
			changed</strong> the present, we are on safer ground.</p>

			<li>(<strong>Past Simple</strong>)&nbsp; The third example tells us two things.&nbsp; It is completed

			<p>This distinction between the simple past and the perfect form 
			lies at the heart of the way English conceptualises past time.</p>
			<p>A way to understand the use of the present perfect simple and the 
			progressive form is to think in terms of
			<strong>telicity</strong>: whether an end point is in consideration, 
			on which more below.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived in London for ten years</em><br />
			clearly implies that the process is finished, and the sense is 
			telic, whereas:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lived in London for ten years</em><br />
			is atelic because the process is unfinished.<br />
			Both tense forms can signal both types of telicity so we can find:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read the book <span class="style_underline">
			for</span> two hours</em><br />
			which implies that I did not finish it, although I am no longer 
			reading it as I speak, whereas:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read the book <span class="style_underline">
			in</span> two hours</em><br />
			implies that the reading is finished.<br />
			Equally:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been to New York three times</em><br />
			implies that the visits are finished and the use is telic although 
			there is a strong sense of this changing the present, 
			whereas selecting the progressing form of the present perfect as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been visiting New York regularly for 
			years</em><br />
			implies that the events are not finished (atelic) and form part of a 
			series.<br />
			There is much more on the distinction between the simple and 
			progressive aspects of the present perfect below.</p>

		<h3>Activity <em>vs</em>. Achievement</h3>

		</table>
			<p>We can use both tenses to refer to a past within the present so 
			we can say either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has climbed the mountain<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has been climbing the mountain<br />
			</em>but in the first we are emphasising his achievement (i.e., the 
			outcome of his efforts) and in the second, the activity itself 
			(i.e., the efforts themselves).<br />
			In the first example, the change to the present concerns his current 
			position (on top).<br />
			In the second example, the change concerns his current state 
			(exhaustion, perhaps).<br />
			Another example may make things clearer.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>achievement or outcome</strong></dt>
				<dd>If we say, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have finished the report<br />
			</em>the obvious sense is that it is now available for you to read, 
				pass on to the boss, publish or whatever.<br />
				We are laying stress on the <strong>achievement</strong> which 
				has altered the present.<br />
				If we say, too:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have taken my holidays in France for 
				many years<br />
				</em>we are suggesting that it is the outcome of the activity 
				which has changed the present and it implies that my knowledge 
				of France is available for use.</dd>
				<dt><strong>activity or effort</strong></dt>
				<dd>If, in contrast, we say:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<em>I have been finishing the report<br />
			</em>we emphasise my activity, not the achievement and it is the
				<strong>activity</strong> which has altered the present and 
				that explains why I am late home, have been out of touch or 
				whatever.&nbsp; In this case, the report is not the central 
				issue, it is the activity which is important.<br />
				If we say, too:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been taking a holiday in France</em><br />
				we are emphasising that the activity and explaining why, say, I 
				have not been answering my emails or been available.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Similar examples can be used when the activity is what interests 
			us, not any kind of achievement and it is the activity which serves

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been running (and I'm hot and tired)<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She has been drinking (and she's not making sense)<br />

			<dl>
				<dt><strong>verb meaning and achievement</strong></dt>
				<dd>Some verbs contain within their meaning the sense of 
				an achievement or an outcome.<br />
				If, for example, we say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has succeeded<br />
				</em>the use of the verb <em>succeed</em> usually prohibits the 
				progressive form so we do not encounter:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She has been succeeding<br />
				</em>because the verb itself refers to achievement not activity.<br />
				Equally, we do not find:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They have been accomplishing it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She has been realising it</em><br />
				and so on for similar reasons.<br />
				With verbs which imply any kind of achievement, the use of the 
				progressive form is simply unnecessary (and usually wrong).<br />
				Other verbs which work this way include:<br />
				<em>annihilate, attain, complete, conclude, defeat, demolish, 
				destroy, do </em>(in the sense of <em>finish</em>),<em> finish, 
				pull off, reach, ruin, stop, triumph, win </em>and more.</dd>
				<dt><strong>verb meaning and stative or dynamic use</strong></dt>
				<dd>The shorthand for this distinction is to think of stative 
				and dynamic verbs and that is how it is often presented to 
				learners.&nbsp; A better way to consider it is to look at the 
				meaning of a verb and ask whether its use <strong>in this 
				meaning</strong> is stative or dynamic.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have often thought that the garden 
				needs some work</em><br />
				is the use of the verb <em>think</em> to mean <em>believe</em> but:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been thinking that the garden 
				needs some work</em><br />
				is the use of the verb to mean <em>deliberate</em> or <em>
				cogitate</em>.<br />
				The rule is that when a verb is <strong>used</strong> statively, 
				the progressive form is unacceptable.<br />
				Other pairings showing this distinction include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John has appeared a bit depressed 
				recently</em><br />
				in which <em>appear</em> means <em>seem</em> and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John has been appearing in The Importance 
				of Being Earnest</em><br />
				in which the verb means <em>act</em> or <em>perform</em>.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has had the house for years</em><br />
				in which the verb <em>have</em> means <em>possess</em>, and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been having an argument</em><br />
				in which the verb means <em>conduct</em> or <em>take part in</em>.<br />
				It follows logically that verbs which are very firmly tied to a 
				state rather than an action, such as <em>own, seem, look like, 
				possess, own, believe, suppose </em>etc. will not appear in the 
				progressive form.<br />
				Other verbs, which are polysemous and can be used in both forms 
				with a change in meaning include <em>have, consider, think, 
				appear, imagine, judge, look, occur</em> etc. and may appear in 
				either simple or progressive structures depending on the meaning 
				intended.<br />
				(Rarely, even the verb <em>be</em> can fall into this polysemous 
				category.&nbsp; Normally, it cannot be used dynamically but in 
				the sense of deliberate assumption of a characteristic, it can.&nbsp; 
				We allow, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has been being difficult for some time</em>.)</dd>
				<dt><strong>adverbials and time / event markers</strong></dt>
				<dd>The distinction is clear here, too.<br />
				We can say, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have flown across the Atlantic
				<span class="style_underline">four times</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have run <span class="style_underline">six marathons</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has <span class="style_underline">often</span> spoken 
				about her schooldays</em><br />
				and so on because we are focused on the achievement or outcome 
				of the actions.<br />
				Using the same forms with the progressive makes no sense because 
				the focus of the progressive is on the efforts or activities, 
				not the outcomes so we do not find:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *I have been flying across the Atlantic
				<span class="style_underline">four times</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They have been running
				<span class="style_underline">six marathons</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She has <span class="style_underline">often</span> been

			<p>The term telicity is not something with which you should trouble 
			learners but the concept is important to understand.<br />
			The question to ask is whether an event or action is seen as 
			finished (that is to say, perfective [not perfect]) or whether there 
			is no end point in sight.<br />
			The progressive form of the tense is used most frequently for events 
			and actions which are seen as atelic, having no explicit finishing 
			point and the simple aspect is used to refer to actions or events 
			that are telic and, although finished, are still set in the present.<br />
			<strong>Both forms refer to the past within the present.</strong><br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have read the book<br />
			</em>clearly implies that the action of reading is now finished but 
			that the reading of the book is set in the present because it makes 
			a change to our conversation in some way, for example, removing any 
			obligation to explain what it is about.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been reading the book<br />
			</em>on the other hand, means that the book is not finished.&nbsp; 
			It is still a past within the present in terms alterations to the 
			present, of 
			course.</p>
			<p>The guide to talking about the present, which considers the 
			present perfect (because it is a present tense) delves a bit deeper

			the tenses refer to the past within the present.<br />
			This is true but the progressive form is also used to describe two 
			other aspects which are not obvious by looking at the forms.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Iterative</strong></dt>
				<dd>This aspect refers to events or actions which are repeated, 
				and that is what iteration means.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John has telephoned me<br />
				</em>implies a single past event set in the present to show it 
				has changed the present in some way (for example, that I have been told some news 
				or whatever).<br />
				However:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John has been telephoning me<br />
				</em>implies a series of events of the same kind.&nbsp; The 
				reason is that a verb like <em>telephone</em> is punctual and 
				suggests a short, one-off action.&nbsp; The 
				sense is still of a past within the present but in this case we 
				are concerned to show that the event has been repeated so the 
				form of choice is present perfect progressive (although it might 
				be better referred to as present perfect iterative).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Durative</strong></dt>
				<dd>This aspect refers to events or actions which take a 
				substantial time.&nbsp; We are emphasising, then, the duration 
				of the event or action.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John has lived in London for many years<br />
				</em>simply states a fact and sets the event in a present 
				context so, for example, John would be a good person to ask 
				about the city.<br />
				However:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John has been living in London for many 
				years<br />
				</em>means roughly the same but the speaker's emphasis is on the 
				duration of the event, not the event itself.&nbsp; Present 
				effect is maintained.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>A key distinction here is semantic not grammatical.&nbsp; Some 
			verbs, by their nature, cannot refer to long-lasting events.&nbsp; 
			They are punctual verbs and include, for example:<br />
			<em>
			arrive,
			bang, begin, break, bump, burst, chop, crash, detonate, dip, dive, drop, explode, 
			flash, glow, hit, jolt, kick, light, meet, name, open, pop, quip, rap, shatter, shoot, slam, smash, spit, spurt, steal, 
			stop, tap, thump, upset, volunteer, wake</em> 
			etc.<br />
			Other verbs, the majority, <strong>may</strong> be durative and the 
			list includes:<br />
			<em>cry, design, enjoy, frighten, glow, hurry, inspect, justify, 
			keep, love, moan, nurture, oppose, play, quieten, read, run, speak, talk, 
			undo, vary, wish, write</em> etc.<br />
			Most verbs are polysemous and have closely connected but distinct 
			meanings so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has frightened the children</em><br />
			implies a single event which was not long lasting but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been frightening the children</em><br />
			implies a repeated, not necessarily long-lasting event.<br />
			Verbs which can only be punctual in nature, such as <em>flash, pop, 
			thump </em>etc. are, when they are used in the progressive form, 
			always iterative, not durative.</p>

			<img alt="summary" height="517" src="../imagesgraphics/ppprog_vs_simple.png" width="620" /></p>

			<p>A number of coursebooks have an annoying habit of presenting 
			learners with long lists (as in the table above) of time phrases to 
			use with past tenses and others to use with the present perfect.&nbsp; 
			From the list, learners are expected to think something like<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			"If I 
			am using <em>last week, </em>I must use the past simple"<br />
			or<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			"If I am 
			using <em>since</em>, I must use the present perfect".<br />
			<strong>That is the wrong way round</strong>.<br />
			The choice of the appropriate time marker depends on the speaker's 
			perception of time which is represented by the tense structure.<br />
			It is not the time marker which determines the tense; it is the 
			speaker's understanding which determines the tense and the tense 
			which determines the appropriate time marker.&nbsp; To be clear, it 
			does <strong>not</strong> work like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="not" height="53" src="../imagesgraphics/it_does_not.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>it works like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="does" height="53" src="../imagesgraphics/it_does.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>If that is not understood, it is virtually impossible to teach 
			the form, the meaning or the use.</p>

		You will readily see that sentences such as <br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been to America<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		They have seen the aurora borealis<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		We have never seen anything like it<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has never smiled at me</em></span><br />
		refer to a time between the speakers' earliest memories and now.<br />
		The meanings are <span class="style_underline">indefinite</span> concerning the 
		time and focuses on the event alone.&nbsp; It is for this reason that 
		the tense is often used to comment on the present or to introduce the 
		topic of a conversation.&nbsp; Here are some typical examples which do 
		not relate to recentness but use the tense in this aspect of discussing 
		experience or raising a topic:<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you know that Mary has left her job and 
		gone travelling?<br />
		</em></span>introducing a topic for discussion – it may be a recent 
		event but that's not the point<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've been to Paris, haven't you?<br />
		</em></span>possibly a forerunner to some closer questioning about Paris<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've discovered something about this 
		program<br />
		</em></span>requiring the hearer to say something like <em>Oh, what's that?&nbsp; Do 
		tell.</em> etc.<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you tried the new restaurant in the 
		square?<br />
		</em></span>a forerunner to asking what it's like or telling the hearer 
		what it's like if the answer is 'no'.</p>
		<p>
		It's pretty easy to make up examples of this very common use of the 
		tense but the trick is to set it in context and give people a reason to 
		introduce a topic and that's usually because:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>they want to <strong>get some information (now)</strong></li>
			<li>they want to <strong>give some information (now) </strong>or</li>

			<p>If you have followed up to now, you will know:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the present perfect simple in English embeds the past in the 
				present as an aid to understanding the present</li>
				<li>the present perfect progressive refers to an atelic, 
				iterative or long-lasting past event embedded in the present 
				which also helps us to understand the present</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and those two concepts are really all that is needed to 
			understand the use of the tenses.</p>
			<p>However, quite well meaning and experienced if not well informed 
			practitioners persist in overwhelming learners by inventing ever 
			more complex and refined uses of the tenses in an effort, forlorn, 
			naturally, to help learners use and understand the forms.<br />
			Some coursebook writers fall headlong into this trap, too.<br />
			You will find, for example out here on the web something like the 
			following seven uses for the present perfect simple including, but 
			not limited to:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li><strong>past finished action</strong><br />
				The example here is usually along the lines of:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have broken my pencil</em><br />
				which we are asked to believe is a past tense.<br />
				It is not, of course, because, although the action referred to 
				is clearly a past event, we do not know when it happened but we 
				do know why it was reported: it says something important about 
				the present so the past is embedded in it.&nbsp; It is 
				vanishingly rare to hear or read something like that in 
				isolation because it would inevitably be followed by something 
				like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... so can I borrow yours, please?<br />
				</em>If we do want to focus on the present perfect for 
				perfective actions or events, then we have to follow it with a 
				comment about how the past event changes the present.&nbsp; 
				Otherwise, practice is misleading.</li>
				<li><strong>recent completed action</strong><br />
				How this might differ from the previous example is hard to 
				fathom because the terms <em>finished </em>and<em> completed
				</em>appear to be synonymous in these uses.&nbsp; A typical 
				model-sentence example is something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has just arrived</em><br />
				and, again, it is clear that this will inevitably be followed by 
				an implied or stated fact about the present such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... so we can start the meeting.<br />
				</em>The other problem with this way of suggesting the present 
				perfect is used lies in the meaning of the word
				<em>recent</em>.&nbsp; The word is a gradable adjective so 
				cannot be precisely pinned down.&nbsp; If we have, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Mary has lived in India<br />
				</em>it is unclear whether the event referred to is recent 
				or happened a long time ago.&nbsp; It actually doesn't matter, 
				of course, because the sentence is about Mary, now and not about 
				the past at all.</li>
				<li><strong>unfinished actions</strong><br />
				The example usually trotted out here will be something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has lived in London for 10 years</em><br />
				and learners will be asked to believe that this is somehow a 
				different use from the previous two cases.&nbsp; It is not, of 
				course, because the tense form does not tell us that the state 
				is unfinished at all.&nbsp; It could be followed by:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... but left this morning.</em><br />
				That aside, the form is still a past embedded in the present 
				because its usual implication will be something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .... so he knows all the best places to 
				eat around here</em><br />
				which is, of course, a comment about the present which is 
				affected by what has gone before.</li>
				<li><strong>multiple actions</strong><br />
				The usual example is along the lines of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have visited The British Museum often</em><br />
				and learners are now faced with trying to understand what 
				distinguishes this from the last example.<br />
				The answer, of 
				course, is nothing.&nbsp; What is happening here is a semantic 
				issue because the verb <em>live</em> implies a long-lasting 
				state unlikely to be seen as iterated and the verb <em>visit</em> 
				implies a short action of some kind which can be repeated.<br />
				All this implies is exactly the same as the last example and 
				might be:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; ... so I can show you around, if you like</em><br />
				which is an offer applicable to the present.</li>
				<li><strong>changes over time</strong><br />
				This is a wholly made-up category which might be represented 
				with a model sentence such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She has taken to eating later and later these days</em><br />
				and that, of course, assumes that it will be followed by:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and now she eats after 9 o'clock 
				every evening</em><br />
				which is, to labour the point, a comment about her present 
				habits with the past embedded within them as a way of explaining 
				why I am bothering to mention it at all.<br />
				The key here is how it is described: <em>changes over time</em> 
				means that the present is different from the past and that is
				<span class="style_underline">exactly</span> what embedding the 
				past in the present suggests.<br />
				There is no need at all to invent another category for this 
				meaning.</li>
				<li><strong>accomplishments</strong><br />
				This is another made-up category which has no discernible 
				classroom utility and only serves to confuse learners 
				unnecessarily.&nbsp; An example often given is:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has won!</em><br />
				which is intended to be understood as a reference to the past.<br />
				It is not, naturally, because it implies:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... so she is now into the final</em><br />
				or whatever, i.e., a comment about the importance of a present 
				state of affairs.<br />
				We saw above that this is a semantic issue to do with the 
				meaning of the verb, not a grammatical issue at all.</li>
				<li><strong>life experiences</strong><br />
				This is a very commonly used category often represented by 
				something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have never eaten Thai food</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have visited the USA quite often on 
				business</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				This differs not at all from any of the foregoing examples 
				because it is simply a way of explaining the present state of 
				affairs as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... but I would like to try it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... so I don't know if you would like it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... so I can give you some advice about the USA<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... so we can exchange impressions concerning the country</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				There is nothing mysterious about this at all.<br />
				The trick, as it so often is, is to set the practice with a 
				co-text.&nbsp; If the focus is left on using the present perfect 
				for life experiences without going on to explain how the 
				experience has changed you in the present, then it is wasted 
				because, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to school when I was five<br />
				</em>is a way of talking only about an experience without 
				implying that it changed the present in any way and does not 
				require the use of a perfect aspect form.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is unfair, unnecessary and counterproductive to teach the 
			tense this way because learners are being asked to acquire seven 
			concepts in which the tense is usable rather than developing a feel 
			for the language and knowing that past events are embedded in 
			present forms for a good reason in English.<br />
			<strong>That is not needed.</strong></p>
