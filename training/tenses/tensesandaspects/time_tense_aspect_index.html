			<p>Before we can look at tense forms, meaning and use in English, we 
			have to get four things clear:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Time</strong>:</dt>
				<dd>This is a <span class="style_underline">non-linguistic</span> concept of <strong>when 
				an action or a state is set</strong>.&nbsp; It is non-linguistic 
				because the relationship between time and grammatical form is 
				often unclear with past forms used to speak about the future, 
				future forms appearing in the past and so on.<br />
				Traditionally, we 
				have four choices:
				<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>Now: the action / state is in the present</li>
					<li>Past: the action / state occurred before the present</li>
					<li>Future: the action / state will occur after the present</li>
				</ul></dd>
				<dt><strong>Tense:</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is <strong>the name we give to the form</strong> the verb takes.&nbsp; It refers to the form of the 
				verb and the grammatical function of any primary auxiliary verbs 
				involved.&nbsp; In English it is often averred that there are just 
				two:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>Past tense: e.g., <em>made</em> rather than <em>make</em></li>
					<li>present tense: e.g., <em>comes</em> rather than <em>came</em></li>
					<li>but we'll add a third because English most certainly 
					does exhibit future forms (such as <em>will go</em> rather 
					than <em>goes</em>) even if it has no 'proper' future tense 
					signalled by an alteration in the form of the main verb as many languages do (and many don't)</li></ul>
				
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Aspect</strong>:</dt>
				<dd>this refers to <strong>how the user 
				of the language views the event or how the event is experienced</strong>.&nbsp; There are many 
				of these and they are signalled in languages in a bewildering 
				number of ways.&nbsp; For the purposes of analysing <em>English</em> 
				verb form, meaning and use, we'll focus on:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>perfect: relating two times (past to pre-past, present 
					to pre-present, future to post-future)</li>
					<li>progressive: ongoing</li>
					<li>continuous: current</li>
					<li>habitual: routine</li>
					<li>iterative: repeated</li>
					<li>durative: long lasting</li>
					<li>prospective: looking forward</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Modality</strong></dt>
				<dd>The expression of the future is often allied to modality because, by 
				definition, the future concerns expressions of willingness, 
				uncertainty or duty.<br />
				Modality concerns the view that the speaker / writer wishes to 
				convey regarding four key concepts:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>the truth or otherwise of a proposition: relating to how 
					the user of the languages perceives the likelihood of 
					something being the case.&nbsp; For example, expressing 
					doubt or certainty.<br />This is known as epistemic 
					modality, from the Greek for <em>knowledge</em>.&nbsp; E.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That might have been her father</em></li>
					<li>obligation: relating to the language user's 
					understanding of whether an obligation or its lack is 
					intended to be expressed.&nbsp; For example, there is an 
					external obligation, an internal sense of duty, a lack of 
					obligation or an expression of advice.<br />This is known 
					as deontic modality from the Greek for <em>being needed</em>.&nbsp; 
					E.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shouldn't have told you that</em></li>
					<li>ability and willingness: this expresses the language 
					user's view concerning how possible it is for someone or 
					something to do what the verb suggests or how willing they 
					are to do it.<br />Because of the sense of power and 
					willingness, this is called dynamic modality from the Greek 
					for <em>power</em>.&nbsp; E.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't safely have driven any 
					faster</em></li>
					<li>necessity: concerns the language user's view of a sense 
					of inevitability so any statement which implies an 
					unavoidable logical conclusion falls into this category.&nbsp; 
					Essential truths about the workings of the natural world or 
					concepts of definitions of states fall into this category.<br />It is called alethic modality from the Greek for 
					<em>truth</em>.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it was the colour you described, 
					it must have been a buzzard</em></li>
				</ul>
				</dd>

				<p>It is unhelpful to assume that continuous and progressive are 
			simply alternative words for the same aspect.&nbsp; We may, somewhat 
			loosely, call the tense form something like <em>present / past / 
				perfect </em> etc.<em> continuous</em> but when we consider aspect, we need to be a little 
			more careful.<br />Nevertheless, it is true that in English little distinction in verb 
			forms is made between continuous and progressive aspects so, for 
			example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John is working at his desk now</em><br />is progressive insofar as it refers to an action in progress, and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am staying at The Ritz</em><br />is continuous insofar as it refers to a background state rather than 
			an action currently in progress.<br />As we shall shortly see, both these aspects can be realised through 
			apparently simple forms of the verb, although the 
			construction with the primary auxiliary <em>be</em> and the present 
			participle is the most common choice.<br />It is important that teachers of English are aware that other 
			people's languages may reserve explicit verb forms to distinguish 
			between progressive and continuous aspects.</p>
				<dl>
					<dt><strong>Continuous aspect</strong></dt>
					<dd>describes a current state of affairs such as, e.g.:<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
				believe in fairies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He loves me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is loving the attention<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
				hated me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are on holiday<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is 
				living in a guest house<br /></em>etc.<br />The clue is in the name &ndash; the aspect refers to the 
				speaker's perception that something is a continuing state of 
				affairs.<br />The continuous aspect does not always require the 
				auxiliary +<em> -ing.</em>&nbsp; It can be inherent in both the 
				simple form and the auxiliary + <em>-ing</em> forms of the verb.&nbsp; 
				This is especially true, of course, with verbs such as <em>think, believe, understand, like</em> etc. which contain the 
				sense of the continuous semantically.</dd>
					<dt><strong>Progressive aspect</strong></dt>
					<dd>describes an ongoing action such as<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm typing this sentence<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He runs the length of the 
				field and scores<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is taking liberties<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were eating in my favourite restaurant<br />
					</em>etc.<br />The clue is in the name &ndash; the aspect refers to the 
				speaker's perception that something is in progress at the time 
				of speaking, i.e., an ongoing action.<br />Notice, again, that the progressive aspect does not always require the 
				auxiliary +<em> -ing.</em>&nbsp; It can be inherent in both the 
				simple form and the auxiliary + <em>-ing</em> forms of the 
				verb.&nbsp; For example<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, I now turn over the paper and there is 
				the shape<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here she comes!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I acknowledge receipt of your 
				letter<br /></em>The progressive aspect of the verb can also signal a 
				background event which is perceived as taking place in the 
				present but is not necessarily something being done right this 
				minute.<br />Compare, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is studying French at university</em><br />which could imply right this minute but probably refers to a 
				background event.&nbsp; She may not, at the time of speaking, be 
				anywhere near the university in question.<br />with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's in the garden, pulling up weeds</em><br />which, because of the nature of the act and the prepositional 
				phrase, almost certainly does refer to the present moment.</dd>

				</table>
				<p>Much of the confusion evident in describing verbs as either 
			stative or dynamic arises from the inability to distinguish between 
			continuous and progressive aspects.</p>
				<p>There is a distinction between, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am thinking<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that ...<br /></em>It is the distinction between the progressive aspect (<em>I am 
			thinking</em>) and the continuous aspect with a simple verb form (<em>I 
			think</em>).&nbsp; In the second of these, the verb is akin to <em>believe</em> (i.e., a 
				<strong>continuous</strong> state of mind) and 
			in the first, it describes an ongoing (that is to say <strong>progressing</strong>) action or process.</p>
				<p>For this reason, if no other, it makes sense to speak of stative 
			vs. dynamic <strong><span class="style_underline">uses</span></strong> 
			of verbs.</p>
				<p>Many other languages make no such distinctions 
			between these uses of verbs and the expressions <em>I go</em> and
				<em>I am going</em> or <em>I think </em>and<em> I am thinking 
				</em>are indistinguishable.&nbsp; English is not

				<p>There are three concepts here:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt><strong><em>perfective</em></strong></dt>
					<dd>is the term used to indicate that an event or state is 
			completed.&nbsp; For example,<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to Margate last Thursday<br />
					</em>is a perfective form which may or may not have present 
			relevance but is clearly finished.<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Napoleon died in 1821<br />
					</em>is another example of a perfective form in English.<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have given up 
			smoking<br /></em>is also a perfective form (because the action is 
			completed) which happens to be in the perfect aspect as well, in 
					this case because it has direct relevance to the present.<br />The perfective can be 
			contrasted with the ...</dd>
					<dt><strong><em>imperfective</em></strong></dt>
					<dd>which is the term that indicates an event is not completed.&nbsp; 
			Examples are: <em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was playing tennis with John<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			have lived here all my life<br /></em>In neither case is the event 
			perceived as finished.&nbsp; The form of the verb is described as 
			imperfect.</dd>
					<dt><strong><em>perfect</em></strong></dt>
					<dd>is the term used to signify an imperfective or perfective which 
			has a certain tense structure.<br />For example,<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been to America<br />
					</em>is a perfective (the 
			act of going to America has been completed) but is a perfect tense 
			indicating a present relevance of some sort.<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I have lived here all my life<br /></em>is imperfective (but still a 
			perfect form) because it also signifies some present relevance (in 
			this case that the state is probably (not certainly) current).<br />The perfect is, in English grammar, contrasted with the simple.</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>Many other languages, again, make no such distinctions between 
			these uses of verbs and the expressions <em>I went </em>and <em>I 
			have been</em> are indistinguishable.&nbsp; English is not unique 
			but it is slightly unusual.<br />Some languages are much clearer about perfective and imperfective

				</table>
				<p>This is a related phenomenon in languages.<br />The term <em>telic</em> comes from the Greek, 
				<em>τέλος</em>, meaning <em>end</em>.&nbsp; 
			The concept of telic and atelic verb phrases concerns whether an 
			activity is seen as finished or unfinished.&nbsp; To grasp the 
			point, compare:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><em>I read the book for an hour</em></li>
					<li><em>I read the book in an hour</em></li>
				</ol>
				<p>Sentence 1. suggests that <em>I did not finished the book</em> so 
			the verb phrase is atelic.<br />Sentence 2. suggests that <em>I finished the book</em> so the verb 
			phrase is telic.</p>
				<p>This matters in English because we can say:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was reading the book for an hour</em><br />but we cannot have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was reading the book in an hour.</em></p>
				<p>The implication for English grammar is that verbs in the perfect 
			or continuous aspects are almost always possible with a time 
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>frame</strong></span> 
			adverbial but not with a time <span class="style_underline"><strong>span</strong></span> adverbial so.&nbsp; In other 
			words, perfective forms, which are by definition telic, generally 
			imply a time frame (even when it is not stated) but not a time span.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been reading for an hour</em><br />vs.<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *I had been reading in an hour<br />
				</em>or<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was cycling for a week</em><br />vs.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was cycling in a week<br /></em>or<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lived here for a year</em><br />vs.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have lived here in a year<br /></em>or<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was reading when the telephone rang</em><br />vs.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I read when the telephone rang.</em></p>
				<p>The situation is complicated by the fact that verbs are generally 
			telic or atelic depending on their meaning so the phenomenon of 
			telicity is as much semantic as grammatical.&nbsp; For example:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><em>I finished the book in an hour</em><br />is telic by its meaning, because the adverbial refers to a time
					<span class="style_underline"><strong>span</strong></span>, and</li>
					<li><em>*I finished the book for an hour</em><br />is not possible because the adverbial refers to a time
					<span class="style_underline"><strong>frame</strong></span> 
				rather than a span.</li>
					<li><em>I was cooking when the telephone rang</em><br />has the atelic verb 
					<em>cooking</em> which is imperfective and 
				the perfective <em>rang</em> which clearly had an end point so 
				is telic.&nbsp; Compare:</li>
					<li><em>I cursed when the telephone rang</em><br />in which both verbs are telic and perfective.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Some languages, for example Finnish, Estonian, Czech and 
			Hungarian, reserve a special verb form to signal telicity but 
			English often does it through tense aspects.</p>

				<p>Here, we depart slightly from a traditional description of tense 
			forms in English and take a more functional view of what the forms 
			actually do and the meanings they realise.</p>
				<dl>
					<dt><strong>Absolute tense forms</strong></dt>
					<dd>These locate an event in time relative to the here and now, 
				i.e., the time of speaking or writing.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will take the 6 o'clock train</em><br />sets her action as lying in the future from now.<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She caught the 6 o'clock train</em><br />sets her action in the past seen from now<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is getting on the 6 o'clock train</em><br />sets her action in the present<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was sitting on the train</em><br />sets the continuous state in the past<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will be sitting on the train</em><br />sets the continuous state in the future</dd>
					<dt><strong>Relative tense forms</strong></dt>
					<dd>These take it a step further and relate what is happening 
				relative to an absolute tense.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has caught the train and is working 
				on her laptop</em><br />sets the present (working) in relation to a past event (getting 
				on the train)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had caught the train and was working 
				on her laptop</em><br />sets the past (working) in relation to the pre-past (getting on 
				the train)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will have finished by the time the 
				train gets to London</em><br />sets the future (finishing) in relation to the a post-future 
				(getting to London)<br />Relative tense forms do not stop there.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was sitting on the train, reading a 
				book</em><br />is absolute in the sense that the events are fixed in time 
				relative to the present as we saw above.<br />However,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was sitting on the train when the she 
				realised her mistake</em><br />sets the realising in relation to a background event and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had been going to work but had 
				forgotten her laptop</em><br />sets the working as a future in the past (although one that did 
				not happen).</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>An alternative way of seeing these forms is to consider what is 
			being expressed in terms of time and the relationships between 
			events and states, like this (following Lock, 1996: 149):</p>

				<p>The visualisation in colour on the right of these tables appeals 
			to some learners.&nbsp; Do not present them all at once!</p>
				<p>A third way to consider the forms is to view them from the point 
			of view of telicity (see above).<br />Relative tense forms, often, refer to atelic forms so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will have been travelling for 24 hours</em><br />is atelic because there is no obvious end point to the activity, but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will travel for 24 hours</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will be travelling for 24 hours</em><br />is telic because the presumption is that he will stop travelling 
			after the 24 hours is up.</p>

			actions in progress, temporary states, the arranged future and ... etc.</span></p>
				<p>That is familiar to most learners and teachers and may be 
			reassuring.&nbsp; However, it is a non-functional way to proceed.<br />It is non-functional because it presumes a mental process something 
			like this:<br />
				<img alt="mental process 1" height="237" src="tenseimages/tensesandmeaning1.png" width="600" /></p>
				<p>Here, we are going to work the other way: we will start with the 
			meanings we want to make and identify the major ways to make these 
			meanings using verb forms and their aspects.<br />This assumes a mental process more like:<br />
				<img alt="mental process 2" height="244" src="tenseimages/tensesandmeaning2.png" width="600" /></p>
				<p>In these guides, the assumption is that you know (and can teach) how the tenses 
			and aspects are formed.&nbsp; We are only considering meaning and 
			function.</p>
