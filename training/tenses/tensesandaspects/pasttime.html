			<h1>Talking about past time</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="past" height="207" src="../../images/history_knight310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>English uses a number of strategies to apply aspect to past time.&nbsp; 
			The form we use depends on the aspect we perceive.<br />
			</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="perfectaspect" height="166" src="../../images/rain_window250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" rowspan="2">
					<h2>Perfect aspect in the past</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style4">
					<span class="style_black"><em>It had rained</em></span><em><br class="style_black" />
					</em><span class="style_black"><em>It had been raining</em></span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The present perfect, often taught as a form of past tense is considered in the guide to present forms because, as the name 
			suggests, it is better considered a present tense which highlights 
			the relationship of the present to the past rather than a reference to past time 
			itself.<br />
			Here, we are concerned with the past perfect which really <em>is</em> 
			a past tense form.<br />
			If we want to refer to a past state of affairs or action <strong>in 
			relation to the <span class="style_underline">previous</span> past</strong>, 
			this form will do it for us.&nbsp; Again, the form can be described 
			as <strong>relational</strong> rather than referring to <strong>
			absolute</strong> time.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Aspect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous
					past
					<strong>event</strong> continued as a past <strong>event</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>It had 
					rained all day.</em></span><br />
					and now it was still raining</td>
					<td class="auto-style7" rowspan="3">perfect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous
					<strong>finished past event</strong> resulted in a change to 
					the past <strong>event</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>He had 
					finally arrived.</em></span><br />
					so now we could get on</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous past
					<strong>event</strong> (recent or not) resulted in a past
					<strong>state</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>I had 
					spent all my money.</em></span><br />
					so now I was broke</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We can combine the perfect aspect with a continuous, progressive, 
			iterative, habitual, durative or even prospective aspect and for 
			this purpose, we will choose a different form.&nbsp; <strong>All</strong> the following retain the sense of the perfect 
			aspect, i.e., the relation of the past to a previous past but have 
			an <strong>additional</strong> aspect grafted on to them.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Aspect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a current past <strong>state</strong> 
					was a previous past
					<strong>state</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em class="auto-style10">I had been 
					feeling rough for a while</em><em class="concoursebluepara"><br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">and I still felt rough</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style7">continuous</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous 
					ongoing <strong>action</strong> was still occurring</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I had been walking quickly for 
					hours<br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">and was still walking 
					quickly</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style7">progressive</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous past 
					series of <strong>events</strong> was still a past series 
					of <strong>events</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>It had 
					been raining on and off all day.</em></span><br />
					and was still raining on and off</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">iterative</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous
					<strong>routine</strong> continued to be a <strong>routine</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>I had 
					been taking the 4 o'clock bus for years</em></span><br />
					and it was still my habit to do this</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">habitual</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a past, 
					long-lasting <strong>action</strong> continued to be a past 
					long-lasting <strong>action</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>I had 
					been thinking about it for a while.</em></span><br />
					and continued to do so</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">durative</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous past
					<strong>event or state</strong> affected a future <strong>
					event or state</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>I had 
					been meaning to talk to you for a while</em></span><br />
					and would do so very soon<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>The river had been rising all 
					night</em></span><br />
					and would soon flood the streets<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>We had decided that I was 
					going to drive / would drive</em></span><br />
					a form of future in the past, in fact</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">prospective</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Speakers will often choose prepositional phrases 
			(circumstances, if you prefer) to reinforce the meaning of what they 
			say <strong>from the point of view of the relationship between past 
			events</strong>.&nbsp; This is often, in the past perfect aspect, a 
			matter of causality.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I couldn't get in because I had left my keys at work</em><br />
			The other element to note is the use of <em>would</em> as a true 
			past form of <em>will</em>. in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had left my keys at work so knew I wouldn't be able to 
			get in.</em></p>
			<p>The progressive aspect has another implication: telicity.<br />
			In, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had read the book</em><br />
			the implication is that the book is finished so the verb is telic 
			(i.e., having a perceived end point), but in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been reading the book</em><br />
			the implication is that the book is unfinished and the verb is 
			atelic (i.e., having no perceived end point).<br />
			Here, too prepositional phrases are often involved in signalling 
			telicity, so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had read the book in an afternoon</em><br />
			is telic, with a prepositional phrase which expresses a time span, 
			but:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I had been reading the book in an afternoon</em><br />
			is not possible because the prepositional phrase implies a time span 
			rather than a frame.<br />
			We can have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been reading the book for an afternoon</em><br />
			because <em>for an afternoon</em> refers to a time frame and the 
			verb is atelic, with no end point suggested.</p>

			<p>The progressive aspect is not the same as the continuous.&nbsp; We 
			can assert that something was ongoing, i.e., in progress, in two 
			ways:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>

					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that an <strong>action</strong>

					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">right then</span></td>

					progressive (all three)</span></td>

					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that an <strong>action</strong>

					then</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><span class="concoursebluepara">

			</table>
			<p>Simple forms, with certain types of verbal processes, especially 
			mental processes such as <em>enjoy, appreciate, love, understand</em> 
			and verbal processes such as <em>say, aver, assert, describe, </em>
			are often progressive in aspect but the tense choice is simple.&nbsp; 
			This is the effect of stative and dynamic use and is <strong>not</strong> 
			paralleled in many languages.</p>
			<p>Again, as we saw above, the progressive aspect implies an atelic 
			use of the verb because it signals incompletion.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style2">

					I was not following the argument</em></span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>As with the progressive aspect, the continuous is expressed 
			through both the simple and complex tense forms.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>

					<td class="auto-style6" rowspan="2">I want to say that a
					<strong>state</strong> existed</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I felt terrible</em><em class="concoursebluepara"><br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">right then</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style9" rowspan="4">
					<span class="concoursebluepara">
					continuous</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I was feeling better<br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">right then</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6" rowspan="2">I want to say that a
					<strong>state of mind</strong> existed</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I thought that it was 
					astonishing</em><br />
					<span class="concoursebluepara">but this cannot be a

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I was looking forward to meeting 
					him</em><br />
					<span class="concoursebluepara">but this cannot be a 
					permanent condition</span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Here, too, the distinction between stative and dynamic verb
			<span class="style_underline">use</span> is apparent but in many circumstances, they are interchangeable with little or no 
			change in meaning.&nbsp; It is the verb's meaning that determines 
			the form, not <em>vice versa</em>.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was feeling better</em><br />
			with<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt the softness of the fur</em></p>

					<td class="auto-style4">
					<span class="style_black"><em>I was smoking too much</em></span></td>

			</table>
			<p>English happens to distinguish between the habitual (which is not 
			solely a past aspect) and the durative.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Aspect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6" rowspan="2">I want to say that an <strong>action</strong> 
					was a past long-lasting event which stopped</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I was staying at the Astor</em><em class="concoursebluepara"><br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">right then and for some 
					time into the past and future</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style9" rowspan="4">
					<span class="concoursebluepara">
					durative</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>He would often talk for hours</em><br />
					<span class="concoursebluepara">but no longer does</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6" rowspan="2">I want to say that a<strong> 
					state</strong> existed but stopped</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>There used to be a castle here</em><br />
					<span class="concoursebluepara">but nothing remains</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I used to have a house in London</em><br />
					<span class="concoursebluepara">but don't now</span></td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>The first of these could be described as progressive but the 
			speaker might not have been in the hotel at the time concerned (so 
			it wasn't an action in progress).<br />
			It is often stated in grammars for students that <em>would</em> can express the durative <strong>but only 
			for actions</strong>.&nbsp; We cannot have, e.g.,<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I would have 
			a house in London.<br />
			</em>That's reasonable classroom rule but 
			the verb can be used for some states with copular verbs which convey 
			the relationship between subject and complement like <em>be, 
			appear, seem, remain </em>etc. in, e.g.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would sometimes be a difficult person to talk to<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He would often appear uninterested<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I would remain in the house<br />
			</em>Frequently, we insert time adverbials in these formulations.</p>

			<p>It is worth noting the distinction here with verb meaning:<br />

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Who was playing the bagpipes?<br />

			<p>There are few learners of English above A1 level who have not 
			encountered a sentence like:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was having a shower when the doorbell rang</em><br />
			and the usual teacher explanation is something like:<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, having a shower is the 
			longer of the two actions and the doorbell rang is the short action.&nbsp; 
			It's called the interrupted past.</em></span><br />
			By the same token, a sentence such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The children were playing in the park while the parents 
			were gossiping</em><br />
			is often explained as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;Well, here we have two long 
			actions connected by either </em>when<em> or </em>while<em>.&nbsp; Both actions are long and happening at the same time.</em></span><br />
			The explanations account for the example sentences, for which they 
			were designed, of course, but both are 
			careless and misleading because neither can explain:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John read a book when I was gardening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary gardened while John read a book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children played while the parents gossiped</em></p>
			<p>The key is to get right away from talking about longer and 
			shorter actions and consider instead</p>
			<ol class="auto-style12">
				<li>how the speaker perceives the 
			nature of the events and here, too, the concepts of telic and atelic 
			clauses is useful</li>
				<li>the meanings of the 
			verbs which are used.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To explain:<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John read a book when I was gardening<br /></em>depends on the meaning of 
			<em>read.</em>&nbsp; The verb is 
			clearly not one which describes a sudden or immediately completed 
			action but by its nature requires some time.&nbsp; Additionally, the 
			inclusion of the object <em>book</em>, adds to the sense of a long 
			action.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John read the note when I was gardening<br />
			</em>in which the telic nature of the action is clear because <em>reading a note</em> is a short, finished action but 
			<em>reading a 
			book</em> is atelic and does not imply that John finished the book 
			(but may imply that he stopped reading at some point).<br />In:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<em>Mary gardened while John read a book<br /></em>and<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children played while the parents gossiped<br />
			</em>the speaker is referring to telic events which have a clear end 
			point.&nbsp; Such a sentence does not imply that either action is 
			unfinished or ongoing.&nbsp; Both actions may have taken some time 
			and therefore qualify as 'long' but the key is that the speaker 
			perceives them as telic, finished, over, done and dusted.<br />Semantically, too, all the verbs, 
			<em>garden, read, play, gossip</em>, 
			imply non-immediate, non-sudden events.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain started while the children played<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightning flashed while the rain fell in torrents<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightning flickered while the thunder was rumbling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bomb exploded while the Prime Minister was speaking</em><br />in which the semantic nature of the verbs,
			<em>start, flash, flicker, 
			explode,</em> allows the simple form however long the action takes 
			but the verbs <em>play, fall, rumble, speak</em> allow either form 
			depending on the speakers' view of telicity.</p>
			<p>Telicity also helps to explain the difference between:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary had a good idea while she was travelling to work</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary had a terrible accident while she was travelling to 
			work</em><br />
			In the first example only the first verb is telic because having the 
			idea is finished (she may even have forgotten what it was).&nbsp; 
			The travelling, however, is atelic because it continued for an 
			unspecified time after the event of having the idea.<br />
			In the second example the events are seen as telic and neither the 
			accident nor the travelling was unfinished.<br />
			The addition of the adjective <em>terrible</em> confirms the fact 
			that she did not continue her journey so semantics plays a role 
			here, too.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary had a minor accident while she was 
			travelling to work</em><br />
			which implies that the travelling probably continued, and is atelic 
			in the speaker's mind.</p>

			<p>The distinction here is with verb meaning:<br />
			When we are talking about past states rather than actions, the 
			durative is the aspect to consider (see above).<br />
			The habitual refers to actions.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Aspect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6" rowspan="2">I want to say that an
					<strong>action</strong> was routine but has ceased</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em class="auto-style10">I used to 
					run for the bus</em><em class="concoursebluepara"><br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">but I no longer do</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style9" rowspan="2"><span class="concoursebluepara">
					habitual</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I would always forget the time<br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">routinely</span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>See the comment under durative aspect above on the use of <em>would</em> + 
			bare infinitive 
			for states and actions.&nbsp; It is not the case that <em>would </em>
			can never be used to refer to states.</p>

			<p>This is commonly referred to as the future in the past and almost 
			always refers to a frustrated, prevented or avoided event.<br />
			In the past, only the <em>going to</em> form is possible 
			for frustrated events.&nbsp; We cannot have, e.g.,<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was having 
			a holiday but lost all my money.</em><br />
			There is an exception to this with the verb <em>go</em> exemplified by:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to America but couldn't get a flight.</em><br />
			Here, the <em>was going</em> formulation is preferred because it 
			avoids the somewhat clumsy <em>was going to go.</em><br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Aspect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that an <strong>action</strong> 
					lay in the future but was prevented</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>The tree was going to fall on 
					his house so he had it removed</em><span class="concoursebluepara"><br />
					current state had a future consequence</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style9" rowspan="4"><span class="concoursebluepara">
					all
					prospective</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a <strong>
					decision</strong> taken became unnecessary</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I was going to ring but he came 
					by<br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">the decision is now 
					redundant</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a <strong>plan</strong> 
					was thwarted</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><span class="style_black"><em>I was 
					going to take a holiday but there was too much work to do</em></span><br />
					<span class="concoursebluepara">a 'frustrated' future</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a future <strong>event</strong> 
					was avoided</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>It was going to hit me so I 
					ducked</em><br />
					<span class="concoursebluepara">threat avoided</span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The <em>going to</em> and the <em>-ing</em> forms are 
			traditionally cited as distinct future forms which have different 
			uses (the first for plans, the second for arrangements).&nbsp; In 
			our analysis they appear in the consideration of present time and 
			there is some doubt that the forms can be distinguished so easily.<br />
			The other common formulation to speak of frustrated futures in the 
			past is the <em>supposed to</em> construction as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were supposed to meet at one, but John was delayed.</em></p>
