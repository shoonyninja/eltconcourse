			<h1>Talking about present time</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="now" height="207" src="../../images/meditation_monk310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>English uses a number of strategies to apply aspect to present 
			time.&nbsp; The form we use depends on the aspect we 
			perceive.<br />
			You may be mildly surprised to find the present perfect, the <em>
			going to</em> formulation and the use of <em>be</em> + -<em>ing</em> 
			in this section.&nbsp; The argument is that, while they do refer to 
			future or past states or events, they do so premised on present states or 
			events and can only be understood with reference to the present.&nbsp; 
			In this sense they are <strong>relational</strong> not <strong>
			absolute</strong> forms and belong here.</p>
			<p>If you are expecting to find consideration of the present simple 
			tense in English in this guide, you will be disappointed.&nbsp; That 
			tense is considered in <a href="alwaystime.html">the guide to 
			talking about always</a> because it is a factual, absolute tense, 
			unmarked for time.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="perfectaspect" height="166" src="../../images/rain_window250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" rowspan="2">
					<h2>Perfect aspect in the present</h2>
					</td>

					<td class="auto-style4">
					<span class="style_black"><em>It has rained</em></span><em><br class="style_black" />
					</em><span class="style_black"><em>It has been raining</em></span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The clue to a major use of the present perfect lies in its name: 
			it is the <strong>present</strong> perfect.<br />
			If we want to refer to <strong>a present state of affairs or action
			in relation to the past</strong>, this form will do it 
			for us.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Aspect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a current <strong>event </strong>
					is also a previous
					<strong>event</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>It has 
					rained all day</em></span><br />
					and is still raining</td>
					<td class="auto-style7" rowspan="4">perfect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a change to the 
					present <strong>event </strong>is the result of a recent 
					finished past <strong>
					event</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>He has 
					finally arrived</em></span><br />
					so now we can get on</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a present
					<strong>state </strong>is the result of past <strong>
					event</strong> (recent or not)</td>

					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>I have 
					owned the house for some time</em></span><br />
					and still do</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We can combine the perfect aspect with a continuous, progressive, 
			iterative, habitual, durative or prospective aspect and for these 
			purposes, we choose a different form.&nbsp; <strong>All</strong> the following retain the sense of the perfect 
			aspect, i.e., the relation of the present to the past but have an
			<strong>additional</strong> aspect grafted on to them.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">

					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>

					<td class="auto-style7">progressive</td>

			<p>Speakers will often choose prepositional phrases 
			(circumstances, if you prefer) to reinforce the meaning of what they 
			say <strong>from their point of view</strong>.<br />
			There is <a href="../presentperfect.html">a guide to the present 
			perfect</a> on this site but it does not focus on more than two 
			aspects.</p>
			<p>One important point about the present perfect is that it can 
			refer to an imperfective or perfective use of the verb.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have returned</em><br />
			is perfective, insofar as the returning is complete.&nbsp; Another 
			way to say this is that the verb use is telic, with a perceived end 
			point.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have worked here for ten years</em><br />
			is imperfective because the implication is that I will go on working 
			here.&nbsp; Another way to say that is that the verb use is atelic, 
			having not end point in sight.</p>

					<img alt="walking" height="166" src="../../images/walking_country250.jpg" width="250" /></td>

			<p>The progressive aspect is not the same as the continuous.&nbsp; We 
			can assert that something is ongoing, i.e., in progress, in three 
			ways:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>

				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that an <strong>action</strong> 
					is currently in progress</td>
					<td class="auto-style9">S<em>he is sitting on the bus, 
					reading War and Peace and loves the story</em><em class="concoursebluepara"><br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">right now</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><span class="concoursebluepara">
					progressive (all three)</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>

					is in progress but is not currently happening</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>She's reading War and Peace<br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">but may be at work now</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style9" rowspan="2"><span class="concoursebluepara">
					progressive</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to <strong>comment</strong> 
					on or <strong>describe</strong> an <strong>action</strong> 
					in progress</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>See, I open it like this, take 
					out the screws and put them aside<br />
					Peterson moves quickly and scores</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Simple forms, with certain types of verbal processes, especially 
			mental processes such as <em>enjoy, appreciate, love, understand</em> 
			and verbal processes such as <em>say, aver, assert, describe, </em>
			are often progressive in aspect but the tense choice is simple.&nbsp; 
			This is the effect of stative and dynamic use and is <strong>not</strong> 
			paralleled in many languages.&nbsp; Examples include:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She appreciates your hospitality<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I understand the main points you are making<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			John says the weather will be better tomorrow<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I describe it as deeply foolish</em></p>
			<p>In all these cases, incidentally, the simple form of the verb is 
			used although the verb is atelic, have no explicitly stated end 
			point.&nbsp; This is slightly unusual because telicity is routinely 
			signalled by aspect in English with, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am living in London</em><br />
			which is atelic with no stated end point.<br />
			The unusual factor is that in the present tense, we can also express 
			an unfinished (atelic) event with the simple aspect:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in London.</em><br />
			This is not possible in the past because:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was living in London</em><br />
			is atelic with no end point but:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived in London</em><br />
			implies the event is concluded and is a telic use.</p>

					I am not following you</em></span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>As with the progressive aspect, the continuous is expressed 
			through both the simple and more complex verb forms.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Aspect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6" rowspan="2">I want to say that a <strong>state</strong> 
					currently exists</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I feel terrible</em><em class="concoursebluepara"><br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">right now</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style9" rowspan="4"><span class="concoursebluepara">
					continuous</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I'm feeling better<br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">right now</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6" rowspan="2">I want to say that a <strong>state 
					of mind</strong> currently exists</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I think that's astonishing</em><br />
					<span class="concoursebluepara">but this cannot be a 
					permanent condition</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I'm looking forward to meeting 
					you</em><br />
					<span class="concoursebluepara">but this cannot be a 
					permanent condition</span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Here, too, the distinction between stative and dynamic verb
			<span class="style_underline">use</span> is apparent but in some circumstances, 
			for example with the verb <em>feel</em>, they are interchangeable with little or no 
			change in meaning.&nbsp; When <em>feel</em> is used in the sense of
			<em>believe</em>, it is timeless, usually, so we can have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that's mistaken</em><br />
			but not:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *I am feeling that's mistaken.</em><br />
			(For more on verbs encoding mental or verbal processes which are 
			used in the simple form when they are statements of timeless fact 
			and in the progressive form when they refer to ongoing mental 
			processes, see <a href="alwaystime.html">the guide to talking about 
			always</a>.&nbsp; In that guide the short list of examples is: <em>
			believe, suggest, say, propose, aver, opine, avow, state, claim, 
			declare, swear, profess</em> and so on.)</p>
			<p>In all these cases, the verb is imperfective or atelic because no 
			end point is explicit.</p>

					<span class="style_black"><em>I'm smoking too much</em></span></td>

			</table>
			<p>English happens to distinguish between the habitual (which is not 
			solely a present aspect) and the durative.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Aspect</td>

					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that an <strong>action</strong>

					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I'm staying at the Astor</em><em class="concoursebluepara"><br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">right now and for some 
					time in the past and future</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style9" rowspan="3"><span class="concoursebluepara">
					durative</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a long-standing
					<strong>state</strong> currently exists but may cease soon</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>It's cooling down a bit<br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">right now</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a current <strong>
					event</strong> is understandable from previous experience of 
					the same event</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>That'll be the neighbour's son 
					coming home<br />
					That'll be the post arriving<br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">right now</span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>All of these could be described as progressive but the first 
			speaker may not be in the hotel now (so it isn't an action in 
			progress) and the second speaker may not be talking of weather at 
			this moment in time (so the state is not current).&nbsp; In both 
			cases, however, the event is unfinished.<br />
			A sub category of the durative, for which some languages have a 
			separate form, is the continuative which is signalled in English by 
			an adverbial of some kind rather than a tense form.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is still eating.</em></p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="bang" height="166" src="../../images/music_drums250.jpg" width="250" /></td>

					<h2>Iterative aspect in the present</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style4">
					<span class="style_black"><em>Who's banging the drum?</em></span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Note the distinction here with verb meaning:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who's banging the drum?<br />
			</em>is iterative (i.e., repeated) because the verb implies a short, 
			sharp action but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who's playing the bagpipes?<br />
			</em>is durative because the verb implies a long action.<br />
			The distinction between durative and iterative aspects in English 
			often lies in the meaning of the verb rather than the tense form.&nbsp; 
			That is not the case in other languages which may signal the uses in 
			distinct verb forms.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Aspect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that an <strong>action</strong>

					<td class="auto-style9"><em>Someone's knocking on the door</em><em class="concoursebluepara"><br />
					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">right now but the 
					knocks may be quite infrequent</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style9" rowspan="2"><span class="concoursebluepara">

					</em><span class="concoursebluepara">over a period of time, 
					repeatedly</span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p><em>Who bangs the drum?</em> and <em>Who plays the bagpipes?</em>

			</table>
			<p>You may be slightly surprised to find what are often contrasted 
			as two future forms in the section on talking about the present.&nbsp; 
			However, seen from an understanding of prospective aspect, it makes 
			good sense.<br />
			Just as the perfect aspect (above) highlights the nature of a 
			present state of affairs or action in relation to the past, so the 
			prospective aspect highlights <strong>the relationship between a 
			current situation and the future</strong>.<br />
			Both the obviously present forms that we use to talk about the 
			future in that analysis are better understood as being rooted firmly 
			in the present.</p>

			<p>The traditional analysis of these two forms as future indicators 
			is not without merit but their use for the future can only be 
			understood from <strong>previous</strong> events or states.<br />
			The distinction between an intention with <em>going to</em> and an 
			arrangement (with the <em>-ing</em> form), if it is sustainable at 
			all, can only be discovered by reference to actions or states at a 
			time before the future.</p>
			<p>It is sometimes said, with reason, that when discussing plans and 
			arrangements (for which we use the present progressive form) or 
			intentions (for which we use the <em>going to</em> structure) the 
			forms are, in fact much more fluid than the simple dichotomy 
			suggests.&nbsp; Functionally, there is little distinction between 
			the meanings of the forms, so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's taking a holiday next week<br />
			</em>carries the same meaning as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to take a holiday next week<br />
			</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to see my mother on Monday<br />
			</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm seeing my mother on Sunday<br />
			</em>are also virtually indistinguishable.</p>
			<p>There are times, however, when the forms are not interchangeable 
			or when ambiguity needs to be avoided.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Semantic disqualification</strong><br />
				<img alt="red card" height="133" src="../../images/sign_red_card200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				With some verbs, arrangement is semantically possible.&nbsp; For 
				example, we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm turning up at my mother's party on 
				Sunday</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to turn up at my mother's 
				party on Sunday</em><br />
				with little difference, if any, in meaning.<br />
				But, if the meaning of the verb specifically excludes any 
				possibility of an agreed arrangement then the progressive form 
				is not possible so we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to surprise my mother by 
				turning up at her party on Sunday</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I am surprising my mother by turning up 
				at her party on Sunday<br />
				</em>because, semantically, you cannot arrange to be <em>surprised, 
				astonished, excited, flabbergasted, bewildered</em> etc.&nbsp; 
				All these sorts of verbs are disqualified from appearing with 
				the <em>be + -ing</em> form, therefore.</li>
				<li><strong>Avoiding ambiguity</strong><br />
				<img alt="alternative meanings" height="133" src="../../images/alternatives200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The progressive form, in order to avoid ambiguity, usually needs 
				to be accompanied by a time adverbial unless the context makes 
				the future nature of the current plan clear.&nbsp; So, for 
				example, we can have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to drive to London</em><br />
				without context and the future sense is still clear.<br />
				However,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to London</em><br />
				without any context is ambiguous and could mean:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to London as we speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm planning / have arranged to drive to London</em><br />
				or even<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my current, temporary habit to drive to London</em> 
				(rather than use an alternative form of transport)<br />
				If the context does not clarify the situation as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Can you come in early tomorrow?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: Sorry.&nbsp; I'm taking the kids to school</em><br />
				we need to insert a time adverbial to disambiguate what we are 
				saying so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to London in the morning</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to London soon</em><br />
				are not ambiguous even without context because of the 
				prepositional phrase adverbial or the adverb respectively.</li>
				<li><strong>Stative vs. Dynamic verb uses</strong><br />
				<img alt="dynamic" height="133" src="../../images/dynamic_water200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The <em>going to</em> formulation can be used with verbs used statively 
				so we allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to be angry when he gets the 
				news<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's going to look wonderful at tonight's party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are going to seem out of place in that company</em><br />
				we do not allow the progressive forms:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is being angry when he gets the news<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She's looking wonderful at tonight's party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They are seeming out of place in that company</em><br />
				if the reference is to the future.<br />
				Both forms can be used with verbs used dynamically, only <em>
				going to</em> is used statively.</li>
				<li><strong>Inanimate subjects</strong><br />
				<img alt="ladder" height="133" src="../../images/ladder200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				We do not ascribe the ability to plan or form arrangements to 
				inanimate objects so we allow, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out!&nbsp; The ladder's going to slip in a minute</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out!&nbsp; *The ladder's slipping in 
				a minute.</em><br />
				This distinction is most noticeable when we are talking about 
				the weather.&nbsp; Because it is inanimate, the weather is 
				spoken about as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to rain tomorrow</em><br />
				but not as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's raining tomorrow.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Present evidence</strong><br />
				<img alt="angry" height="133" src="../../images/woman_angry_smoke200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Only <em>going to</em> can be used to refer to present evidence 
				leading to a future event.&nbsp; So we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's making her angry.&nbsp; She's going 
				to lose her temper soon<br />
				</em>but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's making her angry.&nbsp; She's losing 
				her temper soon</em><br />
				Again, the present evidence rule applies when talking 
				about inanimate objects such as the weather when present 
				evidence is important so we get, for example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Look at the clouds.&nbsp; It's going to rain soon</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the clouds.&nbsp; *It's raining 
				soon.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Past experience</strong><br />
				<img alt="smile" height="133" src="../../images/man_smile200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Prospective events based on past experience are also only 
				realised through <em>going to</em>.&nbsp; For example, we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When your father hears, he's going to 
				laugh</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *When your father hears, he's laughing</em><br />
				even though the future reference is clear.<br />
				Again, past experience of weather conditions often makes the 
				form suitable for that, too.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to snow a lot in Canada in 
				January</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is snowing a lot in Canada in January.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Conditional and contingent clauses</strong><br />
				<img alt="train snow" height="133" src="../../images/train_snow200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is another sematic (or pragmatic) issue.&nbsp; For example, 
				we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the trains aren't running, I'm going 
				to drive</em><br />
				and it is a conditional expressing the fact that the speaker 
				does not yet know if the trains will be running.&nbsp; However,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the trains aren't running, I'm driving</em><br />
				does not have the same sense because it implies that the speaker 
				already knows the trains are not running so has formed a plan or 
				arrangement to drive.&nbsp; It could be realised as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>As the trains aren't running, I'm driving.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Modal auxiliary verbs</strong><br />
				<img alt="help" height="133" src="../../images/helping_up200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Because most modal auxiliary verbs are defective in English and do not 
				exhibit the full range of forms that lexical verbs do, there are 
				severe limitations on the ways they can be used with either the
				<em>going to</em> or the <em>be + -ing</em> structure.<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li><strong>Deontic modality </strong>refers to duty or 
					obligation and we allow, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to have to talk to her</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am having to work long hours</em><br />
					but the second of these refers to present rather than future 
					obligation and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; ?I am having to attend a meeting tomorrow</em><br />
					is at best questionable.<br />
					Other expressions of this form of modality which are 
					rendered in the present with modal auxiliary verbs such as
					<em>should</em> and <em>ought to</em>.<br />
					There are no equivalent forms using either of these 
					structures so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;*He is going to ought to tell her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The are shoulding do it</em><br />
					are not available.<br />
					Other languages allow future forms of equivalent modal 
					auxiliary verbs and 
					learners may be surprised to find that English does not.&nbsp; 
					In fact, these deontic modal auxiliary verbs are used 
					interchangeably in English to refer to present and future 
					obligation as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should smoke less<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should talk to him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ought to be better at this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ought to tell her</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li><strong>Epistemic modality</strong> refers to 
					possibility and likelihood and are again not expressed with 
					these two structures so, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is going to ought to be there by 
					now</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is shoulding be there soon</em><br />
					are not possible.<br />
					Again, both these future meanings are expressed using the 
					same form for present and future time as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She should be here before six 
					tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They ought to arrive soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It ought to work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be possible now</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li><strong>Alethic modality</strong> refers to the general 
					truth of a proposition and is usually timeless so present 
					forms are used and we cannot have, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A square is going to have to have 
					four sides</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A square is having to have four 
					sides.</em></li>
					<li><strong>Dynamic modality</strong> refers to the 
					individual's capabilities, as in, e.g.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see the point</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					The <em>going to</em> formulation is available for some 
					forms of dynamic modality to refer to a present ability 
					realised in the future so we allow, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is going to be able to help</em>
					<em>later</em><br />
					but we do not allow, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is being able to help later</em><br />
					so the <em>be + -ing</em> form is not available to refer to 
					current ability realised in the future.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Arrangements</strong><br />
				<img alt="restaurant" height="133" src="../../images/restaurant_exterior200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is a marginal difference and more a tendency than a rule.&nbsp; 
				By their nature, arrangements are made between people but 
				intentions can be formed individually and only later 
				communicated to others.&nbsp; Most English speakers will prefer, 
				therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us are meeting at the restaurant 
				in the square tomorrow</em><br />
				to<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us are going to meet at the restaurant in the 
				square tomorrow</em><br />
				although both are possible with little effect on meaning.<br />
				However, in an exchange such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Are you writing to the boss about 
				this?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: No.&nbsp; I'm going to talk to her face to face.</em><br />
				then the second speaker has only now communicated a pre-formed 
				intention.&nbsp; If the second speaker had said:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; B: No.&nbsp; I'm meeting her face to face.</em><br />
				then the meaning is that the speaker and the boss have reached 
				an agreement to meet.</li>

				</table>
			<p>It is possible that the event or state which triggers the 
			future may even be in the past, omitting any reference to the 
			present altogether as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talked it over and we're going to emigrate.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			We had a long chat and are moving in together.<br />
			</em>which are both examples of a perfective past simple resulting 
			in a current prospective event.<em><br />
			</em>The prospective present can also be combined with the perfect 
			as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been agreed that I am driving / going to drive.<br />
			</em>In the last case, we have a perfective action (completed) couched 
			in perfect form and followed by a prospective aspect in a present 
			tense (and either form is acceptable).</p>
