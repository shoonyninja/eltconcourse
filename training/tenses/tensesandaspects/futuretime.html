			<h1>Talking about future time</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="FUTURE" height="207" src="../../images/flying_saucer_girl310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>If you have arrived here in expectation of encountering either 
			the <em>going to</em> formulation (as in <em>I am going to see the 
			movie</em>) or the present tense used for the future (as in, e.g.,
			<em>I am taking Mary to the cinema tomorrow</em>) you will be 
			disappointed.&nbsp; Both those forms are discussed under
			<a href="presenttime.html">present time</a> because that is where 
			they belong.</p>
			<p>English uses a number of strategies to apply aspect to future 
			time.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it also employs a lot of modality and 
			pseudo-modality so that will be considered here first before we get 
			along to aspect.</p>
			<p>Modality occurs primarily because the future is, by definition, 
			uncertain.<br />
			If we are certain of something, present tenses are commonly used as 
			in, for example, in answer to<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Where's John?</em><br />
			the response is:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; He's in his room.</em><br />
			then the speaker is demonstrating certainty about a current 
			situation.<br />
			If, on the other hand, the response is:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll be in his room.</em><br />
			then, although the speaker is expressing that she is almost certain 
			of the truth of what she says, there is an implication that John 
			may, in fact, not be in his room.&nbsp; In fact, responses like 
			these are very often softened with the addition of something like
			<em>I expect</em>.<br />
			The fact that <em>will</em> can express this near-but-not-absolute certainty 
			explains much of its use as an auxiliary verb to refer to the future.</p>

			<p>The simple auxiliary verb <em>will</em> causes serious problems 
			for learners and some of them are traceable to the fact that the 
			verb is polysemous and used in two main allied but different meanings in English.&nbsp; 
			Once they are distinguished, much becomes clearer.</p>

			<p>The word <em>will </em>derives from the Old English <em>wyllan</em> which 
			meant, among other things, <em>wish, desire, be willing to.<br />
			</em>It also meant <em>be about to</em> and it is probably thence we derive 
			its use as a future time marker.<br />
			The past tense was <em>wolde</em> (now <em>would</em>), incidentally.<em><br />
			</em>There are cognate words in most Germanic languages, e.g., <em>
			wollen</em> in German which means <em>wish </em>or<em> want 
			(to) </em>and is not a future tense marker (that's <em>werden</em>, 
			which also, confusingly, means <em>become</em>).&nbsp; The 
			first-person singular form of the verb in German is <em>will.</em></p>
			<p>The problems arise when learners assume (or, unforgivably, are told) it is 
			only a future form 
			marker in English whereas it is, in fact, commonly&nbsp;a 
			signal of 
			willingness or volition rather than futurity.&nbsp; (A further small 
			complication is that there is a transitive verb in English, <em>to 
			will</em>, which means something like <em>to bring about by exercise 
			of willpower</em>.)<br />
			Some examples may help.</p>

					so two instances of <em>will</em> are allowable.&nbsp; Compare it to<br />
					<em>What will he do if she doesn't marry him?<br />
					</em>which clearly has reference to the future and only one 
					instance of <em>will</em> is needed.</td>
					<td class="auto-style32">volition</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The two meanings are not always easily separable.&nbsp; 
			For example:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="futurity" height="139" src="tenseimages/futurity.png" width="400" /></p>
			<p>The problem in the middle lies with the intention of the speaker.&nbsp; 
			It may be a prediction about the future based on sound evidence, it 
			may, less usually, be a spontaneous decision or 
			it may, as is more common, be an expression of willingness or a 
			commitment:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5" style="width: 80%">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style25">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style25"><em>Can we talk about this?</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style26">This refers to right now.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21">B:</td>
					<td class="auto-style21"><em>I can't now.&nbsp; I'll talk to 
					you tomorrow, if you like.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style24">And so does this.&nbsp; The speaker 
					is expressing a current inability and a current willingness.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style21"><em>OK.&nbsp; I'll try to come in 
					early.&nbsp; Goodnight.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style24">And this.&nbsp; The speaker is 
					expressing a current willingness, or promising.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21">B:</td>
					<td class="auto-style21"><em>Goodnight.&nbsp; We'll talk 
					tomorrow.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style24">Now the speaker is referring the 
					future <em>per se</em> and not willingness but certainty.&nbsp; 
					If the speaker had said:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect we'll talk tomorrow</em><br />
					then the sense of likelihood is diminished.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The distinction is important because the intrinsic meaning of an 
			expression of willingness (which is a present reference) has to be 
			separated from the extrinsic meaning of inevitability concerning 
			future events (which is a proper future reference).<br />
			There is, rather obviously, some sense of reference to the future in 
			something like <em>I'll do the cooking this evening</em> but the key 
			here is to understand that the speaker is referring primarily to 
			present volition (i.e., volunteering or committing) rather than the future event which 
			may, or may not, actually occur.<br />
			Like this:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5" style="width: 80%">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style25"><em>I'm on the train and I'll be in 
					London by six.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style26">
					<p class="auto-style38">This expresses an inevitable, 
					timetabled future.</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21"><em>If you will get that in the 
					post, it will be there tomorrow.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style24">
					<p class="auto-style38">Two separate uses:<br />
					the first is a request and refers to what someone is 
					prepared to do <strong>now</strong><br />
					the second is a prediction about the efficiency of the 
					postal delivery in the <strong>future</strong></p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21"><em>It'll be snowing in Canada at this 
					time of year.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style24">
					<p class="auto-style38">This is a simple prediction based 
					on climatic knowledge and has nothing to do with anyone's 
					wishes or disposition.&nbsp; It is a true future form.<br />
					The <em>going to</em> formulation can also be used, more 
					rarely, to 
					express this meaning but the <em>be + -ing</em> form cannot.&nbsp; 
					We can have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to be snowing in Canada at 
					this time of year</em><br />
					but not:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is snowing in Canada at this time 
					of year</em><br />
					Even in this use, the speaker can be 
					referring to the present and stating a fact.&nbsp; It is 
					akin to hearing the telephone ring and stating<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That'll 
					be your mother</em>.<br />
					This is reference to now.</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21"><em>Stop that! I won't tell you 
					again</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style24">
					<p class="auto-style38">This is also an expression of 
					current willingness (negatively).&nbsp; It may, obliquely, 
					refer to the future but the speaker's intention is to 
					express a current emotional state.</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Naturally, because we more rarely make commitments for other 
			people, the volitional aspect of the auxiliary verb is most evident 
			in the first person so expressions such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll do the work</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't help you</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll be happy to come</em><br />
			are most likely to be interpreted as expressing willingness (or its 
			lack) rather 
			than referring solely to the future.<br />
			Negative volition can be used in other persons more frequently so we 
			get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Won't she help?</em> (=<em>Is she unwilling 
			to help?</em>)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They won't come to work </em>(<em>=They are 
			unwilling to come to work</em>)<br />
			and neither of those are about the future.&nbsp; The reference is to 
			their <strong>current</strong> volitional state of mind.</p>
			<p>By the same token,<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll be delighted</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll do the work</em><br />
			are most likely to be interpreted as proper future references.</p>
			<p>That is, however, not always the case because we do sometimes 
			delegate to a third person or command the second person so, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My secretary will do the work</em><br />
			can be interpreted both ways, as an expression of my willingness to 
			tell him to do the work (volition) or as a prediction concerning who 
			will do the work.<br />
			Equally,<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You will not do that again!</em><br />
			can be interpreted as volition (on my part) forbidding you to do it 
			again or as a prediction concerning your behaviour.</p>
			<p>Slightly more technically, the distinction between the two central meanings of
			<em>will</em> can be understood 
			as distinct forms of modality:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>epistemic modality refers to the likelihood or otherwise of 
				an event, state or proposition being true in fact.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure he'll be very pleased to hear that<br />
				</em>The verb <em>will</em> carries very strong epistemic modality as can 
				be see if we contrast<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will have passed the examination</em><br />
				with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ought to have passed the examination</em><br />
				In the first case, it is not possible to insert <em>but he 
				didn't </em>after the clause, in the second case, it is.&nbsp; 
				This means the first case refers to the absolute truth of a 
				proposition.<br />
				The modal nature of will is revealed when one considers the 
				kinds of verbal processes with which it occurs.&nbsp; These are 
				almost invariably mental processes concerning the belief in the 
				truth of something.&nbsp; We get, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm afraid he'll be unhelpful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe she'll come alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I doubt if it'll rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect she'll be here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure they'll help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel certain she'll be there by now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know he'll take the train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope she'll marry me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose it'll be OK<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he'll fail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reckon we'll be late</em><br />
				all of which express varying levels of certainty but, because 
				the future is, by definition, unknown, epistemic modality comes 
				into play.</li>
				<li>dynamic modality refers to ability or willingness on the 
				part of the speaker.&nbsp; For example:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I'll tell her (if you like)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll help with that<br />
				</em>both refer to the speaker's willingness.<br />
				The dynamic modality of the verb is also revealed by the verbal 
				processes with which is associated.&nbsp; They are almost 
				invariably behavioural ones and the verb expresses requests or 
				invitations (and is nothing to do with the future).&nbsp; We 
				get, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you be quiet for a moment?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Won't you stay a little longer?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you do that for me?</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>deontic modality refers to obligation or prohibition so for 
				example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; My father will take us to school</em><br />
				implies that the speaker will somehow oblige the father to act 
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will speak to your teacher more 
				politely</em><br />
				suggests that you are being obliged to do something.<br />
				In neither case are we speaking solely about futurity because 
				the obligation comes before the action.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The problem is that not distinguishing between the meanings of
			<em>will</em> results in error &ndash; teacher-induced error.&nbsp; 
			Most course materials (and hundreds of websites) assert that the use 
			of <em>will</em> to express a disposition or promise to do something is a 
			simple future form.&nbsp; It is not.&nbsp; It is about one's current 
			(i.e., present) state of mind.&nbsp; Worse, the admonition in many 
			materials is to slide from the volitional use of the verb to a future form of <em>will</em> to an 
			expression of current plans and the use of <em>going to</em>.</p>
			<p>Take a simple and often-used telephone dialogue such as:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style25">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style27"><em>I don't think there's any wine 
					in the house.</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21">B:</td>
					<td class="auto-style28"><em>Isn't there?&nbsp; Oh, I'll go 
					and get some.</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Students are asked to believe that the second speaker's statement refers to 
			the future and is an example of a spontaneous decision.&nbsp; It doesn't &ndash; it refers 
			to the speaker's current willingness or a promise to do something.&nbsp; 
			It <span class="style_underline">may</span> result in a future 
			action but that is not the point at all.<br />
			If the conversation develops like this:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style25">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style27"><em>Don't bother, I'll get some on 
					the way home.</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21">B:</td>
					<td class="auto-style28"><em>Will you have time?</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Then students realise that the future isn't going to happen.&nbsp; 
			It wasn't a future use, anyway.<br />
			They are now faced with two completely different uses of <em>will</em>.&nbsp; 
			The first expresses volunteering (now) and the second is a question 
			that really <em>is</em> about the future.&nbsp; And it gets worse if 
			the dialogue goes on something like:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style25">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style27"><em>Yes, no problem.&nbsp; I'm 
					going to leave a bit early so I'll be there before they 
					shut.</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21">B:</td>
					<td class="auto-style28"><em>Fine.&nbsp; I expect John'll 
					bring a bottle, too.</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>in which we now have an expression of a present plan, a 
			prediction about travel times and another prediction about the 
			future based on the speaker's knowledge of John's character and 
			habits.</p>
			<h4>This gets even worse<br />
			<img alt="problem" height="133" src="../../images/problems_b200.gif" width="200" /></h4>
			<p>If the materials do not alert learners to the types of verbal 
			processes which are associated with the modal use of <em>will</em>, 
			then they induce errors of comprehension and appropriacy.<br />
			For example, a dialogue such as:<br />
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style25">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style27"><em>I expect she'll be here soon.</em></td>

					<td class="auto-style28"><em>Will she bring the papers with

					<td class="auto-style21">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style28"><em>I hope she will</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21">B:</td>
					<td class="auto-style28"><em>Will you clear the desk for 
					her?</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			</p>
			<p>contains three different uses of the auxiliary verb</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To express epistemic modality concerning the truth of a 
				proposition.&nbsp; We saw above that this use is very common 
				with mental process verbs such as think, believe, feel sure, 
				hope etc.&nbsp; That is the use in A's first and second 
				statements.</li>
				<li>The second use is to refer to a real future: B's first 
				response is clearly concerned with future time and is asking for 
				A's prediction.</li>
				<li>The third, unconnected use is a request (and the form is 
				also often used for invitation) and has nothing to do with 
				futurity or likelihood.&nbsp; It concerns dynamic modality and 
				refers to A's willingness to do something.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is little wonder that learners get confused if the uses and 
			meanings are jumbled up like this.</p>

			<p>A further source of teacher-induced error is the assumption that 
			it is not necessary to deal with <em>shall</em> at all because <em>
			will</em> has taken over and the verb has fallen / is falling into 
			disuse.&nbsp; That's not a bad rule of thumb but it is worth 
			noticing some issues.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>derivation and meaning</strong></dt>
				<dd>the verb <em>shall</em> is derived from a different source 
				from <em>will</em>.&nbsp; The base sense is actually connected 
				to the idea of obligation and cognate verbs in other languages 
				retain the sense of <em>shall</em> as <em>should </em>or<em> 
				ought to.&nbsp; </em>Compare <em>sollen</em> in German, for 
				example.&nbsp; The use to speak about the future is 
				comparatively recent and comparatively rare.</dd>
				<dt><strong>polysemy</strong></dt>
				<dd>the verb <em>shall</em> displays the same polysemy as <em>
				will</em> and can carry the sense of pure prediction, e.g.,<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I shall be in New York at 8 if the plane's on time<br />
				</em>and 
				volition:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall I help you with that?</em><br />
				The 
				use in questions, which is still quite common, is almost always 
				to do with disposition, readiness or willingness and carries no 
				future predictive sense:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where shall we go?&nbsp; </em>(= <em>Where do we want [now] to go?</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shan't! </em>(= <em>I refuse</em> [now])<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where shall I put this?</em> (= <em>Where should I [now] put 
				this?</em>)</dd>
				<dt><strong>obligation</strong></dt>
				<dd>the verb retains its sense of obligation in often legalese 
				statements like<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The property owner shall ensure ...<br />
				</em>etc. and 
				also in<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shan't talk to me like that</em>.<br />
				In this 
				sense, the verb usually has nothing to do with the future.&nbsp; 
				It expresses obligation and obligation routinely refers to both 
				present and future time.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.,<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We mustn't be late<br />
				</em>which can refer to present time or the future 
				depending on context.<br />
				There is a formal use for <strong>all</strong> persons of <em>
				shall</em> in, e.g.<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shall not interrupt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall not 
				pass<br />
				</em>etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>commissive modality</strong></dt>
				<dd>a rarer (and rarely taught) use of <em>shall</em> is in what 
				is known as commissive modality in which the speaker / writer 
				creates a self-imposed duty (so it is a sub-category of deontic 
				modality).&nbsp; In BrE, this is often realised through the use 
				of <em>shall</em> in expressions such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shall have the money by Thursday</em><br />
			although in spoken language the contracted form ('<em>ll</em>) 
			disguises the use of <em>shall</em> and many believe it is a use of
			<em>will</em>.&nbsp; The modal auxiliary verb <em>will</em> is often 
			used in this way but expresses volition or willingness rather than a commitment 
			as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll give you money on Thursday</em></dd>

			<p>When <em>will</em> is used to refer to the future rather than to

				<li ><em>It's a given fact that he'll be late.</em></li>
				<li ><em>There's a strong possibility she'll get lost.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are all indicators that the verb is really being used to 
			refer to future time and not to volition.&nbsp; In fact, the 
			situation may be and often is wholly outside the control of the 
			speaker.<br />
			Other verbal indicators of this sort were listed above and included:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be afraid<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; think<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be sure</em><br />
			all of which are mental verbal processes.</p>
			<p>These introductory expressions always refer to the speaker's view 
			of the likelihood of the future event or state.&nbsp; If <em>will
			</em>concerns volition or making promises (much the same thing), 
			the expressions change the sense to pure futurity:</p>

			<p>Using a simple form like this to refer to the future is, slightly 
			misleadingly, called the 'timetabled' future.&nbsp; It might be 
			better described as the certain future because it is closely allied 
			to the use of a simple present tense to refer to predictable facts 
			as in, e.g.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;It snows heavily in The Alps in winter</em><br />
			Of course, that form includes timetables but it also covers events that 
			we are sure of because they are tied to other ever-present 
			background events.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>Look busy, the boss arrives in a minute<br />
				</em>(i.e., we 
				are talking about the future but basing the certainty on 
				habitual background behaviour)</li>
				<li><em>I arrive at around 6 if all's well<br />
				</em>i.e., this is 
				my future but under the control of someone else's timetable.&nbsp; 
				Compare it to<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I'm driving up and will get to you around 6<br />
				</em>in which the simple use is not possible so we cannot have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'm driving up and get to you around 6</em><br />
				because it is a personal prediction not tied to external 
				timetables.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In both cases above, the simple tense can be replaced with a <em>
			will</em> formulation, either in simple or progressive aspects (<em>will 
			arrive / will be arriving</em>) with no change in meaning.&nbsp; No 
			other modal, except the first-person <em>shall</em>,<em> </em>can be 
			used without changing the meaning.&nbsp; The reverse does not 
			usually apply: 
			we cannot always insert a simple tense form instead of a formulation 
			with<em> will / shall</em>.&nbsp; The following are not acceptable 
			transformations:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll talk to you tomorrow &ne; I talk to you 
			tomorrow<br />
			</em>because the reference is to willingness , not futurity.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She'll be here later &ne; She is here later<br />
			</em>because the reference is to modality concerning likelihood, not 
			futurity.<br />
			The following are acceptable transformations because they do concern 
			futurity:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train will arrive in a minute = The train 
			arrives in a minute<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss get here soon = The boss will get here soon</em><br />
			because the sense of pure futurity is maintained in both 
			formualtions.</p>

			<p>The marginal modal auxiliary verb <em>going to</em> is analysed 
			on this site as a present tense with future aspect because it is 
			most often used that way to state that there is present evidence for 
			a future event, as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's going to rain</em><br />
			or present intent for a future action, as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to talk to the boss.</em><br />
			In some analyses, however, it makes sense to include <em>going to</em> 
			as a future form because it concerns prediction based not on what 
			one perceives now (such as rain clouds) or on what one intends now 
			but on prediction substantiated.<br />
			For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's going to be furious when she finds out</em><br />
			a speaker is making a prediction based not on present intention or 
			present evidence but on what she / he knows about the person in 
			question.<br />
			In this analysis, there are two forms of prediction: <strong>
			substantiated</strong> and <strong>unsubstantiated</strong>.<br />
			Substantiated prediction involves the use of <em>going to</em> and 
			unsubstantiated prediction involves the use of <em>will</em> so, the 
			theory goes, we have a contrast between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll be at home this evening</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to be at home this evening</em><br />
			and the assertion is that the former is unsubstantiated and the 
			latter substantiated by current knowledge of the situation.<br />
			Unfortunately, neat though the concept seems, it doesn't work 
			because:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We often use will for prediction based on current 
				substantiated facts so we get, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm on the train now so I'll be there 
				around 6</em><br />
				which cannot be classed as an unsubstantiated prediction because 
				of the speaker's obvious understanding of a current fact.</li>
				<li>We can use <em>going to</em> to make unsubstantiated 
				predictions as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if she's going to come</em><br />
				where the speaker has admitted to having no substantiated facts 
				to work on.</li>
				<li>There is a cline from substantiated to unsubstantiated with 
				many intermediate levels of certainty and here we are in the 
				realm of epistemic modality (the speaker's view of the truth of 
				a proposition).&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to be here shortly, he's just 
				parking his car</em><br />
				which is substantiated prediction based on a current situation 
				(so arguably, just the present tense used with a future aspect).<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will be here soon</em><br />
				which is an expression of certainty based on something unsaid 
				but influential.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He might be here soon</em><br />
				which is an expression of uncertainty<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He must be here soon</em><br />
				which is probably an expression of great certainty (because of 
				knowledge of other facts) but might also, of course, be an 
				expression of obligation.</li>
				<li>The verb <em>will</em> and the expression <em>going to</em> 
				are interchangeable when there is some substantiation so we can 
				have either:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He'll be here shortly, he's just parking his car<br />
				</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to be here shortly, he's just parking his car<br />
				</em>with no discernible difference in meaning.<br />
				And this can also imply a prediction based on current evidence 
				as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll rain in a minute.&nbsp; Look at 
				those clouds</em><br />
				vs.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to rain in a minute.&nbsp; 
				Look at those clouds.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Because the differentiation between substantiated <em>vs.</em> 
			unsubstantiated prediction is so difficult to make and because the 
			two forms can so often be used interchangeably, it is not a useful 
			classroom tactic to make this difference at all.<br />
			However, if one reserves <em>will</em> for prediction and <em>going 
			to</em> for a present situation or intention with a prospective 
			aspect, as the analysis on this site has it, one is on safer ground 
			and the distinctions become more intuitive (and production more 
			accurate as a result).</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Simple forms with certain types of verbal processes are 
				still continuous in aspect.&nbsp; This is the effect of stative and dynamic use and is <strong>not</strong> 
			paralleled in many languages.<ol class="auto-style31">
					<li><strong>mental processes</strong> such as <em>enjoy, appreciate, love, 
					feel, know, understand</em></li>
					<li><strong>projecting processes</strong> such as<em> hope, 
					expect, imagine, suspect</em></li>
					<li><strong>verbal processes</strong> such as <em>say, aver, assert, describe</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Both the simple and complex forms of the tense can be used 
				for iterative, durative and habitual aspects but <strong>not</strong> for 
				progressive or continuous aspects unless the verb denotes one of 
				the processes mentioned in point 1.<br />
				We can say<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll go to the office at nine every day </em>
				(iterative)<br />
				or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll take the train for a month instead of 
				the bus </em>(durative)<br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He will have lunch so don't phone now </em>(progressive)</li>
				<li>The volitional use of will does <strong>not</strong> occur 
				in these aspects so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be taking the train</em><br />
				only refers to the future, whereas, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll take the train tomorrow</em><br />
				could mean:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am now willing to take the train 
				tomorrow</em> (so, say, you can have the car)<br />
				or<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I predict that this is my mode of transport tomorrow</em> (and 
				is a future tense form)</li>

			<p>The perfect always refers one time to another.&nbsp; 
			It is a <strong>relational</strong> not an absolute time reference.</p>
			<p>The future perfect allows people to express how a future will look from 
			a viewpoint later in the future.&nbsp; Time lines are a helpful way 
			to explain:<br />

			<p>We can combine the perfect aspect with a continuous, progressive, 
			iterative, habitual or durative aspect and for this purpose, we will 
			choose a different form.&nbsp; <strong>All</strong> the following retain the sense of the perfect 
			aspect, i.e., the relation of the future to a previous future but have 
			an <strong>additional</strong> aspect grafted on to them.<br />
			For example:</p>

			<p>Speakers will often choose a prepositional phrase 
			(circumstance, if you prefer) introduced by <em>by </em>in both the 
			perfect forms.</p>
			<p>As is the case with most tense forms in English, telicity plays 
			an important role.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The house will have been built</em><br />
			is telic because we are clearly stating the building work is 
			finished, but:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house will have been being built</em><br />
			is atelic because the end point of the building is not implied.<br />
			This is clearer when a prepositional time phrase is included:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The house will have been built in a year</em><br />
			is telic and the end point is explicit<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house will have been being built for a 
			year</em><br />
			is atelic because there is no explicit end point in sight.</p>
