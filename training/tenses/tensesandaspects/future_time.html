			<h1>Talking about future time</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="FUTURE" height="207" src="../../images/flying_saucer_girl310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>If you have arrived here in expectation of encountering either 
			the <em>going to</em> formulation, as in<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to see the 
			movie</em><br />
			or the present tense used for the future, as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am taking Mary to the cinema tomorrow<br />
			</em>you will not be 
			wholly 
			disappointed but both those forms are also discussed under
			<a href="present_time.html" target="_blank" class="highlightlink">present time</a> because that is where 
			they arguably belong.</p>
			<p>English uses a number of strategies to apply aspect to future 
			time.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it also employs a lot of modality and 
			pseudo-modality so that will be considered here first before we get 
			along to aspect.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Uncertainty and modality</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Modality occurs primarily because the future is, by definition, 
			uncertain.<br />
			If we are certain of something, present tenses are commonly used as 
			in, for example, in answer to<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Where's John?</em><br />
			the response is:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; He's in his room.</em><br />
			then the speaker is demonstrating certainty about a current 
			situation.<br />
			If, on the other hand, the response is:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll be in his room.</em><br />
			then, although the speaker is expressing that she is almost certain 
			of the truth of what she says, there is an implication that John 
			may, in fact, not be in his room.&nbsp; In fact, responses like 
			these are very often softened with the addition of a comment clause 
			such as
			<em>I expect</em>.<br />
			The fact that <em>will</em> can express this near-but-not-absolute certainty 
			explains much of its use as an auxiliary verb to refer to the future.</p>
			<p>Other modal auxiliary verbs can also express varying levels of certainty, 
			especially if they are stressed or otherwise marked for importance 
			(writing conventions such as underlining, hand gestures etc.).<br />
			There is, in fact a cline from the simple statement of fact to the 
			expression of a good deal of uncertainty in an answer to<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Where's John?<br />
			</em>which can be arranged in ascending order of 
			certainty, like this:<br />
			<img alt="certain" height="270" src="../../imagesgraphics/certainty_gradient.png" width="250" /><br />
			and if we add other modifications such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I think<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I imagine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I reckon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I expect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I'm sure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... for sure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... certainly ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I assume</em><br />
			and so on, the subtleties multiply.</p>
			<p>When we are using modality to express futurity rather than 
			current likelihood similar considerations apply.&nbsp; So for 
			example:<br />
			<img alt="certain" height="187" src="../../imagesgraphics/certainty_gradient%202.png" width="250" /></p>
			<p>It is, in other words, almost impossible to disentangle concepts 
			of futurity from modality, particularly epistemic modality which 
			refers to the speaker's view of the truth or likelihood of truth of 
			a proposition.&nbsp; But we'll try.</p>
			<p>We should not, incidentally, be at all surprised that the future 
			in English is often expressed via a modal auxiliary verb.&nbsp; It 
			can be argued that modal auxiliary verbs are, so to speak, tensed 
			insofar as they frequently refer to the future without any marking 
			to show the tense.&nbsp; That's why, for example all the following 
			can refer to the future:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could come here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They may be leaving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might ask a question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must by there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ought to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to work</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			Into all those sentences we can insert a simple time adverbial, such 
			as <em>tomorrow, later, soon</em> etc. and the sentences immediately 
			and unequivocally refer to future time.&nbsp; The modal auxiliary
			<em>will</em> is no different in this respect.</p>

					<img alt="will" height="166" src="../../images/marry_me250.jpg" width="250" /></td>

				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style12">
					<em>Will you marry me?</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The simple auxiliary verb <em>will</em> causes serious problems 
			for learners and some of them are traceable to the fact that the 
			verb is polysemous and used in two main allied but different meanings in English.&nbsp; 
			Once they are distinguished, much becomes clearer.</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>The word <em>will </em>derives from the Old English <em>wyllan</em> which 
			meant, among other things, <em>wish, desire, be willing to.<br />
			</em>It also meant <em>be about to</em> and it is probably thence we derive 
			its use as a future time marker.<br />
			The past tense was <em>wolde</em> (now <em>would</em>), incidentally.<em><br />
			</em>There are cognate words in most Germanic languages, e.g., <em>
			wollen</em> in German which means <em>wish </em>or<em> want 
			(to) </em>and is not a future tense marker (that's <em>werden</em>, 
			which also, confusingly, means <em>become</em>).&nbsp; The 
			first-person singular form of the verb in German is <em>will.&nbsp; </em>
			Other Germanic language such as Dutch (<em>ik wil</em>), Danish (<em>jeg 
			vil</em>), Swedish (j<em>ag vill</em>) etc.</p>
			<p>The problems arise when learners assume (or, unforgivably, are told) it is 
			only a future form 
			marker in English whereas it is, in fact, commonly&nbsp;a 
			signal of 
			willingness or volition rather than futurity.&nbsp; (A further small 
			complication is that there is a transitive verb in English, <em>to 
			will</em>, which means something like <em>to bring about by exercise 
			of willpower</em> and another which refers to leaving things to 
			other people).<br />
			Some examples may help.</p>

			<p>The two meanings are not always easily separable.&nbsp; 
			For example:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="futurity" height="139" src="../../imagesgraphics/futurity.png" width="400" /></p>
			<p>The problem in the middle lies with the intention of the speaker.&nbsp; 
			It may be a prediction about the future based on sound evidence, it 
			may, less usually, be a spontaneous decision or 
			it may, as is more common, be an expression of willingness or a 
			commitment:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5" style="width: 80%">

					<td class="auto-style25">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style25"><em>Can we talk about this?</em></td>

					<td class="auto-style21"><em>Goodnight.&nbsp; We'll talk 
					tomorrow.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style24">Now the speaker is referring the 
					future <em>per se</em> and not willingness but certainty.&nbsp; 
					If the speaker had said:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect we'll talk tomorrow</em><br />
					then the sense of likelihood is diminished as it would be

			</table>
			<p>The distinction is important because the intrinsic meaning of an 
			expression of willingness (which is a present reference) has to be 
			separated from the extrinsic meaning of inevitability concerning 
			future events (which is a proper future reference).<br />
			There is, rather obviously, some sense of reference to the future in 
			something like <em>I'll do the cooking this evening</em> but the key 
			here is to understand that the speaker is referring primarily to 
			present volition (i.e., volunteering or committing) rather than the future event which 
			may, or may not, actually occur.<br />
			Like this:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5" style="width: 80%">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style25"><em>I'm on the train and I'll be in 
					London by six.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style26">
					<p class="auto-style38">This expresses an inevitable, 
					timetabled future.&nbsp; The speakers willingness or 
					intentions are simply not relevant.</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21"><em>If you will get that in the 
					post, it will be there tomorrow.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style24">
					<p class="auto-style38">Two separate uses:<br />
					willingness:
					the first is a request and refers to what someone is 
					prepared to do <strong>now</strong><br />
					prediction:
					the second is a prediction about the efficiency of the 
					postal delivery in the <strong>future</strong></p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21"><em>It'll be cold in Canada at this 
					time of year.</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style24">
					<p class="auto-style38">This is a simple prediction based 
					on climatic knowledge and has nothing to do with anyone's 
					wishes or disposition.&nbsp; It is a true future form.<br />
					The <em>going to</em> formulation can also be used, more 
					rarely, to 
					express this meaning but the <em>be + -ing</em> form cannot.&nbsp; 
					We can have:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to be cold in Canada at 
					this time of year</em><br />
					but not:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is being cold in Canada at this time 
					of year</em><br />
					Even in this use, the speaker can be 
					referring to the present and stating a fact.&nbsp; It is 
					akin to hearing the telephone ring and stating<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That'll 
					be your mother</em>.<br />
					This is reference to now.</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21"><em>Stop that! I won't tell you 
					again</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style24">
					<p class="auto-style38">This is also an expression of 
					current willingness (negatively).&nbsp; It may, obliquely, 
					refer to the future but the speaker's intention is to 
					express a current emotional state.</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Naturally, because we more rarely make commitments for other 
			people, the volitional aspect of the auxiliary verb is most evident 
			in the first person so expressions such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll do the work</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't help you</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll be happy to come</em><br />
			are most likely to be interpreted as expressing willingness (or its 
			lack) rather 
			than referring solely to the future.<br />
			Negative volition can be used in other persons more frequently so we 
			get, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Won't she help?</em> (=<em>Is she unwilling 
			to help?</em>)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They won't come to work </em>(<em>=They are 
			unwilling to come to work</em>)<br />
			and neither of those are about the future.&nbsp; The reference is to 
			their <strong>current</strong> volitional state of mind.</p>
			<p>By the same token,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll be pleased to see them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll do most of the work</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll walk there, I guess</em><br />
			are most likely to be interpreted as proper future references or 
			predictions because we do not conventionally control other people's 
			willingness.&nbsp; The addition of a comment clause, as in the last 
			example with <em>I guess</em> reinforces the nature of the statement 
			as a prediction, not an expression of willingness.</p>
			<p>That is, however, not always the case because we do sometimes 
			delegate to a third person or command the second person so, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My secretary will do the work</em><br />
			can be interpreted both ways, as an expression of my secretary's willingness 
			or ability to 
			do the work (volition) or as a prediction concerning who 
			will do the work.<br />
			Equally,<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You will not do that again!</em><br />
			can be interpreted as volition (on my part) forbidding you to do it 
			again or as a prediction concerning your behaviour.</p>
			<p>Slightly more technically, the distinction between the two central meanings of
			<em>will</em> can be understood 
			as distinct forms of modality:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>epistemic modality refers to the likelihood or otherwise of 
				an event, state or proposition being true in fact.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure he'll be very pleased to hear that<br />
				</em>The verb <em>will</em> carries very strong epistemic modality 
				(i.e., the speaker believes the proposition to be true) as can 
				be seen if we contrast<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will have passed the examination</em><br />
				with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ought to have passed the examination</em><br />
				In the first case, it is not possible to insert<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... but he 
				didn't<br />
				</em>after the clause but in the second case, it is.&nbsp; 
				This means the first case refers to the absolute truth of a 
				proposition.<br />
				The modal nature of <em>will</em> is revealed when one considers the 
				kinds of verbal processes with which it occurs.&nbsp; These are 
				almost invariably mental processes concerning the belief in the 
				truth of something.&nbsp; We get, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm afraid he'll be unhelpful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe she'll come alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I doubt if it'll rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect she'll be here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure they'll help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel certain she'll be there by now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know he'll take the train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope she'll marry me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose it'll be OK<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he'll fail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reckon we'll be late</em><br />
				all of which express varying levels of certainty but, because 
				the future is, by definition, unknown, epistemic modality comes 
				into play.</li>
				<li>dynamic modality refers to ability or willingness on the 
				part of the speaker.&nbsp; For example:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I'll tell her (if you like)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll help with that<br />
				</em>both refer to the speaker's willingness.<br />
				The dynamic modality of the verb is also revealed by the verbal 
				processes with which is associated.&nbsp; They are almost 
				invariably behavioural ones and the verb expresses requests or 
				invitations (and is nothing to do with the future).&nbsp; We 
				get, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you manage alone for a moment?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Won't you stay a little longer?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you do that for me?</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>deontic modality refers to obligation or prohibition so for 
				example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; My father will take us to school</em><br />
				implies that the speaker will somehow oblige the father to act 
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will speak to your teacher more 
				politely</em><br />
				suggests that you are being obliged to do something.<br />
				In neither case are we speaking solely about futurity because 
				the obligation comes before the action.<br />
				A subcategory of deontic modality is known as commissive 
				modality and refers to a self-imposed duty.&nbsp; The use of <em>
				will</em> (and <em>would</em>) commonly expresses this form of 
				obligation as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call you as soon as I arrive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her I would call her as soon as I arrived</em><br />
				etc.</li>

			</table>
			
			<p>The problem is that not distinguishing between the meanings of
			<em>will</em> results in error &ndash; teacher-induced error.&nbsp; 
			Most course materials (and hundreds of websites) assert that the use 
			of <em>will</em> to express a disposition or promise to do something is a 
			simple future form, often dressed up as something called spontaneous 
			decision or a similarly silly expression.&nbsp; It is not.&nbsp; It is about one's current 
			(i.e., present) state of mind.&nbsp; Worse, the admonition in many 
			materials is to slide from the volitional use of the verb to a future form of <em>will</em> to an 
			expression of current plans and the use of <em>going to</em>.</p>
			<p>Take a simple and often-used telephone dialogue such as:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style25">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style27"><em>I don't think there's any wine 
					in the house.</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21">B:</td>
					<td class="auto-style28"><em>Isn't there?&nbsp; Oh, I'll go 
					and get some.</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Students are asked to believe that the second speaker's statement refers to 
			the future and is an example of a spontaneous decision.&nbsp; It doesn't 
			and isn't &ndash; it refers 
			to the speaker's current willingness or a promise to do something.&nbsp; 
			It <span class="style_underline">may</span> result in a future 
			action but that is not the point at all.&nbsp; This is a commitment 
			and, as we saw above, is a deontic modal use called commissive modality 
			(because the speaker is committing to an action).<br />
			If the conversation develops like this:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style25">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style27"><em>Don't bother, I'll get some on 
					the way home.</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21">B:</td>
					<td class="auto-style28"><em>Will you have time?</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Then students realise that the future isn't going to happen.&nbsp; 
			It wasn't a future use, anyway.<br />
			They are now faced with two completely different uses of <em>will</em>.&nbsp; 
			The first expresses volunteering (now) and the second is a question 
			that really <em>is</em> about the future.&nbsp; You can easily see 
			that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you have time?</em><br />
			has nothing to do with willingness because none of us can control 
			time, however willing we are.<br />
			On the other hand,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you make time?</em><br />
			actually does refer to willingness because we all labour under the 
			impression that we can do such a thing.<br />
			And it gets worse if 
			the dialogue goes on something like:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style25">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style27"><em>Yes, no problem.&nbsp; I'm 
					going to leave a bit early so I'll be there before they 
					shut.</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21">B:</td>
					<td class="auto-style28"><em>Fine.&nbsp; I expect John'll 
					bring a bottle, too.</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>in which we now have an expression of a present plan, a 
			prediction about travel times and another prediction about the 
			future based on the speaker's knowledge of John's character and 
			habits.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>If the materials do not alert learners to the types of verbal 
			processes which are associated with the modal use of <em>will</em>, 
			then they induce errors of comprehension and appropriacy.<br />
			For example, a dialogue such as:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">

					<td class="auto-style25">A:</td>
					<td class="auto-style27"><em>I expect she'll be here soon.</em></td>

				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style21">B:</td>
					<td class="auto-style28"><em>Will you clear the desk for 
					her?</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>contains three different uses of the auxiliary verb</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect she'll be here soon<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope she will<br />
				</em>express epistemic modality concerning the truth of a 
				proposition.&nbsp; We saw above that this use is very common 
				with mental process verbs such as <em>think, believe, feel sure, 
				hope</em> etc.&nbsp; That is the use in A's first and second 
				statements.&nbsp; The use of a comment clause (with <em>expect</em> 
				and <em>hope</em>) concerns the level of certainty the speaker 
				feels.</li>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will she bring the paper with her?<br />
				</em>refers to a real future: B's response is clearly concerned with future time and is asking for 
				A's prediction.</li>
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you clear the desk for her?<br />
				</em>is an unconnected use.&nbsp; It is a request for action on 
				A's part (and the form is 
				also often used for invitation) and has nothing to do with 
				futurity or likelihood.&nbsp; It concerns dynamic modality and 
				refers to A's willingness to do something or make a commitment.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is little wonder that learners get confused if the uses and

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>A straightforward way to understand the difference between <em>
			will</em> as a modal auxiliary and <em>will</em> as a tense-forming 
			auxiliary is to compare it to the verb <em>have</em>.<br />
			For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen the boss<br />
			</em>the verb <em>have</em> is acting as a primary auxiliary, forming a 
			perfect tense of the verb <em>see</em>.&nbsp; No problem, but in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to see my boss<br />
			</em>the verb is clearly a modal auxiliary and expresses a sense of 
			obligation (deontic modality, technically).</p>
			<p>The verb <em>will</em> can be analysed in the same way.&nbsp; So, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train will arrive at platform 6<br />
			</em>we have an example of <em>will</em> acting to form a tense and 
			it can be considered a primary auxiliary verb but in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will marry you if you will give up drinking<br />
			</em>the verb is modal insofar as it denotes the speaker's current 
			willingness and that is the job of modal auxiliary verbs.</p>

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h3><em>shall</em> is obsolete, right?</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>A further source of teacher-induced error is the assumption that 
			it is not necessary to deal with <em>shall</em> at all because <em>
			will</em> has taken over and the verb has fallen / is falling into 
			disuse.&nbsp; That's not a bad rule of thumb but it is worth 
			noticing some issues.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>derivation and meaning</strong></dt>
				<dd>the verb <em>shall</em> is derived from a different source 
				from <em>will</em>.&nbsp; The base sense is actually connected 
				to the idea of obligation and cognate verbs in other languages 
				retain the sense of <em>shall</em> as <em>should </em>or<em> 
				ought to.&nbsp; </em>Compare <em>sollen</em> in German, for 
				example.&nbsp; The use to speak about the future is 
				comparatively recent and comparatively rare.</dd>
				<dt><strong>polysemy</strong></dt>
				<dd>the verb <em>shall</em> displays the same polysemy as <em>
				will</em> and can carry the sense of pure prediction, e.g.,<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I shall be in New York at 8 if the plane's on time<br />
				</em>and 
				volition:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall I help you with that?</em><br />
				The 
				use in questions, which is still quite common, is almost always 
				to do with disposition, readiness or willingness and carries no 
				future predictive sense:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where shall we go?&nbsp; </em>(= <em>Where do we want [now] to go?</em>)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shan't! </em>(= <em>I refuse</em> [now])<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where shall I put this?</em> (= <em>Where should I [now] put 
				this?</em>)</dd>
				<dt><strong>obligation</strong></dt>
				<dd>the verb retains its sense of obligation in often legalese 
				statements like<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The property owner shall ensure ...<br />
				</em>etc. and 
				also in<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shan't talk to me like that</em>.<br />
				In this 
				sense, the verb usually has nothing to do with the future.&nbsp; 
				It expresses obligation and obligation routinely refers to both 
				present and future time.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.,<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We mustn't be late<br />
				</em>which can refer to present time or the future 
				depending on context.<br />
				There is a formal use for <strong>all</strong> persons of <em>
				shall</em> in, e.g.<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shall not interrupt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall not 
				pass<br />
				</em>etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>commissive modality</strong></dt>
				<dd>a rarer (and rarely taught) use of <em>shall</em> is in what 
				is known as commissive modality in which the speaker / writer 
				creates a self-imposed duty (so it is a sub-category of deontic 
				modality).&nbsp; In BrE, this is often realised through the use 
				of <em>shall</em> in expressions such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shall have the money by Thursday</em><br />
			although in spoken language the contracted form ('<em>ll</em>) 
			disguises the use of <em>shall</em> and many believe it is a use of
			<em>will</em>.&nbsp; The modal auxiliary verb <em>will</em> is often 
			used in this way but also expresses volition or willingness:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll give you money on Thursday</em></dd>

			<p>These are all indicators that the verb is really being used to 
			refer to future time and not to volition.&nbsp; In fact, the 
			situation may be and often is wholly outside the control of the 
			speaker.<br />
			Other verbal indicators of this sort were listed above and included:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be afraid<br />

			all of which are mental verbal processes occurring conventionally in 
			comment clauses about the future.</p>
			<p>These introductory expressions always refer to the speaker's view 
			of the likelihood of the future event or state.&nbsp; If <em>will
			</em>concerns volition or making promises (much the same thing),

			<p>Note that in the second exchange, the reference to prediction

			<p>There is an unusual but quite simple form in English which does 
			unequivocally refer to the future either seen from now or in the

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is to be a meeting tomorrow<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are to meet again after lunch</em><br />

			The form refers either to a firm arrangement already made or to one 
			made and then unfulfilled for a reason (which is conventionally 
			supplied).</p>
			<p>An allied form, discussed in the guide to the infinitive is the 
			sense of absolute prohibition or obligation contained in notices and 
			commands from those in authority such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children are not to leave the premises 
			unaccompanied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passengers are not to proceed beyond this point<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desks are to be kept tidy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This door is to be kept clear of obstructions<br />

			deontic modality concerning <strong>current</strong> externally 
			imposed obligations.&nbsp; The forms cannot be used for commissive 
			modality because even:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am to keep my desk tidy<br />
			</em>does not represent the speaker's commitment to do something 
			but the strength of an imposed obligation.</p>

			<p>Using a simple form like this to refer to the future is, slightly 
			misleadingly, called the 'timetabled' future.&nbsp; It might be 
			better described as the certain future because it is closely allied 
			to the use of a simple present tense to refer to predictable facts 
			as in, e.g.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;It snows heavily in The Alps in winter</em><br />
			Of course, the form includes timetables but it also covers events that 
			we are sure of because they are tied to other ever-present 
			background events.&nbsp; Snow, in common with other weather events, 
			cannot be timetabled.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>Look busy, the boss arrives in a minute<br />
				</em>(i.e., we 
				are talking about the future but basing the certainty on 
				habitual background behaviour)</li>
				<li><em>I arrive at around 6 if all's well<br />
				</em>i.e., this is 
				my future but under the control of someone else's timetable.&nbsp; 
				Compare it to<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I'm driving up and will get to you around 6<br />
				</em>in which the simple use is not possible so we cannot have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'm driving up and get to you around 6</em><br />
				because it is a personal prediction not tied to external 
				timetables.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In both cases above, the simple tense can be replaced with a <em>
			will</em> formulation, either in simple or progressive aspects (<em>will 
			arrive / will be arriving</em>) with no change in meaning.&nbsp; No 
			other modal, except the first-person <em>shall</em>, can be 
			used without changing the meaning.&nbsp; The reverse does not 
			usually apply: 
			we cannot always insert a simple tense form instead of a formulation 
			with<em> will / shall</em>.&nbsp; The following are not acceptable 
			transformations:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll talk to you tomorrow &ne; *I talk to you 
			tomorrow<br />
			</em>because the reference is to willingness, not futurity.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She'll be here later &ne; *She is here later<br />
			</em>because the reference is to modality concerning likely, not 
			absolutely certain, futurity.<br />
			The following are acceptable transformations because they do concern 
			certainty futurity:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train will arrive in a minute = The train 
			arrives in a minute<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss gets here soon = The boss will get here soon</em><br />
			because the sense of pure futurity is maintained in both 
			formulations.</p>

			<p>The marginal modal auxiliary verb <em>going to</em> is analysed 
			on this site as a present tense with future aspect because it is 
			most often used that way to state that there is present evidence for 
			a future event, as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's going to rain</em><br />
			or present intent for a future action, as in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to talk to the boss.</em></p>
			<p>In some analyses, however, it makes sense to include <em>going to</em> 
			as a future form because it concerns prediction based not on what 
			one perceives now (such as rain clouds) or on what one intends now 
			but on prediction substantiated.<br />
			For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's going to be furious when she finds out</em><br />
			a speaker is making a prediction based not on present intention or 
			present evidence but on what she / he knows about the person in 
			question.&nbsp; That can, of course, also be interpreted as present 
			evidence because the speaker's knowledge of the subject is current.</p>
			<p>In this analysis, there are two forms of prediction: <strong>
			substantiated</strong> and <strong>unsubstantiated</strong>.<br />
			Substantiated prediction involves the use of <em>going to</em> and 
			unsubstantiated prediction involves the use of <em>will</em> so, the 
			theory goes, we have a contrast between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll be at home this evening</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to be at home this evening</em><br />
			and the assertion is that the former is unsubstantiated and the 
			latter substantiated by current knowledge of the situation.<br />
			Unfortunately, neat though the concept seems, it doesn't always work 
			because:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We often use <em>will</em> for prediction based on current 
				substantiated facts so we get, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm on the train now so I'll be there 
				around 6</em><br />
				which cannot be classed as an unsubstantiated prediction because 
				of the speaker's obvious understanding of a current fact.</li>
				<li>We can use <em>going to</em> in exactly the same way, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train's been delayed so I'm going to 
				be late<br />
				</em>and that, too, is substantiated prediction and nothing to 
				do with intention.</li>
				<li>We can use <em>going to</em> to make unsubstantiated 
				predictions as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if she's going to come</em><br />
				where the speaker has admitted to having no substantiated facts 
				to work on.</li>
				<li>Again, we can use <em>will</em> in the same way:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if she'll come</em></li>
				<li>There is a cline from substantiated to unsubstantiated with 
				many intermediate levels of certainty and here we are in the 
				realm of epistemic modality (the speaker's view of the truth of 
				a proposition).&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to be here shortly, he's just 
				parking his car</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll be here shortly, he's just parking 
				his car<br />
				</em>which are both substantiated predictions based on a current situation.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will be here soon</em><br />
				which is an expression of certainty based on something unsaid 
				but influential.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He might be here soon</em><br />
				which is an expression of uncertainty<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He must be here soon</em><br />
				which is probably an expression of great certainty (because of 
				knowledge of other facts) but might also, of course, be an 
				expression of obligation.</li>
				<li>The verb <em>will</em> and the expression <em>going to</em> 
				are interchangeable when there is some substantiation so we can 
				have either:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He'll be here shortly, he's just parking his car<br />
				</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to be here shortly, he's just parking his car<br />
				</em>with no discernible difference in meaning.<br />
				And this can also imply a prediction based on current evidence 
				as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll rain in a minute.&nbsp; Look at 
				those clouds</em><br />
				vs.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to rain in a minute.&nbsp; 
				Look at those clouds.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Because the differentiation between substantiated <em>vs.</em> 
			unsubstantiated prediction is so difficult to make and because the 
			two forms can so often be used interchangeably, it is not a useful 
			classroom tactic to make this difference at all.<br />
			However, if one reserves <em>will</em> for prediction and <em>going 
			to</em> for a present situation or intention with a prospective 
			aspect, as the analysis on this site has it, one is on safer ground 
			and the distinctions become more intuitive (and production more 
			accurate as a result).<br />
			The next section expands on this idea.</p>

					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>There is a simple and alternative way to look at the <em>going to</em> 
			structure.<br />
			The <em>to-</em>infinitive in English often betokens some sort of 
			prospective aspect as we see in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to visit Margate next week<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I intend to take the train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean to stay a night or two<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to see you when I'm there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope to visit the new museum<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I aim to come back next Thursday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I plan to see my brother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect to find him at home</em><br />
			and so on.&nbsp; In all these cases, the first verb denotes a state 
			which precedes the action or event denoted by the second verb in the
			<em>to-</em>infinitive form.&nbsp; In other words, the <em>to-</em>infinitive 
			signals a prospective event.<br />
			We can, if we get away from calling it the <em>going to</em> 
			structure, view the verb <em>go</em> in the same way.&nbsp; The only 
			difference then is that the verb is conventionally used in the 
			progressive form.<br />
			Even in this case, most of the verbs in our example apart, arguably, 
			from <em>want, mean </em>and <em>expect</em>, can also be used 
			progressively as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm planning to see my brother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm aiming to come back next Thursday</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			The verb phrase <em>would like</em>, of course, cannot be used 
			progressively because modal auxiliary verbs are always finite and 
			have no infinitive or participle forms.<br />
			This analysis is not universally accepted and course books and 
			grammars for learners are firmly wedded to calling the <em>going to</em> 
			structure a future form.&nbsp; It isn't really; it's the verb <em>go</em> 
			followed by a <em>to-</em>infinitive.</p>

			<p>It is worth a small diversion here to consider why, in the first 
			place, we use <em>will</em> and <em>going to</em> to refer to future 
			time.<br />
			Neither verb form has a long history of their current use as 
			auxiliary verbs because they were both once simple lexical verbs.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em><strong>will</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>We saw above that <em>will</em> derives from an earlier verb 
				which meant something akin to the modern verb <em>want</em> and, 
				indeed, the cognate verb in German and other Germanic languages 
				still carries this sense:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ich <strong>will</strong> das Geld<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ik <strong>wil</strong> het geld<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeg <strong>vil</strong> have pengene<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jag <strong>vill</strong> ha pengarna<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ég vil hafa peningana<br />
				</em>in German, Dutch, Danish, Swedish and Icelandic, 
				respectively all translate as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want the money</em><br />
				and are not future forms at all</dd>
				<dd>In Modern English, the verb still carries this sense in some 
				circumstances as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help yourself to what you will (= ... 
				what you want)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you have some more coffee? (= Do you want ...)<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				The use of the verb as an auxiliary to refer to the future was 
				already developing in Old English but not fixed until the 9th 
				century.</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>going to</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>This verb still retains its initial meaning of <em>travel</em> 
				or <em>move</em> as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are going to the cinema<br />
				</em>and is often used to signal current actions, arrangements 
				or intentions.<br />
				The use of <em>going to</em> + bare infinitive to signal a 
				future of some kind was not, however, established until the 15th 
				century at roughly the end of the period described as Middle 
				English.<br />
				The pronunciation often betrays the use of the verb.&nbsp; When 
				it is a future marker, it is often pronounced weakly (and 
				sometimes spelled <em>gonna</em>) as /ˈɡənə/
				but the lexical form is not weakened, retaining the full 
				pronunciation as /ˈɡəʊɪŋ/.<br />
				You cannot transcribe<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are going to the cinema<br />
				</em>as:<br />
				/wi.ə.ˈɡənə.ðə.ˈsɪ.nə.mə/<br />
				but you can transcribe<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to go to the cinema<br />
				</em>as:<br />
				/ˈaɪ.əm.ˈɡənə.ɡəʊ.tə.ðə.ˈsɪ.nə.mə/</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>In both these cases, what has occurred is bleaching.&nbsp; The 
			lexical meaning of the verb has, so to speak, been bleached out of 
			the lexeme, leaving it functioning only as a grammatical form with 
			no intrinsic meaning.&nbsp; An alternative way to describe this 
			feature (which is common to many languages) is as 
			grammaticalisation.</p>

			<p>The traditional analysis of the present progressive used to refer 
			to the future is that it signals an arrangement rather than 
			volition, an intention or a prediction.&nbsp; That 
			is not wholly without merit but its use for the future can only be 
			understood from <strong>previous or current</strong> events or states.<br />
			In other words, the use of the tense can only be discovered by reference to actions or states at a 
			time before the future (now or in the past).</p>
			<p>It is sometimes said, with reason, that when discussing plans and 
			arrangements we use the present progressive form, when we make 
			predictions we use <em>will</em> and when we refer 
			to 
			intentions we use the <em>going to</em> structure.&nbsp; However, the 
			forms are, in fact much more fluid than the simple difference 
			suggests.&nbsp; Functionally, there is little distinction between 
			the meanings of the forms, so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's taking a holiday next week<br />
			</em>carries the same meaning as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to take a holiday next week<br />
			</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll be on holiday next week<br />
			</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to see my mother on Monday<br />
			</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm seeing my mother on Sunday<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll see my mother on Sunday<br />
			</em>are also virtually indistinguishable.</p>
			<p>There are times, however, when the forms are not interchangeable 
			or when ambiguity needs to be avoided.&nbsp; In many of the cases 
			below, the present progressive form is not allowed but an 
			alternative exists either with the use of <em>going to </em>or in the form of the <em>will</em> 
			future.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Semantic disqualification</strong><br />
				<img alt="red card" height="133" src="../../images/sign_red_card200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				With some verbs, arrangement is semantically possible.&nbsp; For 
				example, we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm turning up at my mother's party on 
				Sunday</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to turn up at my mother's 
				party on Sunday</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll turn up at my mother's party on 
				Sunday<br />
				</em>with little difference, if any, in meaning.<br />
				But, if the meaning of the verb specifically excludes any 
				possibility of an agreed arrangement then the progressive form 
				is not possible so we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to surprise my mother by 
				turning up at her party on Sunday</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll surprise my mother by turning up at 
				her party on Sunday<br />
				</em>but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I am surprising my mother by turning up 
				at her party on Sunday<br />
				</em>because, semantically, you cannot arrange to be <em>surprised, 
				astonished, excited, disappointed, flabbergasted, bewildered</em> etc.&nbsp; 
				All these sorts of participle adjectives and verbs are disqualified from appearing with 
				the <em>be + -ing</em> form, therefore.<br />
				They can all be used, quite naturally with both <em>going to</em> 
				and the <em>will </em>
				future<em>.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Avoiding ambiguity</strong><br />
				<img alt="alternative meanings" height="133" src="../../images/alternatives200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The progressive form, in order to avoid ambiguity, usually needs 
				to be accompanied by a time adverbial unless the context makes 
				the future nature of the current plan clear.&nbsp; So, for 
				example, we can have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to drive to London</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll drive to London</em><br />
				without context and the future sense is still clear.<br />
				However,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to London</em><br />
				without any context is ambiguous and could mean:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to London as we speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm planning / have arranged to drive to London</em><br />
				or even<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my current, temporary habit to drive to London</em> 
				(rather than use an alternative form of transport).<br />
				If the context does not clarify the situation,
				we need to insert a time adverbial to disambiguate what we are 
				saying so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to London in the morning</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to London soon</em><br />
				are not ambiguous even without context because of the 
				prepositional phrase adverbial or the adverb respectively.<br />
				We do not need to insert a time adverbial when the context has 
				already provided the temporal information so:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Can you come in early tomorrow?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: Sorry.&nbsp; I'm taking the kids to school<br />
				</em>is coherent.</li>
				<li><strong>Stative vs. Dynamic verb uses</strong><br />
				<img alt="dynamic" height="133" src="../../images/dynamic_water200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The <em>going to</em> formulation and the <em>will</em> future can be used with verbs used statively 
				so we allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to be angry when he gets the 
				news<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's going to look wonderful at tonight's party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are going to seem out of place in that company</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll be angry when he gets the news<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She'll look wonderful at tonight's party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'll seem out of place in that company</em><br />
				we do not allow the progressive forms:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is being angry when he gets the news<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She's looking wonderful at tonight's party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They are seeming out of place in that company</em><br />
				if the reference is to the future.<br />
				All three forms can be used with verbs used dynamically, only <em>
				going to</em> and <em>will</em> are used statively.</li>
				<li><strong>Inanimate subjects</strong><br />
				<img alt="ladder" height="133" src="../../images/ladder200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				We do not ascribe the ability to plan or form arrangements to 
				inanimate objects so we allow, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out!&nbsp; The ladder's going to slip in a minute</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out!&nbsp; *The ladder's slipping in 
				a minute.</em><br />
				The reason that:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ladder'll slip in a minute</em><br />
				is not common (although it is possible) is twofold:<br />
				Firstly, <em>will</em>, as we have seen, is commonly used for 
				current volition and ladders do not have volition.<br />
				Secondly, the <em>going to</em> formulation is often preferred 
				for imminent events (as is the marginal modal auxiliary verb <em>be about 
				to</em>).<br />
				This distinction is most noticeable when we are talking about 
				the weather.&nbsp; Because it is inanimate, the weather is 
				spoken about as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to rain tomorrow</em><br />
				or, with great certainty<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll rain tomorrow<br />
				</em>but not as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's raining tomorrow.<br />
				</em>This distinction is sometimes confused with the idea that 
				the progressive form for the concept needs to refer to a 
				personal arrangement.&nbsp; That is a defensible point of view 
				but focuses through the wrong end of the telescope.&nbsp; It is 
				the nature of participants (in this case the subject) which 
				determines the appropriate form to use.</li>
				<li><strong>Present evidence</strong><br />
				<img alt="angry" height="133" src="../../images/woman_angry_smoke200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Only <em>going to</em> and, slightly less commonly <em>will</em> can be used to refer to present evidence 
				leading to a future event.&nbsp; So we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's making her angry.&nbsp; She's going 
				to lose her temper soon<br />
				</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's making her angry.&nbsp; She'll lose her temper soon<br />
				</em>but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's making her angry.&nbsp; *She's losing 
				her temper soon</em><br />
				Again, the present evidence rule applies when talking 
				about inanimate objects such as the weather when present 
				evidence is important so we get, for example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Look at the clouds.&nbsp; It's going to rain soon</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the clouds.&nbsp; It'll rain soon<br />
				</em>but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the clouds.&nbsp; *It's raining 
				soon.<br />
				</em>In both these cases, the
				<em>will</em> future is an acceptable alternative to
				<em>going to.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Negative forms</strong><br />
				<img alt="no" height="133" src="../../images/no_hand200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The equivalence of the <em>will</em> formulation and the <em>
				going to</em> structure is even more marked when the negative 
				uses are considered.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a lovely day and I'm sure it's not 
				going to rain</em><br />
				can be rendered as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a lovely day and I'm sure it won't 
				rain</em><br />
				with no significant change in meaning.<br />
				This equivalence is maintained even for human subjects so, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not going to be at the meeting</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't be to the meeting</em><br />
				are functionally equivalent.<br />
				Both negative forms can also carry the sense of refusal rather 
				than prediction so, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't explain it again</em><br />
				is indistinguishable in meaning from<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not going to explain it again.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Past experience</strong><br />
				<img alt="smile" height="133" src="../../images/man_smile200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Prospective events based on past experience are also only 
				realised through <em>going to</em> or <em>will</em>.&nbsp; For example, we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When your father hears, he's going to 
				laugh</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When your father hears, he'll laugh</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *When your father hears, he's laughing</em><br />
				even though the future reference is clear.<br />
				Again, past experience of weather conditions often makes the 
				form suitable for that, too.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to snow a lot in Canada in 
				January</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll snow a lot in Canada in January</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is snowing a lot in Canada in January</em></li>
				<li><strong>Conditional and contingent clauses</strong><br />
				<img alt="train snow" height="133" src="../../images/train_snow200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is another semantic (or pragmatic) issue.&nbsp; For example, 
				we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the trains aren't running, I'm going 
				to drive</em><br />
				and it is a conditional expressing the fact that the speaker 
				does not yet know if the trains will be running.<br />
				And,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the trains aren't running, I'll drive<br />
				</em>also<em>
				</em>expresses the fact that the speaker does not yet know 
				whether the trains will run or not and is speculating.<br />
				However,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the trains aren't running, I'm driving</em><br />
				does not have the same sense because it implies that the speaker 
				already knows the trains are not running so has formed a plan or 
				arrangement to drive.&nbsp; It could be realised as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>As the trains aren't running, I'm driving.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Modal auxiliary verbs</strong><br />
				<img alt="help" height="133" src="../../images/helping_up200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Because most modal auxiliary verbs are defective in English and do not 
				exhibit the full range of forms that lexical verbs do, there are 
				severe limitations on the ways they can be used with <em>will</em>, the
				<em>going to</em> or the <em>be + -ing</em> structure.<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li><strong>Deontic modality </strong>refers to duty or 
					obligation and we allow, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to have to talk to her</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have to talk to her</em><br />
					and we also allow<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am having to talk to her</em><br />
					but the last of these refers to present rather than future 
					obligation and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; ?I am having to attend a meeting tomorrow</em><br />
					is questionable.<br />
					Other expressions of this form of modality are 
					rendered in the present with modal auxiliary verbs such as
					<em>should</em> and <em>ought to</em>.<br />
					There are no equivalent forms using either of these 
					structures so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;*He is going to ought to tell her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The are shoulding do it</em><br />
					are not available.<br />
					Other languages allow future forms of equivalent modal 
					auxiliary verbs and 
					learners may be surprised to find that English does not.&nbsp; 
					In fact, these deontic modal auxiliary verbs are used 
					interchangeably in English to refer to present and future 
					obligation as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should smoke less<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should talk to him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ought to be better at this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ought to tell her</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li><strong>Epistemic modality</strong> refers to 
					possibility and likelihood and these are again not expressed with 
					these structures so, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is going to ought to be there by 
					now</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is shoulding be there soon</em><br />
					are not possible.<br />
					Both these future meanings are expressed using the 
					same form for present and future time as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She should be here before six 
					tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They ought to arrive soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It ought to work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be possible now</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li><strong>Alethic modality</strong> refers to the general 
					truth of a proposition and is usually timeless so present 
					forms are used and we cannot have, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A square is going to have to have 
					four sides</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A square will have four sides<br />
					</em>or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A square is having to have four 
					sides.<br />
					</em>However, we do allow:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dodecahedron will have twelve sides<br />
					</em>because that is actually an example of a deduction from 
					knowledge of Greek numbers and epistemic not alethic.</li>
					<li><strong>Dynamic modality</strong> refers to the 
					individual's capabilities, as in, e.g.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see the point</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					The <em>going to</em> formulation and <em>will</em> are both available for some 
					forms of dynamic modality to refer to a present ability 
					realised in the future so we allow, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is going to be able to help</em>
					<em>later</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll be able to help later<br />
					</em>but we do not allow, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is being able to help later</em><br />
					so the <em>be + -ing</em> form is not available to refer to 
					current ability realised in the future.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Arrangements</strong><br />
				<img alt="restaurant" height="133" src="../../images/restaurant_exterior200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is a marginal difference and more a tendency than a rule.&nbsp; 
				By their nature, arrangements are made between people but 
				intentions can be formed individually and only later 
				communicated to others.&nbsp; Most English speakers will prefer, 
				therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us are meeting at the restaurant 
				in the square tomorrow</em><br />
				to<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us are going to meet at the restaurant in the 
				square tomorrow</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us'll meet at the restaurant in 
				the square tomorrow<br />
				</em>although all are possible with little effect on meaning.<br />
				However, in an exchange such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Are you writing to the boss about 
				this?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: No.&nbsp; I'm going to talk to her face to face.</em><br />
				then the second speaker has only now communicated a pre-formed 
				intention and, as we have seen, this can also be rendered as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: No, I'll talk to her face to face<br />
				</em>If the second speaker had said:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; B: No.&nbsp; I'm meeting her face to face.</em><br />
				then the meaning is that the speaker and the boss have reached 
				an agreement to meet.<br />
				It is sometimes averred, by some who should know better, that 
				the <em>be</em> + -<em>ing</em> form implies an arrangement 
				between people.&nbsp; It does, sometimes, but it is perfectly 
				possible to use the form with the sense of only one person's 
				intention.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm giving John a lift to Margate 
				tomorrow</em><br />
				does imply an arrangement between the speaker and John which, 
				note, has already been made but:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to Margate tomorrow</em><br />
				implies no arrangement with anyone else at all.<br />
				However, see above for the functional equivalence of the forms 
				when used in negative sentences.</li>
				<li><strong>Person</strong><br />
				<img alt="people" height="133" src="../../images/people200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				In particular, when the subject of the verb is first-person 
				plural an arrangement will be assumed, whichever form is taken 
				so, to all intents and purposes:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are meeting in the station</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are going to meet in the station</em><br />
				are synonymous because of the plural first-person pronoun.<br />
				Equally,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John and I are going to meet at the 
				station<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John and I are meeting at the station<br />
				</em>are synonymous.</li>

				<li>Simple forms with certain types of verbal processes are 
				still continuous in aspect.&nbsp; This is the effect of stative and dynamic use and is <strong>not</strong> 
			parallelled in many languages.<ol class="auto-style31">
					<li><strong>mental processes</strong> such as <em>enjoy, appreciate, love, 
					feel, know, understand<br />
					</em>So, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll love a long holiday</em><br />
					refers to a continuous future state.</li>
					<li><strong>projecting processes</strong> such as<em> hope, 
					expect, imagine, suspect<br />
					</em>So, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll expect you around 6</em><br />
					refers to a continuous future state and could also be 
					phrased, with no change in meaning, as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be expecting you around 6</em></li>
					<li><strong>verbal processes</strong> such as <em>say, aver, assert, describe, 
					explain<br />
					</em>So, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the meeting I'll describe and 
					explain the plan in detail</em><br />
					refers to a progressive action and could be re-phrased with 
					no change in meaning as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the meeting I'll be describing and 
					explaining the plan in detail.</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Both the simple and complex forms of the tense can be used 
				for iterative, durative and habitual aspects but <strong>not</strong> for 
				progressive or continuous aspects unless the verb denotes one of 
				the processes mentioned in point 1.<br />
				We can say<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll go to the office at nine every day </em>
				(iterative)<br />
				or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll take the train for a month instead of 
				the bus </em>(durative)<br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He'll have lunch so don't phone now </em>(progressive)</li>
				<li>The volitional use of <em>will</em> does <strong>not</strong> occur 
				in these aspects so, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be taking the train</em><br />
				only refers to the future, whereas, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll take the train tomorrow</em><br />
				could mean:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am now willing to take the train 
				tomorrow</em> (so, say, you can have the car)<br />
				or<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I predict that this is my mode of transport tomorrow</em> (and 
				is a future tense form)</li>
				<li>The progressive form often refers to what is known as
				<strong>the future as a matter of course</strong> and signals 
				that the speaker is aware of a routine event and what it 
				affects.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The London express will be passing 
				through in a moment so stand back from the edge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'll be having lunch about now so I'll call later<br />
				</em>and in these examples, the speaker is aware of the 
				timetable or people's habits.</li>
				<li>The comments made in the general guide to aspect and tense 
				apply here, too, concerning the distinction between durative 
				verbs which are progressive in nature such as <em>play, read, rain</em> 
				etc. and punctual or momentary verbs such as <em>hit, bang, drop</em> 
				etc. which, when used with a progressive form, imply repeated 
				(i.e., iterative) aspect.<br />
				So, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She'll be studying French</em><br />
				is a progressive form but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She'll be banging the drum</em><br />
				is an iterative aspect.<br />
				By the same token,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?She'll be breaking the glass</em><br />
				makes no sense unless you believe that a glass can be broken 
				more than once but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She'll be breaking the glasses</em><br />
				does make some sense because it can be seen as iterative, not 
				progressive.<br />
				This is a <strong>semantic</strong> rather than a <strong>
				grammatical</strong> issue.<br />
				For more on punctual <em>vs</em>. durative forms, see the 
				introductory guide in this section to time, tense, and aspect.&nbsp;

			<p>The perfect always refers one time to another.&nbsp; 
			It is a <strong>relational</strong> not an absolute time reference.<br />
			The functional way to see the tense is as the past set in the future 
			as the time lines show.</p>
			<p>The future perfect allows people to express how a future will look from 
			a viewpoint later in the future.&nbsp; It is, in other words, a 
			reference to the past within the future.<br />
			Timelines are a helpful way 
			to explain a sentence such as:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">She will have made the point clear
			<span class="auto-style39">(EVENT 1) </span>so every will understand
			<span class="auto-style39">(EVENT 2)</span>.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="future perfect" height="289" src="../../imagesgraphics/future_perfect.png" width="465" /><br />
			Both Events 1 and 2 are clearly in the future (they come to the 
			right of NOW) but from the point of view of Event 2, Event 1 is in 
			the past.&nbsp; That's why we refer to it as the past within the 
			future.<br />
			</p>
			<h3>The problem<br />
			<img alt="problem" height="133" src="../../images/problem_c200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>There is one very obvious difficulty with the two perfect aspect 
			future tenses: the verb forms do not match the time to which they 
			refer.&nbsp; If we take, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have finished it by the time you need 
			it<br />
			</em>we can see that the first verb phrase, <em>will have finished</em>, 
			is clearly a future form of some sort but the second verb phrase is 
			simply <em>need</em> and that looks like a present form.&nbsp; It is 
			logical to assume that it should be <em>will need</em> and that is 
			what many learners are tempted to say.&nbsp; Many languages do 
			signal the time in this way and in that sense are more logically and 
			intuitively constructed.<br />
			This happens to be the way that tense forms work in dependent 
			clauses in English and is a source of a great deal of error.<br />
			There is a guide on the site to
			<a href="../../inservice/verbs/tense_in_dependent_clauses.html" target="_blank" class="highlightlink">
			tenses in dependent clauses</a> that you can access here (new tab).</p>

			<h3>perfect +</h3>
			<p>We can combine the perfect aspect with a continuous, progressive,

			(i.e., the efforts themselves).<br />

				<dt><strong>achievement or outcome</strong></dt>
				<dd>If we say, too:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have finished my university course 
				in a year<br />

				future event, such as, 
				for example, applying for work, going on to other studies and so 
				on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>activity or effort</strong></dt>
				<dd>If, in contrast, we say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have been studying here for three

				it is that the activity has involved.</dd>
			</dl>
			<h3>Semantic considerations</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>verb meaning and achievement</strong></dt>
				<dd>Some verbs contain within their meaning the sense of 
				achievement or outcome.<br />
				If, for example, we say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will have succeeded<br />
				</em>the use of the verb <em>succeed</em> usually prohibits the 
				progressive form so we do not encounter:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She will have been succeeding<br />
				</em>because the verb itself refers to achievement not activity.<br />
				Equally, we do not find:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They will have been accomplishing it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She will have been concluding it</em><br />
				and so on for similar reasons.<br />
				With verbs which imply any kind of achievement, the use of the 
				progressive form is simply unnecessary (and usually wrong).</dd>
				<dt><strong>verb meaning and stative or dynamic use</strong></dt>
				<dd>The shorthand for this distinction is to think of stative 
				and dynamic verbs and that is how it is often presented to 
				learners.&nbsp; A better way to consider it is to look at the 
				meaning of a verb and ask whether its use <strong>in this 
				meaning</strong> is stative or dynamic.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of the presentation, I hope 
				they will have thought it is worth the time to do this</em><br />
				is the use of the verb <em>think</em> to mean <em>believe</em> but:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will have been thinking about the 
				problem for weeks</em><br />
				is the use of the verb to mean <em>deliberate</em> or <em>
				cogitate</em>.<br />
				The rule is that when a verb is <strong>used</strong> statively, 
				the progressive form is unacceptable.<br />
				It follows logically that verbs which are very firmly tied to a 
				state rather than an action, such as <em>own, seem, look like, 
				possess, believe, suppose </em>etc. will not appear in the 
				progressive form.<br />
				Other verbs, which are polysemous and can be used in both forms 
				with a change in meaning include <em>have, consider, think, 
				appear, imagine, judge, look, occur</em> etc. and may appear in 
				either simple or progressive structures depending on the meaning 
				intended.</dd>
				<dt><strong>adverbials and time / event markers</strong></dt>
				<dd>The distinction is clear here, too.<br />
				We can say, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have flown across the Atlantic
				<span class="style_underline">four times</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will have run <span class="style_underline">six marathons</span><br />
				</em>and so on because we are focused on the achievement or outcome 
				of the actions.<br />
				Using the same forms with the progressive makes no sense because 
				the focus of the progressive is on the efforts or activities, 
				not the outcomes so we do not find:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *I will have been flying across the Atlantic
				<span class="style_underline">four times</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They will have been running
				<span class="style_underline">six marathons</span></em></dd>

			<p>As is the case with most tense forms in English, telicity plays 
			an important role.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The house will have been built</em><br />
			is telic because we are clearly stating the building work is 
			finished, but:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house will have been being built</em><br />
			is atelic because the end point of the building is not implied.<br />
			This is clearer when a prepositional time phrase is included:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The house will have been built 
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>in</strong></span> a year</em><br />
			is telic and the end point is explicit<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house will have been being built 
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>for</strong></span> a 
			year</em><br />
			is atelic because there is no explicit end point in sight.</p>

		<h3>Aspects</h3>

		</table>
			<p>The future perfect tenses, both simple and progressive are described as 
			having a perfect aspect and by that it is meant that the tenses 
			refer in some way to the past within the future.<br />
			This is true but the progressive form is also use to describe two 
			other aspects which are not obvious by looking at the forms.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Iterative</strong></dt>
				<dd>This aspect refers to events or actions which are repeated, 
				and that is what iteration means.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John will have telephoned his wife so she 
				will know the news<br />
				</em>implies a single past event set in the future to show its 
				relevance to that future (that his wife will know something).<br />
				However:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John will have been telephoning his wife<br />
				</em>implies a series of events of the same kind.&nbsp; The 
				sense is still of a past within the future but in this case we 
				are concerned to show that the event is repeated so the 
				form of choice is future perfect progressive (although it might 
				be better referred to as future perfect iterative).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Durative</strong></dt>
				<dd>This aspect refers to events or actions which take a 
				substantial time.&nbsp; We are emphasising, then, the duration 
				of the event or action.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John will have lived in London for many years<br />
				</em>simply states a fact and sets the event in a future 
				context so, for example, John will be a good person to ask 
				about the city.<br />
				However:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John will have been living in London for many 
				years<br />
				</em>means roughly the same but the speaker's emphasis is on the 
				duration of the event, not the event itself.&nbsp; Past 
				relevance within the future is maintained.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>It makes sense, of course, to handle these distinctions piecemeal 
			with learners rather than expecting them to absorb all this in a 
			single sitting.</p>
