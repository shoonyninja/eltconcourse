		<p>Here we consider four past tense forms.&nbsp; English past forms are 
		not hugely complex but they are more complicated than the ones used 
		by many other languages.&nbsp; English uses a 
		variety of forms to talk about different aspects or ways of 
		seeing the past.&nbsp; If you are unclear about the difference between 
		tense and aspect, it will help if you followed
		<a href="tense_aspect_essentials.html" target="_blank">the guide to tense and aspect</a> before going on 
		(new tab).</p>
		<p>There is also a separate
		<a href="present_perfect.html" target="_blank">guide to the present perfect</a> 
		which contains a contrast with the past simple so 
		that will not be covered here.<br />
		Another guide covers the past perfect simple and progressive so that 
		will not be considered in any depth here.</p>
		<p><a name="present1"></a>Compare these examples and see if you can figure out 
		what the difference in meaning is:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style19">

			<p>It is important to remember that many languages do not 
			distinguish between progressive and instantaneous actions.&nbsp; In 
			German, for example, <span class="styleredbold"><em>ich kam</em></span> 
			could be translated either as <span class="styleredbold"><em>I came</em></span> or <span class="styleredbold">
			<em>I was coming</em></span>.&nbsp; 
			The context will usually make things clear or an adverbial such as
			<em>at that moment </em>may be added.&nbsp; In many other languages, the same thing applies.<br />
			Many languages do not have a form analogous to these uses of <em>used 
			to</em> and <em>would </em>at all.</p></div>
			<p>A few notes:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style5">
			<li><em>I called you on the 14th June<br />
			</em><span class="style_blue">The simplest form of the past 
			in English and the one usually taught first.&nbsp; There is more on 
			this in 
			<a href="../initial/lexis/lexical_verb_forms.html" target="_blank">the guide to basic verb forms</a> including a discussion of 
			pronunciation, spelling and irregular forms.</span></li>
			<li><em>I worked in London from 1998 till 2004<br />
			</em><span class="style_blue">Note the finished nature of the 
			action.&nbsp; For more, see 
			<a href="present_perfect.html" target="_blank">the guide to the present perfect</a> where 
			the two forms are compared.</span></li>
			<li><em>I always went to school by bus<br />
			</em><span class="style_blue">As we noted above, if you 
			remove the adverbial the sense changes to that in example 1: a
			</span><span class="auto-style17">single finished, short past</span><span class="style_blue"> 
			event unless the context makes it clear that this was a habit.</span></li>
			<li><em>I was reading a book<br />
			</em><span class="style_blue">This form tell us a little 
			about how the speaker views the action (its aspect) but gives no 
			further information except that the action was progressive.&nbsp; We 
			don't know when it started and we don't know when it finished.</span></li>
			<li><em>I was just getting on the bus when I saw her<br />
			</em><span class="style_blue">We don't know from 
			this whether the speaker continued to get on the bus or stopped 
			because he saw her.&nbsp; We need more context to know (see below 
			under time lines).</span></li>
			<li><em>He was watching television while she was gardening<br />
			</em><span class="style_blue">This is the usual way of 
			talking about two progressive actions happening at the same time.&nbsp; 
			However, providing the context is clear, it is possible to use the 
			simple past to do this.&nbsp; For example, </span><em>He read while 
			I watched TV</em><span class="style_blue">.</span></li>
			<li><em>I used to go to school by bus and ...</em></li>
			<li><em>... I would always try to sit at 
			the back<br />
			</em><span class="style_blue">Both these forms refer to 
			discontinued past habits but <em>would</em> is rarer as a way of 
			setting the scene.&nbsp; It is, however, very common to start with a
			<em>used to</em> expression and then continue using <em>would</em>.&nbsp; 
			For example<br />
			</span><em>We <span class="auto-style18">used to</span> take our holidays in Margate where 
			the kids <span class="auto-style18">would</span> go to the beach all day and we 
			<span class="auto-style18">would</span> spend our time 
			reading or shopping.&nbsp; In the evening we 
			<span class="auto-style18">would</span> all meet up for 
			dinner and then we'<span class="auto-style18">d</span> go on to see a show or something</em><span class="style_blue">.<br />
			For past states, only <em>used to</em> is usually 
			possible:<br />
			We can have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to drive to work early in the morning</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would drive to work early in the morning</em><br />
			BUT, we can have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to own a Jaguar<br />
			</em>but NOT<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I would own a Jaguar</em></span></li>

			<p>This is a semantic issue rather than a grammatical one and to 
			understand the aspect which is signalled by the <em>-ing</em> form 
			of a verb we need to distinguish between instantaneous verbs such as
			<em>bang, hit, glance, break </em>etc. and durative verbs such as
			<em>read, stay, live, listen </em>etc.<br />
			The distinction can be seen in these examples:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Iterative use with instantaneous verbs:</dt>
				<dd><em>She was hitting the the keyboard too hard<br />
				She was breaking bottles in the garden</em></dd>
				<dt>Progressive or background use with durative verbs:</dt>
				<dd><em>They were reading in the train<br />
				John was listening to the music</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Not all verbs fall neatly into one or the other category, 
			naturally, and in cases of ambiguity, English resorts to the use of 
			adverbials to make the aspect clear so we may find, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was trying to repair the pipe all morning</em> 
			(progressive)<em><br />
			</em>vs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He was trying to repair the pipe on and off for weeks</em> 
			(iterative)</p>
			<p>Some languages reserve a special form of the verb to distinguish 
			and iterative aspect but English simply re-purposes the <em>-ing</em> 
			form for this distinction., </p>

			<h3>past simple and past progressive tenses</h3>
			<p>The formation of the tenses is not usually troublesome for 
			learners.&nbsp; It is the concepts which take time to absorb and 
			master.</p>
			<p>As we saw with the contrast between present simple and present 
			progressive, the following are the usual issues which arise 
			concerning form.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Many languages change the ending (inflect) for all persons and 
			number so, for example, in French, we see:<br />
			<em>je mangeais (I ate)<br />
			</em><em>tu mangeais<br />
			</em><em>il/elle/on mangeait<br />
			nous mangions<br />
			</em><em>vous mangiez<br />
			</em><em>ils/elles mangeaient</em><strong><br /></strong>The same applies to most European languages and some 
			are even more complicated than French.<br />
			English is unusual because the verb past tense form, regular or not, 
			NEVER changes.&nbsp; We have, therefore, <em>I ate, you ate, they 
			ate, we ate, everyone ate</em> etc.<br />
			The very simplicity of this can confuse low-level learners used to 
			looking for inflexion in the verb.</li>
			<li>To form questions and negatives, many languages rely on changes 
			to word order or simply on intonation or punctuation.<br />
			English, however, makes use of the auxiliary verb <em>do</em> 
			(called an operator) followed by the base form (bare infinitive) of 
			the verb to form both questions and negatives.<br />
			We get, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went &gt; <strong>Did</strong> she go? &gt; She <strong>didn't</strong> 
			go</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			At elementary level in particular, this can be confusing and hard to 
			remember so we get errors such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Went you?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*Made you?</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He not go</em><br />
			etc.</li>
			<li>The progressive is generally simpler to form (which may be one 
			reason learners tend to overuse it).&nbsp; The important thing to 
			note is that the past tense of <em>be</em> is irregular and does 
			actually inflect for number, although on a simple basis with two 
			forms only, <em>was</em> and <em>were</em> and without any 
			inflexion for person.</li>
			<li>The negative and interrogative forms of the past progressive 
			follow the pattern of the present progressive using:<br />
			For negatives: <span class="style_black">subject + past of <em>be</em> + not 
			+ <em>-ing</em> form</span> to produce, e.g., <em>She was not paying 
			attention</em><br />
			For interrogatives: <span class="style_black">past of <em>be</em> + subject +
			<em>-ing</em> form </span>to produce, e.g., <em>Were they playing 
			tennis?</em></li>
		</ol>
			<h3><em>used to</em> and <em>would</em></h3>
			<p>These two verbs work very differently because they are, in fact, 
			modal or semi-modal in nature.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>would</strong></dt>
				<dd>makes the question by simple inversion of subject and verb 
				and no other changes:<br />
				<em>She would often get angry &gt; Would she often get angry?</em><br />
				makes the negative by the insertion of <em>not</em> after the 
				auxiliary:<br />
				<em>She would often get angry &gt; She would not / wouldn't often 
				get angry</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>used to</strong> is more complicated because there are two possible 
				forms of negatives and interrogatives:</dt>
				<dd>
				<table cellpadding="2" class="tableblueborder">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style8">&nbsp;</td>
						<td class="auto-style8">More common / less formal</td>
						<td class="auto-style78">Less common / more formal</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style8" style="height: 22px">Declarative</td>
						<td class="auto-style72" colspan="2" style="height: 22px"><em>She used to work in 
						a bank</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style8">Interrogative</td>
						<td class="auto-style8"><em>Did she use(d) to work in a 
						bank?</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style78"><em>Used she to work in a bank?</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style74">Negative</td>
						<td class="auto-style74"><em>She didn't use(d) to work in a 
						bank</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style75"><em>She use(d)n't to work in a bank</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br />
				The <em>-d</em> inflexion is optional in most cases.&nbsp; That's the 
				line taken on this site but purists might differ.<br />
				The less common and more formal ways to form questions and 
				negatives are probably better left to higher levels or even 
				consigned to receptive knowledge only.&nbsp; They are probably 
				dying out.</dd>

		<p>Time lines are simple, graphical representations of how languages use 
		tense and aspect to visualise events in time as if they were clothes on 
		a line.&nbsp; They can be simple, 
		effective and clear but you need to get them right to make sure that 
		that's true.&nbsp; In other words, you need to plan what you are going 
		to present.<br />
		Here's a task:<br />
			On a piece of paper, draw a horizontal arrow and mark it something 
			like this:<br />
			<img alt="past time line" height="100" src="../imagesgraphics/pasttimeline1.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>Now, take these examples and see if you can show the various 
			uses of the past forms by drawing time lines.</p>
