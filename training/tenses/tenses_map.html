		<p>What follows is not exhaustive but it covers the main uses of these 
		tenses in English.<br />
		The fourth column contains examples of the tenses used in the passive.&nbsp; 
		An essential guide to the passive and a more complex and detailed one 
		are available from the list of links at the end.<br />
		The fifth column contains examples of typical time words associated with 
		the tenses.&nbsp; It is <span class="style_underline"><strong>not</strong></span> 
		the time words which determine the tense use, it is the concept of the 
		tense which determines appropriate time expressions.</p>
