		<p>You may like to look at the guides to future forms before tackling

		on.</p>

				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>You should also bear in mind 		the guide to reported or 
		indirect speech, linked in the list of related guides at the end, because a great deal of what is there impinges on 
		this area.&nbsp; This is especially true for phenomena such as 
		back-shifting tenses and the changes made to modal auxiliary verbs such as <em>
		will</em>.&nbsp; If that's unclear, see the guide.</p>
			<p>There are times when we need to discuss plans that were made or 
		undertakings given for the future seen from the viewpoint of the past.<br />
		For example, if you mentally form a current intention such as<br />
		<span class="auto-style25">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to call him 
			tomorrow</span> and 
		then later want to discuss the intention, you might use an expression 
		such as<br />
		<span class="auto-style25">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		I was going to call him</span><br />
		That's not the same as using reported or indirect speech, but it 
		is very similar because you are reporting your own thoughts.<br />
			By the same token, indirect speech often includes 
		such examples as<br />
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<span class="style_black"><em>He said he would come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
		promised to write to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She undertook to have finished it by Friday<br />
			</em></span>etc.<br />
		which are 
		all ways of reporting what was said, written or implied.<br />
		This guide is not concerned with repeating what is explained in the one 
		on indirect or reported 
		speech.</p>

		<h2>The 5 main ways of talking about the future from a past perspective</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>There are five main ways English uses to see the future from the 
		perspective of the past.&nbsp; All of them express the same views of the 
		future that are expressed by similar constructions used either to talk about 
		the future proper or to refer to some current intention, willingness or 
		plan which will affect the future.<br />
		If you would like to remind yourself of the 
		four most common ways to talk about future time in English, see
		the guide to four future forms, linked below.</p>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="1" height="68" src="../../gfx/1blue.png" width="100" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style14">
		<h3><em><strong>was / were going to</strong></em></h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>This is sometimes called the <strong>unfulfilled intention</strong> 
			construction.&nbsp; If you have an intention to do something but 
			your plans are thwarted, you may well express the situation as 
			something like:<br /><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to take a week off but 
			there's too much to do</em></span><br />Equally, if someone uses 
		<em>will/shall</em> to express 
			current willingness such as:<br /><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll let you have the money soon</em></span><br />but the promise is not kept, the person owed the money might well 
			express the situation as:<br /><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		You were going to let me have the money soon</em></span><br />Notice how polite, even tentative, this can sound 
		compared with, e.g.<br />
		<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You promised to let me have the 
			money</em></span></p>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="2" height="69" src="../../gfx/2blue.png" width="100" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style14">
		<h3><em><strong>past progressive</strong></em></h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>This parallels the use of the present progressive used 
			for plans and arrangement currently in place.&nbsp; For example, in narrative 
			style we might find:<br /><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were meeting in Paris the following 
			week</em></span><br />which is not exactly reported speech but a very similar function 
			conceptually.<br />This form is also often used to complain about arrangements broken 
			or forgotten:<br />&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Did you forget that we were having lunch together today?</em></span></p>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="3" height="65" src="../../gfx/3blue.png" width="100" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style14">
		<h3><em><strong>was / were about to</strong></em></h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Used in the present, this marginal modal form implies an almost 
			certain imminent action:<br /><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am about to lose my temper<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is about to go to the airport</em></span><br />Occasionally, however, the action is cancelled or postponed (that's 
			life) so we get a similar construction, often with <em>but </em>(to 
			explain a reason) or <em>when</em> (to introduce an intervening 
			act):<br /><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about to lose my temper
			</em>
			<span class="style_underline"><em>but</em></span><em> he apologised so nicely 
			that I calmed down<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was about to go to the airport 
		</em> 
		<span class="style_underline"><em>when</em></span><em> the boss rang to say the 
			trip was off</em></span><br />
		A parallel structure is another marginal modal, <em>be on the point of</em>, 
		as in, e.g.<br />
		<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was on the point of losing my temper when 
		she apologised</em></span><br />
			A similar but rather odd marginal modal auxiliary verb construction 
		is <em>went to</em> which, when used in this way does not carry the 
		normal sense of <em>went</em> at all.&nbsp; For example:<br />
		<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to say something 
		but she interrupted<br />
		</em></span>The form is <strong>only</strong> used to refer to 
		unfulfilled past intentions.</p>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="4" height="67" src="../../gfx/4blue.png" width="100" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style14">
		<h3><em><strong>would</strong></em></h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>We are not here discussing forms such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They said they would come at 6</em>.<br />
		That is simply the 
			change to the verb <em>will</em> used for predicted futures which is a common event when it is 
			reported at a later time, back-shifting from <em>will</em> to <em>
		would</em>, its past form.</p>
		<p>The modal <em>would</em> is used as the past of <em>will</em> in many 
		situations where <em>will</em> is used to make firm future predictions.&nbsp; 
		The difference, of course, is that when the prediction is in the past we 
		usually know whether it turned out to be accurate.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<table cellspacing="0" class="auto-style17" style="width: 50%">
			<tr class="style_black">
				<td class="auto-style19">present prediction</td>
				<td class="auto-style20">past prediction</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style18"><em>Computers will get faster and 
				cheaper</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style21"><em>Computers would get faster and 
				cheaper</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style23"><em>She will be a farmer</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style22"><em>She would be a farmer</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style23"><em>She won't be much good at it</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style22"><em>She wouldn't be much good at it</em></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The use of <em>would</em> to refer to a future in the past is also 
		common in the context of projecting mental processes such as <em>expect, 
		think, imagine, guess, assume, hope, suspect</em> etc.&nbsp; For 
		example:</p>
		<table cellspacing="0" class="auto-style17" style="width: 50%">
			<tr class="style_black">
				<td class="auto-style19">present projection</td>
				<td class="auto-style20">past projection</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style18"><em>I suspect it will rain</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style21"><em>I suspected it would rain</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style23"><em>I hope she will see sense</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style22"><em>I hoped she would see sense</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style27"><em>They imagine I won't understand</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style26"><em>They imagined I wouldn't understand</em></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>There's not much that's mysterious in either use because the form is closely 
		analogous to the reported speech use exemplified above.</p>
		<p>There is a rather formal use of 
		<em>would</em> which 
			refers to the future in the past.&nbsp; This form is commonly used 
		in narratives, often to anticipate the plot in some way and grab the 
		reader's attention.<br />
		Here's an example:<br />
		<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She very soon would feel guilty about 
			what she had done</em></span><br />The future forms 
			proper that this parallels are not always easy to identify and quite varied 
			but they include things like:<br /><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is going to feel guilty about what 
			she has done<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will feel guilty about what she has done<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will be feeling guilty about what she has done</em></span></p>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="5" height="68" src="../../gfx/5blue.png" width="100" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style14">
		<h3><em><strong>was / were + to</strong></em></h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>This parallels the formal obligation form.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The children are to come to school 10 minutes early next Monday<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are to present the report at the next 
			board meeting</em></span><br />If the obligation remains unfulfilled after the event, it is often 
			discussed along with the reason for the failure using the 
		conjunction <em>but</em> 
			(or a similar concessive conjunct such as <em>however</em> etc.):<br />
		&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The children were to come to school ten 
			minutes early </em></span>
		 <span class="style_black"><em>but the bus broke down</em></span><span class="style_black"><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was to present the report at the next 
			board meeting.&nbsp; </em></span>
		 <span class="style_black"><em>However</em></span><span class="style_black"><em>, it was cancelled at the last minute</em></span><br />
		<span class="smallfont">See the footnote for another example.</span></p>

		<h2>Problems for learners</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>The fundamental issue for learners is that languages vary in how 
			relationships between times are expressed.&nbsp; This is a 
			conceptual issue as much as a grammatical one.<br />
			In English, we can refer to an event which is relative to another by 
			using the aspectual system so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to telephone you later about this</em><br />
			in which the speaker is moving the point of reference into the past 
			and expressing a future idea from there.&nbsp; The centre of this 
			sentence is, therefore, the past, not the present.&nbsp; In 
			technical terms, we can say that the speaker has shifted the deictic 
			centre from its usual place (here, now and me) into the past.<br />
			Other languages take a different tack and, lacking relative or 
			relational tense 
			form, use adverbials instead or will use a simple past tense form to 
			make this kind of statement such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to telephone you later about this</em><br />
			which expresses only more or less the same idea.<br />
			Even comprehending what is meant by, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was hosting a dinner party and left work 
			early</em><br />
			is not straightforward for learners whose first languages do not 
			have relational tense aspects, especially if they have been told that 
			the past progressive form is used to signal on-going events in the 
			past.</p>
			<p>The upshot is that a good deal of error occurs when learners 
			struggle to express the idea of a past intention, promise or 
			arrangement.&nbsp; Examples are:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I will telephone you earlier today<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I would telephone you earlier today<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is hosting a dinner party and left work early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He would host a dinner party and left work early</em><br />
			and more.&nbsp; All are caused by the inability to grasp the tense 
			forms required in English to move the centre to the past.</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				<img alt="time line" height="166" src="../images/pegs_on_line250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style14">
		<h2>time lines</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>None of the above (with the exception of the rarer <em>would </em>
		form) is particularly difficult to form but the concept of shifting the 
		point of view (the deictic centre) into the past is somewhat mysterious 
		to many learners.<br />
		Time lines help.&nbsp; In these, it is important that the eye is 
		included because the forms are dependent on the way events and ideas are 
		perceived.&nbsp; Here are examples of the time lines for all five ways 
		of expressing a future embedded in the past:</p>
			<h3><em>was / were going to</em></h3>
		<p>
		<img alt="1" height="165" src="../imagesgraphics/t-line_future_in_past2.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>
			past progressive</h3>
		<p>
		<img alt="2" height="149" src="../imagesgraphics/t-line_future_in_past1.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>
			<em>was / were about to</em></h3>
			<p>
			<img alt="3" height="149" src="../imagesgraphics/t-line_future_in_past3.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>
			<em>would</em></h3>
			<p>
			<img alt="4" height="140" src="../imagesgraphics/t-line_future_in_past4.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>
			<em>was / were to</em></h3>
			<p>
			<img alt="5" height="140" src="../imagesgraphics/t-line_future_in_past5.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>Even with the use of time lines and other graphical 
			representations, the need for constant concept checking remains.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>She w<span class="auto-style59">as going to present the 
				report at that meeting</span></em><ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li><em>When did she agree to present the report?</em></li>

		<p class="smallfont">Footnote:<br />
		For the forms under 4 and 5 above, you may like to consider this bit 
		from Oscar Wilde:</p>
		<p class="auto-style58" style="width: 600px"><span class="style_black"><em>
		She was thinking of Prince Charming, and, that 
		she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him, but 
		prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about the 
		gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life he 
		was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers. For he was not to 
		remain a sailor, or a super-cargo, or whatever he was going to be. Oh, 
		no! A sailor's existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in a horrid 
		ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a black 
		wind blowing the masts down, and tearing the sails into long screaming 
		ribands! He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a polite good-bye 
		to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields. Before a week was 
		over he was to come across a large nugget of pure gold, the largest 
		nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it down to the coast in 
		a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen. The bushrangers were to 
		attack them three times, and be defeated with immense slaughter. Or, no. 
		He was not to go to the gold-fields at all. They were horrid places, 
		where men got intoxicated, and shot each other in bar-rooms, and used 
		bad language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one evening, as he 
		was riding home, he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off 
		by a robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her. Of course 
		she would fall in love with him, and he with her, and they would get 
		married, and come home, and live in an immense house in London. Yes, 
		there were delightful things in store for him. But he must be very good, 
		and not lose his temper, or spend his money foolishly. She was only a 
		year older than he was, but she knew so much more of life. He must be 
		sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and to say his prayers each 
		night before he went to sleep. God was very good, and would watch over 
		him. She would pray for him too, and in a few years he would come back 
		quite rich and happy.<br />
		The lad listened sulkily to her, and made no answer. He was heart-sick 
		at leaving home.<br />
		Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.<br />

		<p class="smallfont">There are two aspects to note:</p>
		<ol class="smallfont" style="width: 565px">
			<li>
			Wilde uses the <em>were/was </em>to form to talk in 
			the past about Jim's imagined (rather than planned) future.&nbsp; This is an effective 
			literary device.</li>
			<li>
			In the final part, we know that she is 
			actually saying all this to Jim because we have <em>The lad listened</em> 
			so the <em>would</em> here is a form of reporting the verb <em>will</em>.</li>
