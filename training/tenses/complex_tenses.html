		voice.<br />
		If that is not the case, you should refer to the 
		<a href="tenses_map.html" target="_blank">introductory guide to English tenses</a> and/or
		<a href="tense_aspect_essentials.html" target="_blank">the guide to tense and

		<p>If you have the familiarity suggested above, this will

		What is the difference between the tense forms in these examples?</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>He arrived</em></li>
			<li><em>He has arrived</em></li>
			<li><em>She left</em></li>
			<li><em>She was leaving</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Sentences 1 and 3 are simple tense forms but sentences 2 and 4 display an 
		aspect of the tenses, perfect aspect in sentence 2 and progressive 
		aspect in sentence 4.<br />
		Many languages, as you will also know, do not have a way of 
		differentiating between the senses in 3. and 4., relying on context and 
		adverbials to make the meaning clear.&nbsp; Additionally, many other 
		languages do not differentiate formally between the aspects in sentences 1 and 
		2 although some will, like Italian, differentiate between distant and 
		close past events.</p>

		</table>
		<p>Complex tenses are those in which English combines 
		aspects, for example, the perfect and progressive but other aspects are 
		also combined, and they cause considerable trouble for 
		learners, especially for those whose first languages do not have a 
		developed aspect system, or, arguably, an aspect system at all.&nbsp; 
		Learners from these language backgrounds have to come to terms not only 
		with the forms in English (which include a range of auxiliary verbs) but 
		also with acquiring the concepts which the forms signal.<br />
		That is not to say, incidentally, that other languages do not have 
		complex verb phrases, just that English happens to have combinations of 
		aspectual forms which are not usually parallelled in other languages.</p>
			<p><a name="1"></a>Here are three examples for you to figure out the 
		meanings.</p>

			<li><em>They had been working all night</em></li>

			<p>These complex forms share many characteristics with their simple 
			forms:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>the present perfect progressive is used to explain a current 
				state or action with reference to past 
				actions or states just as the 
				simple form is used.&nbsp; It is a present, not a past, tense 
				with a past event or state embedded within it.</li>
				<li>the future perfect progressive, like the simple form, 
				implies looking back at future events from a point further in 
				the future.&nbsp; It is a relative or relational tense, relating two times to 
				each other.</li>
				<li>the past perfect progressive is used to talk about events 
				further in the past than the past simple, especially those with 
				causal relationships, in the same way that the past perfect 
				simple is used.&nbsp; It is also a relational tense.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For more on the uses of the tenses, refer to the individual 
			guides, the guide to aspect 
			and to the guide to 
			time, tense and aspect, both linked in the list of related guides at 
			the end.</p>
			<p>Again, it is important to remember that many languages do not 
			distinguish between progressive or repeated and on-off instant 
			actions and events.&nbsp; In 
			German, for example,<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<span class="auto-style31">Ich habe das Auto 
			gewaschen<br />
			</span>could be translated either as<br />
			 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
			<span class="auto-style31">I 
			have been washing the 
			car<br />
			</span>or<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<span class="auto-style31">I have washed the car</span>.<br />
			The context or an adverbial (e.g., <em>for hours</em>) will usually make things clear.&nbsp; In many other languages, the same thing applies.</p>

			<p>Understanding the forms is not at all easy and producing them 
			fluently requires a good deal of practice.&nbsp; The central issue 
			is that complex tenses contain more than one primary auxiliary verb 
			(<em>be, have, get, do</em> or <em>will</em>) which have to be 
			ordered correctly in the correct form for the tense to be acceptably 
			produced.&nbsp; Any deviation usually produces nonsense such as, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They will has be work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She had will be worked</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I had will be doing it</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			Unusually, such utterances are rarely understood even by a 
			sympathetic listener and almost never by someone untrained in the 
			kinds of errors that learners may make.<br />
			Moreover, unlike some languages, English does not consistently allow 
			adverbials to be embedded within the verb phrase so, while:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will definitely have been making 
			numerous mistakes in the calculations</em><br />
			is acceptable,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They will have been definitely making 
			numerous mistakes in the calculations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They definitely will have been making in the calculations 
			numerous mistakes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They will have definitely in the calculations been making 
			numerous mistakes</em><br />
			and a range of other formulations are not allowed.&nbsp; None of 
			this is obvious or intuitive to most learners<br />
			There is a guide in the initial plus section of this site to the 
			main uses and forms of primary auxiliary verbs, linked below).</p>

		<p>In spoken English, the auxiliary verbs are 
		often contracted and the stress falls on the main verb and the adverbial 
		(usually) so we get, e.g.:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>It's been r</em><strong><em>ai</em></strong><em>ning for h</em><strong><em>ou</em></strong><em>rs </em>(/ɪts bɪn ˈreɪn.ɪŋ fə ˈaʊəz/)</li>
			<li><em>They'll've been w</em><strong><em>o</em></strong><em>rking for h</em><strong><em>ou</em></strong><em>rs 
			</em>(/ˈðeɪləv bɪn ˈwɜːk.ɪŋ fə ˈaʊəz/)</li>
			<li><em>She'd been pl</em><strong><em>a</em></strong><em>ying p</em><strong><em>oo</em></strong><em>rly up 
			to then </em>(/ʃid bɪn ˈpleɪ.ɪŋ ˈpʊə.li ʌp tə ðen/)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If the phonemic script means nothing to you at the moment, don't 
		fret.&nbsp; Just try saying the sentences rapidly and notice how <em>
		been</em> is pronounced as <em>bin</em> and how the '<em>o</em>' in <em>for</em> 
		and <em>to</em> is reduced to a short sound such as the one at the end 
		of <em>sister</em> (/ə/).</p>
		<p>This gets worse in the negatives where we get, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They won't've been travelling for long </em>(/ˈðeɪ wəʊntəv bɪn ˈtræ.vəl.ɪŋ 
		fə ˈlɒŋ/)</p>
			<p>This sort of thing is tough to say in a foreign language and 
			learners need lots of practice perhaps including some drilling before they get it 
			right.<br />
			Hearing the form is also a challenge because of the consistent use 
			of contractions and weak forms.&nbsp; This meansd that learners will 
			often be unaware of some of the auxiliary verbs in what they hear 
			and hear something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll've been finished by six<br />
			</em>as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been finished by six<br />
			</em>or even as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'll finished by six<br />
			</em>In particular, the reduced forms of <em>will, had</em> and <em>
			been</em> will often be missed.</p>

				<p>The first two examples above show the semantically determined 
				difference between the progressive and iterative aspects.&nbsp; 
				Although both sentences contain <em>been</em> + <em>-ing</em> 
				forms and are perfect in aspect, the sense of the verb <em>bang</em> 
				is that it is an instantaneous action and cannot be a 
				progressive one whereas the sense of the verb <em>ride</em> is 
				one that implies a possible (almost certain) progressive action.&nbsp; 
				When the <em>-ing </em>form is used with instantaneous verbs 
				such as <em>bang, break, glance, cough</em> etc., the sense 
				signalled is of a repeated action but when it is used with a 
				durative verb such as <em>ride, read, study, sleep, drive </em>
				etc., the sense signalled is of a progressive action rather than 
				a repeated one.<br />
				The third example shows how a usually durative verb (<em>drive</em>) 
				can be made iterative in aspect by the addition of adverbials (<em>a 
				day for weeks</em>).&nbsp; The fourth example also shows this 
				phenomenon (the adverbials <em>on and off for weeks</em>).&nbsp; 
				The fifth example is slightly ambiguous because it could be 
				interpreted as iterative if the spending occurred frequently but 
				on separate occasions.<br />
				For learners whose first languages have no way to signal 
				progressive aspects, that is troubling.</p>

		<h2>Modal auxiliary verbs</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>In exactly the same ways that modal auxiliary verbs can be used with simple tenses, 
		they can be deployed with complex ones.&nbsp; We get structures such as 
		these</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>He must have been out walking because his boots are all wet 
			and muddy</em></li>
			<li><em>They will have to have been driving all night so they will 
			be tired when they arrive tomorrow</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>The past perfect progressive is not used with 
		modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; When we need to insert modality we use the present 
		perfect progressive with the modal and follow it with a past tense if 
		need be.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="3"><em>*He must had been out walking in the rain because 
			he came with wet, muddy boots.<br />
			</em>is unacceptable.&nbsp; Compare 1. above.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>We can even combine modality with the passive so it is, 
		theoretically, possible to form examples such as:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="4"><em>His car must have been being serviced if he came 
			in a cab.</em></li>
			<li><em>The room can't have been being painted recently.&nbsp; There 
			was no smell of paint.</em></li>
			<li><em>He should have been being treated sooner but there will be a 
			delay, I'm afraid.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>These forms are rare, which is not to say they don't exist, of 
		course.</p>
			<p>An issue with modal auxiliary verbs concerns aspect.&nbsp; With 
			non-modal clauses, the use of the prefect aspect signals that events 
			are considered as relational so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She has arrived so now we can start the meeting</em><br />
			embeds the past event in the present to make the relation clear and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had lost their money so walked home in 
			the rain</em><br />
			embeds the past event inside another event.<br />
			However, when modal auxiliary forms are used in the past, this 
			relational sense is not always retained so.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She can't have left at nine o'clock</em><br />
			may not be related to the present at all and refer to a finished 
			past event set in absolute rather than relative time.<br />
			In that sense, the aspect is simple, <strong>not</strong> perfect.</p>

		<p>What we can do with the passive and modal auxiliary verbs, we can also do with 
		the causative so, again, the following are theoretically possible, 
		albeit rare, apart from the present perfect progressive causative which 
		is actually reasonably frequently used.&nbsp; See 9., below.</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="7"><em>I will have been having my hair cut here for ten 
			years by then.</em></li>
			<li><em>He must have been having to have his car serviced because he

			<li><em>They couldn't have been getting the groceries delivered.</em></li>

		<p>Learners who already know how the perfect aspect affects current 
		meaning and who understand the concept of duration and repeated action 
		expressed through the progressive aspect will have the ability to unpack 
		these meanings (and it is unwise to try to tackle this area with 
		learners who don't).&nbsp; They will also understand how the addition of 
		the time adverbial affects meaning.</p>
		<p>Once the concept is clear, for Step 2, you can focus on the form and 
		the pronunciation in a reasonably controlled way.&nbsp; The trick then 
		is to go on to get the learners to make their own meanings.</p>
		<p>Step 3:<br />
		The easiest tense to focus on is the present perfect progressive.&nbsp; 
		When learners have the sense of that, they can transfer the concept to 
		the other complex tenses.&nbsp; The ideas of durative or repeated 
		actions are parallel across all three tenses.<br />
		A half-way house is to use visuals to get learners to use the forms 
		correctly.<br />
		The following is for illustration purposes and mixes all the tenses.&nbsp; 
		It is far safer to focus on one at a time but the same kinds of visuals

		it is important continually to check the concepts, of course, or the

		You will need to be very alert to the responses from your learners and 
		prepared, for example, to explain why<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I had been opening the front 
		door before I came to class<br />
		</em>is wrong.<br />
		Actions and events need to be <strong>durative or repeated</strong>

		<table class="auto-style32">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style27" style="width: 145px"><strong>Prompt</strong></td>
				<td class="auto-style27"><strong>Convert this sentence ...</strong></td>
				<td class="auto-style27"><strong>into a sentence with a modal 
				auxiliary verb</strong></td>
				<td class="auto-style27"><strong>How does the meaning change?&nbsp;</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style27" style="width: 145px">
				<img alt="stone" height="133" src="../images/milestone200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style27"><em>We had been walking for hours when 
				we finally found the milestone</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style27"><em>We must ...</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style27">&nbsp;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style27" style="width: 145px">

				<td class="auto-style27"><em>The boss won't have been in the

			<p>It is very important that the fourth column is filled in and 
			discussed, of course, or the exercise will be mere manipulation.&nbsp; 
			It is also the case that the third column can be completed with a 
			variety of forms, all with slightly different meanings.&nbsp; That, 
			too, merits some careful discussion.</p>
			<p>Once the learners are confident in using the forms and understand 
			the concepts involved, you can go on to just providing a set of 
			visual prompts to get them to produce appropriate utterances 
			combining tense forms and modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; Like this, 
			perhaps:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style50">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style44" colspan="2">Look at these images and 
				make four sentences with <em>can't, must, should</em> and <em>
				might</em>, using the forms we have studied today.<br />
					The first one is an example.</td>
				</tr>
