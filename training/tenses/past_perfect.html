	<h1>The past perfect: the past embedded in the past</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="past" height="207" src="../images/history_ammonite310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p>If you have studied other languages, you may have found this tense 
		referred to as the pluperfect and it sometimes called that in English 
		grammar, too.&nbsp; Here, however, we'll use the usual term for it, the 
		past perfect.</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="what?" height="166" src="../images/animals_meerkats_two250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style14">
		<h2>What is the past perfect?</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The past perfect (like all perfect forms) is a <strong>relational</strong> 
		rather than <strong>absolute</strong> time marker.&nbsp; That means that 
		the tense is used to link actions or states <strong>in relation to each 
		other</strong>, not set them at a particular time.</p>
		<p>The past perfect tense refers to the past <strong>in</strong> the past or the past 
		<strong>before</strong> the past.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>She <span class="style_black">had visited</span> France 
			often before then</em></li>
			<li><em>She <span class="style_black">had met</span> him before and 
			knew his reputation.</em></li>
			<li><em>They <span class="style_black">had spent</span> the 
			afternoon skiing and were looking forward to a rest.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>A simple time line can make it clearer:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="timeline" height="117" src="../imagesgraphics/pastperfecttimeline.png" width="310" /></p>
		<p>In fact, as sentence 1 above indicates, the past perfect often occurs 
		without the past simple.&nbsp; For example,</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="4"><em>He <span class="style_black">had arrived</span> 
			before me.</em></li>
			<li><em>Before lunch they <span class="style_black">had played</span> 
			cards.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Note, however, that some other past event or state is <strong>always</strong> 
		implied in these circumstances.&nbsp; In sentence 4, that implication is 
		that <em>I also arrived</em> and in sentence 5, there is a clear 
		implication that <em>they ate lunch</em> after they played cards.<br />
		In this way the past perfect stands in relation to the past in the same 
		way that the present perfect stands in relation to the present.<br />
		In both these tenses, the prior event is <strong>embedded</strong> in a 
		following event and alters it in some way or even allows it to happen at 
		all.<br />
		So, for example, when we embed the past in the present, we might say:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss has arrived so now we can start the 
		meeting</em><br />
		and the use of the present perfect signals the fact that the meeting 
		would not take place but for the boss' arrival.<br />
		Equally, when we shift the events to the past, we get:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boss had arrived so then we could start the 
		meeting</em><br />
		which also signals exactly the same relationship between the boss' 
		arrival and the meeting's reality.</p>

		This is what is meant by the past perfect referring to the past <strong>

		<p><span class="style_brown">The general rule is, therefore, that when

		</table>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>When events or states are mentioned out of order:</strong></dt>
			<dd>Speakers and writers will often reverse the ordering of events 
			to emphasise one of them.<br />
			It's fine to have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lived for 20 years in France and 
			retired to England<br />
			</em>using two simple past forms because the events are stated in a 
			logical, chronological order.&nbsp; In this case, the use of the 
			past perfect would be redundant and unnatural.<br />
			But if we 
			reverse the order, the past perfect is <span class="style_underline">
			usually</span> necessary:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He returned to England.&nbsp; He had lived in France for 20 
			years </em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He returned to England after he had lived in France<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Before he returned to England he had lived in France<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Here's another example to make things clear.&nbsp; If we state 
			events in the logical, chronological order as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She went out to dinner, came home, remembered to feed the 
			cat and went to bed</em><br />
			using the past perfect would be so cumbersome, redundant and 
			unnatural that most speakers would reject:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*?She had been out to dinner, had come home, had 
			remembered to feed the cat and went to bed<br />
			</em>However, if we disturb the ordering and have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She went out to dinner, came home, went to bed and had 
			remembered to feed the cat<br />
			</em>then the past perfect needs to be inserted to make the sudden 
			disjuncture of events understandable.</dd>
			<dt><strong>When we have a </strong><em><strong>when</strong></em><strong>-clause 
			referring to a later (not (near) simultaneous) event:</strong></dt>
			<dd>The conjunction <em>when</em> can connect simultaneous
			<span class="style_underline">or</span> consecutive events so, it's fine to have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he retired he went to England<br />
			</em>because the events happened at the same time but when they don't, we 
			usually need the past perfect to avoid ambiguity.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made tea when they arrived</em><br />
			which means that the arrival and the tea making happened close 
			together if not simultaneously,
			with<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had made tea when they arrived<br />
			</em>which means that the tea making preceded the arrival.</dd>
			<dt><strong>When the first past event has an immediate effect on the 
			second:</strong></dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had never seen him before that night<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			They hadn't tried whisky before they went to Scotland<br />
			</em>(<em>*She never saw him before that night<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em> 
			*They didn't try whisky before they went to Scotland<br />
			</em>are both 
			unacceptable.)<br />
			The reason for this is that the past perfect is a <strong>relational</strong> tense and 
			relates an event before the past which has an immediate effect on 
			the past or may even allow a past event to take place at all just as the present perfect relates the past to the 
			present.<br />
			For this reason, the adverbs <em>just, already</em> and <em>yet</em> 
			(which are relational) often compel the use of the past perfect 
			form.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had just finished the work when it started 
			to rain<br />
			</em>not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I finished the work when it started to rain<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had you already finished the work when it 
			started to rain<br />
			</em>not<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Did you already finish the work when it 
			started to rain?</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>In causal subordinating clauses:</strong></dt>
			<dd>Especially with causal relationships, the past perfect is 
			commonly used (although two past simple tenses are often possible).<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made tea because they had arrived<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I didn't go because I had lost my ticket</em><br />
			But we can also have, e.g.,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrived late because the car broke down on the way<br />
			</em>where 
			the ordering and causality is obvious.<br />
			The rule of thumb here is that it is never wrong to use the past 
			perfect in these types of sentences.</dd>

		<h3>Activity <em>vs</em>. Achievement</h3>

			<p>We can use both tenses to refer to a past within the past so 
			we can say either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had climbed the mountain<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had been climbing the mountain<br />
			</em>but in the first we are emphasising his achievement (i.e., the 
			outcome of his efforts) and in the second, the activity itself 
			(i.e., the efforts themselves).<br />
			Another example may make things clearer.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>achievement or outcome</strong></dt>
				<dd>If we say, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had finished the report<br />
			</em>the obvious sense is that it was now available for you to read, 
				pass on to the boss, publish or whatever.<br />
				We are laying stress on the <strong>achievement</strong> which 
				is relevant to the past.<br />
				If we say, too:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had taken my holidays in France for 
				many years<br />
				</em>we are suggesting that it is the outcome of the activity 
				which carries the relevance to a following past event such as, 
				for example, deciding to retire to France or take holidays 
				elsewhere etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>activity or effort</strong></dt>
				<dd>If, in contrast, we say:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<em>I had been finishing the report<br />
			</em>we emphasise my activity, not the achievement and it is the
				<strong>activity</strong> which is relevant to the past and 
				that explains why I was late home, had been out of touch or 
				whatever.&nbsp; In this case, the report is not the central 
				issue, it is the activity which is important.<br />
				If we say, too:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been taking a holiday in France</em><br />
				we are emphasising that the activity and explaining why, say, I 
				had not been answering my emails or been available.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Similar examples can be used when the activity is what interests 
			us, not any kind of achievement and it is the activity which serves 
			to <strong>explain the past</strong>.&nbsp; Here are three:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been running (and was hot and tired)<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She had been drinking (and was not making sense)<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			What had you been doing? (to get so dirty, tired, wet </em>etc<em>.)</em></p>
			<h3>Semantic considerations</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>verb meaning and achievement</strong></dt>
				<dd>Some verbs contain within their meaning the sense of 
				achievement or outcome.<br />
				If, for example, we say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had succeeded<br />
				</em>the use of the verb <em>succeed</em> usually prohibits the 
				progressive form so we do not encounter:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She had been succeeding<br />
				</em>because the verb itself refers to achievement not activity.<br />
				Equally, we do not find:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They had been accomplishing it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She had been realising it</em><br />
				and so on for similar reasons.<br />
				With verbs which imply any kind of achievement, the use of the 
				progressive form is simply unnecessary (and usually wrong).</dd>
				<dt><strong>verb meaning and stative or dynamic use</strong></dt>
				<dd>The shorthand for this distinction is to think of stative 
				and dynamic verbs and that is how it is often presented to 
				learners.&nbsp; A better way to consider it is to look at the 
				meaning of a verb and ask whether its use <strong>in this 
				meaning</strong> is stative or dynamic.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had often thought that the garden needs 
				some work</em><br />
				is the use of the verb <em>think</em> to mean <em>believe</em> but:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been thinking that the garden needs 
				some work</em><br />
				is the use of the verb to mean <em>deliberate</em> or <em>
				cogitate</em>.<br />
				The rule is that when a verb is <strong>used</strong> statively, 
				the progressive form is unacceptable.<br />
				Other pairings showing this distinction include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John had appeared a bit depressed 
				recently</em><br />
				in which <em>appear</em> means <em>seem</em> and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John had been appearing in The Importance 
				of Being Earnest</em><br />
				in which the verb means <em>act</em> or <em>perform</em>.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had had the house for years</em><br />
				in which the verb <em>have</em> means <em>possess</em>, and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had been having an argument</em><br />
				in which the verb means <em>conduct</em> or <em>take part in</em>.<br />
				It follows logically that verbs which are very firmly tied to a 
				state rather than an action, such as <em>own, seem, look like, 
				possess, believe, suppose </em>etc. will not appear in the 
				progressive form.<br />
				Other verbs, which are polysemous and can be used in both forms 
				with a change in meaning include <em>have, consider, think, 
				appear, imagine, judge, look, occur</em> etc. and may appear in 
				either simple or progressive structures depending on the meaning 
				intended.<br />
				(Rarely, even the verb <em>be</em> can fall into this polysemous 
				category.&nbsp; Normally, it cannot be used dynamically but in 
				the sense of deliberate assumption of a characteristic, it can.&nbsp; 
				We allow, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has been being difficult for some time</em>.)</dd>
				<dt><strong>adverbials and time / event markers</strong></dt>
				<dd>The distinction is clear here, too.<br />
				We can say, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had flown across the Atlantic
				<span class="style_underline">four times</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had run <span class="style_underline">six marathons</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had <span class="style_underline">often</span> spoken 
				about her schooldays</em><br />
				and so on because we are focused on the achievement or outcome 
				of the actions.<br />
				Using the same forms with the progressive makes no sense because 
				the focus of the progressive is on the efforts or activities, 
				not the outcomes so we do not find:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *I had been flying across the Atlantic
				<span class="style_underline">four times</span></em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They had been running
				<span class="style_underline">six marathons</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She had <span class="style_underline">often</span> been 
				speaking about her schooldays</em></dd>

		<h3>Telicity</h3>

		</table>
			<p>The term telicity is not something with which you should trouble 
			learners but the concept is important to understand.<br />
			The question to ask is whether an event or action is seen as 
			finished (that is to say, perfective [not perfect]) or whether there 
			is no end point in sight.<br />
			The progressive form of the tense is used most frequently for events 
			and actions which are seen as atelic, having no explicit finishing 
			point and the simple aspect is used to refer to actions or events 
			that are telic and, although finished, still refer to the past 
			within the past.<br />
			<strong>Both forms refer to the past within the past.</strong><br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had read the book<br />
			</em>clearly implies that the action of reading was now finished but 
			that the reading of the book is set in the past because it was 
			relevant to our conversation in some way.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been reading the book<br />
			</em>on the other hand, means that the book was not finished.&nbsp; 
			It is still a past within the past in terms of relevance, of 
			course.<br />
			Compare, too, for example<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had been writing a letter but was unhappy with the wording<br />
		</em>in which the action was incomplete (atelic) and may have been resumed and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had written a letter but was unhappy with the wording<br />
		</em>in which the action is complete (telic) but still with relevance to the second past event.</p>

			<p>The past perfect tenses, both simple and progressive are described as 
			having a perfect aspect and by that it is meant that the tenses 
			refer in some way to the past within the past.<br />
			This is true but the progressive form is also use to describe two 
			other aspects which are not obvious by looking at the forms.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Iterative</strong></dt>
				<dd>This aspect refers to events or actions which are repeated, 
				and that is what iteration means.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John had telephoned me<br />
				</em>implies a single past event set in the past to show its 
				relevance to then (for example, that I had been told some news 
				or whatever).<br />
				However:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John had been telephoning me<br />
				</em>implies a series of events of the same kind.&nbsp; The 
				sense is still of a past within the past but in this case we 
				are concerned to show that the event was repeated so the 
				form of choice is past perfect progressive (although it might 
				be better referred to as past perfect iterative).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Durative</strong></dt>
				<dd>This aspect refers to events or actions which take a 
				substantial time.&nbsp; We are emphasising, then, the duration 
				of the event or action.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John had lived in London for many years<br />
				</em>simply states a fact and sets the event in a past 
				context so, for example, John was a good person to ask 
				about the city.<br />
				However:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John had been living in London for many 
				years<br />
				</em>means roughly the same but the speaker's emphasis is on the 
				duration of the event, not the event itself.&nbsp; Past 
				relevance is maintained.</dd>

		<p>Briefly, the past perfect is often used when we report something said 
		in the past tense after the time of speaking.&nbsp; So, for example<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I bought it in London"<br />
		</em>is reported as<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she had bought it in London.<br />
		</em>However, if the object in question lies before us, the past perfect 
		is not necessary, so the reporting can be<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she bought this in London</em><br />
		in which the use of <em>this</em> clearly implies that the object is 
		before us.<br />If the direct speech is already in the past perfect, no changes can 
		be made either to it or the following past simple form.<br />
		Therefore:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I had been running to catch the bus and was out of breath"<br />
		</em>will be reported as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she had been running for the bus and was out of
