			<h1>Talking about present time</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="now" height="207" src="../../images/meditation_monk310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>English uses a number of strategies to apply aspect to present 
			time.&nbsp; The form we use depends on the aspect we 
			perceive.<br />
			You may be mildly surprised to find the present perfect, the <em>
			going to</em> formulation and the use of <em>be</em> + -<em>ing</em> 
			in this section.&nbsp; The argument is that, while they do refer to 
			future or past states or events, they do so premised on present states or 
			events and can only be understood with reference to the present.&nbsp; 
			In this sense they are <strong>relational</strong> not <strong>
			absolute</strong> forms and belong here.</p>
			<p>If you are expecting to find consideration of the present simple 
			tense in English in this guide, you will be disappointed.&nbsp; That 
			tense is considered in 
			<a href="always_time.html" target="_blank" class="highlightlink">the guide to 
			talking about always</a> because it is a factual, absolute tense, 
			unmarked for time.</p>

					<td>
					<img alt="perfectaspect" height="166" src="../../images/rain_window250.jpg" width="250" /></td>

					<span class="style_black"><em>It has rained</em></span><em><br class="style_black" />
					</em><span class="style_black"><em>It has been raining</em></span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The clue to a major use of the present perfect lies in its name: 
			it is the <span class="style_underline"> <strong>present</strong></span> perfect.<br />
			If we want to refer to <strong>a present state of affairs or action
			in relation to the past</strong>, this form will do it 
			for us.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style25">
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style23">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style23">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style23">Aspect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style26">I want to say that a current <strong>event </strong>
					is also a previous
					<strong>event</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style21"><span class="style_black"><em>It has 
					rained all day</em></span><br />
					and is still raining</td>
					<td class="auto-style21" rowspan="4">perfect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style26">I want to say that a change to the 
					present <strong>event </strong>is the result of a recent 
					finished past <strong>
					event</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style21"><span class="style_black"><em>He has 
					finally arrived</em></span><br />
					so now we can get on</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style26">I want to say that a present
					<strong>state </strong>is the result of past <strong>
					event</strong> (recent or not)</td>
					<td class="auto-style21"><span class="style_black"><em>I have 
					learned French.</em></span><br />
					so now I can speak it</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style26">I want to say that a present<strong>

					<td class="auto-style21"><span class="style_black"><em>I have 
					owned the house for some time</em></span><br />
					and still do</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We can combine the perfect aspect with a continuous, progressive, 
			iterative, habitual, durative or prospective aspect and for these 
			purposes, we choose a different form.&nbsp; <strong>All</strong> the following retain the sense of the perfect 
			aspect, i.e., the relation of the present to the past but have an
			<strong>additional</strong> aspect grafted on to them.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style25">
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style23">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style23">Form of choice</td>

					<span class="style_blue">and I still feel rough</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">continuous<br />
					durative</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style26">I want to say that a current ongoing

			<p>Speakers will often choose prepositional phrases 
			(circumstances, if you prefer) to reinforce the meaning of what they 
			say <strong>from their point of view</strong>.<br />
			There is 
			<a href="../present_perfect.html" target="_blank" class="highlightlink">a guide to the present 
			perfect</a> (new tab) on this site.</p>

		<h3>Telicity and perfective, not perfect, use</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>The term telicity refers to whether an event is seen to have an 
			end point or not.&nbsp; In the first case, the use is telic as in, 
			e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John has broken his leg</em><br />
			In the second case, the use is atelic as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John has been in hospital for a week</em><br />
			One important point about the present perfect is that it can 
			refer to an imperfective or perfective use of the verb.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have returned</em><br />
			is perfective, insofar as the returning is complete.&nbsp; Another 
			way to say this is that the verb use is telic, with a perceived end 
			point.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have worked here for ten years</em><br />
			is imperfective because the implication is that I will go on working 
			here.&nbsp; Another way to say that is that the verb use is atelic, 
			having no end point in sight.</p>
			<p>Telicity is sometimes cited as the reason why some verbs resist 
			the use of the present perfect altogether.&nbsp; These verbs are 
			often, perhaps not coincidentally, those which also occur almost 
			solely in the active voice although they all take a direct object.&nbsp; 
			For example:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>possession</strong></dt>
				<dd>is often seen as atelic and active only so, while we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary has three houses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary possesses three houses</em><br />
				we cannot have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Three houses are had by Mary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Three houses are possessed by Mary</em><br />
				This use of the verbs also resists the present perfect so, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Mary has had three houses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Mary has possessed three houses</em><br />
				are unusual.</dd>
				<dt><strong>matching and fitting</strong></dt>
				<dd>are two areas where verbs are usually active voice only so 
				we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That tie matches your shirt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coat fits me well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bag goes well with my shoes</em><br />
				we do not encounter:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Your shirt is matched by that tie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I am fitted well by the coat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *My shoes are gone with by the bag</em><br />
				And, again, the present perfect is rare with these verbs because 
				they are atelic:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?That tie has matched your shirt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The coat has fitted me well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The bag has gone well with my shoes</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>resembling</strong></dt>
				<dd>is a further atelic concept so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She resembles her father in that respect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looks like his brother</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He takes after his grandfather</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Her father is resembled by her in that 
				respect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *His brother is looked like by him</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *His grandfather is taken after by him</em><br />
				and the use of the present perfect is also rare:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?She has resembled her father in that 
				respect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?He has looked like his brother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?He has taken after his grandfather</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The fact that there is a consistent pattern concerning verbs 
			which resist the passive as well as the present perfect has led some 
			to consider the passive voice as an aspect of the verb rather than 
			the usual analysis concerning voice and the relationships between 
			subjects, objects, agents and patients and verbs.</p>
			<p>The atelic nature of an action or event is often strongly 
			signalled by the use of the progressive aspect combined with the 
			perfect.&nbsp; For example, the distinction between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been studying the language for over 
			20 years<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has studied the language for over 20 
			years<br />
			</em>is quite subtle but the sense of the first is that the studying 
			is atelic.&nbsp; The second form could naturally be followed by 
			something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and now she's moving on to a different area<br />
			</em>but that is less likely with the first example.<br />
			Additionally, the progressive form also signals the durative nature 
			of the action so in the first the implication is that her studying 
			has been both long-lasting and quite intensive but in the second, no 
			such implication is carried.</p>
			<p>The progressive form is also used to signal iterative aspects of 
			the verb so we get, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone has been stealing vegetables from my 
			allotment<br />
			</em>which signals that the action has been repeated and is 
			continuing (iterative and atelic) but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone has stolen vegetables from my 
			allotment<br />
			</em>signals that the event was not repeated and is perfective and 
			telic.</p>
			<p>The key to understanding this is a semantic issue to do with 
			whether a verb is punctual (for example, <em>hit, bang, knock, break</em> 
			etc.) or durative (for example, <em>live, read, work, enjoy</em> 
			etc.).<br />
			When the verb is punctual in nature, the use of a progressive form 
			signals a repeated event, when it is durative, it signals a 
			continuous state as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been knocking on his door for hours</em> 
			(repeated or iterative sense)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been reading the paper for hours</em> 
			(durative, long-lasting sense)<br />
			There is more on this below.</p>
			<p>The guide linked above has more on the present 
			perfect simple and progressive.</p>

			<p>The progressive aspect is not the same as the continuous.&nbsp; We 
			can assert that something is ongoing, i.e., in progress, in three 
			ways:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style25">
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style23">The meaning I want to convey</td>

					<span class="style_blue">right now</span></td>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Simple forms, with certain types of verbal processes, especially 
			mental processes such as <em>enjoy, appreciate, love, understand</em> 
			and verbal processes such as <em>say, aver, assert, describe, </em>
			are often continuous in aspect but the tense choice is simple.&nbsp; 
			This is the effect of stative and dynamic use and is <strong>not</strong> 
			parallelled in many languages.&nbsp; Examples include:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <strong>appreciates</strong> your hospitality<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I <strong>understand</strong> the main points you are making<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			John <strong>says</strong> he isn't feeling well<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I <strong>describe</strong> it as deeply foolish</em></p>
			<p>In all these cases, incidentally, the simple form of the verb, in
			<strong>bold</strong>, is 
			used although the verb is atelic, have no explicitly stated end 
			point.&nbsp; This is slightly unusual because telicity is routinely 
			signalled by aspect in English with, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am living in London</em><br />
			which is atelic with no stated end point.<br />
			The unusual factor is that in the present tense, we can also express 
			an unfinished (atelic) event with the simple aspect:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in London.</em><br />
			This is not possible in the past because:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was living in London</em><br />
			is atelic with no end point but:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived in London</em><br />
			implies the event is concluded and is a telic use.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="continuous" height="166" src="../../images/continuous250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" rowspan="2">
					<h2>Continuous aspect in the present</h2>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style4">
					<span class="style_black"><em>I don't understand it<br />
					I am not following you</em></span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>As with the progressive aspect, the continuous is expressed 
			through both the simple and more complex verb forms.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style25">
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style23">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style23">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style23">Aspect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style26" rowspan="2">I want to say that a <strong>state</strong> 
					currently exists</td>
					<td class="auto-style27"><em>I feel terrible</em><br />
					<span class="style_blue">right now</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style27" rowspan="4">
					<span class="style_blue">
					continuous</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style27"><em>I'm feeling better<br />
					</em><span class="style_blue">right now</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style26" rowspan="2">I want to say that a <strong>state 
					of mind</strong> currently exists</td>
					<td class="auto-style27"><em>I think that's astonishing</em><br />
					<span class="style_blue">but this cannot be a 
					permanent condition</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style27"><em>I'm looking forward to meeting 
					you</em><br />
					<span class="style_blue">but this cannot be a 
					permanent condition</span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Here, too, the distinction between stative and dynamic verb
			<span class="style_underline">use</span> is apparent but in some circumstances, 
			for example with the verb <em>feel</em>, they are interchangeable with little or no 
			change in meaning.&nbsp; When <em>feel</em> is used in the sense of
			<em>believe</em>, it is timeless, usually, so we can have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that's mistaken</em><br />
			but not:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; *I am feeling that's mistaken.</em><br />
			(For more on verbs encoding mental or verbal processes which are 
			used in the simple form when they are statements of timeless fact 
			and in the progressive form when they refer to ongoing mental 
			processes, see 
			<a href="always_time.html" target="_blank" class="highlightlink">the guide to talking about 
			always</a>.&nbsp; In that guide the short list of examples is: <em>

			<p>In all these cases, the verb is imperfective or atelic because no

			A sub category of the durative, for which some languages have a

			<p>Note the distinction here with verb meaning:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who's banging the drum?<br />

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who's playing the bagpipes?<br />
			</em>is durative because the verb implies a long action.<br />
			The distinction between durative and iterative aspects in English

				</table>
			<p>As we explained in the general introduction to time, tense and 
			aspect, English, unlike some languages, does not formally 
			distinguish between three aspects, progressive, durative and 
			iterative, by changing the verb form.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children are playing truant too often<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children are playing in the garden</em><br />
			use the same form of the verb and the auxiliary but are clearly 
			different conceptually because the first refers to a repeated event 
			and the second to a progressive or durative event.<br />
			The key to understanding this is to look at meaning not structure.&nbsp; 
			In other words, it is a semantic issue not a grammatical one.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Durative verbs<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="tennis" height="133" src="../../images/sport_tennis_woman200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Some verbs are durative and they include verbs such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>continue, play, read, rain, walk, wear, work</em> etc.<br />
			which all contain within their meaning an idea that the action they 
			describe may be long lasting.<br />
			When these verbs are used with no counteracting adverbials in the 
			progressive form, the sense is durative.&nbsp; So for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is playing tennis<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was reading a book on the train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's raining again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's on holiday, walking in the Lake District<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are you wearing a suit?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are they working today?</em><br />
			etc. all refer to a progressive event.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Punctual verbs<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="shoot" height="133" src="../../images/broken_window200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Some verbs are, however, somewhat rarer and describe a punctual or 
			momentary event so their meaning resists any idea of a durative 
			aspect.&nbsp; Such verbs include:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arrive, bang, break, explode, hit, knock, 
				shoot, stop, tap</em> 
				etc.<br />
			and when they are used in the progressive form, they do not suggest 
			a progressive action rather than a repeated or iterative aspect so, 
			for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guests are arriving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is banging a drum<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fireworks are exploding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is hitting the nail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am knocking on the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are stopping the traffic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is someone tapping on the window?</em><br />
			etc. all refer not to a progressive but to an iterative event.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Some verbs can be used in both senses of course so we can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am taking the train to work these days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is taking the train to work today</em><br />
			both refer to the same action but the first is iterative and the 
			second is progressive (and possibly prospective).<br />
			Not distinguishing the meaning in the classroom leads almost 
			inevitably to errors.&nbsp; The errors are sometimes covert because 
			if a learner says, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am taking the train</em><br />
			it may not be clear whether a progressive sense or an iterative 
			sense is intended.</p>

			<p>You may be slightly surprised to find what are often contrasted 
			as two future forms in the section on talking about the present.&nbsp; 
			However, seen from an understanding of prospective aspect, it makes 
			good sense.<br />
			Just as the perfect aspect (above) highlights the nature of a 
			present state of affairs or action in relation to the past, so the 
			prospective aspect highlights <strong>the relationship between a 
			current situation and the future</strong>.<br />
			Both the obviously present forms that we use to talk about the 
			future in that analysis are better understood as being rooted firmly 
			in the present.</p>

			</table>
			<p>The traditional analysis of these two forms as future indicators 
			is not without merit but their use for the future can only be 
			understood from <strong>previous or current</strong> events or states.<br />
			The distinction between an intention with <em>going to</em> and an 
			arrangement (with the <em>-ing</em> form), if it is sustainable at 
			all, can only be discovered by reference to actions or states at a 
			time before the future.</p>
			<p>It is sometimes said, with reason, that when discussing plans and 
			arrangements we use the present progressive form and when we refer 
			to 
			intentions we use the <em>going to</em> structure.&nbsp; However, the 
			forms are, in fact much more fluid than the simple dichotomy 
			suggests.&nbsp; Functionally, there is little distinction between 
			the meanings of the forms, so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's taking a holiday next week<br />
			</em>carries the same meaning as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to take a holiday next week<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to see my mother on Monday<br />
			</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm seeing my mother on Sunday<br />
			</em>are also virtually indistinguishable.</p>
			<p>There are times, however, when the forms are not interchangeable 
			or when ambiguity needs to be avoided.&nbsp; In many of the cases 
			below, the present progressive form is not allowed but an 
			alternative to <em>going to </em>exists in the form of the <em>will</em> 
			future.<br />
			(The following is also covered in the guide to talking about the 
			future for obvious reasons but there the use of the present 
			progressive is contrasted with both the <em>going to</em> and <em>will</em> 
			futures.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Semantic disqualification</strong><br />
				<img alt="red card" height="133" src="../../images/sign_red_card200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				With some verbs, arrangement is semantically possible.&nbsp; For 
				example, we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm turning up at my mother's party on 
				Sunday</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to turn up at my mother's 
				party on Sunday</em><br />
				with little difference, if any, in meaning.<br />
				But, if the meaning of the verb specifically excludes any 
				possibility of an agreed arrangement then the progressive form 
				is not possible so we can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to surprise my mother by 
				turning up at her party on Sunday</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I am surprising my mother by turning up 
				at her party on Sunday<br />
				</em>because, semantically, you cannot arrange to be <em>surprised, 
				astonished, excited, disappointed, flabbergasted, bewildered</em> etc.&nbsp; 
				All these sorts of verbs are disqualified from appearing with 
				the <em>be + -ing</em> form, therefore.<br />
				They can all be used, quite naturally with the <em>will </em>
				future<em>.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Avoiding ambiguity</strong><br />
				<img alt="alternative meanings" height="133" src="../../images/alternatives200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The progressive form, in order to avoid ambiguity, usually needs 
				to be accompanied by a time adverbial unless the context makes 
				the future nature of the current plan clear.&nbsp; So, for 
				example, we can have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to drive to London</em><br />
				without context and the future sense is still clear.<br />
				However,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to London</em><br />
				without any context is ambiguous and could mean:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to London as we speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm planning / have arranged to drive to London</em><br />
				or even<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my current, temporary habit to drive to London</em> 
				(rather than use an alternative form of transport).<br />
				If the context does not clarify the situation,
				we need to insert a time adverbial to disambiguate what we are 
				saying so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to London in the morning</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to London soon</em><br />
				are not ambiguous even without context because of the 
				prepositional phrase adverbial or the adverb respectively.<br />
				We do not need to insert a time adverbial when the context has 
				already provided the temporal information so:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Can you come in early tomorrow?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: Sorry.&nbsp; I'm taking the kids to school<br />
				</em>is coherent.</li>
				<li><strong>Stative vs. Dynamic verb uses</strong><br />
				<img alt="dynamic" height="133" src="../../images/dynamic_water200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The <em>going to</em> formulation can be used with verbs used statively 
				so we allow, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to be angry when he gets the 
				news<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's going to look wonderful at tonight's party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are going to seem out of place in that company</em><br />
				we do not allow the progressive forms:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is being angry when he gets the news<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She's looking wonderful at tonight's party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They are seeming out of place in that company</em><br />
				if the reference is to the future.<br />
				Both forms can be used with verbs used dynamically, only <em>
				going to</em> is used statively.</li>
				<li><strong>Inanimate subjects</strong><br />
				<img alt="ladder" height="133" src="../../images/ladder200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				We do not ascribe the ability to plan or form arrangements to 
				inanimate objects so we allow, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out!&nbsp; The ladder's going to slip in a minute</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out!&nbsp; *The ladder's slipping in 
				a minute.</em><br />
				This distinction is most noticeable when we are talking about 
				the weather.&nbsp; Because it is inanimate, the weather is 
				spoken about as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to rain tomorrow</em><br />
				but not as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's raining tomorrow.<br />
				</em>This distinction is sometimes confused with the idea that 
				the progressive form for the concept needs to refer to a 
				personal arrangement.&nbsp; That is a defensible point of view 
				but focuses through the wrong end of the telescope.&nbsp; It is 
				the nature of participants (in this case the subject) which 
				determines the appropriate form to use.</li>
				<li><strong>Present evidence</strong><br />
				<img alt="angry" height="133" src="../../images/woman_angry_smoke200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Only <em>going to</em> can be used to refer to present evidence 
				leading to a future event.&nbsp; So we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's making her angry.&nbsp; She's going 
				to lose her temper soon<br />
				</em>but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's making her angry.&nbsp; *She's losing 
				her temper soon</em><br />
				Again, the present evidence rule applies when talking 
				about inanimate objects such as the weather when present 
				evidence is important so we get, for example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; Look at the clouds.&nbsp; It's going to rain soon</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the clouds.&nbsp; *It's raining 
				soon.<br />
				</em>In both these cases, the
				<em>will</em> future is an acceptable alternative to
				<em>going to.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Past experience</strong><br />
				<img alt="smile" height="133" src="../../images/man_smile200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Prospective events based on past experience are also only 
				realised through <em>going to</em> or <em>will</em>.&nbsp; For example, we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When your father hears, he's going to 
				laugh</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When your father hears, he'll laugh</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *When your father hears, he's laughing</em><br />
				even though the future reference is clear.<br />
				Again, past experience of weather conditions often makes the 
				form suitable for that, too.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to snow a lot in Canada in 
				January</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll snow a lot in Canada in January</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It is snowing a lot in Canada in January.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Conditional and contingent clauses</strong><br />
				<img alt="train snow" height="133" src="../../images/train_snow200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is another semantic (or pragmatic) issue.&nbsp; For example, 
				we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the trains aren't running, I'm going 
				to drive</em><br />
				and it is a conditional expressing the fact that the speaker 
				does not yet know if the trains will be running.&nbsp; However,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the trains aren't running, I'm driving</em><br />
				does not have the same sense because it implies that the speaker 
				already knows the trains are not running so has formed a plan or 
				arrangement to drive.&nbsp; It could be realised as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>As the trains aren't running, I'm driving.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Modal auxiliary verbs</strong><br />
				<img alt="help" height="133" src="../../images/helping_up200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Because most modal auxiliary verbs are defective in English and do not 
				exhibit the full range of forms that lexical or main verbs do, there are 
				severe limitations on the ways they can be used with either the
				<em>going to</em> or the <em>be + -ing</em> structure.<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li><strong>Deontic modality </strong>refers to duty or 
					obligation and we allow, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to have to talk to her</em><br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am having to work long hours</em><br />
					but the second of these refers to present rather than future 
					obligation and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; ?I am having to attend a meeting tomorrow</em><br />
					is at best questionable.<br />
					Other expressions of this form of modality are 
					rendered in the present with modal auxiliary verbs such as
					<em>should</em> and <em>ought to</em>.<br />
					There are no equivalent forms using either of these 
					structures so, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;*He is going to ought to tell her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The are shoulding do it</em><br />
					are not available.<br />
					Other languages allow future forms of equivalent modal 
					auxiliary verbs and 
					learners may be surprised to find that English does not.&nbsp; 
					In fact, these deontic modal auxiliary verbs are used 
					interchangeably in English to refer to present and future 
					obligation as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should smoke less<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should talk to him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ought to be better at this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ought to tell her</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li><strong>Epistemic modality</strong> refers to 
					possibility and likelihood and are again not expressed with 
					these two structures so, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is going to ought to be there by 
					now</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She is shoulding be there soon</em><br />
					are not possible.<br />
					Again, both these future meanings are expressed using the 
					same form for present and future time as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She should be here before six 
					tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They ought to arrive soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It ought to work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be possible now</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li><strong>Alethic modality</strong> refers to the general 
					truth of a proposition independent of other factors and is usually timeless so present 
					forms are used and we cannot have, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A square is going to have to have 
					four sides</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A square is having to have four 
					sides.</em></li>
					<li><strong>Dynamic modality</strong> refers to the 
					individual's capabilities, as in, e.g.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see the point</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					The <em>going to</em> formulation is available for some 
					forms of dynamic modality to refer to a present ability 
					realised in the future so we allow, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is going to be able to help</em>
					<em>later</em><br />
					but we do not allow, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He is being able to help later</em><br />
					so the <em>be + -ing</em> form is not available to refer to 
					current ability realised in the future.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Arrangements</strong><br />
				<img alt="restaurant" height="133" src="../../images/restaurant_exterior200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is a marginal difference and more a tendency than a rule.&nbsp; 
				By their nature, arrangements are made between people but 
				intentions can be formed individually and only later 
				communicated to others.&nbsp; Most English speakers will prefer, 
				therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us are meeting at the restaurant 
				in the square tomorrow</em><br />
				to<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us are going to meet at the restaurant in the 
				square tomorrow</em><br />
				although both are possible with little effect on meaning.<br />
				However, in an exchange such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Are you writing to the boss about 
				this?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: No.&nbsp; I'm going to talk to her face to face.</em><br />
				then the second speaker has only now communicated a pre-formed 
				intention.&nbsp; If the second speaker had said:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; B: No.&nbsp; I'm meeting her face to face.</em><br />
				then the meaning is that the speaker and the boss have reached 
				an agreement to meet.<br />
				It is sometimes averred, by some who should know better, that 
				the <em>be</em> + -<em>ing</em> form implies an arrangement 
				between people.&nbsp; It does, sometimes, but it is perfectly 
				possible to use the form with the sense of only one person's 
				intention.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm giving John a lift to Margate 
				tomorrow</em><br />
				does imply an arrangement between the speaker and John which, 
				note, has already been made but:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm driving to Margate tomorrow</em><br />
				implies no arrangement with anyone else at all.</li>
				<li><strong>Person</strong><br />
				<img alt="people" height="133" src="../../images/people200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				In particular, when the subject of the verb is first-person 
				plural an arrangement will be assumed, whichever form is used 
				so, functionally:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are meeting in the station</em><br />
				and<br />

			<p>There is a simple and alternative way to look at the <em>going to</em> 
			structure.<br />
			The <em>to-</em>infinitive in English often betokens some sort of 
			prospective aspect as we see in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to visit Margate next week<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I intend to take the train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean to stay a night or two<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to see you when I'm there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope to visit the new museum<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I aim to come back next Thursday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I plan to see my brother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect to find him at home</em><br />
			and so on.&nbsp; In all these cases, the first verb denotes a state 
			which precedes the action or event denoted by the second verb in the
			<em>to-</em>infinitive form.&nbsp; In other words, the <em>to-</em>infinitive 
			signals a prospective event when verbs catenate.<br />
			We can, if we get away from calling it the <em>going to</em> 
			structure, view the verb <em>go</em> in the same way.&nbsp; The only 
			difference then is that the verb is conventionally used in the 
			progressive form.<br />
			Even in this case, most of the verbs in our example apart, arguably, 
			from <em>want, mean </em>and <em>expect</em>, can also be used 
			progressively as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm planning to see my brother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm aiming to come back next Thursday</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			The verb phrase <em>would like</em>, of course, cannot be used 
			progressively because modal auxiliary verbs are always finite and 
			have no infinitive or participle forms.<br />
			This analysis is not universally accepted and course books and 
			grammars for learners are firmly wedded to calling the <em>going to</em> 
			structure a future form.&nbsp; It isn't really; it's the verb <em>go</em> 
			followed by a <em>to-</em>infinitive.</p>

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Prospective aspect triggered by past events</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>It is possible that the event or state which triggers the 
			future may even be in the past, omitting any reference to the 
			present altogether as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talked it over and we're going to emigrate.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			We had a long chat and are moving in together.<br />
			</em>which are both examples of a perfective past simple resulting 
			in a current prospective event.<br />The prospective present can also be combined with the perfect 
			as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been agreed that I am driving / going to drive.<br />
			</em>In the last case, we have a perfective action (completed) couched 
			in perfect form and followed by a prospective aspect in a present 
			tense (and either form is acceptable).</p>
