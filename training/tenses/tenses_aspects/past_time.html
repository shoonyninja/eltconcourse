			<h1>Talking about past time</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="past" height="207" src="../../images/history_knight310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>English uses a number of strategies to apply aspect to past time.&nbsp; 
			The form we use depends on the aspect we perceive.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="rain" height="166" src="../../images/ripples250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" rowspan="2">
					<h2>Simple aspect in the past</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style4">
					<span class="style_black"><em>It rained last night</em></span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The simple aspect signals an absolute verb tense which is 
			independent of any other event.&nbsp; It is the finite form of the 
			verb standing alone to signify two things:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style14">
				<li>The event is in the past (and we may or may not include a 
				time reference)</li>
				<li>The event is finished and may have no current relevance</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is because the form is an absolute tense form, that we use 
			time markers such as <em>yesterday, last month, in 1922, before the 
			war, at six o'clock</em> etc. which all refer to times which are 
			fixed and do not depend for their understanding on other times.<br />
			We cannot, for this reason, combine this tense form with markers 
			such as <em>just, already, yet, recently</em> etc. which all imply a 
			time relative to that of speaking.<br />
			In BrE, therefore, we do not usually hear:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she just leave?</em><br />
			but that is a common use in AmE.<br />
			British English speakers would generally select a present perfect 
			form for this message to embed the act of leaving in the changed 
			present circumstances which the act has altered.</p>
			<p>This aspect is also selected when durative verbs are used to 
			express a continuous aspect.&nbsp; We may get, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lived in London at the time</em><br />
			rather than<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was living in London at the time</em><br />
			because the continuous sense is included in the meaning of the verb.<br />
			We also find this with verbs that imply a temporary state such as 
			in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed with friends during the conference</em><br />
			rather than<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was staying with friends during the 
			conference</em><br />
			which carries the same meaning.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="perfectaspect" height="166" src="../../images/rain_window250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" rowspan="2">
					<h2>Perfect aspect in the past</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style4">
					<span class="style_black"><em>It had rained</em></span><em><br class="style_black" />
					</em><span class="style_black"><em>It had been raining</em></span></td>

			</table>
			<p>The <strong>present</strong> perfect, often taught as a form of past tense is considered in the guide to present forms because, as the name 
			suggests, it is better considered a present tense which highlights 
			the relationship of the present to the past rather than a reference to past time 
			itself.<br />
			Here, we are concerned with the <strong>past</strong> perfect which really <em>is</em> 
			a past tense form.<br />
			If we want to refer to a past state of affairs or action <strong>in 
			relation to the <span class="style_underline">previous</span> past</strong>, 
			this form will do it for us.&nbsp; Again, the form can be described 
			as <strong>relational</strong> rather than referring to <strong>
			absolute</strong> time.&nbsp; The traditional way to explain this to 
			learners is to say that the past perfect refers to the past before 
			the past and that will usually do although the sense is actually of 
			a past <strong>embedded</strong> in the past.<br />
			To make this clear, we can embed the past in the present with 
			something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been to the bank so she has money 
			with her</em><br />
			in which the going to the bank is embedded in the present effect and 
			the action of going to the bank has altered the present.<br />
			Equally,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had been to the bank so she had money 
			with her</em><br />
			performs the same function of embedding a previous action in the 
			then current state of affairs which the previous action has altered 
			in some way.</p>
			<p>Here's is how the form is used to convey meaning:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Aspect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous
					past
					<strong>event</strong> continued as a past <strong>event</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>It had 
					rained all day.</em></span><br />
					and then it was still raining</td>
					<td class="auto-style7" rowspan="3">perfect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous
					<strong>finished past event</strong> resulted in a change to 
					the past <strong>event</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>He had 
					finally arrived.</em></span><br />
					so then we could get on</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous past
					<strong>event</strong> (recent or not) resulted in a past
					<strong>state</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>I had 
					spent all my money.</em></span><br />
					so then I was broke</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We can combine the perfect aspect with a continuous, progressive, 
			iterative, habitual, durative or even prospective aspect and for 
			this purpose, we will choose a different form.&nbsp; <strong>All</strong> the following retain the sense of the perfect 
			aspect, i.e., the relation of the past to a previous past, setting a 
			past within the past, but have 
			an <strong>additional</strong> aspect grafted on to them.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Aspect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a current past <strong>state</strong> 
					was a previous past
					<strong>state</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em class="auto-style10">I had been 
					feeling rough for a while</em><br />
<span class="style_blue">and I still felt rough</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style7">continuous</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous 
					ongoing <strong>action</strong> was still occurring</td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I had been walking quickly for 
					hours<br />
					</em><span class="style_blue">and was still walking 
					quickly</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style7">progressive</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous past 
					series of <strong>events</strong> was still a past series 
					of <strong>events</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>It had 
					been raining on and off all day.</em></span><br />
					and was still raining on and off</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">iterative</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous
					<strong>routine</strong> continued to be a <strong>routine</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>I had 
					been taking the 4 o'clock bus for years</em></span><br />
					and it was still my habit to do this</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">habitual</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a past, 
					long-lasting <strong>action</strong> continued to be a past 
					long-lasting <strong>action</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>I had 
					been thinking about it for a while.</em></span><br />
					and continued to do so</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">durative</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that a previous past
					<strong>event or state</strong> affected a future <strong>
					event or state</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><span class="style_black"><em>I had 
					been meaning to talk to you for a while</em></span><br />
					and would do so very soon<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>The river had been rising all 
					night</em></span><br />
					and would soon flood the streets<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em>We had decided that I was 
					going to drive / would drive</em></span><br />
					a form of future in the past, in fact</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">prospective</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Speakers will often choose prepositional phrases 
			(circumstances, if you prefer) to reinforce the meaning of what they 
			say <strong>from the point of view of the relationship between past 
			events</strong>.&nbsp; This is often, in the past perfect aspect, a 
			matter of causality.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I couldn't get in because I had left my keys at work</em><br />
			The other element to note is the use of <em>would</em> as a true 
			past form of <em>will</em>. in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had left my keys at work so knew I wouldn't be able to 
			get in.</em></p>
			<p>The progressive aspect has another implication: telicity.<br />
			In, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had read the book</em><br />
			the implication is that the book was finished so the verb is telic 
			(i.e., having a perceived end point), but in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been reading the book</em><br />
			the implication is that the book was unfinished and the verb is 
			atelic (i.e., having no perceived end point).<br />
			Here, too prepositional phrases are often involved in signalling 
			telicity, so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had read the book in an afternoon</em><br />
			is telic, with a prepositional phrase which expresses a time span, 
			but:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I had been reading the book in an afternoon</em><br />
			is not possible because the prepositional phrase implies a time span 
			rather than a frame.<br />
			We can have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been reading the book for an afternoon</em><br />
			because <em>for an afternoon</em> refers to a time frame and the 
			verb is atelic, with no end point suggested.</p>

			<a href="../past_perfect.html" target="_blank" class="highlightlink">more on the past 
			perfect simple and progressive</a>.</p>

			<p>The progressive aspect is not the same as the continuous.&nbsp; We 
			can assert that something was ongoing, i.e., in progress, in two 
			ways:</p>

				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Aspect</td>

					<td class="auto-style6">I want to say that an <strong>action</strong>

<span class="style_blue">right then</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style9"><span class="style_blue">
					progressive (all three)</span></td>

			</table>
			<p>Simple forms, with certain types of verbal processes, especially 
			mental processes such as <em>enjoy, appreciate, love, understand</em> 
			and verbal processes such as <em>say, aver, assert, describe, </em>
			are often progressive in aspect but the tense choice is simple.&nbsp; 
			This is the effect of stative and dynamic use and is <strong>not</strong> 
			parallelled in many languages.</p>
			<p>Again, as we saw above, the progressive aspect implies an atelic 
			use of the verb because it signals <strong><em>in</em></strong>completion.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					I was not following the argument</em></span></td>

			</table>
			<p>As with the progressive aspect, the continuous is expressed 
			through both the simple and complex tense forms.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">
				<tr class="auto-style11">
					<td class="auto-style6">The meaning I want to convey</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Aspect</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6" rowspan="2">I want to say that a

					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I felt terrible</em><br />
<span class="style_blue">right then</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style9" rowspan="4">
					<span class="style_blue">
					continuous</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I was feeling better<br />

					<td class="auto-style9"><em>I was looking forward to meeting 
					him</em><br />
					<span class="style_blue">but this cannot be a 
					permanent condition</span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Here, too, the distinction between stative and dynamic verb
			<span class="style_underline">use</span> is apparent but in many circumstances, they are interchangeable with little or no 
			change in meaning.&nbsp; It is the verb's meaning that determines 
			the form, not <em>vice versa</em>.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was feeling better</em><br />
			with<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt the softness of the fur</em></p>

			<p>English happens to distinguish between the habitual (which is not

			For example:</p>

				</table>
			<p>The first of these could be described as progressive but the 
			speaker might not have been in the hotel at the time concerned (so 
			it wasn't an action in progress).&nbsp; It is better described as a 
			continuous aspect.<br />
			It is often stated in grammars for students that <em>would</em> can express the durative <strong>but only 
			for actions</strong>.&nbsp; We cannot have, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I would have 
			a house in London.<br />
			</em>instead of<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to have a house in London.<br />
			</em>That's reasonable classroom rule but 
			the verb can be used for some states with copular verbs which convey 
			the relationship between subject and complement like <em>be, 
			appear, seem, remain </em>etc. in, e.g.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would sometimes be a difficult person to talk to<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He would often appear uninterested<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I would remain in the house<br />
			</em>Frequently, we insert time adverbials in these formulations but 
			they usually apply only to indefinite frequency.</p>
			<p>The distinction lies in the temporary, iterated or permanent 
			nature of the event.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>temporary</strong> states</dt>
				<dd>can be referred to either with <em>would</em> or <em>used to</em> 
				as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She used to be irritable if we asked too many questions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would appear impatient when the children were slow in 
				learning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would be happy to deliver the post daily</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>repeated</strong> states</dt>
				<dd>can also be referred to with the same two forms as in, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would often be a bit difficult to 
				talk to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She used often to be found sitting in the garden in the 
				summer</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>permanent</strong> states</dt>
				<dd>can only be referred to with <em>used to</em> as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She used to be so slim and attractive</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She would be so slim and attractive</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used to live in London</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We would live in London</em><br />
				unless the living is clearly made temporary as in<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we visited Europe we would live / 
				stay in 
				London</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The issue, of course, is that the terms temporary and permanent 
			may be variously interpreted.&nbsp; So for example, many will 
			consider that:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would always be the first person the 
			children ran to in trouble</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;She would invariably be attractive and well dressed</em><br />
			refer to permanent conditions because of the adverbs (<em>always</em> 
			and <em>invariably</em>).&nbsp; If they 
			do, the rule is broken but the usual understanding in these cases is 
			that both adverbs refer to temporary, if quite long lasting, 
			conditions.<br />
			Another way of understanding this is to look at the kind of 
			adjective which is used to describe the subject.&nbsp; If the 
			adjective describes an inherent quality of the subject, <em>would</em> 
			is disallowed so we cannot have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would be fat</em><br />
			However, if the state is either non-inherent or under the control of 
			the subject we do allow the use of <em>would</em> as in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would be impatient</em></p>

			<p>It is worth noting the distinction here with verb meaning:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Who was banging the drum?<br />
			</em>is iterative (i.e., repeated) because the verb implies a short, 
			sharp action and can be described as a punctual verb but<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Who was playing the bagpipes?<br />
			</em>is durative because the verb implies a long action.<br />
			Verbs such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>play, read, rain, , walk, wear, work</em> etc.<br />
			all contain within their meaning an idea that the action they 
			describe may be long lasting.<br />
			Other verbs, such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arrive, bang, explode, hit, knock, stop, tap</em> 
			etc.<br />
			do not usually allow the sense of a long-lasting event so using 
			these in the progressive form implies a repeated (i.e., iterative 
			aspect) not a durative (i.e., progressive aspect).<br />

			<p>There are few learners of English above A1 level who have not 
			encountered a sentence like:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was having a shower when the doorbell rang</em><br />
			and the usual teacher explanation is something like:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>Well, having a shower is the 
			longer of the two actions and the doorbell rang is the short action.&nbsp; 
			It's called the interrupted past.</em></span></p>
			<p>By the same token, a sentence such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The children were playing in the park while the parents 
			were gossiping</em><br />
			is often explained as:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em>Well, here we have two long 
			actions connected by either </em><span class="auto-style13">when</span><em> or </em>
			<span class="auto-style13">while</span><em>.&nbsp; Both actions are long and happening at the same time.</em></span></p>
			<p>The explanations account for the example sentences, for which they 
			were designed, of course, but both are 
			careless and misleading because neither can explain:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John read a book when I was gardening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary gardened while John read a book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children played while the parents gossiped</em></p>
			<p>The key is to get right away from talking about longer and 
			shorter actions and consider instead</p>
			<ol class="auto-style12">
				<li>how the speaker perceives the 
			nature of the events and here, too, the concepts of telic and atelic 
			clauses is useful</li>
				<li>the meanings of the 
			verbs which are used.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To explain:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John read a book when I was gardening<br />
				</em>depends on the meaning of 
			<em>read.</em>&nbsp; The verb is 
			clearly not one which describes a sudden or immediately completed 
			action but by its nature requires some time.&nbsp; Additionally, the 
			inclusion of the object <em>book</em>, adds to the sense of a long 
			action.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John read the note when I was gardening<br />
				</em>in which the telic nature of the action is clear because 
				<em>reading a note</em> is a short, finished action but 
			<em>reading a 
			book</em> is atelic and does not imply that John finished the book 
			(but may imply that he stopped reading at some point).</li>
				<li>In:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<em>Mary gardened while John read a book<br /></em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children played while the parents gossiped<br />
				</em>the speaker is referring to telic events which have a clear end 
			point.&nbsp; Such a sentence does not imply that either action is 
			unfinished or ongoing.&nbsp; Both actions may have taken some time 
			and therefore qualify as 'long' but the key is that the speaker 
			perceives them as telic, finished, over, done and dusted.</li>
				<li>Semantically, too, all the verbs, 
			<em>garden, read, play, gossip</em>, 
			imply non-immediate, non-sudden events.&nbsp; Compare, for example:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain started while the children played<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightning flashed while the rain fell in torrents<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightning flickered while the thunder was rumbling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bomb exploded while the Prime Minister was speaking</em><br />in which the semantic nature of the verbs,
				<em>start, flash, flicker, 
			explode,</em> allows the simple form however long the action takes 
			but the verbs <em>play, fall, rumble, speak</em> allow either form 
			depending on the speakers' view of telicity.</li>
				<li>Telicity also helps to explain the difference between:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary had a good idea while she was travelling to work</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary had a terrible accident while she was travelling to 
			work</em><br />
			In the first example only the first verb is telic because having the 
			idea is finished (she may even have forgotten what it was).&nbsp; 
			The travelling, however, is atelic because it continued for an 
			unspecified time after the event of having the idea.<br />
			In the second example the events are seen as telic and neither the 
			accident nor the travelling was unfinished.<br />
			The addition of the adjective <em>terrible</em> confirms the fact 
			that she did not continue her journey so semantics plays a role 
			here, too.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary had a minor accident while she was 
			travelling to work</em><br />
			which implies that the travelling probably continued, and is atelic 
			in the speaker's mind.</li>

			<p>The distinction here is with verb meaning:<br />

			The habitual refers to actions.<br />

			<p>See the comment under durative aspect above on the use of <em>would</em> +

			<p>This is commonly referred to as the future in the past and almost 
			always refers to a frustrated, prevented or avoided event.<br />
			In the past, only the <em>going to</em> form is possible 
			for frustrated events.&nbsp; We cannot have, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I was having 
			a holiday but lost all my money.</em><br />
			There is an exception to this with the verb <em>go</em> exemplified by:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to America but couldn't get a flight.</em><br />
			Here, the <em>was going</em> formulation is preferred because it 
			avoids the somewhat clumsy <em>was going to go.</em><br />
			The same phenomenon occurs with the verb <em>come</em> because of 
			the perceived clumsiness of <em>going to come</em> so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was coming to see you but suddenly felt 
			quite ill<br />
			</em>is preferred over:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to come to see you but suddenly 
			felt quite ill.</em></p>

			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style5">

					<td class="auto-style7">Form of choice</td>

			<p>The <em>going to</em> and the <em>-ing</em> forms are 
			traditionally cited as distinct future forms which have different 
			uses (the first for plans, the second for arrangements).&nbsp; In 
			our analysis they appear in the consideration of present time and 
			there is some doubt that the forms can be distinguished so easily.<br />
			The other common formulation to speak of frustrated futures in the 
			past is the <em>supposed to</em> construction as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were supposed to meet at one, but John was delayed.</em></p>
