		<p>Here we consider four past tense forms.&nbsp; English past forms are 
		not hugely complicated but they are more complicated than the ones used 
		by many other languages.&nbsp; English uses a 
		variety of forms to talk about different aspects or ways of 
		seeing the past.&nbsp; If you are unclear about the difference between 
		tense and aspect, it will help if you followed
		<a href="../initial/grammarl2/tenseaspect1.html" target="_blank">the guide to tense and aspect</a> before going on 
		(new tab or window).</p>
		<p>There is also a separate
		<a href="presentperfect.html" target="_blank">guide to the contrasts between past simple and present perfect</a> so 
		that will not be covered here.</p>
		<p><a name="present1"></a>Compare these examples and see if you can figure out 
		what the difference in meaning is:</p>

			<p>It is important to remember that many languages do not 
			distinguish between progressive and instantaneous actions.&nbsp; In 
			German, for example, <span class="orangeitalic">ich kam</span> 
			could be translated either as <span class="orangeitalic">I came</span> or <span class="orangeitalic">
			I was coming</span>.&nbsp; 
			The context will usually make things clear or an adverbial such as
			<em>at that moment </em>may be added.&nbsp; In many other languages, the same thing applies.<br />
			Many languages do not have a form analogous to these uses of <em>used 
			to</em> and <em>would </em>at all.</p></div>
			<p>A few notes:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style5">
			<li><em>I called you on the 14th June<br />
			</em><span class="concoursebluepara">The simplest form of the past 
			in English and the one usually taught first.&nbsp; There is more on 
			this in 
			<a href="../initial/lexis/lexicalverbforms.html" target="_blank">the guide to basic verb forms</a> including a discussion of 
			pronunciation, spelling and irregular forms.</span></li>
			<li><em>I worked in London from 1998 till 2004<br />
			</em><span class="concoursebluepara">Note the finished nature of the 
			action.&nbsp; For more, see 
			<a href="presentperfect.html" target="_blank">the guide to the present perfect</a> where 
			the two forms are compared.</span></li>
			<li><em>I always went to school by bus<br />
			</em><span class="concoursebluepara">As we noted above, if you 
			remove the adverbial the sense changes to that in example 1: a
			</span><span class="auto-style17">single finished, short past</span><span class="concoursebluepara"> 
			event unless the context makes it clear that this was a habit.</span></li>
			<li><em>I was reading a book<br />
			</em><span class="concoursebluepara">This form tell us a little 
			about how the speaker views the action (its aspect) but gives no 
			further information except that the action was progressive.&nbsp; We 
			don't know when it started and we don't know when it finished.</span></li>
			<li><em>I was just getting on the bus when I saw her<br />
			</em><span class="concoursebluepara">We don't know from 
			this whether the speaker continued to get on the bus or stopped 
			because he saw her.&nbsp; We need more context to know (see below 
			under time lines).</span></li>
			<li><em>He was watching television while she was gardening<br />
			</em><span class="concoursebluepara">This is the usual way of 
			talking about two progressive actions happening at the same time.&nbsp; 
			However, providing the context is clear, it is possible to use the 
			simple past to do this.&nbsp; For example, </span><em>He read while 
			I watched TV</em><span class="concoursebluepara">.</span></li>
			<li><em>I used to go to school by bus and ...</em></li>
			<li><em>... I would always try to sit at 
			the back<br />
			</em><span class="concoursebluepara">Both these forms refer to 
			discontinued past habits but <em>would</em> is rarer as a way of 
			setting the scene.&nbsp; It is, however, very common to start with a
			<em>used to</em> expression and then continue using <em>would</em>.&nbsp; 
			For example<br />
			</span><em>We <span class="auto-style18">used to</span> take our holidays in Margate where 
			the kids <span class="auto-style18">would</span> go to the beach all day and we 
			<span class="auto-style18">would</span> spend our time 
			reading or shopping.&nbsp; In the evening we 
			<span class="auto-style18">would</span> all meet up for 
			dinner and then we'<span class="auto-style18">d</span> go on to see a show or something</em><span class="concoursebluepara">.<br />
			For past states, only <em>used to</em> is usually 
			possible:<br />
			We can have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to drive to work early in the morning</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would drive to work early in the morning</em><br />
			BUT, we can have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to own a Jaguar<br />
			</em>but NOT<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I would own a Jaguar</em></span></li>

			<h3>past simple and past progressive tenses</h3>
			<p>The formation of the tenses is not usually troublesome for 
			learners.&nbsp; It is the concepts which take time to absorb and 
			master.</p>
			<p>As we saw with the contrast between present simple and present 
			progressive, the following are the usual issues which arise 
			concerning form.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Many languages change the ending (inflect) for all persons and 
			number so, for example, in French, we see:<br />
			<em>je mangeais (I ate)<br />
			</em><em>tu mangeais<br />
			</em><em>il/elle/on mangeait<br />
			nous mangions<br />
			</em><em>vous mangiez<br />
			</em><em>ils/elles mangeaient</em><strong><em><br />
			</em></strong>The same applies to most European languages and some 
			are even more complicated than French.<br />
			English is unusual because the verb past tense form, regular or not, 
			NEVER changes.&nbsp; We have, therefore, <em>I ate, you ate, they 
			ate, we ate, everyone ate</em> etc.<br />
			The very simplicity of this can confuse low-level learners used to 
			looking for inflexion in the verb.</li>
			<li>To form questions and negatives, many languages rely on changes 
			to word order or simply on intonation or punctuation.<br />
			English, however, makes use of the auxiliary verb <em>do</em> 
			(called an operator) followed by the base form (bare infinitive) of 
			the verb to form both questions and negatives.<br />
			We get, therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went &gt; <strong>Did</strong> she go? &gt; She <strong>didn't</strong> 
			go</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			At elementary level in particular, this can be confusing and hard to 
			remember so we get errors such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Went you?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*Made you?</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He not go</em><br />
			etc.</li>
			<li>The progressive is generally simpler to form (which may be one 
			reason learners tend to overuse it).&nbsp; The important thing to 
			note is that the past tense of <em>be</em> is irregular and does 
			actually inflect for number, although on a simple basis with two 
			forms only, <em>was</em> and <em>were</em> and without any 
			inflexion for person.</li>
			<li>The negative and interrogative forms of the past progressive 
			follow the pattern of the present progressive using:<br />
			For negatives: <span class="style_black">subject + past of <em>be</em> + not 
			+ <em>-ing</em> form</span> to produce, e.g., <em>She was not paying 
			attention</em><br />
			For interrogatives: <span class="style_black">past of <em>be</em> + subject +
			<em>-ing</em> form </span>to produce, e.g., <em>Were they playing 
			tennis?</em></li>
		</ol>
			<h3>used to and would</h3>
			<p>These two verbs work very differently because they are, in fact, 
			modal or semi-modal in nature.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>would</strong></dt>
				<dd>makes the question by simple inversion of subject and verb 
				and no other changes:<br />
				<em>She would often get angry &gt; Would she often get angry?</em><br />
				makes the negative by the insertion of <em>not</em> after the 
				auxiliary:<br />
				<em>She would often get angry &gt; She would not / wouldn't often 
				get angry</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>used to</strong> is more complicated because there are two possible 
				forms of negatives and interrogatives:</dt>
				<dd>
				<table cellpadding="2" class="auto-style32">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style34">&nbsp;</td>
						<td class="auto-style34">More common / less formal</td>
						<td class="auto-style34">Less common / more formal</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style34">Declarative</td>
						<td class="auto-style33" colspan="2"><em>She used to work in 
						a bank</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style34">Interrogative</td>
						<td class="auto-style34"><em>Did she use(d) to work in a 
						bank?</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style34"><em>Used she to work in a bank?</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style34">Negative</td>
						<td class="auto-style34"><em>She didn't use(d) to work in a 
						bank</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style34"><em>She use(d)n't to work in a bank</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br />
				The <em>-d</em> inflexion is optional in most cases.&nbsp; That's the 
				line taken on this site but purists might differ.<br />
				The less common and more formal ways to form questions and 
				negatives are probably better left to higher levels or even 
				consigned to receptive knowledge only.&nbsp; They are probably 
				dying out.</dd>

		<p>Time lines are simple, graphical representations of how languages use 
		tense and aspect to visualise events in time as if they were clothes on 
		a line.&nbsp; They can be simple, 
		effective and clear but you need to get them right to make sure that 
		that's true.&nbsp; In other words, you need to plan what you are going 
		to present.<br />
		Here's a task:<br />
			On a piece of paper, draw a horizontal arrow and mark it something 
			like this:<br />
			<img alt="past time line" height="108" src="../imagesgraphics/pasttimeline1.png" width="500" /></p>
			<p>Now, take these examples and see if you can show the various 
			uses of the past forms by drawing time lines.</p>
		<ol class="auto-style5">
			<li><em>John hit him</em></li>
			<li><em>John cycled from France to Sicily / John was reading on the 
			train</em></li>
			<li><em>John was reading the paper while I was doing my homework</em></li>
			<li><em>John cycled to work every day</em></li>
			<li><em>John was cycling to work when an idea hit him </em>
			<span class="concoursebluepara">(but he carried on)</span></li>
			<li><em>John was cycling to work when a bus hit him </em>
			<span class="concoursebluepara">(so he didn't 
			carry on!)</span></li>
			<li><em>John used to go to France where he would visit old friends</em></li>
