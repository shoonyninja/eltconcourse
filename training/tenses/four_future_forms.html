			</table>
			
		<p>English is slightly peculiar.<br />
		You knew that but the reference 
		here is to the fact that there is no obvious future tense in English.&nbsp; 
		English is not alone in this.<br />
		Some languages, such as Greek, Mandarin, Hebrew and so on, have ways of 
		referring to the future which don't demand a change to the verb form but 
		rely on context and co-text to make the meaning clear.<br />
		Greek uses 
		a little particle (<em>tha</em>), Mandarin relies mostly on adverbials such as <em>
		tomorrow, next week </em>etc. and Hebrew verbs are very different 
		indeed.&nbsp; Many Germanic and Scandinavian languages have ways of 
		making the future (often employing the verb <em>to go </em>or<em> to 
		become</em>) but also habitually use the present tense with an adverb 
		marker to talk about the future (e.g., <em>I go tomorrow</em>).&nbsp; 
		These languages are similar to English in having no inflected tense form 
		to denote future reference.<br />
		Romance languages, like 
		French, Spanish and Portuguese do rely on changes to the verb and 
		therefore have real future tenses so we get, for example, the French <em>
		aimerai</em> and the Spanish <em>amaré</em> (both meaning <em>I will 
		love</em>).<br />
		<strong>Knowing how your students' first 
		languages work is very helpful when you are teaching in this area</strong>.</p>
			<p>Technically speaking, in order to qualify as a tense a verb needs 
			to be inflected to show the time reference.&nbsp; In that respect, 
			English has no future tense, and nor do many other languages.<br />
			That is not to say, however, that for all intents and purposes a 
			statement such as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be 62 tomorrow</em><br />
			is not a future tense form.&nbsp; It is; just not technically so.&nbsp; 
			Learners are rarely interested in technical differences and will be 
			quite happy to look upon the form as a future tense.&nbsp; Why 
			shouldn't they?</p>

		<p>Notice the use of the word <strong>current</strong> in the middle 
		column.&nbsp; There is a strong argument, made elsewhere on this site, 
		that most of the forms above are actually present tenses which refer to 
		future events or states.&nbsp; The only truly future form is the one 
		used for prediction and certainty.</p>
			<p>There are some more forms you may have thought of (such as <em>
			He'll be working, He'll have finished </em>or even<em> I will have 
			been working</em>) but they are the subject of 
		a separate guide to four more future forms, linked in the list of 
			related guides at the end.&nbsp; In this guide we will consider the four most commonly taught forms 
		(above).</p>
			<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="sunrise" height="166" src="../images/sunrise250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style21" rowspan="2">
		<h2>the <em>will / shall</em> form</h2>

				<td class="auto-style22">
				<em>The sun will rise at 6:45</em></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</div>
		<p>The first thing to note is that these are modal auxiliary verbs as well as 
		markers for future time and it's sometimes almost impossible to separate 
		the functions.&nbsp; If you have read through some of the guides to modal auxiliary verbs, you 
		will be aware that one of <em>will</em>'s main functions expresses 
		intention as in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<span class="auto-style12"> I'll write as often as I can<br />
		</span></em>Is 
		that a statement about the future or a statement of intention (a 
		promise)?&nbsp; The answer will depend on the context but in both cases
		<em>will</em> refers to <strong>now</strong>.</p>
			<p>The second thing to note is that learners often use this as the 
		default choice.&nbsp; There are two reasons:<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		a) it is the form they first encountered for the future<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		b) it is the form most clearly identifiable as a tense and a natural 
		choice for people from many language backgrounds</p>
		<p><strong><em>will</em> or <em>shall</em>?</strong><br />
		Traditionally, <em>shall</em> for the future is restricted to the 1st 
		person singular and plural:<em><span class="auto-style12"><br />
		</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<span class="auto-style12">I shall see him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall arrive late<br />
		</span></em>In modern English, the forms are very restricted, arguably 
		to formal use in Southern British English only.&nbsp; It may be 
		important for learners studying or living in that setting to know the 
		form but it will rarely be heard elsewhere.&nbsp; However, questions 
		such as:<em><span class="style_brown"><br />
		</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown">What shall we do today?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where shall I put 
		this?<br />
		</span> </em>and the question tags<span class="auto-style12"><br />
		</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<span class="auto-style12">shall I?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall we?<br />
		</span>are still 
		very common and all learners need to be aware of the interrogative uses.</p>

		<p><strong>the neutral future</strong><br />
		<em>will</em> is often called the neutral future because it indicates 
		little or nothing of the speaker's viewpoint (but note the comment above 
		about the verb <span class="style_underline">as a modal auxiliary</span> 
		expressing current willingness).&nbsp; It is used for a fixed, certain future 
		event:<br />
		<span class="auto-style12"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the third
		stroke it will be 6:25 precisely.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The show will begin at 5:30.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The sea will eventually erode the cliff.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The Grand National will be run on Saturday.<br />
		</em></span>etc.</p>
		<p><strong>the predicted future</strong><br />
		This is allied to the idea of the neutral future but is more often used 
		to refer to the speaker's experience of the world allowing a prediction 
		to be made:<br />
		<span class="auto-style12"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be home by six as usual.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		There'll be hell to pay later.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		She'll certainly disagree.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		I'll never get him to spend the money.<br />
		</em></span>etc.<br />
		This is the function persistently seen in conditional 
		sentences such as<span class="auto-style12"><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		He'll be angry if you don't 
		get it finished.<br />
		</span>The central idea of a conditional sentence 
		is that an event is <span class="style_underline">predicted</span> from 
		a current condition.</p>
		<p><strong>the spontaneous future</strong><br />
		Traditionally, this is explained to learners as being used when a 
		decision has just been made on the basis of something heard such as<br />
		<span class="auto-style12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no butter left</span><br />
		to which a response might be:<br />
		<span class="auto-style12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, I'll go and get some 
		from the corner shop</span><br />
		or<span class="auto-style12"><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		John doesn't know where we live<br />
		</span>to which a response might be<br />
		<span class="auto-style12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Don't worry, I'll call him later.<br />
		</span>It is, however, better to see the verb in both those responses as <em>will</em> acting as a modal 
		auxiliary expressing willingness or volition right <strong>now</strong> (see above).&nbsp; 
		The answers may be, for example:<br />
		In both cases, the verb is modal and refers to a <strong>current</strong> willingness, not directly to the future.&nbsp; 
		Elsewhere on this site, this sense of a self-imposed duty is referred to 
		as commissive modality, a sub-category of deontic modality.</p>
		<p><strong>Other uses of </strong><em><strong>will</strong></em> such as 
		expressing:<span class="auto-style13"><br />
		stubbornness</span><span class="auto-style12"><br />
		</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<span class="auto-style12">He 
		will interrupt all the time</span><span class="auto-style13"><br />
		deduction</span><span class="auto-style12"><br />
		</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<span class="auto-style12">That'll be Sheila at the 
		door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That'll be our neighbours' dog you can hear<br />
		</span>or <span class="auto-style13">requests</span><span class="auto-style12"><br />
		</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<span class="auto-style12">Will 
		you wait a minute, please?<br />
		</span>are actually nothing to do with 
		futurity and should be taught separately &ndash; they are modal uses of 
		the verb.&nbsp; Mixing them up with future forms will confuse, not 
		clarify.</p>

		<p>This has been called <em>the future fulfilment of the present</em> (Quirk 
		and Greenbaum 1973:48).&nbsp; I.e., it is a future based on present 
		events.&nbsp; It is probably more easily understood as a present tense 
		which links current plans and intentions to the future.&nbsp; There are three main uses:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>present intention</strong>:<span class="auto-style12"><br />
			</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<span class="auto-style12">When are you going 
			to tell me?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to see the dentist.<br />
			</span>This 
			use of the form is 
			usually used
			<span class="style_underline">with people as the subject of the verb</span> 
			and it denotes a personal view of the present situation and the 
			future that arises from it.&nbsp; It is concerned with the speaker's 
			current, present <span class="style_underline">intention</span>, not 
			the speaker's view of the future <em>per se</em>.</li>
			<li><strong>present evidence</strong>:<br />
			<table style="width: 100%">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="pregnant" height="196" src="../images/pregnant.jpg" width="131" /></td>
					<td valign="top">The traditional way to present this use in 
					class is via a picture, with the statement<span class="auto-style12"><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					She's 
					going to have a baby</span><br />
					This usually gets the message across that the form is 
					used to talk about a future which is based on current 
					evidence.<br />
					Less entertainingly, you could use a picture of rain clouds 
					(see above) and the statement<span class="auto-style12"><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Look, it's going to rain</span><br />
					This form is, in contrast to intentionality, often used with 
					non-animate subjects:<span class="auto-style12"><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The 
					weather's going to turn nasty<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The rope's going to break<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The money is going to run out<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					It's going to be cold<br />
					</span>etc.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2">
					Because this use of <em>going to</em> does not carry the sense of willingness or 
					volition or that of a pure predicted future, it cannot be replaced with <em>will</em>, so:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *Look it will rain</em><br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She will have a baby<br />
					</em>or<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *Be careful, the ladder will slip</em><br />
					are not possible.</td>

			</li>
			
			<li><strong>past experience:<br />
			</strong>This is sometimes considered a sub-set of the present 
			evidence idea.<br />
			In sentences such as<br /><em><span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to be very upset</span><br />
			</em>we are not expressing his intention but predicting his reaction 
			based on our <strong>current </strong>knowledge and experience of him.&nbsp; Similar examples 
			are:<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's going to be really cold at that 
			time of year in Toronto<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The meeting's going to go on a long time<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She's going to get very angry.</em></span><br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His lecture's going to be interesting 
			and entertaining</em></span><br />
			etc.<br />
			The form in this use is often interchangeable with <em>will</em> 
			used for a predicted future (see above) and the meanings are very 
			close.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will be happy when he finds out<br />
			</em></span>my prediction based on the fact that the news is welcome and<br />
			<em>
			<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's going to be happy when he finds 
			out<br />
			</span></em>my prediction based on the fact that the news is welcome 
			and I know something about him.</li>

		<p>This form denotes a present anticipation of a future based on an arrangement, a 
		programme of events or a plan.&nbsp; Some typical examples are:<br />
		<span class="auto-style12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm leaving on Sunday<br />
		</span>my travel plans are booked and arranged<br />
		<span class="auto-style12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are teaching in room 5<br />
		</span>that's the timetabled programme for the day<br />
		<span class="auto-style12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm having lunch with the boss tomorrow<br />
		</span>it's arranged and in the diaries<br />
		<span class="auto-style12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John is bringing them home<br />
		</span>he's agreed and committed himself<br />
		Two things to note:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Because the same form is used to refer to the present, it is 
			often necessary to make the time apparent by inserting some kind of 
			marker such as<em> tomorrow, when I've finished this, later</em> 
			etc.</li>
			<li>This form is very commonly used with dynamic verb uses such as
			<em>arrive, go, take off, drive, play, take</em> etc. and far less 
			frequently used with state verbs such as <em>hope, expect, enjoy, 
			live</em> etc.&nbsp; In fact, it's hard to imagine<span class="auto-style12"><br />
			</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
			<span class="auto-style12">I am living in England<br />
			</span>referring 
			to anything except present time or<span class="auto-style12"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am 
			arriving<br />
			</span>referring to anything except future time (leaving 
			on-the-train mobile calls aside).<br />
			The use is especially 
			common with causative expressions such as<span class="auto-style12"><br />
			</span> 
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style12">
			I am having my hair done<br />
			</span>or<span class="auto-style12"><br />
			</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
			<span class="auto-style12">I am 
			getting the house painted<br />
			</span>probably because such events 
			clearly depend on arrangements between suppliers and clients.</li>
		</ol>
			<p><span class="style_red"><strong>Warning</strong></span>: there is 
			considerable overlap between the progressive and the <em>going to</em> 
			formulation.&nbsp; In many cases, the forms can be used 
			interchangeably with <em>going to</em> referring to arrangements in 
			particular in, e.g.:<br />
			<em><span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We decided I'm going to cook this 
			evening.</span><br />
			</em>Note, too the famous song lyric with its reference to having 
			tickets and a reservation.<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gonna take a sentimental journey<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gonna set my heart at ease<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gonna make a sentimental journey<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			To renew old memories<br />
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I got my bag, I got my reservation<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Spent each dime I could afford<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Like a child in wild anticipation<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I long to hear that: "all aboard!"</em></span></p>
		<p>(By the way, spelling <em>going to </em>as <em>gonna</em> is an 
		example of what is called metaplasm.)</p>
			<p>For more on the times when the forms are <strong>not</strong> 
		interchangeable see the 
		guide to talking about present time, linked below.&nbsp; The discussion occurs 
		there because the forms are both present tenses related to future 
		events.</p>
