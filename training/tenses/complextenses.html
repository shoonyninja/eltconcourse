		<p>This guide assumes you are familiar with the form and meaning of all 
		the tenses in English and comfortable with the concepts of aspect and 
		voice.<br />
		If that is not the case, you should refer to the 
		<a href="../initial/grammarl2/tenses.html">
		introductory guide to English tenses</a> and/or
		<a href="../initial/grammarl2/tenseaspect1.html">the guide to tense and

		<p>Sentences 1 and 3 are simple tense forms but sentences 2 and 4 display an 
		aspect of the tenses, perfect aspect in sentence 2 and progressive 
		aspect in sentence 4.<br />
		Many languages, as you will also know, do not have a way of 
		differentiating between the senses in 3. and 4., relying on context and 
		adverbials to make the meaning clear.&nbsp; Additionally, many other 
		languages do not differentiate formally between the aspects sentences 1 and 
		2 although some will, like Italian, differentiate between distant and 
		close past events.</p>

			<p>These complex forms share many characteristics with their simple 
			forms:</p>
			<ul class="auto-style21">
				<li>the present perfect progressive is used to explain a current 
				state or action with reference to past 
				actions or states just as the 
				simple form is used.&nbsp; It is a present, not a past, tense.</li>
				<li>the future perfect progressive, like the simple form, 
				implies looking back at future events from a point further in 
				the future.&nbsp; It is a relative tense, relating two times to 
				each other.</li>
				<li>the past perfect progressive is used to talk about events 
				further in the past than the past simple, especially those with 
				causal relationships, in the same way that the past perfect 
				simple is used.&nbsp; It is also a relative tense.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For more on the uses of the tenses, refer to the individual 
			guides, <a href="../inservice/verbs/aspect.html">the guide to aspect</a> 
			and to <a href="tensesandaspects/tensesindex.html">the guide to 
			time, tense and aspect</a>.</p>
			<p>Again, it is important to remember that many languages do not 
			distinguish between progressive or repeated and on-off instant 
			actions and events.&nbsp; In 
			German, for example,<span class="auto-style31"><br />
			</span><span class="style_italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
			<span class="auto-style31">Ich habe das Auto 
			gewaschen<br />
			</span>could be translated either as<span class="auto-style31"><br />
			</span> <span class="style_italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> 
			<span class="auto-style31">I 
			have been washing the 
			car<br />
			</span>or<span class="auto-style31"><br />
			</span><span class="style_italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
			<span class="auto-style31">I have washed the car</span>.<br />
			The context or an adverbial (e.g., <em>for hours</em>) will usually make things clear.&nbsp; In many other languages, the same thing applies.</p>

			<p>Understanding the forms is not at all easy and producing them 
			fluently requires a good deal of practice.</p>

				<img alt="pronounce" height="166" src="../images/pronounce250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style30">
		<h2>Pronunciation</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>In spoken English, the auxiliary verbs are 
		often contracted and the stress falls on the main verb and the adverbial 
		(usually) so we get, e.g.:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>It's been r</em><strong><em>ai</em></strong><em>ning for h</em><strong><em>ou</em></strong><em>rs (/ɪts bɪn ˈreɪn.ɪŋ fə ˈaʊəz/)</em></li>
			<li><em>They'll've been w</em><strong><em>o</em></strong><em>rking for h</em><strong><em>ou</em></strong><em>rs 
			(/ˈðeɪləv bɪn ˈwɜːk.ɪŋ fə ˈaʊəz/</em></li>
			<li><em>She'd been pl</em><strong><em>a</em></strong><em>ying p</em><strong><em>oo</em></strong><em>rly up 
			to then (/ʃid bɪn ˈpleɪ.ɪŋ ˈpʊə.li ʌp tə ðen/)</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>If the phonemic script means nothing to you at the moment, don't 
		fret.&nbsp; Just try saying the sentences rapidly and notice how <em>
		been</em> is pronounced as <em>bin</em> and how the '<em>o</em>' in <em>for</em> 
		and <em>to</em> is reduced to a short sound such as the one at the end 
		of <em>sister</em> on the '<em>e</em>'.</p>
		<p>This gets worse in the negatives where we get, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They won't've been travelling for long (/ ˈðeɪ wəʊntəv bɪn ˈtræ.vəl.ɪŋ 
		fə ˈlɒŋ /)</em></p>
			<p>This sort of thing is tough to say in a foreign language and 
			learners need lots of practice perhaps including some drilling before they get it 
			right.<br />
			Hearing the form is also a challenge because of the consistent use 
			of contractions and weak forms.</p>

		<p>In exactly the same ways that modal auxiliary verbs can be used with simple tenses, 
		they can be deployed with complex ones.&nbsp; We get structures such as 
		these</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>He must have been out walking because his boots are all wet 
			and muddy</em></li>
			<li><em>They will have to have been driving all night so they will 
			be tired when they arrive tomorrow</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>The past perfect progressive is not used with 
		modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; When we need to insert modality we use the present 
		perfect progressive with the modal and follow it with a past tense if 
		need be.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="3"><em>He must have been out walking in the rain because 
			he came with wet, muddy boots.<br />
			</em>Compare 1. above.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>We can even combine modality with the passive so it is, 
		theoretically, possible to form examples such as:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="4"><em>His car must have been being serviced if he came 
			in a cab.</em></li>
			<li><em>The room can't have been being painted recently.&nbsp; There 
			was no smell of paint.</em></li>
			<li><em>He should have been being treated sooner but there will be a 
			delay, I'm afraid.</em></li>

		<p>What we can do with the passive and modal verbs, we can also do with 
		the causative so, again, the following are theoretically possible, 
		albeit rare, apart from the present perfect progressive causative which 
		is actually reasonable frequently used.&nbsp; See 9., below.</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="7"><em>I will have been having my hair cut by then, I 
			expect.</em></li>
			<li><em>He must have been having to have his car serviced because he 
			wants a lift.</em></li>
			<li><em>Sorry I'm late.&nbsp; I have been having my eyes tested.</em></li>
			<li><em>He had been having his old shoes repaired for years before 
			he bought a new pair.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>The very complex forms with passives, modality and causative 
		constructions are, because of their comparative rarity, quite hard to 
		teach but, at higher levels at least, the form and meaning is not 
		difficult to analyse.</p>

		<h3>Combining form and concept</h3>
		<p>There's little point simply focusing on the forms if the learners 
		have no idea why they should be using them.&nbsp; A good place to start, 
		therefore, is by contrasting progressive and simple forms of the three 
		tenses (not, please, at the same time).&nbsp; For example, Step 1 can be 
		to get the learners to figure out the 
		difference in meaning between these pairs.</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style24">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style26" style="width: 50%"><strong>Sentence A</strong></td>
				<td class="auto-style26" style="width: 50%"><strong>Sentence B</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style25" style="width: 50%">He has played chess 
				with his brother</td>

				chess with his brother (for three hours)</td>

				the drums but stopped when the neighbours complained</td>

				<td class="auto-style25" style="width: 50%">We will have

			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Learners who already know how the perfect aspect affects current 
		meaning and who understand the concept of duration and repeated action 
		expressed through the progressive aspect will have the ability to unpack 
		these meanings (and it is unwise to try to tackle this area with 
		learners who don't).&nbsp; They will also understand how the addition of 
		the time adverbial affects meaning.</p>
		<p>Once the concept is clear, for Step 2, you can focus on the form and 
		the pronunciation in a reasonably controlled way.&nbsp; The trick then 
		is to go on to get the learners to make their own meanings.</p>
		<p>Step 3:<br />
		The easiest tense to focus on is the present perfect progressive.&nbsp; 
		When learners have the sense of that, they can transfer the concept to 
		the other complex tenses.&nbsp; The ideas of durative or repeated 
		actions are parallel across all three tenses.<br />
		A half-way house is to use visuals to get learners to use the forms 
		correctly.<br />
		The following is for illustration purposes and mixes all the tenses.&nbsp; 
		It is far safer to focus on one at a time but the same kinds of visuals 
		can be used for all of them.<br />
		Start with the sentence completion exercise before you go on the more 
		challenging task of starting the sentences.</p>

		etc.<p>Almost any visual of people doing something can be used in this way but 
		it is important continually to check the concepts, of course, or the 
		students will just be parroting the form without understanding its 
		significance.</p>
		<p>Step 4 is to get the learners to think about questions such as:</p>
		<ul class="auto-style29">
			<li>Think of three things you will have been doing for a long time 
			by the end of next year.</li>
			<li>Say what you had been doing before you came to class this 
			morning.</li>
			<li>Say what you have been doing this week.<br />
			etc.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Then you can conduct a simple find-someone-who exercise as a way of 
		getting feedback.<br />
		You will need to be very alert to the responses from your learners and 
		prepared, for example, to explain why<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I had been opening the front 
		door before I came to class<br />
		</em>is wrong.<br />
		Actions and events need to be <strong>durative or repeated</strong> 
		(i.e., in iterative aspect) for 
		the forms to work.</p>
