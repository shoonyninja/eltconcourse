	<h1>The past perfect</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="past" height="207" src="../images/history_ammonite310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p>If you have studied other languages, you may have found this tense 
		referred to as the pluperfect and it sometimes called that in English 
		grammar, too.&nbsp; Here, however, we'll use the usual term for it, the 
		past perfect.</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="what?" height="166" src="../images/animals_meerkats_two250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style14">
		<h2>What is the past perfect?</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The past perfect (like all perfect forms) is a <strong>relational</strong> 
		rather than <strong>absolute</strong> time marker.&nbsp; That means that 
		the tense is used to link actions or states <strong>in relation to each 
		other</strong>, not set them at a particular time.</p>
		<p>The past perfect tense refers to the past <strong>in</strong> the past or the past 
		<strong>before</strong> the past.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>She <span class="style_black">had visited</span> France 
			often before then</em></li>
			<li><em>She <span class="style_black">had met</span> him before and 
			knew his reputation.</em></li>
			<li><em>They <span class="style_black">had spent</span> the 
			afternoon skiing and were looking forward to a rest.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>A simple time line can make it clearer:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="past perfect time line" height="151" src="../imagesgraphics/pastperfecttimeline.png" width="400" /></p>
		<p>In fact, as sentence 1 above indicates, the past perfect often occurs 
		without the past simple.&nbsp; For example,</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="4"><em>He <span class="style_black">had arrived</span> 
			before me.</em></li>
			<li><em>Before lunch they <span class="style_black">had played</span> 
			cards.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Note, however, that some other past event or state is <strong>always</strong> 
		implied in these circumstances.&nbsp; In sentence 4, that implication is 
		that <em>I also arrived</em> and in sentence 5, there is a clear 
		implication that <em>they ate lunch</em> after they played cards.</p>

		<p><span class="style_brown">There isn't much difference in meaning 
		between sentences 1 and A or between sentences 3 and C and there are two
		<strong>different</strong> reasons for that:</span></p>
		<ul class="auto-style7">
			<li><span class="style_brown">The nature of the verb <em>expect</em>.&nbsp; 
			Clearly, <em>expecting</em> precedes an even or state so we know 
			which one came first.&nbsp; The use of the past perfect here is, 
			therefore, unnecessary.</span></li>
			<li><span class="style_brown">The presence of the word <em>
			after</em> in sentences 3 and C also mean that the past perfect form 
			is not needed.&nbsp; The word tells us explicitly what came first.</span></li>
		</ul>
		<p><span class="style_brown">However, in sentences 2 and B, there is a 
		difference.&nbsp; The causal effect of the conjunction <em>because </em>
		needs explaining so the hearer/reader knows which event occurred 
		first.&nbsp; Most people find sentence 2 unacceptable.</span></p>
		<p><span class="style_brown">The general rule is, therefore, that when 
		the two events are spoken of in the order in which they occurred and 
		without adverbials such as <em>by then, before, up till then, just, 
		already </em>etc., we do not need to use the past perfect form.&nbsp; So 
		we get:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went home and had dinner<br />
		</em>Here we have two events spoken of in the 
		order they occurred so no past perfect tense is needed.<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lived for 20 years in France and then returned to England<br />
		</em>Here we have 
		a state and an event a) spoken of in the order they occurred and b) 
		containing a time adverb (<em>then</em>) so no past 
		perfect form is needed.</span></p>

		<dl>
			<dt><strong>When events or states are mentioned out of order:</strong></dt>
			<dd>Speakers and writers will often reverse the ordering of events 
			to emphasise one of them.<br />
			It's fine to have<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lived for 20 years in France and 
			retired to England<br />
			</em>using two simple past forms but if we 
			reverse the order, the past perfect is <span class="style_underline">
			usually</span> necessary:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He returned to England.&nbsp; He had lived in France for 20 
			years </em>or<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He returned to England after he had lived in France </em>or<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Before he returned to England he had lived in France<br />
			</em>etc.</dd>
			<dt><strong>When we have a </strong><em><strong>when</strong></em><strong>-clause 
			referring to a later event:</strong></dt>
			<dd>It's fine to have<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he retired he went to England<br />
			</em>because the events happened at the same time but when they don't, we 
			usually need the past perfect to avoid ambiguity.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made tea when they arrived</em><br />
			with<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had made tea when they arrived</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>When the time is not specified:</strong></dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had never seen him before that night<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			They hadn't tried whisky before they went to Scotland<br />
			</em>(<em>*She never saw him before that night </em>and<em> 
			*They didn't try whisky before they went to Scotland </em>are both 
			wrong.)</dd>
			<dt><strong>In subordinating clauses:</strong></dt>
			<dd>Especially with causal relationships, the past perfect is 
			commonly used (although two past simple tenses are often possible)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made tea because they had arrived<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I didn't go because I had lost my ticket</em><br />
			But we can also have, e.g.,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrived late because the car broke down on the way<br />
			</em>where 
			the ordering and causality is obvious.<br />
			The rule of thumb here is that it is never wrong to use the past 
			perfect in these types of sentences.</dd>

		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had written a letter but was unhappy with the wording<br />

		<p>Using the past perfect progressive to distance oneself

		</em>makes the speaker sound very diffident and polite indeed.</p>

		<p>Briefly, the past perfect is often used when we report something said 
		in the past tense after the time of speaking.&nbsp; So, for example<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I bought it in London"<br />
		</em>is reported as<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she had bought it in London.<br />
		</em>However, if the object in question lies before us, the past perfect 
		is not necessary.<em><br />
