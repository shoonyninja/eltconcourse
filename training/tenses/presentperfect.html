	<h1>The present perfect</h1>

		<p>The distinction in English between the simple and perfect forms of 
		all tenses is the key to understanding how English conceptualises time.<br />
		If you haven't followed the <a href="../initial/grammarl2/tenses.html">
		introductory guide to English tenses</a> yet, please consider doing so 
		now.</p>

				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Many languages have verbs forms selected to represent the speaker's 
		view of time &ndash; that is what tenses do.&nbsp; However, they differ 
		in terms of what they see as the important distinctions.<br />
		Some languages, such as 
		Mandarin, have no changes to verbs to signify time at all, relying on 
		adverbials, particles and the context to signal time concepts.&nbsp; It 
		is perfectly possible to be understood (at least on a basic level) and 
		use no tense forms at all.&nbsp; So:<br /><em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go tomorrow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I come yesterday<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always do this<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrive recently<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		I finish work at 6 last week</em><br />are all perfectly comprehensible even if they need a little 
		interpretation from the listener.<br />Briefly, many languages do not distinguish between the present 
		perfect and the simple past in the way that English does although they 
		may have very similar forms.&nbsp; (German, for example, can form a 
		sentence like<em class="style_brown"> Ich habe es gemacht</em> 
		(roughly translatable as <em class="style_brown">I have done it</em>) 
		but this does not necessarily signify present relevance and could be translated as<span class="style_brown">
		<em>I did it</em></span>.)</p>

		<p>The present perfect is a <strong>relative</strong> tense.&nbsp; We 
		use it to consider one state, event or action in relation to another.<br />
		Fundamentally, the tense is a <strong>present</strong> tense, not a past 
		tense, because it refers to the present in relation to the past.&nbsp; 
		This is what is meant:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style34">

				<td class="auto-style38">Concept and meaning</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>

		</table>
		<p>One way to understand the concept the present perfect in 
		English indicates is to contrast it with the past simple.<br />
		The past simple is an absolute tense, not a relative one, and refers to 
		a finished event or action which may or may not have any relation to the 
		present.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style34">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style36">Example</td>
				<td class="auto-style38">Concept and meaning</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style39"><em>I spent all my money</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style37">This just refers to something finished.&nbsp; 
				It does not necessarily imply anything about the present.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style39"><em>He finished</em> <em>at six</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style43">Compare this to the use above with <em>
				yet</em>.&nbsp; The time expression <em>at six</em> clearly 
				fixes the event in time but <em>yet</em> is open ended.&nbsp; 
				This does <strong>not</strong><span class="auto-style44"> mean 
				that the time expression controls tense use.&nbsp; It is the 
				other way around: the tense meaning permits some time references 
				and not others.</span></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>

		<h2>the present perfect progressive</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>We use the progressive aspect with the present perfect to do one of 
		two things:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>We <strong>emphasise the activity</strong> over the achievement.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have finished the report<br />
			</em>emphasises that the report is 
			now ready.&nbsp; It is the achievement that matters and that carries 
			the present relevance (<em>so now you can read it</em>)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been finishing the report<br />
			</em>however, emphasises my 
			activity, not the achievement and it is the activity which is 
			relevant to the present (<em>that's why I'm so late home</em>)</li>
			<li>We emphasise the recentness of the activity or state and <strong>
			explain the present</strong>.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been running (and I'm hot and tired)<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She has been drinking (and she's not making sense)<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			What have you been doing? (to get so dirty, tired, wet </em>etc<em>.)</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>The sense of an activity focus with the progressive vs. achievement 
		focus with the simple aspect becomes clearer with these examples:</p>
		<ul class="auto-style9">
			<li><em>I have been working<br />
			</em>vs.<em><br />
			I have worked<br />
			</em>The first of these is comprehensible because the speaker is 
			emphasising the activity.&nbsp; The second is almost meaningless 
			because we need to know what has been achieved so the sentence needs 
			a complement such as <em>on the report all this week</em></li>
			<li><em>She has succeeded<br />
			</em>vs.<em><br />
			She has been succeeding</em><br />
			This is the reverse case.&nbsp; Because the verb <em>succeed</em> 
			implies an achievement, it is usually used with the present perfect 
			simple but the second sentence is meaningless because the verb does 
			not refer to an activity</li>
			<li><em>I have taken a holiday in France many times<br />
			</em>vs.<em><br />
			I 
			have been taking a holiday in France<br />
			</em>The first structure can be used with something like <em>many 
			times, twice, often</em> etc. because we are emphasising the 
			achievement (<em>so I now know a little about the country</em>) but 
			the second cannot be used with a term like <em>twice </em>because 
			we are not speaking of an achievement with present relevance but of 
			the activity itself which is probably very recent (<em>and that's why 
			I didn't answer your email</em>)</li>

			<p>A number of coursebooks have an annoying habit of presenting 
			learners with long lists (as in the table above) of time phrases to 
			use with past tenses and others to use with the present perfect.&nbsp; 
			From the list, learners are expected to think something like<br />
			"If I 
			am using <em>last week, </em>I must use the past simple"<br />
			or<br />
			"If I am 
			using <em>since</em>, I must use the present perfect".<br />
			<strong>That is the wrong way round</strong>.<br />
			The choice of the appropriate time marker depends on the speaker's 
			perception of time which is represented by the tense structure.<br />
			It is not the time marker which determines the tense; it is the 
			speaker's understanding which determines the tense and the tense 
			which determines the appropriate time marker.&nbsp; To be clear, it 
			does not work like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="not like this" height="61" src="../imagesgraphics/itdoesnot.png" width="400" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>it works like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="like this" height="63" src="../imagesgraphics/itdoes.png" width="550" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>If that is not understood, it is virtually impossible to teach 
			the form, the meaning or the use.</p>

		You will readily see that sentences such as <br />

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has never smiled at me</em></span><br />
		refer to a time between the speakers' earliest memories and now.<br />
		These examples refer to a time between the speakers' earliest memories and now.&nbsp; 
		It is <span class="style_underline">indefinite</span> concerning the 
		time and focuses on the event alone.&nbsp; It is for this reason that 
		the tense is often used to comment on the present or to introduce the 
		topic of a conversation.&nbsp; Here are some typical examples which do 
		not relate to recentness but use the tense in this aspect of discussing 
		experience or raising a topic:<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you know that Mary has left her job and 
		gone travelling?<br />
		</em></span>introducing a topic for discussion – it may be a recent 
		event but that's not the point<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've been to Paris, haven't you?<br />
		</em></span>possibly a forerunner to some closer questioning about Paris<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've discovered something about this 
		program<br />
		</em></span>requiring the hearer to say something like <em>Oh, what's that?&nbsp; Do 
		tell.</em> etc.<br />
		<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you tried the new restaurant in the 
		square?<br />
		</em></span>a forerunner to asking what it's like or telling the hearer 
		what it's like if the answer is 'no'.</p>
		<p>
		It's pretty easy to make up examples of this very common use of the 
		tense but the trick is to set it in context and give people a reason to 
		introduce a topic and that's usually because:</p>
		<ul class="auto-style9">
			<li>they want to <strong>get some information (now)</strong></li>
			<li>they want to <strong>give some information (now) </strong>or</li>
			<li>they want to <strong>start a discussion (now)</strong></li>
