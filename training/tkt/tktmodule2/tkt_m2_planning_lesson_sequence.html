			<p>There are almost as many ways to plan a lesson as there are 
			teachers to teach them.<br />
			Before we can begin to plan a lesson or a series of lessons, 
			however, we need to be clear about what sort of lesson we are 
			designing.<br />
			Here we will consider three basic lesson structures and look at 
			what they are appropriate for and how we can plan them.<br />
			Here's a picture:<br />
			<img alt="three structures" height="272" src="../imagestkt/three_structures.png" width="400" /><br />
			And here's the explanation:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="boldblue">PPP</span> refers to Present &rarr; Practice 
				→ Produce.&nbsp; This is a 
				very common framework for lessons of all kinds.&nbsp; It is 
				familiar, simple and often effective.&nbsp; It usually works 
				like this:<ol class="auto-style42">
					<li>The topic and target are introduced at the outset.</li>
					<li>The core of the lesson lies in progressively less 
					controlled practice.</li>
					<li>At the end, the learners can use the language in a 
					personal way for real communication.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><span class="boldblue">TTT</span> refers to Test → Teach → Test and is almost equally 
				common and but is less straightforward to plan because the 
				teacher must respond and adapt to what emerges from the first 
				testing stage.<ol class="auto-style42">
					<li>The lesson begins with tasks to test the learners' 
					ability to do things with the language.&nbsp; This alerts 
					both the learners and the teacher to what needs to be 
					improved or learned.</li>
					<li>The actually teaching and practice come next with the 
					focus on analysing and practising.</li>
					<li>Finally, the tasks are repeated or new, parallel ones are set to 
					allow everyone to judge how well the lesson's targets have 
					been achieved.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><span class="boldblue">TBL</span> refers to Task-Based Learning.&nbsp; This is not common 
				as a structure but has great advantages in terms of requiring 
				the learners to use their language skills to the full right from 
				the beginning.&nbsp; It is also useful if you have a very 
				mixed-level group of learners because they can all achieve the 
				task in some way.<br />
				There are differences in how people plan lessons of this kind 
				with some preferring to teach language first and some preferring 
				to teach the language after the task is complete so the sequence 
				could be:<ol class="auto-style42">
					<li>Possibility 1:<ol class="auto-style43">
						<li>Presentation of the task</li>
						<li>Do the task</li>
						<li>Report back on the task outcomes</li>
						<li>Analysis of the language produced with correction</li>
						<li>Practice of the language the learners needed to 
						command.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Possibility 2:<ol class="auto-style43">
						<li>Practice of the language the learners will need</li>
						<li>Presentation of the task</li>
						<li>Do the task</li>
						<li>Report back on the task outcomes</li>
						<li>Revisit, revise and extend the language skills and 
						systems</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All three lesson types can be used to target skills, systems and 
			integrated skills and systems.<br />
			All three structures can also be used for all kinds of lessons 
			although some are better suited to presentation of new language and 
			skills and some to revision and extension of language and skills 
			already learned.</p>

						presentation.<br />
						A TTT approach could work if the task at the beginning 
						alerts the learners to the fact that they need more 
						language and more options to perform the functions 
						successfully.<br />
						A TBL approach centred on a task to survey the opinions

				<li>Stage 1 (15 minutes) is the presentation phase.<br />
				Here the learners look at the pictures and try to identify the 
				name of the activity.&nbsp; If they can't, the teacher has to 
				provide it (or the learners could use their dictionaries / ask 
				each other etc.).<br />
				Note that the teacher's job here is to <strong>supply</strong> 
				and <strong>model</strong> language.&nbsp; That's what 
				presentation is all about.</li>
				<li>Stage 2 (15 minutes) is very tightly controlled practice.<br />
				All the learners have to do is change positive sentences to 
				negative ones and vice versa.&nbsp; They change, e.g., <em>I 
				like fishing</em> to <em>I don't like fishing </em>or <em>I like 
				shopping</em> to <em>I hate shopping / I don't like shopping</em>.<br />
				The aim here is to get the learners to use the language 
				accurately so the task is simple.&nbsp; The teacher's role is to 
				monitor and spot problems, helping people to get it right.</li>
				<li>Stage 3 (15 minutes) is freer practice and gets the students 
				moving around (often A Very Good Thing).<br />
				Notice that the language is, again, personalised for the 
				students.&nbsp; They have to ask and answer questions in a way 
				which is <strong>true for them</strong>.&nbsp; Making language 
				personal makes it memorable.</li>
				<li>Stage 4 (15 minutes) is revision and a bit of fun.&nbsp; If 
				the lesson has overrun (it is planned for 60 minutes but could 
				take longer and probably would with a large class) then this 
				stage can be left until later and form the basis of a revision 
				lesson.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The lesson staging can be used for many different purposes.&nbsp; 
			For example, it could easily be adapted to present and practise 
			things you are allowed to do (<em>I can ...</em>) and things that 
			are forbidden (<em>We can't ... / mustn't ...</em>).&nbsp; All 
			that's needed is some different pictures and a change to the 
			worksheet.</p>

				If this were a speaking lesson, this might be done through the 
				learners reading / watching / listening to a model dialogue or some 
				other form of speaking.</li>
				<li>Stage 2 focuses on the language the learners will need to 
				complete the task.<br />
				This is an important stage because it is very frustrating to be

				<li>Stage 3 gets the learners to cooperate in brainstorming what

			<p>Planning sequences of lessons is a matter of applying the same 
			sort of thinking but on a bigger scale.&nbsp; Over a series of 
			lessons, a range of purposes and appropriate lesson structures will 
			be useful.<br />
			This will add variety to the course and keep the lessons fresh and 
			engaging but it will also mean you can match the lesson style to the 
			stage of the course.&nbsp; A short course series could look 
			something like:</p>

			<img alt="series of lessons" height="143" src="../imagestkt/lessons_series.png" width="400" /></p>
			<p>Some notes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bluebullet">At the beginning of the series, many 
				of the lessons would be PPP- or TTT-style lessons because this is 
				where we want to introduce and make our learners aware of the 
				course targets.</li>
				<li class="bluebullet">In the second stage, we present less 
				and practise more so the lesson types could involve TTT or TBL 
				or a mixture.</li>
				<li class="bluebullet">At stage three, it comes to 
				integrating the language and skills learned and for this project 
				work and other TBL-style lessons are ideal.</li>
				<li class="bluebullet">Finally, we need ways of assessing 
				how well the whole series of lessons has worked and that is the 
				subject of the next guide.</li>
