				by looking at the material to

					However, unless the next set of learners are very similar,

					course again.</li>
					<li>Test the outcomes.&nbsp; This can be helpful but it is 
					very difficult to know if success or failure is due to the 
					choice of materials (rather than the learners' motivation, 
					the teachers' skills etc.).</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong class="boldblue">Prospectively</strong>,<br />
				By assessing how well the

					<h2>Asking the right questions</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Prospective evaluation is what most people understand by materials evaluation.&nbsp; 
			It is the effort to decide whether whatever material you are 
			presented with is fit for its purpose.<br />
			In simple terms: <em>will it work?</em></p>
			<p>We can do two other things before we ask our own questions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="boldblue">Read a review</span><br />Reviews of new, and not so new, materials appear in the 
					professional press quite frequently.&nbsp; We can decide on the basis of good reviews 
				and reject on a similar 
					basis.<ol class="auto-style41">
					<li>Problem 1: reviewers may not be using the same criteria 
					that you are.&nbsp; What's important to the reviewer may not 
					be important to you and your learners.</li>
					<li>Problem 2: a reviewer is not looking at the materials 
					with any particular course or group in mind.&nbsp; What may 
					be usable with a group of adults on a short course will not 
					work with a group of children over a school year.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><span class="boldblue">Rely on the 
					publishers' descriptions</span><br />
					Read the information on the back cover and the descriptions 
					provided by the publishers to decide whether the material 
					will suit your purposes.<ol class="auto-style41">
					<li>Problem 1: for financial reasons, coursebooks have to be 
					designed to appeal to as wide a range of markets as 
					possible.&nbsp; This often means that they become a mixture of 
					different approaches and try to cover the syllabus of as 
					many settings and nations as possible.<br />
					Much of what is included may simply not be relevant to you 
					and your learners.</li>
					<li>Problem 2: publishers vary widely in what they feel are 
					key characteristics of course materials.&nbsp; They also vary in 
					their use of terms like 'intermediate' and 'intensive'.&nbsp; 
					It may, therefore, be just impossible to make useful 
					comparisons or judgements based on what they tell you.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Teachers have to rely on their own judgements 
			and look at the material carefully.&nbsp; Too often, however, 
			this becomes  
			something like:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><em>It looks nice and is at the right level, so I'll use it.</em></p>
			<p>We need to have some clearer questions to ask and go beyond <em>
			Is it pretty and at the right level?</em></p>

					<h2>Check lists for evaluation</h2>

			</table>
			<p>Some check-lists run to over 50 questions and are very difficult 
			to apply.&nbsp; Here we will try to identify the really important 
			questions but remember that everyone is in a unique setting so you 
			will have to subtract from or add to the list (or both).<br />
			Some of these questions will only apply to selecting coursebooks.</p>

			<h3><span class="boldblue">types of supplementary materials</span><br />
			<img alt="types" height="133" src="../../images/blocks_green200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Web-based</strong></dt>
				<dd>There was a time when anyone working outside an English-speaking 
			setting had a hard time finding extra materials with which to 
			supplement the diet of a coursebook.&nbsp; No longer.<br />
			If you are reading this, you are connected to the web and there you 
			will find billions (really) of pieces of material you can bring into 
			your classroom to brighten up the day and provide much-needed 
			practice.&nbsp; Of the estimated 1.2 billion websites out here, over 
				60% are in English.&nbsp; (The next three biggest languages have 
				less than 15% between them.)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Printed</strong></dt>
				<dd>Additionally, there are the 'traditional', text-based 
				supplementary materials such as books focused on particular 
				skills, communication games and so on as well as printed media 
				in English (mostly newspapers and magazines).</dd>
				<dt><strong>TV and radio</strong></dt>
				<dd>Media globalisation has meant that a good range of 
				English-language TV and radio programmes are available to anyone 
				who has an internet or satellite connection.&nbsp; 
				If you also have the ability to record and play back to the 
				class, you have a powerful and rich resource base to draw on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>People</strong></dt>
				<dd>Around 375 million people speak English as a first language 
				and the same number use it as a second language (at work etc.).&nbsp; 
				In addition, 750 million people use English as a foreign 
				language.<br />
				English is an official or widely used language in 60 countries.<br />
				Even if you are not teaching in an English-speaking environment, 
				therefore, it is usually not too difficult to find expert users 
				of English who are willing to come into your classroom, or to 
				whom your students can go, to provide supplementary 
				communication practice.<br />
				It would be strange not to take advantage of them.</dd>
			</dl>
			<h3>Why use supplementary material?<br />
			<img alt="why" height="133" src="../../images/think_cogs200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>There are a number of good <span class="boldblue">reasons</span>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Because the class needs more.<br />
				Most people can read an entire coursebook in an hour or so, 
				cover to cover.&nbsp; Coursebooks are not usually very rich sources of 
				language.&nbsp; If you accept that one of the most powerful aids 
				to learning is repeated and continual exposure to examples of 
				language in use, then we need to supply a much richer 
				environment than any coursebook can hope to give us.</li>
				<li>Because people get bored.<br />
				We can simply work through a coursebook from Unit 1 to the end 
				but this means<ol class="auto-style42">
					<li>that you think all the units and topics are relevant</li>
					<li>that the class is very tolerant</li>
					<li>that the same approach will be followed in every lesson 
					(because coursebook writers usually have a clear idea of 
					what they understand as 'best practice')</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>the <span class="boldblue">dangers</span> of supplementary 
			materials<br />
			<img alt="danger" height="133" src="../../images/banana_skin200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p>Be careful.&nbsp; Taking texts, songs, supplementary materials, 
			video clips, magazines and newspapers etc. into your classroom can 
			certainly add variety and give your learners exposure to authentic 
			English but:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Many materials are intended for native-speaker users of the 
				language and may be over the heads of your learners (and you).&nbsp; 
				You may think they are useful but if nobody can understand them 
				the lesson will be boring and demotivating.</li>
				<li>The one-off lesson syndrome.&nbsp; Something may be 
				attractive, interesting and at the right level but if it is not 
				relevant to your learners' needs and isn't integrated into the 
				syllabus, your learners may not be getting a balanced diet.</li>
				<li>Too many supplementary materials may require lots of careful 
				planning and preparation.&nbsp; Do you have the time for that?</li>

			<h3><span class="boldblue">boards</span></h3>
			<p>Boards are the central and most versatile aid of all.&nbsp; They 
			don't have to be interactive (although that helps) and they don't 
			need to be colourful (although that helps, too) but they do have to 
			be <strong>organised</strong>.<br />
			The board is often the focus of all or part of every lesson.&nbsp; 
			It is where the learners look for <strong>critical</strong> information and it is often from 
			the board that they note things down to take away.&nbsp; If you 
			write something on a board, most learners will assume that what you 
			write is important.<br />
			That means:</p>

			<h3><span class="boldblue">data projectors</span></h3>
			<p>These won't be available everywhere but where they are, they can 
			be very useful.&nbsp; Use them for:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>PowerPoint (etc.) presentations.</li>
				<li>Projecting texts so people are looking up and making eye 
				contact with you rather than looking down to read.</li>
				<li>Projecting material from the web: videos, exercises, news 
				sites, tests, texts etc.</li>
				<li>Students to report back on what they have done with tasks.</li>
				<li>Projecting images and pictures.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3><span class="boldblue">smart phones</span></h3>
			<p>These are underused but many students have them.&nbsp; Their main 
			advantage in the classroom is that they can be used to record students 
			talking and to take quick images.&nbsp; You need to consider 
			carefully how that is done and how you will listen to / see the 
			results.</p>
			<h3><span class="boldblue">audio and video equipment</span></h3>
			<p>There are two different ways to use these:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>As input materials:<br />
				Language teachers have long used these aids and, with DVD and CD players, they have become easier to use.&nbsp; The trick is 
			to be fully acquainted with the equipment so you don't waste time 
			playing with the controls and trying to find the bit on the CD you 
			want to play.&nbsp; Practise.<br />
			Beware, too, of overly long sequences.&nbsp; The maximum is around 5 
			minutes before audio recordings start to wash over people or video 
			recordings become just passively watching TV.&nbsp; At lower levels, 
				one minute is probably the limit.<br />
			You need to set the learners clear tasks to achieve before they 
			listen or watch, while they are listening or watching and after they 
			have listened and watched.&nbsp; Make sure there is a purpose to it.<br />
			These are aids, not substitutes for the teacher.</li>
				<li>To record learners' output:<br />
				This use needs a bit more care and expertise to set up but it 
				can be very rewarding to hear oneself speaking a foreign 
				language accurately and comprehensibly.&nbsp; On the other hand, 
				it can be acutely embarrassing to hear oneself speaking it 
				poorly and incomprehensibly.<br />
				Handle with care.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3><span class="boldblue">realia</span></h3>
			<p>Bringing real objects into the classroom can be engaging and 
			motivating (especially if the learners have brought them).&nbsp; 
			Consider, for example,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Real texts:<br />
				a letter / email from a friend or relative of yours or one of 
				the learners is immediately more intriguing than something made 
				up in a coursebook.</li>
				<li>Objects:<br />
				if your aim is to teach vocabulary for things like fruit, 
				stationery, colours, clothes etc. then having real objects to 
				talk about and describe is motivating and memorable.&nbsp; The 
				same applies to lots of adjective teaching, of course.</li>
				<li>Notices, adverts and mini-texts:<br />
				many institutions have places for people to post notices.&nbsp; 
				Exploit them.</li>
				<li>Newspapers, brochures and magazines:<br />
				can form the basis for a huge range of lessons (not just those 
				focused on reading skills).&nbsp; Get your learners to gather 
				them, if possible.&nbsp; Be careful to remember that newspapers 
				contain a large range of different text types and each one 
				requires a different set of skills to access it.</li>
				<li>Most of us carry 15 or so items with us at 
				all times.<br />
				In a class of ten, you have a potential 150 objects to talk 
				about and describe.&nbsp; Ask people to take one object from 
				their pocket, handbag, rucksack etc. and explain to a partner or 
				the class what it is and why it's important.</li>
				<li>Personal things:<br />
				a useful set of lessons can be built around the learners 
				bringing to class a small object that is, in some way, 
				significant for them and explaining to others what it is, how 
				they acquired it and why it's significant.</li>
