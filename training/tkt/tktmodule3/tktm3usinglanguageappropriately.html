				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well done.&nbsp; That was really good.</em><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, OK.&nbsp; Why is that the

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are those who will tell you that we should avoid 
			<span class="boldblue">the use of 
			the learners' first language</span> where possible.&nbsp; We want to establish an English-only environment because:</p>
			<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
				<li>With some classes it just isn't possible to do anything 
				else.&nbsp; Some classes have a mix of first languages and you 
				are unlikely to know them all.&nbsp; Having a group who mostly 
				but not all speak a particular language is sometimes challenging 
				because the majority can exclude the minority.</li>
				<li>We want people to start thinking and interacting in English 
				even when they are only using the language for social purposes 
				in the classroom.</li>
				<li>We do not want to encourage people to translate everything 
				into their first language(s) because:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li class="greenbullet">it slows down the speaking, reading 
					and listening processes in particular.</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">translation between languages is 
					rarely precise because words cover different concepts and 
					may be used in different styles, like this:<br />
					<img alt="translate" height="100" src="../imagestkt/translate.png" width="200" /></li>
					<li class="greenbullet">translation is a specialist skill and not one that most of 
				our learners will need.</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">It encourages learners to see English 
				through the medium of their first languages and not on its own 
				terms.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>

				<dt><strong>For safety reasons</strong></dt>
				<dd>You do not want a learner to misunderstand<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't touch 
				that!&nbsp; It's very hot.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>For counselling and pastoral care reasons</strong></dt>
				<dd>Especially with younger learners, you need to be able to 
				respond to social problems sensitively and helpfully.&nbsp; That 
				is often best done in the learner's first language.</dd>
				<dt><strong>With very elementary groups</strong></dt>
				<dd>The sooner you can teach the chunks for the language 
				functions people need, the better (there is a guide to 
				identifying learners' language which covers this point more 
				thoroughly later on this course).&nbsp; However, at 
				the outset of learning, it is often quicker and more efficient 
				to give instructions and some explanations in the learners' 
				first language.</dd>
				<dt><strong>With abstract concepts or unusual words</strong></dt>
				<dd>A concept such as <em>a cosy relationship</em> is actually 
				very difficult to define in other English words so recourse to 
				translation is an option.<br />
				Unusual words, for example, for some types of machines or 
				animals, may only be needed for a few minutes to understand a 
				text and it is not worth spending time trying to draw pictures 
				of things like <em>ferret</em> (it is one of these):<br />
				<img alt="ferret" height="133" src="../../images/animals_ferret200.jpg" width="200" />)</dd>
				<dt><strong>When comparing languages</strong></dt>
				<dd>Learners' first languages are often seen as a source of 
				error but they are also a resource for learning.<br />
				For example, related languages will often have similar 
				structures.&nbsp; Drawing learner's' attention to the fact can 
				be a useful shortcut.<br />
				Related languages will also have cognate words (words which come 
				from the same source) and, while some will carry different 
				meanings, most will be the same.&nbsp; That's another useful 
				shortcut to meaning.<br />
				It is often useful to know how our first language differs from a 
				language we are learning so we can be alert to the differences 
				and avoid errors caused by word-for-word translation.</dd>
