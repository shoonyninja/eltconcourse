			<p>Probably, not all of the text types you read or listened to are 
			in this list.&nbsp; It is very difficult to predict what people will 
			hear and read and why.&nbsp; That is one reason that teaching the 
			area is quite difficult.</p>

					<h2>Text purposes</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>All writers and speakers write and speak for a reason.&nbsp; The 
			purpose of the text will often determine:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>How the text is organised:<br />
				this is called the
				<span class="boldblue">staging</span>.&nbsp; This refers to how 
				the information is presented conventionally in English.<br />
				For example, we know, when we are reading a news report, that 
				the main event will probably be described in the first paragraph 
				and the outcome with any future action will be presented at the 
				end.&nbsp; This knowledge allows us to access the text quickly 
				and find what we want.</li>
				<li>What <span class="boldblue">language forms</span> are in the 
				text:<br />
				this includes, for example, types of conjunction, tenses, 
				verb types, prepositional phrases, modal auxiliary verbs and so on.<br />
				For example, a recipe will often include adverbs which show the 
				ordering of actions such as <em>firstly, then, finally </em>etc. but a 
				news report will often begin in the present perfect (to show it 
				is relevant to and has changed the present) as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Three men have been arrested at Gatwick airport<br />
				</em>but after the first paragraph, the tense will often be past 
				simple to related what happened as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Police were alerted to the vehicle by a member of the 
				public<br />
				</em>and, at the end, the tense form will often refer to the 
				present or the&nbsp;future as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The men will appear in court on Thursday, charged with 
				...</em></li>
				<li>The <span class="boldblue">layout</span> of the text:<br />
				this 
				includes whether it comes with pictures, graphics or different 
				sizes and types of print 
				(written texts), with film clips, gestures, graphics or special 
				effects (spoken texts) and so on.<br />
				For example, a news 
				report will often come with a general picture of the scene (and 
				often a map of the area) but a letter will not but will have the 
				conventional addresses, dates and so on in recognisable places.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If we know the purpose of a text. it will often make 
			understanding it very much easier because we will know where to look 
			for information and when to listen carefully.<br />
			This is called <span class="boldblue">generic knowledge</span>.</p>
			<table class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td valign="top">

			<p class="auto-style45"><strong>What sort of text?</strong></p>
			<ul id="texttypes" class="bluebullet" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li class="bluebullet">The first text is a newspaper 
				article:<ul class="greenbullet">
					<li class="greenbullet">It has a banner headline to catch 
					the eye</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">There is a large graphic to intrigue 
					the reader</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">The text is divided into columns</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">Paragraphs are short and spread out 
					to make reading easy</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="bluebullet">The second text is a technical 
				article of some kind:<ul>
					<li class="greenbullet">The title comes in two parts</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">The authors' names are at the top</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">There is a subtitle which is 
					probably 'Abstract' or 'Summary'</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">There's a graphic</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">The text is dense and continuous</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="bluebullet">The third text is a recipe:<ul>
					<li class="greenbullet">There's a picture of the finished 
					meal</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">There's a list of ingredients</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">The procedure is numbered in stages</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="bluebullet"><strong>Important information</strong><ul>
					<li class="greenbullet">Text 1: the first paragraph will set 
					the scene: when, where, who?&nbsp; The final paragraph will 
					sum up the situation.&nbsp; Everything in between can be 
					ignored.</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">Text 2: the abstract at the 
					beginning will tell you if you need to read it.&nbsp; At the 
					end there will probably be a summary of the main points and 
					that will often include suggestions for further research and 
					work.&nbsp; 
					Detail will be in the text.</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">Text 3: the list of ingredients will 
					tell you if you have what's needed.&nbsp; All the text is 
					important because it is a set of instructions.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If we know a little about the topic of the text, it will also make 
			understanding easier.&nbsp; This is known as using
			<span class="boldblue">knowledge of the world</span> to help us 
			understand.<br />
			For example, when reading a news story about a terrorist alert at an 
			airport, we can bring our knowledge of the people involved (police, 
			anti-terrorist specialists, immigration officers etc.) and places 
			(long-stay car parks, immigration control, departure lounges etc.) 
			to the text so we can also predict who will be involved and what 
			happened.<br />
			We can also bring our knowledge of the world to other sorts of text 
			so, for example, if we are reading an email from a friend, we will 
			already share lots of information so we know who and what is 
			referred if someone writes about <em>my sister</em> or <em>my job</em> 
			and we do not need to have that information in the text.<br />
			We also bring our general knowledge to specialist texts in 
			professional fields, of course, so someone who is concerned with an 
			area will not need to have everything explained.&nbsp; You are doing 
			this now because we have talked here about things like verb tenses 
			and conjunctions and assume, because you are a teacher of English, 
			that you know what is meant by these terms.</p>

			<p>Knowing <strong>why</strong> we are reading or listening to a 
			text helps us to decide <strong>how</strong> to read or listen.&nbsp; 
			To explain:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Listening:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>When we are dealing with some listening texts, for 
					example, a set of instructions or a waiter explaining what's 
					in a dish, it's important that we understand nearly 
					everything.&nbsp; If miss something important we may make a 
					serious mistake or get the wrong meal.<br />
					Some listening settings allow us to interrupt and ask for 
					clarification or repetition, e.g., the work instructions or 
					the waiter's explanation.&nbsp; Some settings, such as 
					lectures, don't allow that, so it's important to be even more 
					careful.<br />
					This is called <span class="boldblue">intensive listening</span>.</li>
					<li>Typically, in a TV news programme, people will watch and 
					listen quite casually until a key word or picture alerts 
					them to an item of interest.&nbsp; Then they switch listening 
					mode and pay more attention.&nbsp; Travel announcements are 
					often dealt with this way.&nbsp; If we recognise that the 
					announcement does not concern our journey, we just switch 
					off until the next one comes along.<br />
					This kind of 
					listening is called <span class="boldblue">monitor listening</span>.</li>
					<li>A TV soap opera or an anecdote might require some 
					attention but as long as we get the gist of what's going on, 
					it isn't usually necessary (or possible) to catch every word 
					and every nuance.&nbsp; Typically, an anecdote is told 
					face-to-face or over the 'phone so in this case we also need 
					occasionally to show interest and comprehension.&nbsp; We do that 
					through what's called <span class="boldblue">back channelling</span> (grunts, 
					exclamations such as <em>oh, really?, wow, gosh</em> etc., nods, 
					smiles etc.).<br />
					We are <span class="boldblue">gist listening</span>.&nbsp; 
					This is also known as <span class="boldblue">extensive 
					listening</span> because we do not need to understand 
					everything we hear.</li>
					<li>Finally, some texts require our full attention, even to 
					the point of making notes to help us recall important 
					information.&nbsp; Here, we need particularly to pay attention to 
					the speaker's signals.&nbsp; For example, something beginning<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Here's the key point: ...<br />
					</em>is likely to be important but 
					something beginning<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, ...<br />
					</em>can probably be 
					safely ignored.<br />
					This is a difficult skill because it combines monitoring, 
					listening for gist and intensive listening.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Reading:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>When we are dealing with some written texts, for example, a recipe or a 
			set of instructions, it's important that we understand 
			nearly everything.&nbsp; If the book says <em>twist anti-clockwise</em> 
			or <em>do not allow it to boil</em>, it's important that we get it 
			right.&nbsp; Fortunately, when we read, we can usually take the time 
					to re-read as often as we like and use a dictionary when we 
					don't understand.<br />
					Typically, study texts (such as this one) or texts with very 
					important information (instructions at work, information 
					about finance and tax and so on) also require this approach.&nbsp; 
					We may even have to take notes!<br />
					This is <span class="boldblue">intensive reading</span>.</li>
					<li>Typically, on a news website, people will run their eyes across the 
			links looking for a story that interests them and then access the 
			text for a more detailed look at the information.<br />
					Even when we 
			are quite interested in a story, we still often won't read every 
			word, preferring to skip to the important (for us) bits of the 
			story.<br />
					Similarly, other texts, such a bus timetable require us just 
					to look for what we need.&nbsp; 
			We can't usually just read from top to bottom, left to right 
			because we don't want the information from most of the text.&nbsp; 
			We only want to know when the next bus goes to where we want to be.&nbsp; If you are looking for a name in a telephone 
			directory, you don't start at page one and read till you find it.<br />
					This is called <span class="boldblue">scanning or scan 
					reading</span>.</li>
					<li>Depending on how much we are engaged, reading a novel requires a 
			different approach, too.&nbsp; We will usually read with some care 
			and even back-track to re-read sections but we can ignore parts of 
			the text and simply follow the story.&nbsp; If we are getting a 
			bit bored, we may even start to glance through the text to find out what 
			happened in the story.<br />
					Ignoring whole parts and just getting the gist is called
					<span class="boldblue">skimming or skim reading</span>.&nbsp; 
					This is also called <span class="boldblue">extensive reading</span> 
					because it is not necessary to understand every word.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>

		<p>It's clear, then, that we use different skills depending on:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style13">
			<li><strong>the sorts of text we are accessing</strong></li>
			<li><strong>our reasons for accessing it</strong></li>

				<dd>using your knowledge of the world in general to understand 
				what you read or hear.&nbsp; For example, if you know that

				locate specific information.&nbsp; You did this at the beginning 
				of the guide.<br />
				using your knowledge of the topic to help you understand.&nbsp; 
				For example, if you are an expert gardener, you will know how to 
				do a lot of things with plants and can recognise words like <em>
				dibber, wheelbarrow, shears, espalier</em> etc. so can focus on 
				the new material in a text (spoken or written).</dd>
				<dt><span class="boldblue">Bottom-up processing</span> concerns 
				using your formal linguistic knowledge of:</dt>
				<dd>the pronunciation of English to distinguish, e.g., between
				<em>pin</em> and <em>bin</em>.<br />
				lexis and how it is pronounced to understand meaning in a 
				written or spoken text.<br />
				intonation to understand a speaker's emotional state and 
				intention.<br />
				the grammar of the language to distinguish, e.g., between<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
				arrived<br />

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has arrived</em><br />
				conjunctions, cohesive devices such as pronouns and sequencers to identify
