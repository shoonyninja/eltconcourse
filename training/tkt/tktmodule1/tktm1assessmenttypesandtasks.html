		<p>Trick question?<br />
		No, not really.&nbsp; The point is that any of these activities can be
		<strong>seen</strong> as a form of testing.&nbsp; You are asking 
		questions or setting tasks to find something out about the learners' 
		abilities.<br />
		We can take them one at a time:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><em>a public examination</em></dt>
	<dd>This sort of test is instantly recognisable to most of us.&nbsp; It is 
	usually a very formal procedure with strict rules for its conduct.&nbsp; TKT 
	is a form of public examination test, of course.</dd>
			<dt><em>doing that exercise</em></dt>
			<dd>In this case, the exercise is only marginally a test because the 
			only person who will look at the result is you.&nbsp; However, in a 
			classroom, you might set a task like this to find out what people already 
			know.</dd>
			<dt><em>asking someone if she understands</em></dt>
			<dd>this is a kind of test but it's a pretty poor one because the 
			answer won't tell you a great deal.&nbsp; Many learners will say 
			yes, even if they don't.&nbsp; A test to avoid.</dd>
			<dt><em>using a multiple-choice exercise</em></dt>
			<dd>You may be using such an exercise as a teaching tool, to alert 
			people to the range of choices, for example.&nbsp; However, most 
			learners will see it as some kind of test and the outcomes will, 
			presumably, be evaluated in some way.&nbsp; So it's a test.</dd>
			<dt><em>saying, "Can you pronounce this word?"</em></dt>
			<dd>This is a test if you want to hear the learner pronounce it 
			rather than being satisfied with an answer like "Yes, thanks" or a 
			nod.</dd>
			<dt><em>using a role play exercise at the end of a lesson</em></dt>
			<dd>The purpose of activities like this is twofold:<br />
			a) they gives the learners an opportunity to use the language in a 
			freer way and make it a bit more personal to them but<br />
			b) they also allows you to discover if they can actually use it in the 
			way you hoped.<br />
			So it's a test.</dd>
			<dt><em>asking what a word means</em></dt>
			<dd>This is clearly a test.&nbsp; You want to know if the person 
			knows the word or not.&nbsp; Be aware, however, that giving an off-the-cuff definition of a word in a foreign language is very challenging (that's what keeps 
			dictionary writers in business). &nbsp;It's perfectly possible to know all you need to know about a word and still not be able to give a neat, clear definition of it.</dd>
			<dt><em>asking a learner to tell you about yesterday</em></dt>
			<dd>This may just be a bit of social chit-chat but in a classroom, 
			many learners will assume they are being tested and their production 
			evaluated.&nbsp; Good teachers will be listening carefully to see 
			how well the learner can do this as well, of course to responding to 
			the content of what the learner says.</dd>

				<li><strong>formal testing: </strong>this is what public examinations are but also what 
					end-of-week or end-of-course tests usually are.<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>formal tests are very often written but can have a

					<li>formal tests are not frequent</li>
					<li>formal tests are usually quite objective (or appear so)</li>
					<li>formal tests often have a set marking scheme (two marks

				<li><strong>informal testing </strong>happens frequently in classrooms<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>can be anything from a simple question to a complicated 
					role play</li>
					<li>requires the teacher and the learners to evaluate rather 
					than assess by recording marks</li>
					<li>does not rely on outcomes being given to the learners 
					although feedback is often supplied somehow</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>formative testing is </strong>quite frequent and 
				often done at the beginning, in 
					the middle or at the end of lessons.&nbsp; It can be formal or informal 
				and is designed to aid the 
				learning process by<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>telling the teacher what has been learnt well so far and 
					what needs more work</li>
					<li>focusing learners on what they have learned and what needs to be learned</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>summative testing</strong> is what happens at the 
				end of a process and is designed to discover how well the 
				targets have been learned.&nbsp; Examples are:<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>a public examination</li>
					<li>an end-of-course written test</li>
					<li>a final speaking exercise in a lesson</li>
					<li>homework tasks</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol></div>
			<p>It is, of course, not always so clear cut.&nbsp; Tests can be:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt class="style_brown"><strong>formative and formal</strong></dt>
	<dd>end-of week tests<br />
	written homework to be handed in and marked etc.</dd>
			<dt class="style_brown"><strong>summative and informal</strong></dt>
			<dd>tasks set at the end of lessons to see what progress has been 
			made<br />
			end-of-course activities which combine many aspects of what has been 
			learned / taught</dd>
			<dt class="style_brown"><strong>summative and formal</strong></dt>
			<dd>end-of-course tests<br />
			public examinations</dd>
			<dt class="style_brown"><strong>formative and informal</strong></dt>
			<dd>checking understanding (<em>Can you tell me what John said?</em>)<br />
			checking pronunciation (<em>How many syllables?&nbsp; Where's the 
			stress?</em>)<br />
			checking grammar (<em>What's the past of 'go'?</em>)</dd>
</dl>
			<p>The last of these is very frequently done because informal, 
			formative testing goes on all the time in classrooms.<br />
			Whenever a teacher is asking a question and whenever a teacher is 
			listening to the learners' production or reading what they have 
			written, informal, formative testing is happening.</p>

		<h3><strong class="boldblue">Validity</strong></h3>
		<p>This is a term you will often hear applied to testing.&nbsp; It means 
		three things:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style6">
			<li>Does the test measure what we say it measures?<br />For example, if we set out to test someone's ability to 
				be part of an informal spoken transaction, do the test items 
				we use actually test that ability or something else?&nbsp; If we 
			are trying to test grammar and structure, are we also testing 
			vocabulary knowledge in the test items?</li>
			<li>Does the test contain a relevant and representative sample 
				of what it is testing?<br />For example, if we are testing someone's ability to write a 
				formal email, are we getting them to deploy the sorts 
				of language they actually need to do that?<br />
			If we are testing whether our learners have mastered the vocabulary 
			we have taught, are we targeting enough items to tell us anything 
			useful?</li>
			<li>Does the test look like a proper test?<br />
			You want your learners to take it seriously so presentation is 
			important.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Simple.&nbsp; Of course, we want our test to be valid so here's a 
		short guide to how to write a good test.<br />
		The test can be formative (in the middle of a course or even a 
		lesson) or it can be summative (coming at the end of a course or series 
		of lessons).</p>
		<p>The process can look like this:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="making a test" height="148" src="../../imagesgraphics/makeatest.png" width="700" /></p>
		<h3>Deciding what to test, prioritising and organising</h3>
		<p>This is where good record-keeping comes in handy.&nbsp; Briefly, this 
		means</p>
		<ul class="greybulletlist">
			<li>looking back and selecting the areas you think need testing.&nbsp; 
			You won't be able to test everything (unless you have taught very 
			little) so</li>
			<li>prioritise the list to make sure you are being fair to all your 
			learners.&nbsp; They will better at some skills than at others so 
			mix it up.</li>
			<li>now break the list down into skills (reading, writing, speaking, 
			listening), grammar and structures, pronunciation and lexis</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Selecting test items and working out how to mark the test</h3>
		<p>Now you have your list, you can decide how to test the items.&nbsp; 
		Many of the task and activity types you met in the last guide (to 
		practice activities and tasks for language and language skills 
		development) can be used for testing as well as practising.&nbsp; You 
		can open that guide in a new tab by clicking
		<a href="tktm1practiceactivitiesandtasks.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		<h4>Types of test tasks</h4>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>true or false</strong></dt>
	<dd>This called an <span class="boldblue">alternate-answer</span> test.&nbsp; You can expand it slightly 
	to include True, False and Don't know (the answer isn't in the text).</dd>
			<dt><strong class="boldblue">multiple-choice</strong></dt>
			<dd>This is sometimes called a fixed-response test.&nbsp; Typically, 
			the correct answer must be chosen from three or four alternatives.&nbsp; 
			The 'wrong' items are called the distractors.&nbsp; TKT is a good 
			example!</dd>
			<dt><strong class="boldblue">structured response</strong></dt>
			<dd>In tests of this sort, you give a structure in which 
			to form the answer.&nbsp; Skeleton sentence items of the sort 
			which require the subject to expand a sentence such as <em>He / come/ my 
			house / yesterday / 9 o'clock</em> into <em>He came to my house at 9 
			o'clock yesterday </em>are tests of this sort.&nbsp; Tests which ask 
			students to write a text but also to include a number of given 
			points are also structured response tests and oral tests in which 
			students are asked to give and get a limited and specified amount of 
			data are also structured response tests.</dd>
			<dt><strong class="boldblue">free response</strong></dt>
			<dd>In these tests, no guidance is given other than the instructions 
			(called the rubric, incidentally) and 
			the learners are free to write or say what they like.&nbsp; A 
			<span class="boldblue">hybrid 
			form</span> of this and a structured response item is one where the subject 
			is given a list of things to include in the response.</dd>

		<p>Some of these items require more judgement by the 
		marker (usually you) than others.<br />
		The more <span class="boldblue">subjective</span> the marking is, the less reliable will be the 
		results so where possible <span class="boldblue">objective</span> 
		marking is better.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<ul class="greybulletlist">
			<li>Items 1 and 2 are either right or wrong so easy to mark but 
			remember that you can get 50% by guessing in item 1, and 25% in item 
			2.&nbsp; You can also get it right even if you don't understand most 
			of the text.</li>
			<li>In item 4, would you accept <em>She didn't play so many games as 
			she wanted to</em> when what you actually wanted was <em>She doesn't 
			play as many sports as she used to</em>?&nbsp; To get round the 
			problem, you can give the learner a selection of words to choose 
			from but that makes it easier, of course.&nbsp; The same issue 
			arises with item 3.</li>
			<li>Item 5 demands most of the marker because you will have to 
			assess against a range of criteria, such as:
			<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
				<li>use of lexis</li>
				<li>accuracy of grammar</li>
				<li>content</li>
				<li>ordering</li>
				<li>use of connectors<br /></li></ul>
				etc.<br />
		That's quite difficult to do and maintain 
		fairness at the same time.</li></ul>
		<p>There are, of course, many more variants and types of test item than 
		we can cover here.&nbsp; Look at tests in coursebooks and be aware that 
		most examination boards and ELT publishers have examples of tests and 
		test types on their websites.&nbsp; Go there for more ideas.<br />
		There is also <a href="../../inservice/background/testing.html">a fuller 
		guide to testing and assessment </a>on this site.</p>
