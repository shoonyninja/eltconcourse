			<p>You were not born with the ability to speak, ride a bicycle, play

			concerns us here are the abilities you <strong>
			<span class="boldblue">naturally develop</span>
			</strong>as opposed to those which you are <strong class="boldblue">taught</strong>.</p>
			<p>Some of this is quite easy.&nbsp; Divide this list into learned 
			(i.e., taught or self-taught) abilities and those which naturally 
			develop in <strong>all</strong> normal children:<br />
			Click on the table when you have done that.</p>

			<p>It is clear that some behaviours, such as the ability to grasp 
			objects or walk are biologically determined because all children, 
			regardless of their culture, learn to do it pretty much at the same 
			stage in their development.&nbsp; For example, most babies learn to 
			sit, then roll over, then crawl and finally walk between the first 9 
			to 12 months of life.&nbsp; None, however, has 
			to be taught the skill.<br />
			Babies in all cultures learn to talk between 18 and 28 months of 
			life.<br />
			Some behaviours are never naturally acquired so if you never learn 
			to ride a bicycle or play a decent game of chess, you will not 
			magically develop the ability to do so, no matter how long you live.</p>

			<p>In their first languages, children often use irregular forms and then revert to an 
			inaccurate regular form before once more acquiring the irregular 
			form.&nbsp; So, for example, a child may produce<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mice ran up 
			the clock<br />
			</em>then begin to say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mouses runned up the clock<br />
			</em>before settling on the correct version later.<br />
			If this is true, the importance is obvious: it means that language 
			cannot be being acquired by simple imitation and practice.&nbsp; If 
			it were, children would never produce something like *<em>comed</em> 
			instead of <em>came</em> for the simple reason that they would never 
			hear it.</p>

			<p>Children speak the language(s) 
			in which they were raised.&nbsp; A child taken from an English-speaking 
			environment at an early age and raised in an Urdu-speaking 
			environment will acquire Urdu as its first language.<br />
			The theory is that imitation must have a role to play because you cannot 
			understand the meaning of a word from its form so 
			you must hear it spoken in a clear context to be able to imitate its 
			use.</p>
			<p>There are some problems:</p>
			<ol >
				<li>Children's speech is different from adults' speech<br />
				Children do not produce fully formed sentences.&nbsp; They progress from 1-word utterances (acquired 
				around 12 months) to 2-word utterances (around 18 months) and 
				then go on to more complex sentences.</li>
				<li>The U-shaped learning curve<br />
				If imitation were all there was to acquiring language, then the 
				U-shaped curve, going from correct production of irregular forms 
				to recognition of the 
				irregularity (e.g., from <em>went</em> via <em>goed</em> and 
				then back to <em>went</em>) would not occur because a child 
				would very rarely, if ever, hear the incorrect form in order to 
				imitate it.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>relevance to (English) language teaching</h3>
			<p>A number of approaches to and techniques in teaching languages 
			appear to be based on the assumption that people learn language by a 
			process of imitation of a model.<br />
			Why do you drill in a classroom if you don't believe imitation and 
			repetition are 
			effective?</p>

					correction and reward</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The theory claims that children learn to produce correct language 
			because they are praised and rewarded (by adult approval) when they 
			do and are corrected when they don't.<br />
			Here's a 
			very brief summary:<br />
		<img alt="behaviourism" height="164" src="../../imagesgraphics/behaviourism465.png" width="465" /></p>
			<ol>
				<li>The process starts with a stimulus, say, a question from a carer such as <em>Who 
			did you see?</em> put to the 
			organism (in this case, a child).&nbsp; The stimulus 
			can elicit a variety of responses but only the 'right' one will be 
			reinforced.</li>
			<li>So, for example, if the child responds with <em>I seed Tom</em> the 
			carer will negatively reinforce it with <em>No, 
			say 'I saw Tom'</em>.</li>
			<li>If, eventually, the carer can persuade the child to produce a 
			correct utterance, the response will be rewarded (i.e., reinforced) 
			with something like<em> Oh! That's lovely! </em>and the child will learn the form.</li>
			<li>Enough Stimulus &gt; Response &gt; Reinforcement cycles will see the 
			habit instilled and the language acquired.</li>
		</ol>
			<p>There are three problems with the theory.</p>
			<ol >
				<li>If a child produces a well formed but untrue 
				statement, carers are more likely to correct it or at least 
				avoid reinforcing it.&nbsp; So a true but incorrectly formed 
				statement may receive praise and a correctly formed but untrue 
				statement will receive censure of some kind.</li>
				<li>Cuteness will be reinforced<br />
				Carers and other adults have frequently been observed 
				reinforcing false structure and lexical use simply because it is 
				cute and endearing.&nbsp; Thus <em>Choo-choo Bang-bang!</em> 
				while meaningless, uncommunicative and poorly formed may produce 
				a positive response in doting adults.</li>
				<li>Even when adults do focus on correcting form, the research 
				shows that it is almost wholly ineffective.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>relevance to (English) language teaching</h3>
			<p>Much that is recommended in classrooms in terms of praising 
			learners and error correction is based (even implicitly) on this 
			kind of behaviourist theorising.&nbsp; It is a short step from 
			asserting that all learners respond positively to praise and that 
			praise motivates them to perform better to suggesting that 
			reinforcing acceptable language will lead to the instilling of 
			correct language habits.</p>

					<td class="auto-style12"><h2><span class="boldblue">Active Construction of a Grammar</span> 
					Theory</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The theory is a little like Innateness theory.<br />
			For example, a French child 
			will notice that in the language it hears, the adjective normally 
			follows the noun (un 
			évènement fantastique).<br />
			A 
			child in an English-speaking environment will hear, by contrast,<em> 
			a fantastic event</em> and notice that English is an 
			adjective–noun language.<br />
			Enough exposure will result in the 
			knowledge becoming permanently fixed.<br />
			Such hypothesising about language form neatly explains the U-shaped 
			learning curve described in this guide.&nbsp; When first acquired, 
			the rule is applied indiscriminately and then it is later amended to 
			account for exceptions.</p>
			<h3>relevance to (English) language teaching</h3>
			<p>If learners (of whatever age) of a second or subsequent language 
			are applying this kind of rule-forming behaviour to the 
			language they hear then concepts such as noticing and the 
			positive role of error become even more important.</p>
