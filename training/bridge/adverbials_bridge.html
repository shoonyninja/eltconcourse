			<p>On most initial training courses, the term <em>adverb</em> will have been 
			discussed and on some, the term <em>adverbial</em> may have been mentioned.&nbsp; 
			The usual outcome is that graduates of such courses remain slightly 
			unsure about the difference so we'll start with some simple 
			definitions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>An adverb is a member of an open word class (like noun, verb, 
				adjective etc., meaning that we can invent new ones) which 
				usually modifies a verb, another adverb or an adjective 
				(although some can modify other items such as prepositional 
				phrases).&nbsp; They provide more information about the situation or 
				event.&nbsp; Here are some <span class="style_black"><strong>
				<em>examples</em></strong></span>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived <span class="style_black">
				<strong>yesterday</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was <span class="style_black"><strong>very</strong></span> careful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They did the work <span class="style_black"><strong>extremely</strong></span> 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>thoroughly</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went <span class="style_black"><strong>upstairs</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car broke <span class="style_black"><strong>down</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He jogged <span class="style_black"><strong>frequently</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_black"><strong>carefully</strong></span> 
				opened the envelope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>Stupidly</strong></span>, I 
				forgot my keys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am <span class="style_black"><strong>dead</strong></span> 
				against the idea</em></li>
				<li>An adverbial is <span class="style_underline"><strong>any</strong></span> 
				word or phrase which modifies the meaning of a verb or verb 
				phrase.&nbsp; Here are some <span class="style_black"><strong>
				<em>examples</em></strong></span> of adverbials which are 
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>not</strong></span> 
				adverbs:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived <span class="style_black"><strong>the day before yesterday</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going <span class="style_black"><strong>up the stairs</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had spoken<span class="style_black"><strong> in Italian</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car drove <span class="style_black"><strong>over his foot</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He jogged <span class="style_black"><strong>most mornings</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived <span class="style_black"><strong>in a foul temper</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened the envelope <span class="style_black"><strong>because he wanted to read the letter</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>Last night</strong></span> 
				I watched television<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>Despite the rain</strong></span> 
				I went for a walk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>In general</strong></span>, 
				that's a useful idea</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Briefly, then:</p>
			<ul class="purple_bullet">
				<li>all adverbs can act as adverbials but not all adverbials are 
				adverbs.</li>
				<li>adverbs have multiple functions, modifying verbs, adjectives 
				and other adverbs but adverbials only modify verbs and verb 
				phrases.</li>
				<li>many adverbs end in -<em>ly</em> but many do not so we 
				cannot know by looking at a word whether it is an adverb or not.&nbsp; 
				We have to see what it does, not what it looks like.</li>
				<li>many adverbials consist of phrases or clauses but adverbs 
				are usually single words or combinations of two or more adverbs.</li>
			</ul>

			</table>
			<p>In that little test, there were two items which were neither 
			adverbs nor adverbials.&nbsp; They were:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They hammered it <span class="style_black"><strong>flat</strong></span></em><br />
			which is actually an adjective.&nbsp; Although it looks like it is 
			modifying the verb, it is actually modifying the pronoun <em>it</em>.&nbsp; 
			It refers to what <em>it</em> will look like when the hammering is 
			finished.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a </em><span class="style_black">
			<strong><em>timely</em></strong></span><em> interruption<br />
			</em>in which the word is actually an adjective modifying the noun
			<em>interruption</em>, although, because it ends in -<em>ly</em>, it 
			looks like an adverb.&nbsp; There are plenty of adjectives in 
			English which end in -<em>ly</em> and look like adverbs but aren't.&nbsp; 
			Other examples include:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brotherly, costly, early, friendly, ghastly, leisurely, lively, 
			lonely, motherly, silly </em>and more.<br />
			Beware.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Because adverbs and adverbials do similar jobs in the language 
			they resemble each other in many ways but there are also key 
			differences.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Most adverbs can take any of three positions:<br />
				Initial:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>
				Obviously</strong></span>, she was working<br />
				</em>Mid or medial:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was <span class="style_black">
				<strong>obviously</strong></span> working<br />
				</em>Final:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was working, 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>obviously</strong></span><br />
				</em>Most other adverbials come either in initial or final 
				position:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>In the 
				morning</strong></span> she was working<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was working <span class="style_black"><strong>in the 
				morning</strong></span><br />
				</em>but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She <span class="style_black"><strong>in 
				the morning </strong></span>was working</em></li>
				<li>Some adverbs can be particles combining with verbs to make a 
				new meaning (a phrasal verb) so, for example:<br />
				The verb <em>look</em> can combine with the adverb <em>up</em> 
				to make:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked the word
				<span class="style_black"><strong>up</strong></span><br />
				</em>but other adverbials don't do this so, although we can 
				have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked <span class="style_black">
				<strong>at the word</strong></span><br />
				</em>we cannot have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She looked the word at<br />
				</em>because the phrase <em>at the word</em> is an adverbial 
				prepositional phrase telling us something more about the verb
				<em>look</em>.</li>
				<li>Adverbs and adverbials can do the same sorts of job in a 
				sentence and can express:<ol class="auto-style92">
					<li>Place:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrived <span class="style_black">
					<strong>here</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived<span class="style_black"><strong> in the office</strong></span></em></li>
					<li>Manner:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The did it <span class="style_black">
					<strong>well</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They did it <span class="style_black"><strong>with great 
					skill</strong></span></em></li>
					<li>Time:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came <span class="style_black">
					<strong>early</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came <span class="style_black"><strong>before lunch</strong></span></em></li>
					<li>Frequency (a sub-set of time adverbials)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span class="style_black">
					<strong>often</strong></span> argued<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They argued <span class="style_black"><strong>all the time</strong></span></em></li>
					<li>Degree:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They argued <span class="style_black">
					<strong>loudly</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They argued <span class="style_black"><strong>in loud voices</strong></span></em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Because adverbs constitute a word class in their own right, 
				they can only be adverbs (obviously).<br />
				However, adverbials are not a word class, they are a way of 
				modifying verbs, and they are much more flexible.&nbsp; They can 
				be:<ol class="auto-style92">
					<li>Adverbs:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came </em>
					<span class="style_black"><strong><em>here</em></strong></span></li>
					<li>Prepositional phrases:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They went </em>
					<span class="style_black"><strong><em>over the road</em></strong></span></li>
					<li>Clauses:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came </em>
					<span class="style_black"><strong><em>so I could help</em></strong></span></li>
					<li>Noun phrases:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She worked </em>
					<span class="style_black"><strong><em>most days</em></strong></span></li>
					<li>Infinitives:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I play </em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>to win</em></strong></span></li>
				</ol>
				</li>

			</table>
			
			<p>There is a good deal more on this area in the in-service guide to 
			adverbials (linked below) and that guide has links to the three areas considered more in detail.&nbsp; Here, we will quickly 
			summarise the three grammatical roles that adverbials (including 
			adverbs) usually play.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="witch" height="133" src="../images/woman_witch200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style34">
					<h3>Role 1: modifying the verb as part of the clause</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>These are called adjuncts and are the most common grammatical 
			role of adverbials. &nbsp;They form part of the clause in which they 
			appear and serve only to provide more information about the event or 
			situation.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She opened the book <span class="style_black">
			<strong>again</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They came <span class="style_black"><strong>into the garden</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed home <span class="style_black"><strong>in the 
			evening</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_black"><strong>frequently</strong></span> 
			go to the cinema<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="queen" height="133" src="../images/woman_queen200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style34">
					<h3>Role 2: modifying the rest of the clause</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>These are called disjuncts or, sometimes, sentence adverbials, and often come in initial or end 
			position (but don't have to).&nbsp; They can be called sentence 
			adverbials because they modify not just the verb but the whole of 
			the clause with which they are connected.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_black"><strong>Obviously</strong></span>, 
			the weather was too awful to consider going for a walk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a very silly thing to say <span class="style_black">
			<strong>in my opinion</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Money, <span class="style_black"><strong>it seems</strong></span>, 
			will be in short supply<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>Politically</strong></span>, 
			that's not a good idea</em></p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="wayne" src="../images/man_actor_wayne200.jpg" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style34">
					<h3>Role 3: connecting clauses</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>These are called conjuncts (and should not be confused with 
			conjunctions).&nbsp; They act to link clauses together and, 
			therefore, usually occur in the initial position of the second 
			clause or sentence but can occur in 
			medial and end position, too.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The train was late.&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
			<strong>Consequently</strong></span>, I missed the start of the 
			meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lost her keys and <span class="style_black"><strong>
			therefore</strong></span> borrowed mine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was persuasive.&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>
			However</strong></span>, the meeting was still not convinced.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to go now, <span class="style_black"><strong>
			otherwise</strong></span>, we'll miss the train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was expensive.&nbsp; It was, <span class="style_black">
			<strong>however</strong></span>, well done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had very little money.&nbsp; She dressed expensively,
			<span class="style_black"><strong>nevertheless</strong></span>.</em></p>
