			<h1>The Bridge: Deixis</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="man" height="207" src="../images/man_working_exist310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Deixis is not a word that you are likely to have come across on 
			most initial training courses.&nbsp; You will, however, have come 
			across the phenomenon because, unless you attended a rather odd 
			course, the topic of reported or indirect speech will have been 
			mentioned at some time (we hope).<br />
			This is not just about reported speech but it explains the 
			phenomenon very well and goes a bit further.</p>
			<p>This is also not an area that you would generally set out to teach 
			but, when it comes to responding to error or to explaining 
			structure, you cannot live without some understanding of how English 
			refers to here, me and now and not here, not me and not now.&nbsp; 
			That's what deixis is all about.</p>
			<p>The word itself, which is pronounced /ˈdeɪksɪs/, by the way, 
			comes from a Greek word meaning <em>reference</em> and means showing or 
			indicating.&nbsp; It concerns, in language studies, how we say 
			where, who and when things are.<br />
			An example or two will help:<br />
			If we say, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was there with her then</em><br />
			we are clearly pointing to three facts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The place is not near the speaker (we use <em>there</em> not
				<em>here</em>)</li>
				<li>The person the speaker was with is not being addressed and 
				is probably not present (that's the sense of the third person 
				represented by <em>her</em>)</li>
				<li>The time is not in the present for the speaker (we use <em>
				then</em> not <em>now</em>)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>However, if we say, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I was with you here then</em><br />
			the case is altered and the facts are now:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The place is near the speaker</li>
				<li>The person the speaker was with is present (or at least 
				being directly addressed)</li>
				<li>The time is still not in the present for the speaker</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Other languages operate differently in this regard and that is a 
			source of considerable error.</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>In most languages, not all, the centre of deixis is the speaker 
			him/herself, the speaker's position and the speaker's present.&nbsp; 
			The centre is, however, sometimes moved and that is a phenomenon 
			that all languages do not share.</p>

			<p>Most European languages, including English, have a fairly simple 
			system of deixis for people.<br />
			So, in English:</p>
			<ul class="purple_bullet">
				<li><em>I</em> refers the speaker alone.</li>
				<li><em>You</em> refers to the hearer and may be singular or 
				plural.</li>
				<li><em>We</em> refers to the speaker plus one or more which may 
				or may not include <em>you.</em>&nbsp; The pronoun may also 
				include <em>they</em> so, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Houston, we have a problem</em><br />
				may refer to the speaker and the speaker's companion(s) (<em>he, 
				she </em>or<em> they</em>) but not the hearer (<em>you</em>) or it may refer to 
				the speaker including the hearer, <em>you,</em> when addressing a third 
				party.</li>
				<li><em>He, she, it, they</em> refer to people other than the 
				speaker and cannot include the hearer.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other possibilities exist.<br />
			Some languages have a pronoun for <em>we</em> which always excludes 
			the hearer and another which always includes the hearer.&nbsp; So a 
			distinction can be made between:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; We are leaving </em>(without <em>you</em>)<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall we go? </em>(including <em>you</em>)<br />
			Some languages have a pronoun for <em>they</em> which includes <em>
			you</em> and another which excludes <em>you</em>.<br />
			Many languages (in fact most) distinguish singular and plural forms 
			of all pronouns.<br />
			Many languages also express the level of familiarity which is 
			appropriate and some have more than two levels.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="here" height="133" src="../images/earth_offset200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h3>Place</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style4">
					<em><strong>You are here</strong></em></td>
					<td>
					&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>All reference to place, in the normal course of events, is centred 
			on the speaker or writer's location.&nbsp; We have, therefore:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>there</em> and <em>here</em> (far from the speaker and 
				close to the speaker)</li>
				<li><em>this</em> and <em>these</em>, <em>that</em> and <em>those</em> (things 
				near to and far from the speaker)</li>
				<li><em>left</em> and <em>right</em> (from the speaker's 
				viewpoint)</li>
				<li><em>up</em> and <em>down</em> (from here)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.</p>
			<p>English has only two locational viewpoints in terms of proximity 
			(<em>here</em> and <em>there</em>, <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> 
			etc.) but it used to have a third possibility which referred to a 
			distal form and expresses something far away from both the speaker 
			and the hearer.&nbsp; An example in Middle English, now almost 
			obsolete is <em>yonder</em> but the modern English <em>beyond</em> 
			carries a similar sense.<br />
			Some languages, such as Turkish and Japanese, employ distal 
			expressions, incidentally, and speakers of those languages may be 
			surprised that English does not, making them unable to express a 
			common thought in their own language in a natural way in English.</p>
			<p>There are two sorts of location:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Absolute position which cannot be altered if the speaker 
				moves.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The post office is opposite the station</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is on top of the hill</em><br />
				in which it makes no difference at all where the speaker is 
				positioned.</li>
				<li>Relative position which depends on the speaker's location.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is on the left</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The church is behind the bridge</em><br />
				which will, of course vary depending on where the speaker and 
				hearer are (or are imagined to be).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>How languages deal with absolute and relative position is 
			variable and may result in some error as we shall see.</p>

					<td class="auto-style4">
					<strong><em class="auto-style4">Right now</em></strong></td>

					&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>In almost all languages, time is based on the present so all 
			tense forms (where they exists at all) are defined with reference to 
			now (the deictic centre).<br />
			There, unfortunately, the similarities end.</p>
			<p>English makes two fundamental distinctions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Absolute time not related to any other time.&nbsp; For 
				example<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William Smith died in 1839<br />
				</em>in which it is irrelevant when the sentence is uttered<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train arrives at 17:30<br />
				</em>which is true whenever it is said</li>
				<li>Relative time which can only be understood by reference to 
				an absolute time.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has arrived<br />
				</em>which can only be understood with reference to now<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had lost the money<br />
				</em>which can only be understood with reference to another 
				event in the past<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have finished the work<br />
				</em>which can only be understood with reference to another 
				event in the future</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The same distinctions apply to time adverbials so, for example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Absolute adverbials include:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday 24th March 2019<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; during World War I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the winter of 1963<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since 1990</em><br />
				are all comprehensible without reference to the deictic centre.</li>
				<li>Relative adverbials are far more common and include, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recently<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; afterwards<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tens years ago</em><br />
				all of which need the hearer / reader to know the reference 
				point from which they are taken.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Other languages chop up time in different ways and may rely on 
			concepts not of absolute and relative times but of uncompleted and 
			completed events or actions, time close to or distant from other 
			times and so on.<br />
			Concepts of time are not universals.</p>

					<td class="auto-style3">

					</td>

			<p>This is where languages differ most and the source of 
			considerable error.</p>

			<p>In English, some tense forms can only be understood if the hearer 
			mentally shifts time from now to the future or past.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went yesterday<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm leaving tomorrow<br />
			</em>are both comprehensible by viewing the events from now (the 
			usual deictic centre).<br />
			However,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will have finished soon<br />
			</em>is only comprehensible if the hearer first moves the centre to 
			the future and then imagines looking back from then.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had been running<br />
			</em>is also only understood if the hearer mentally moves the time 
			centre back into the past and then looks back from then.<br />
			Other languages do not do this kind of thing or, if they do, do 
			things very differently.</p>
			<p>When speech is reported there are two options:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The time of speaking and the time of reporting are close 
				together, in which case:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am waiting"<br />
				</em>is reported as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he is waiting<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am arriving tomorrow"<br />
				</em>is reported as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he is arriving tomorrow.</em></li>
				<li>The time of speaking and the time of reporting differ 
				substantially, in 
				which case:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am waiting"<br />
				</em>is reported as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he was waiting<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am arriving tomorrow"<br />
				</em>is reported as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he was arriving the next day<br />
				</em>For more on the alterations we make to take the deictical 
				centre into account, see the guide to reported speech linked 
				below.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="change" height="133" src="../images/face_change200.jpg" width="200" /></td>

					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style4">
					<em><strong>Who is she?</strong></em></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Again, in reported speech, this can become quite complicated 
			because it depends who is doing the talking and who the reporting.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>If the reporter and the reported are the same person or 
				people then:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are coming"<br />
				</em>may be reported as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We said we are coming<br />
				</em>or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We said we were coming<br />
				</em>depending on whether there is a change in time.</li>
				<li>If the reporter and the reported are different people, other 
				adjustments need to be made, so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are coming"<br />
				</em>may be reported as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They said they were coming<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are welcome"<br />
				</em>as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me I was welcome<br />
				</em>etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is not necessarily intuitive.</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="mars" height="133" src="../images/mars_a200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h3>Changing place</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style4">
					<em><strong>You are not here</strong></em></td>
					<td>
					&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>This is the area that gives people the most trouble.</p>
			<p>In reported speech, similar issues apply as we saw above so, for 
			example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>If the place of reporting is the same as the spoken words, 
				then:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are coming"<br />
				</em>may be reported as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They said they are coming<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will be here"<br />
				</em>may be reported as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she would be here</em></li>
				<li>If the place changes, then other adjustments must be made:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pass me that hammer"<br />
				</em>may become<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked me to pass him this hammer<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sit on the left"<br />
				</em>may be reported as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me to sit on the right<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will be there"<br />
				</em>may be reported as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he would be here<br />
				</em>and there are numerous other possible complications 
				discussed in the guide linked below.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Some verbs in English are commonly used with a mental change to 
			the centre of deixis which are not parallelled in other languages.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A sentence such as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to see my mother tomorrow</em><br />
				is clearly understood as movement away from here, hence the 
				choice of verb.<br />
				However, if the hearer and my mother live close to each other, I 
				may prefer:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am coming to see my mother</em><br />
				because English speakers often move the centre to the person 
				they are addressing.&nbsp; It's a sign of politeness.<br />
				Furthermore, if I am speaking to my mother, most English 
				speakers will move the centre of deixis to the mother rather 
				than the speaker so the natural form will be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am coming to see you tomorrow.<br />
				</em>and other languages may well prefer:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to see you tomorrow<br />
				</em>because the centre of deixis remains on the speaker in all 
				circumstances.</li>
				<li>A sentence such as:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please bring a bottle to the party<br />
				</em>will be understood to mean that the party giver is speaking 
				to a party goer, hence the choice of <em>bring</em>, not <em>
				take</em>.<br />
				However, when the bottle-bringer speaks, we may have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll bring a bottle to your party, of 
				course</em><br />
				because the speaker has moved the centre from themselves to the 
				hearer.<br />
				In many languages, that will be expressed as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll take a bottle to your party</em><br />
				with no change in the centre.</li>
				<li>Even in writing, the same centre movement is observable in 
				English.<br />
				When giving directions, it is common for the writer / speaker to 
				move the centre to the standpoint of the reader / hearer so we 
				find, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn right off the main road and when you see the green 
				pub sign on the left, my house is just on the left before the 
				petrol station</em><br />
				although from the writer / speaker's point of view the turn may 
				be to the left, the sign on the right and the house is probably 
				where they are at the moment and after the petrol station, not 
				before it.<br />
				Other languages do not necessarily do that.</li>
