	<h1>The Bridge: Clause patterns</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="pattern" height="207" src="../images/windows_pattern310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This is not a topic that you will probably set out to teach 
			tomorrow and, for that reason, does not often appear as a separate 
			issue to be considered on initial training courses.<br />
			However, an understanding of clause structures in English is crucial 
			if you are to be in any position to help your learners unravel the 
			way sentences can be put together in the language.<br />
			The patterns we shall analyse here can act as templates for 
			innumerable grammatically correct sentences in English and, once 
			mastered, will mean that you and your learners have a sound basis 
			for teaching and constructing acceptable syntax.</p>
			<p>We will only be considering normally ordered active sentences in 
			English and not exotic passives or causatives, for example, in order 
			to keep things simple and clear.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="ingredients" height="166" src="../images/ingredients_a250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style4">
					<h2>The ingredients of clauses</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Before we can go much further, we need to get some terms 
			straight.&nbsp; In any initial training course worth its while (and 
			any secondary school for that matter), you will have encountered the 
			fact that any sentence can be divided into two parts.&nbsp; For 
			example, the sentences:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>John met a friend yesterday</em></li>
				<li><em>The friend was a bank manager</em></li>
				<li><em>The oil spilled onto the floor</em></li>
				<li><em>The floor was filthy</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>all have two parts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The Subject: <em>John, The friend, The oil</em> and <em>The 
				floor</em> respectively.<br />
				In some analyses, for good reasons, these are called the Themes 
				of the sentences but we'll stick to the more familiar term, 
				Subject.</li>
				<li>The rest of the sentence is known as the Predicate.&nbsp; In 
				these examples, the predicates are:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; met a friend yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was a bank manager<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spilled onto the floor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was filthy</em><br />
				In the analysis which terms the Subject the Theme, the Predicate 
				is the Rheme but, again, we'll stick to the term Predicate.<br />
				The Predicate can be further broken down:<ol>
					<li><em>a friend </em>is an Object noun phrase</li>
					<li><em>yesterday</em> is an Adverbial of time</li>
					<li><em>was</em> is a Verb</li>
					<li><em>a bank manager</em> is a synonym (here) for <em>the 
					friend</em> and is called the Complement of the Subject</li>
					<li><em>filthy</em> is an attribute of the Subject and is 
					also a Complement</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<table cellpadding="0" class="bridge_table">

					<td class="auto-style4">
					<a href="hps/clauses_bridgehp1.htm">Try a short test</a> to

					<td class="auto-style4">
					<h2>Six patterns</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In what follows, the following abbreviations will be used and, 
			later, some of these will be refined slightly.</p>
			<ul class="purple_bullet">
				<li>S = Subject</li>
				<li>V = Verb</li>
				<li>C = Complement</li>
				<li>A = Adverbial</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here they are, simplest first:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					
					<img alt="1" height="68" src="../../gfx/1blue.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td>
					<h3>Pattern 1: SV</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is the basic pattern, parallelled in almost all languages and 
			quite easy to form.<br />
			Here are some examples:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary spoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John apologised<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary relented</em></p>
			<p>If you have followed <a href="verbs_bridge.html" target="_blank">The Bridge guide 
			to verbs</a> or other similar guides on this site, you'll recognise 
			immediately that this pattern can only be formed with verbs which 
			are or can be intransitive (not having an object).&nbsp; Verbs such as <em>tell</em> or <em>
			find</em>, which cannot operate without an object (expressed or 
			implied) do not follow this pattern or the next.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					
					<img alt="2" height="69" src="../../gfx/2blue.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td>
					<h3>Pattern 2: SVA</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is almost as simple and just means including an adverbial 
			to modify the verb, usually in terms of place or time (but 
			other options are available such as degree or manner).<br />
			Here are some examples:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John arrived late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary spoke angrily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John apologised immediately<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary relented in the end</em></p>
			<p>It is possible to move the adverbial, especially when it is an 
			adverb but, for simplicity's sake, we'll assume that a sentence such 
			as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Mary immediately relented</em><br />
			still follows the SVA pattern (because it does).</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					
					<img alt="3" height="65" src="../../gfx/3blue.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td>
					<h3>Pattern 3: SVC<sub>S</sub></h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The only issue here is what the Complement (C) can be.&nbsp; The 
			reason for the use of C<sub>S</sub> rather than simply C will become clear 
			soon.&nbsp; The dropped <sub><strong>S</strong></sub> stands for the 
			subject because that is what the complement modifies.<br />
			There are two options (with one more to come):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>An attribute as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; He felt sorry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She appeared angry</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were at home</em></li>
				<li>A noun which is co-referential (referring to the same 
				things) as the subject, as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was her husband<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were friends</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She became a witch</em></li>
			</ol>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					
					<img alt="4" height="67" src="../../gfx/4blue.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td>
					<h3>Pattern 4: SVOC<sub>O</sub></h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Slightly more unusually in English the Complement does not apply 
			to the Subject of the sentence but to its Object as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He made her angry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They elected her president<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She called the idea stupid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He declared the meeting closed</em></p>
			<p>Here we have the dropped <sub><strong>O</strong></sub> which 
			stands for the Object because the complement refers to it and not to 
			the subject.&nbsp; Some languages, incidentally, do not allow this pattern and 
			learners from these language backgrounds may be confused about what 
			the Complement is doing.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					
					<img alt="5" height="68" src="../../gfx/5blue.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td>
					<h3>Pattern 5: SVO</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Verbs which must be or can be transitive (taking an object) 
			follow this pattern.<br />
			Here are some examples:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John opened the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary hit him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John said something<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary forgave him</em></p>
			<p>Next, we'll refine the concept of Object a little more 
			precisely.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					
					<img alt="6" height="67" src="../../gfx/6blue.png" width="100" /></td>
					<td>
					<h3>Pattern : SVO<sub>I</sub>O<sub>D</sub></h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are some verbs in English which allow two Objects but they 
			differ.&nbsp; Pattern 5 has only a Direct Object but in this 
			pattern, we have both an Indirect and a Direct Object.&nbsp; In 
			English, unless one uses a <em>to </em>+ Object formulation, the 
			Indirect Object precedes the Direct Object.&nbsp; They are 
			distinguished above as O<sub>I</sub> and O<sub>D</sub> respectively.<br />
			It is also the case that the Indirect object is almost always 
			animate, very often a person.<br />
			That is by no means the case in all languages and many differ from 
			English or differ internally by placing pronoun objects in different 
			positions from noun objects.<br />
			Here are some examples:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John told her the problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary gave him a piece of her mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John offered her some flowers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary handed him his coat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave the house a clean</em></p>
			<hr />
			<p>Only Pattern 2 above contains an Adverbial added from Pattern 1, but, because 
			Adverbials are optional in all sentences, it is not necessary to 
			include the possibility of inserting one or more in any of the 
			clause patterns.&nbsp; We can, therefore, have:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pattern 3: SVC<sub>S</sub>A:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They appeared unhappy yesterday</em></li>
				<li>Pattern 4: SVOC<sub>O</sub>A:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They installed her then and there as chair of the meeting</em></li>
				<li>Pattern 5: SVOA:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spent the money on a new car</em></li>
				<li>Pattern 6: SVO<sub>I</sub>O<sub>D</sub>A:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She read the children a story before bedtime</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is also not necessary to repeat the A for every new Adverbial 
			because, in theory at least, there is no limit to the number of 
			Adverbials we can add so we might see, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave me the flowers last night in the 
			shop immediately after seeing me</em><br />
			which contains four adverbials represented by the single A in SVO<sub>I</sub>O<sub>D</sub>A.<br />
			It is, following the simplification rule above, also not necessary 
			to move the A around as one can with many adverbials especially for 
			emphasis as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Immediately after seeing me she gave me the flowers last 
			night in the shop</em></p>

			<p>It was noted at the outset that it is unlikely that you would 
			plan a lesson or series of lessons around an analysis of syntax 
			possibilities in English, although one might with more advanced 
			students who are still struggling to construct clauses with the 
			right sequence of phrases.&nbsp; Nevertheless, analysis of this type 
			is helpful when supporting learning and correcting false syntax such 
			as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Problems with adverbial placement<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I saw yesterday the film</em><br />
				Remember: SVOA not SVAO</li>
				<li>Problems with Indirect and Direct Object placement (probably 
				the result of first-language interference)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She read to the children a story</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She read a story the children</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She read it the children</em><br />
				Remember: SVO<sub>I</sub>O<sub>D</sub> not SVO<sub>D</sub>O<sub>I</sub></li>
				<li>Problems with Object Complement placement (and 
				comprehension)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They made angry the people</em><br />
				Remember: SVOC<sub>O</sub> not SVC<sub>O</sub>O</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.&nbsp; Whenever learners produce unnatural or plain 
			wrong syntax, the explanation and correction often lies in the realm 
			of how clauses and phrases are ordered in English.</p>
