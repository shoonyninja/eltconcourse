				<li>Both cohesion and coherence refer to how texts, whether

				<dt>Example 1: Spoken text</dt>
				<dd><span class="style_black"><em>Mary: Have you seen by 
				gardening gloves?<br />
				John: Did you have them in the garage?</em></span><br />
				In this text, we do not need to know anything about where Mary 
				and John are, what their relationship is or what they are doing.&nbsp; 
				The text hangs together by virtue of being both coherent (John's 
				answer is obviously relevant to Mary's question)
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>and</strong></span> 
				cohesive.<br />
				It is cohesive because John says:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you have
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>them</strong></span> ...</em><br />
				and the pronoun <em>them</em> refers back to the <em>gardening 
				gloves</em> in Mary's question, linking the question and the 
				response grammatically.<br />
				Even if you have no idea what gardening gloves are, you can 
				still understand that they are the object of both Mary's 
				question and John's response.<br />
				The two utterances are linked in both meaning and grammar so 
				they are coherent and cohesive.</dd>
				<dt>Example 2: Spoken text</dt>
				<dd><span class="style_black"><em>Mary: Have you seen my 
				gardening gloves?<br />
				John: The roses needed pruning</em></span><br />
				In this text, we have to do some inferencing concerning what is 
				meant.&nbsp; With luck, we can work out that John's answer 
				suggests that he has borrowed the gloves to protect his hands 
				when pruning the roses.<br />
				There is, however, no linguistic link between Mary's question 
				and John's response.<br />
				Understanding the text requires us to know that gardening gloves 
				protect your hands and that roses are thorny plants.&nbsp; That 
				is knowledge of the world that we do not have to bring to the 
				first example.<br />
				Knowing those two facts makes the dialogue comprehensible and, 
				therefore, coherent but there is no sense that they are 
				cohesive.</dd>
				<dt>Example 3: Written text</dt>
				<dd><span class="style_black"><em>Honey buzzards are birds of 
				prey.&nbsp; Their diet, however, consists largely of wasps and 
				hornets, the nests of which they excavate using their long 
				claws.</em></span><br />
				This is a formal written text and it is conventionally written.&nbsp; 
				It is both cohesive and coherent.<br />
				Coherence is achieved by the sense connections.&nbsp; We are 
				told that buzzards are birds of prey and that primes us for the 
				information that follows concerning what they eat and how they 
				get it.<br />
				Cohesion comes through the connections of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>buzzards</em> and <em>they</em> (twice)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>buzzards</em> and <em>their</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>wasps and hornets</em> and <em>the nests of which</em><br />
				It is quite possible that the writer has no idea who might be 
				reading the text so is careful to set the scene with the first, 
				topic sentence, making it coherent, and connect the clauses grammatically, making it cohesive.</dd>
				<dt>Example 4: Written text</dt>
				<dd><span class="style_black"><em>I hope you got my last email.&nbsp; 
				Are you coming to the do on Saturday?&nbsp; Don't forget to 
				dress up 60s style!&nbsp; Mary will be very disappointed if you 
				can't.</em></span><br />
				This is also a written text but more informal and it is clear 
				that writer and reader know each other.&nbsp; The writer also 
				knows that she/he does not have to explain items that we, as 
				outsiders, do not understand.&nbsp; We do not know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who Mary is (or whether it is her do that is the subject)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where the do is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why the do is happening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what sort of a do it is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the relevance of dressing in 60's fashion<br />
				All of this is known to both the writer and the reader so the 
				text is, for them, perfectly coherent.<br />
				There are, however, no internal cohesive grammatical links 
				between the sentences except for the elision of the verb after
				<em>can't</em>.&nbsp; Even here, we do not have enough data to 
				know whether this refers to <em>dressing up</em> or <em>coming to the do</em>.<br />
				In short, the text is coherent to the participants but not 
				cohesive in any real sense.</dd>

			<p>Cohesion is achieved in two main ways and this guide will cover 
			only the main ones.&nbsp; For more detail, follow the links at the 
			end.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Grammatical cohesion</strong><ol>
					<li>using pronoun references:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he found 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>it</strong></span>, the shop was closed 
					for the weekend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my brother arrived, <span class="style_black"><strong>he</strong></span> went straight to the kitchen<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you got anything larger?&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
					<strong>This</strong></span> is too small.</em></li>
					<li>using pro-forms for verbs:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Mary here.&nbsp; I think 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>so</strong></span>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may rain but I hope <span class="style_black"><strong>not</strong></span>.</em></li>
					<li>using conjunctions and conjuncts:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was raining 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>so</strong></span> I stayed in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came <span class="style_black"><strong>because</strong></span> she wanted to meet his brother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The costs are spiralling out of control.&nbsp; 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>Nevertheless</strong></span>, 
					the government will press ahead.</em></li>
					<li>omitting an item that is understood (elision):<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first problem is serious, the 
					second even more so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John came home, cooked a meal and went out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor said I should take more exercise and I will</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Lexical cohesion</strong><ol>
					<li>repeating an item:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His <span class="style_black">
					<strong>son</strong></span> went to university with my 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>son</strong></span></em></li>
					<li>using synonyms:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two <span class="style_black">
					<strong>lorries</strong></span> broke down but only one 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>truck</strong></span> was towed away</em></li>
					<li>using hypernyms (superordinates)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two <span class="style_black">
					<strong>lorries</strong></span> broke down but only one 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>vehicle</strong></span> was towed away</em></li>

					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span class="style_black">
					<strong>paint</strong></span> pot leaked and

			hypernym are slightly mysterious to you.</p>

				</table>
			
			<p>Coherence depends less on explicit linguistic connections and 
			more on how texts are linked in terms of meaning and logical 
			progression.<br />
			Coherence may be maintained, as we saw above by the writer / 
			speaker and the hearer / reader sharing knowledge that it outside 
			the text.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Shared information<ol>
					<li>Cultural knowledge:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We needed a dignitary to do the deed 
					and persuaded the Prince to open the new library<br />
					</em>There are many princes in the world but in this text, it is 
					clear that both writer and reader / speaker and hearer know 
					which prince is the reference, hence the capital letter on
					<em>Prince</em>.&nbsp; In this case there is only one prince 
					in question.</li>
					<li>Institutional knowledge:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The head has said that the children 
					must go to class in silence<br />
					</em>In this case, the parties to the text know that the <em>
					head</em> referred to is the head of a particular school.</li>
					<li>Personal information:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to help but you know my back 
					won't bear it<br />
					</em>In this case, the fact that the writer / speaker has a 
					bad back is known to both participants.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Topic signalling<ol>
					<li>Topic sentences:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This essay concerns the use of 
					recreational drugs.&nbsp; The most common of these is 
					marijuana.<br />
					</em>Many well-written paragraphs will begin with a topic 
					sentence which leads the reader to be able to predict the 
					content of the paragraph.&nbsp; In fact, reading only the 
					topic, often the first, sentence of every paragraph in a 
					text is a good way quickly to get its gist.</li>
					<li>Topicalising:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That restaurant?&nbsp; No, you 
					wouldn't like the food.<br />
					</em>English has few grammatically sound ways of 
					topicalising but other languages routinely place the topic 
					at the beginning of clauses whatever its grammatical 
					function.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Staging<ol>
					<li>Conjunctions:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we have to buy the tickets and 
					then we'll be able to jump the queue at the door.<br />
					</em>Conjunction allows the text producer to signal a wide 
					range of internal connections including addition, concession 
					and condition.&nbsp; These are sense relations so belong 
					under the topic of coherence but they also figure above 
					under cohesion because they represent internal grammatical 
					connections, too.<br />
					There are guides on this site to all aspects of conjunction.</li>
					<li>Conjuncts:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing is to make sure the 
					surface is free from grease.&nbsp; Secondly, gently score 
					the surfaces.&nbsp; Finally, apply the glue.<br />
					</em>As the name implies, conjuncts usually refer to 
					previous clauses, making the sense and grammatical 
					connections clear.</li>
					<li>Text staging:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This happened to me in France.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was trying to hitchhike from Paris to Nice and ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, it all worked out well but next time I'll take 
					the train!<br />
					</em>Different text types will exhibit different information 
					staging.&nbsp; Here, the example is a recount with a scene 
					setting, a description of what happened and a coda 
					expressing the writer / speaker's response to the events.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Lexical chaining<ol>
					<li>Tense forms are usually kept consistent so a text that 
					begins in the present tense usually stays there and a 
					narrative which uses past tenses will normally not stray 
					into other tenses.</li>
					<li>Certain lexical items will predictably form chains in 
					texts so a text about health will general include a chain of 
					illnesses and complaints along with a chain concerned with 
					health professionals and yet another with a chain of 
					treatments and cures.<br />
					This phenomenon is to do with the field in which the text 
					maker is operating (the register).</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			<p>As you can see, cohesion and coherence, while being closely 
			linked and showing some overlap are qualitatively different.<br />
			Trying to tackle both areas at the same time in a classroom is not a 
			recipe for unalloyed success.</p>
