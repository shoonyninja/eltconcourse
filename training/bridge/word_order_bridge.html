	<h1>The Bridge: Word order</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="ordering" height="207" src="../images/birds_ducklings_order310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide covers two main concepts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The usual (or canonical) way in which we order the 
				information in clauses and sentences in English.</li>
				<li>What happens when we depart from the usual ordering and why 
				we do it.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is important for two connected reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Languages differ quite fundamentally in how things are 
				generally ordered.</li>
				<li>Changing the word ordering in English affects meaning in 
				ways of which many learners and teachers are unaware.</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />

					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Canonical word order</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>The adjective <strong><em>canonical</em></strong> is derived from 
			the Latin <em>canonicus</em>, meaning <em>according to rule</em> and 
			it is the rules of conventional word ordering in English which we 
			are setting out to explain here.</p>
			<p>Before we start, however, a short explanation of why word 
			ordering is so important in English in particular is appropriate and for that we 
			need a short language lesson.&nbsp; As our example, we'll use 
			contrasting word ordering in a European language but many other languages 
			will exhibit similar phenomena.</p>

					<img alt="bird kiss" height="133" src="../images/birds_kiss200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">

					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man kissed the bird<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bird kissed the man</em></p>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>We know by the word ordering who did what to whom.<br />
			In the first sentence, the man did the kissing and in the second, 
			the bird did the kissing.&nbsp; That's clear.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" class="bridge_table">
				<tr>
					<td valign="top">
					<img alt="?" height="50" src="../../gfx/q_mark_sq50.png" width="50" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><a name="wo1"></a>If we translate 
					this into German, however, we find the same two sentences 
					but with a subtle difference.&nbsp; Can you spot the difference?<br />
					The two sentences translate as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Der Mann küsste den Vogel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Der Vogel küsste den Mann<br />
					</em>
					<a href="#wo1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'wo1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
					Click here when you have it</a>.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p id="wo1" class="auto-style5">
			The difference is in the article which translates as 
			<em><strong>the</strong></em>.<br />
			In the first sentence we have <em><strong>der Mann</strong></em> and
			<em><strong>den Vogel</strong></em>.<br />
			In the second, we have <strong><em>der 
			Vogel</em></strong> and <strong><em>den 
			Mann</em></strong>.<br />
			This means that the object and the subject of the verb 
			<em>kiss</em> are 
			distinguished by the article that is used.<br />
			We can, therefore, reverse the noun phrases and have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Den Mann küsste der Vogel<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Den Vogel küsste der Mann<br />
			</em>and retain the same meaning.&nbsp; A German speaker will still 
			be aware that in the first sentence it was the man who was kissed by 
			the bird and in the second, it was the bird that was kissed by the 
			man.<br />
			That is not possible in English, because reversing the ordering 
			reverses the sense.&nbsp; English does not mark the subject and the 
			object at all, so the only way we have to determine who did what 
			to whom is to rely on the ordering of the words.<br />
			Most languages which have case structures (and there are 
			many hundreds of them) will exhibit a similar effect.</p>
			<p>In some other languages, such as Czech, Polish and other Slavic 
			languages, the object and subject of a verb are identified by the 
			form of the verb itself.&nbsp; So, for example, if we translate 
			these two sentences in which only the word ordering in English 
			distinguishes the cause and effect:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The problem caused the delay</li>
				<li>The delay caused the problem</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We get:</p>
			<p>In Greek (with different forms of the article):</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Η καθυστέρηση προκάλεσε το πρόβλημα (I kathystérisi 
				prokálese to próvlima)</em></li>
				<li><em>Το πρόβλημα προκάλεσε την καθυστέρηση (To próvlima 
				prokálese tin kathystérisi)</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In Czech (with different forms of the verb):</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Zpoždění způsobilo problém</em></li>
				<li><em>Problém způsobil zpoždění</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In Basque (with many alterations to determiners and verbs):</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Atzerapenak eragin du arazoa</em></li>
				<li><em>Arazoak atzerapena eragin zuen</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In Russian (with changes to the endings on the nouns):</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Задержка вызвала проблему (Zaderzhka vyzvala problemu)</em></li>
				<li><em>Проблема вызвала задержку (Problema vyzvala zaderzhku)</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The upshot is that if a learner inadvertently disturbs the usual 
			word ordering in English, the communicative effect will be very 
			different and that may surprise speakers of many other languages 
			where ordering is less important than the forms of the words.</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>If you have followed any of the guides on this site to word class 
			or the guide in The Bridge to Sentence Grammar (linked below), you 
			will be aware of the possible constituents of a clause or sentence.&nbsp; 
			Now we need to look at the possible ways in which the elements can 
			be ordered.<br />
			There are five sorts of ordering we need to consider.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Subjects, verbs and objects<br />
				We have seen, above, that the canonical word ordering in English 
				is Subject &gt; Verb &gt; Object (if any) so, for example, we have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She travelled to Paris</em><br />
				(Subject &gt; Verb &gt; Adverbial)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter explained 
				the problem<br />
				</em>(Subject &gt; Verb &gt; Object)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave him the book<br />
				</em>(Subject &gt; Verb &gt; Indirect object &gt; Direct object)<br />There are 6 possible ways to order these three elements but 
				only one of them (the first) is acceptable in English:<ol>
					<li>Subject &gt; Verb &gt; Object:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John spent the money</em></li>
					<li>Subject &gt; Object &gt; Verb:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John the money spent</em></li>
					<li>Verb &gt; Object &gt; Subject:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spent the money John</em></li>
					<li>Verb &gt; Subject &gt; Object:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spent John the money</em></li>
					<li>Object &gt; Subject &gt; Verb:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The money John spent</em></li>
					<li>Object &gt; Verb &gt; Subject:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The money spent John</em>
					</li>
				</ol><p class="noparaspace">It helps, of course, to know what your learners' first 
				language(s) do in this respect because this is a fundamental 
				characteristic of all languages.&nbsp; See the in-service guide, 
				linked below, for a list of common languages and other 
				cross-linguistic analysis for more.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Adjectives and nouns<br />
				There are exceptions but, overwhelmingly in English, the 
				canonical ordering of these elements is Adjective &gt; Noun, so we 
				have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; the fragile vase</em><br />
				not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *the vase fragile</em><br />
				Other languages, you are probably aware, do things differently 
				and in French that would be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; le vase fragile</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *le fragile vase.</em></li>
				<li>Numerals, determiners and nouns:<br />
				Again, in English the canonical ordering is Numeral or 
				determiner &gt; Noun, so we have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three birds</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *birds three<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this book<br />
				</em>not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *book this<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many books<br />
				</em>not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *books many<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				Other languages place the numeral or quantifier after the noun.</li>
				<li>Possessive determiners<br />
				In English, the possessive is complicated because we can have 
				both types of ordering so, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the government's policy<br />
				</em>which is possessive marker &gt; noun, and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the policy of the government<br />
				</em>which is noun &gt; possessive marker<br />are both correct but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the leg of the table<br />
				</em>is usually preferred to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the table's leg<br />
				</em>Most languages settle on one or the other type of ordering 
				and that can confuse learners as well as leading them to produce 
				grammatically correct but unnatural language such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the hat of John<br />
				</em>Many languages, including, e.g., Modern Greek, also place 
				the possessive determiner after the noun (and sometimes attach 
				it directly to the noun) so we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book my</em> (<em>το βιβλίο μου</em> 
				[<em>to vivlío mou</em>])<br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Prepositions<br />
				As the name implies, English puts these first (hence
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>pre</strong></span>-position), 
				so we have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the corner<br />
				</em>not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the corner in<br />
				</em>and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; opposite the hotel<br />
				</em>not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the hotel opposite<br />
				</em>(which carries a very different meaning).<br />
				A range of languages (notably Turkish and Japanese) use postpositions canonically and this 
				can, of course, cause comprehension and production difficulties.<br />
				Some languages, such as German, use both, depending on the 
				preposition.</li>

			other languages do, see the guide to word order in the in-service

			<p>If you are perceptive, you will have objected to some of what was 
			said above along the lines of:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em><strong>Well, we don't always 
			follow that order in English, do we?</strong></em></span><br />
			and you'd be quite right.<br />
			It is possible, for example, to have:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="purple_bullet">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Him, I cannot 
				stand</em><br />
				which is Object &gt; Subject &gt; Verb</li>
				<li class="purple_bullet">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Have you (got) 
				my address?</em><br />
				which is Verb &gt; Subject &gt; Object<br />
				</li>
				<li class="purple_bullet">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I may be late 
				but pay the money I will</em><br />
				which contains Subject &gt; Verb &gt; Object &gt; Subject &gt; auxiliary verb</li>
				<li class="purple_bullet">&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; The house was 
				destroyed by the fire</em><br />
				which is Object &gt; Verb &gt; Subject</li>
				<li class="purple_bullet">&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting 
				proper didn't start till 6</em><br />
				which is Noun &gt; Adjective</li>
				<li class="purple_bullet">&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; He arrived ten 
				minutes ago</em><br />
				which is a postposition (<em>ago</em>) rather than a preposition (and 
				nearly 
				the only one in English)</li>
				<li class="purple_bullet"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he called 
				for his fiddlers three!<br />
				</em>which is Noun &gt; Number</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We also adopt unusual word ordering in sentences such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Mary that he took to the restaurant<br />
			</em>which puts the Object at the beginning<br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Idiotic is what it seemed to me<br />
			</em>which reverses the usual ordering of copular verb and 
			attribute.</p>
			<p>The question, naturally, is why we should want to do any of this 
			and the answer lies in a concept called <strong>markedness</strong>.</p>
			<p>If, for example, in English, we want to mark a clause to make it 
			an interrogative, we reverse the ordering of the Subject and the 
			Verb so instead of<em>:</em></p>
			<ul class="purple_bullet">
				<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can help<br />
				</em>we have<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you help?</em></li>
				<li>Instead of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had arrived already<br />
				</em>we produce:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had he arrived already?</em></li>
				<li>Instead of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went</em><br />
				we have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she go?<br />
				</em>In which we retain the subject &gt; verb ordering but 
				introduce anew verb to make the questions form, <em>do / does / 
				did</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As soon as the hearer recognises the departure from Subject &gt; 
			Verb &gt; Object he or she is alert to the fact that something less 
			usual is intended.&nbsp; In this case a question.</p>
			<p>(The phenomenon of markedness does not only affect word order, 
			incidentally, because if we were to say, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; How near is it?</em><br />
			instead of<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; How far is it?</em><br />
			we are marking the fact that we already know that it is close by.<br />
			The usual question is also, as another example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; How old is the puppy?</em><br />
			not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; How young is the puppy?</em><br />
			for the same reason.)</p>
			<p>Thus it is in all these examples, that the deviation from 
			canonical word order marks an element of the clause for special 
			emphasis:</p>
			<ul class="purple_bullet">
				<li>With adverbs, which normally directly precede or follow the 
				verb:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequently, she argued the point<br />
				</em>rather than<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She frequently argued the point</em></li>
				<li>With objects, which normally follow the verb:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That house I really can't afford<br />
				</em>rather than<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really can't afford that house</em></li>
				<li>With verbs, which normally follow the subject:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give in I will not<br />
				</em>rather than<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not give in</em></li>
				<li>With objects which normally follow the verb, and 
				prepositional phrases which normally come at the end of clauses:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this ring I thee wed<br />
				</em>rather than<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wed thee with this ring<br />
				</em>or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the water he fell<br />
				</em>instead of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He fell into the water</em></li>
				<li>With active sentences such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She led the meeting astray</em><br />
				we may prefer<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting was led astray (by her)</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>English emphasises information in three distinct and non-parallel 
			ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Fronting</strong><br />
				This is simply moving an item to the front of the sentence.&nbsp; 
				For example:<ol class="purple_bullet">
					<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Barely had I sat down to eat when the 
					telephone rang</em><br />
					instead of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> I had barely sat down to eat when the telephone rang</em></li>
					<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Yesterday, I went to the cinema</em><br />
					instead of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; I went to the cinema yesterday</em></li>
					<li>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The restaurant is where I took my 
					mother</em><br />
					instead of<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took my mother to the restaurant</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>End focus</strong><br />
				English usually places new information at the end of a clause so 
				we would normally have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Where did you go yesterday?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: I went to London<br />
				</em>in which the new information is placed in the end position.&nbsp; 
				However, if the conversation takes this turn:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Where did you go yesterday?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: I went to London yesterday</em><br />
				then speaker B is emphasising the day, not the location and may 
				well have a good reason for that.</li>
				<li><strong>End weighting</strong><br />
				English generally places more complex and 'heavier' elements to 
				the end of a clause so, instead of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Mary was allowed to leave so early 
				when the work wasn't finished surprised me</em><br />
				which is quite normal Subject &gt; Verb &gt; Object ordering, we will 
				usually prefer:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was surprised that Mary was allowed to leave so early 
				when the work wasn't finished</em><br />
				because we prefer the heavy clause at the end.</li>

			<p>The phenomena of fronting, end focus and end weighting for 
			markedness are not common across languages so, for example, in 
			German, the time adverbial frequently comes at the beginning of 
			clauses but is not specifically marked for emphasis because of that.&nbsp; 
			Speakers from language backgrounds like that will often produce, 
			therefore:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow, I am leaving<br />
			</em>without realising that an English-speaking hearer might assume 
			that there is something more important about <em>tomorrow</em> than the 
			learner intended.</p>
			<p>In many languages, there is a strong tendency to front the topic 
			rather than the grammatical subject of the clause so learners from 
			those language backgrounds (such as Spanish or Chinese languages 
			among many others) may produce:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; That factory is where my father works</em><br />
			without knowing that an English-speaking hearer may assume that <em>the 
			factory</em> is being unduly emphasised.</p>
			<p>Not all languages conform to the principle of end weighting so 
			learners may produce the grammatically correct but unnatural:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The storm which came in from the west 
			overnight and got worse in the morning damaged the trees<br />
			</em>where an English speaker would probably prefer a passive 
			structure to get the weight to the end and have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trees were damaged by the storm which 
			came in from the west overnight and got worse in the morning</em></p>
			<p>It is often suggested to learners that active and passive 
			sentences are simply two different ways of saying the same thing.&nbsp; 
			That is not the case.&nbsp; There is a real difference between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children stole the puppy<br />
			</em>and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The puppy was stolen by the children<br />
			</em>because of the nature of end focus in English.<br />
			For this reason alone, transformation exercises are probably best 
			avoided.<br />
			It is also the case that some passive sentences, especially those 
			with unknown or unknowable subjects are the more natural way to form 
			the clause and no obvious active sentence is even available.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The limestone was formed many millions of 
			years ago<br />
			</em>has no clear active equivalent and there is no special marking 
			of <em>the limestone</em>.</p>
			<p>One the other hand, learners may misinterpret what they hear or 
			read because they are not sensitive to word-ordering principles so 
			may miss important emphases which would be obvious to a native 
			speaker.&nbsp; That may not result in a breakdown in communication 
			but it does make it less efficient.</p>
