		<div id="collocation" style="visibility: hidden">
			<p>
			<span class="style_brown">Some are easy, aren't they?&nbsp; <em>flock of</em>, for example, 
		will only be followed by a restricted range of other items (all nouns)

		Other words such as <em>high</em> have a much greater collocational 
		range and it's impossible to predict what you might have put in the gap &ndash;
		<em>velocity, wall, price, tree</em>?&nbsp; The list of possibilities is 
		very long.&nbsp; Other words, in a middle range have a good number of 
		collocates but not an endless list.&nbsp; There are far more words which

			reasonably few words which can modify a noun like <em>carriage</em>

			<p>Naturally, some collocations are stronger than others, as we 
		saw above.&nbsp; The nature of collocation can be illustrated like this:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="collocation" height="157" src="../../imagesgraphics/collocation.png" width="400" /></p>
			<p>
			Note the overlaps.&nbsp; There is probably no principled way in which 
			we can always distinguish, e.g., a strong collocation from an idiom 
			or a binomial although it is easy enough to identify examples of one 
			or the other.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Idioms</strong><br />
			These are pretty much fixed and unalterable expressions in a 
			language.&nbsp; For example, someone can be described as <em>a 
			one-man band, a jack of all trades, the life and soul of the party</em> 
			etc.&nbsp; Things can be talked about as <em>the odd one out, a 
			blessing in disguise, chicken feed, a flash in the pan </em>and so 
			on.&nbsp; There are literally thousands of such expressions in every 
			language which people can deploy almost as if they were single 
			words, saving thinking time and maintaining fluency.&nbsp; There are 
			a number of
			<a href="../../../learners/exercises/indexpages/exindex.html" target="_blank">
			exercises in the pages for learners</a> which focus on this type of collocation.&nbsp; 
			For examples, go to
			<a href="../../../learners/exercises/indexpages/vocabc1c2.html" target="_blank">
			here</a> or
			<a href="../../../learners/exercises/mats/vocabulary/c1c2vocabulary/advidioms1.htm" target="_blank">
			here</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>Binomials</strong><br />
			These are a special sort of idiom made up of two elements 
			which always appear in the same order.&nbsp; If they are nouns, they 
			are often used with a singular verb form because they represent a single concept 
			(we say, e.g., <em>supply and demand <strong>is</strong> the issue</em> 
			not <em><strong>are</strong> the issue</em>).<br />
			Binomials often contain words found in no other contexts.&nbsp; Examples 
			are: <em>to and fro, thunder and lightning, spic and span, neither 
			here nor there, in and out, cheap and nasty</em> etc.&nbsp; (There 
			are also some trinomials in English such as <em>left, right and 
			centre, bell, book and candle, cool, calm and collected, hook, line 
			and sinker</em> etc.)</li>
			<li><strong>Strong collocations</strong><br />
			These can almost always be predicted by native speakers of a 
			language (or at least have very few alternatives).&nbsp; For 
			example, if you are asked to fill the gap in the following, your 
			answer is probably quite predictable.<br />
			<em>Please __________ free to ask any questions</em>.<br />
			Many collocations like this occur with general-purpose verbs such 
			as:<em><br />
			make (mistakes, haste, a fuss, arrangements, certain, discoveries, 
			fun of, a journeys, peace, war, a mess, money, friends)<br />
			do (homework, justice to, an injury, a service, a favour, wrong, the shopping, 
			damage)<br />
			take (advantage, notice, pains, root, an offer, an interest, place, offence)</em><br />
			<em>pay (attention, a compliment, our respects)<br />
			give (explanations, thanks, consideration, thanks, one's word, 
			promises)<br />
			</em>The point at which strong collocations like these become so 
			predictable and fixed as to qualify as idioms rather than 
			collocations is not at all easy to discern.<em><br />
			</em>Other strong collocations are adjective-noun combinations.&nbsp; 
			The number of possible adjectives for <em>rain</em> is large but not 
			infinite (<em>heavy, light, drizzly, hard, thin</em> 
				etc.) and exclude adjectives such as <em>strong, powerful</em> 
			etc.</li>
			<li><strong>Textual collocation</strong><br />
			This refers to the tendency for sets of words to occur together in a 
			text on a particular topic.&nbsp; A text about families will 
			probably include, e.g., <em>home, children, parents, arguments</em> 
			and so on but one about smoking would have <em>cigarette, health, 
			addictive, nicotine, secondary</em> etc.</li>

		<p>Collocations can also be classified by word class.&nbsp; This is 
		often a useful way to limit one's focus in the classroom and help 
		learners to identify collocations of a particular sort so they are, for 
		example, only trying to notice particular combinations of words, not all 
		combinations.<br />

		<p>Collocations are very helpful for learning vocabulary.&nbsp; 
		There are some things to consider:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>helping learners to notice collocation</strong></dt>
	<dd>It is unusual to find any kind of reading text which doesn't contain 
	some obvious collocations so make sure you focus on them at some time in a 
	reading lesson.&nbsp; Eventually, your students should be able to spot them 
	for themselves.&nbsp; Highlighting <strong><span class="auto-style28">likely</span><span class="style_red"> 
	collocations</span></strong> in texts is effective.<br />
	A small trick is to design a short text in which the collocations are wrong 
	and get learners a) to notice them and b) to correct them.&nbsp; At higher 
	levels, this can make an interesting change to a dictation.&nbsp; You 
	dictate the text with the false collocations and the learners correct it as 
	they go along.</dd>
			<dt><strong>teaching vocabulary thoroughly</strong></dt>
			<dd>Whenever you teach a new verb, remember to set it in a context 
			of what sort of nouns it collocates with.&nbsp; For example, if you 
			teach <em>unearth</em> try make sure that your learners know what sorts 
			of things can be <em>unearthed</em> <em>&ndash; the truth, a body, an 
			artifact, evidence </em>etc.&nbsp; If you teach a new adjective, 
			treat it similarly and make sure your learners know what sorts of 
			things it describes, for example, <em>greedy</em> applies to animate things, 
			mostly, but you can have <em>a greedy bank.</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>focusing some lessons on collocation</strong></dt>
			<dd>This is such a useful area that it is worth making it part of 
			your usual teaching programme.&nbsp; It is worth considering, for 
			example, basing a lesson around notions such as size, weight, 
			length, temperature and so on so that you can focus the learners on 
			such things as <em>tall building, high wall, narrow street, heavy 
			load, scorching sunshine, bitterly cold, extensive grounds, crushing 
			weight</em> etc.&nbsp; This may help your learners avoid saying 
			things like <em>thin street, flimsy load, boiling 
			sunshine, severely cold</em> or <em>grave weight</em>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>being clear</strong></dt>
			<dd>If you are a native speaker of English in particular, you may 
			often feel that a collocation such as <em>shuddering with fear</em> 
			or <em>burying an argument</em> is conceivable (and they both are) 
			but your students want clear answers and access to more natural 
			collocations so, unless they are very advanced, stick to the clichés &ndash; 
			we <em>shiver</em> or <em>tremble with fear, resolve arguments</em> 
			and <em>bury hatchets</em>.</dd>
