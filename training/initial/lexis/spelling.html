		<p>We all make mistakes.&nbsp; There are three sorts above.&nbsp; Which

		<ol>

				<li>The first two pictures (<em>shcool</em> and <em>nohing</em>) are 
		just slips and they happen frequently.&nbsp; For the purposes of this 
		guide, we can ignore them because they have nothing to do with spelling 
		rules in English.</li>
				<li>The third picture (<em>excellense</em>) is the result of someone simply 
		not knowing how the word <em>excellence</em> is spelled in English.</li>
				<li>The quotations from the BBC, Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph websites are errors caused by the lack of 
		sound-spelling consistency in English.&nbsp; They are called homophone errors 
		because <em>toe</em> and <em>tow</em>,<em> break </em>and<em> brake </em>and<em> duel</em> 
		and<em> dual </em>sound the same but are differently 
		written and mean different things.&nbsp; News sites are a rich source 
		of such errors because many news stories are submitted by journalists 
		over the telephone.&nbsp; Another example, from the Daily Telegraph, sadly 
		since corrected, is the description of shelves which <em>"<span class="style_black">grown with 
		academic tomes</span>".</em></li>

		</span><span class="auto-style17">The English Spelling Society</span></p>

		<p>If English really were a language with no predictable sound-spelling 
		consistency as the English Spelling Society claims, that would not have 
		been possible.</p></div>
		<p>To understand what follows, you need to understand that we are 
		considering <strong>sounds not letters</strong>.<br />
		So, for example, the single letter 'p' is represented as a 
		single sound (transcribed, i.e., written as /p/) and even a double 'p' 
		as in <em>pepper</em> still only has a single sound /p/ in the middle 
		and at the beginning.<br />
		Pairs of letters like <em>'</em>sh', 'ch', 'th', 'ck', 'sc' etc. are 
		also often only single sounds as they are in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>shave</em> (transcribed as /ʃeɪv/ with a single symbol 
		[/ʃ/] representing the first two letters)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>school</em> (transcribed as /skuːl/ with a single symbol 
		[/k/] representing 'ch')<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>this</em> (transcribed as /ðɪs/ with a single symbol 
		[/ð/] representing the first two letters)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sock</em> (transcribed as /sɒk/ with a single symbol 
		[/k/] representing the last two letters)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>science</em> (transcribed as /ˈsaɪəns/ with a single 
		symbol [/s/] representing the first two letters)</p>
		<p>You do not need to be able to read the phonemic transcriptions to 
		understand what follows (although it will help).</p>

				<td class="auto-style16" style="width: 358px">
		<h2>The rules</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Here's a short list of the rules:</p>
		<h4>Long and short vowels</h4>
		<ol class="auto-style4">
			<li>short vowels only usually require a single letter: <em>bit, bat, 
			sit, hat, kit, cut</em> and so on.&nbsp; This is the 
			Consonant-Vowel-Consonant principle or CVC.&nbsp; It is adhered to 
			in thousands of words and knowing it allows us to predict from the 
			spelling how, for example, all of the following will be pronounced.&nbsp; 
			The CVC principle also allows us to infer the spelling from the 
			sound, even if we have never heard the word.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>combat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; habitat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brickbat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; humdrum</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>driven</em><br />
			and innumerable more words.</li>
			<li>long vowels are represented in two ways:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>by inserting a vowel, often 'e' or 'i', after the consonant: <em>bite, bate, site, 
				stating, hate, kite, cute, driving </em>and so on.&nbsp; This is the 
			Vowel-Consonant-Vowel (VCV) principle.</li>
				<li>by inserting a second vowel letter before the consonant: <em>beat, boat, 
			heat</em> etc.&nbsp; This is the Consonant-Vowel-Vowel-Consonant (CVVC) principle.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Applying to these two principles, along with principle a., allows us 
		to predict how another huge range of words will be pronounced, 
		including, for example:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confuse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dreaming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skating<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defeated<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; considerable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; displeasing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contracting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disambiguation</em><br />
		and thousands more.&nbsp; Again, this will work in reverse: we can make 
		a very good guess at the spellings of these words when we hear them by 
		applying the principles.</p>
		<p>There are <strong>exceptions </strong>(of course) and they are 
		common words, usually.&nbsp; They include:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come, done, give, gone, have, live, love, none, one, some</em><br />
		All these have short vowels but end VCV.&nbsp; They are quite simple to 
		learn and learners usually have little trouble pronouncing or spelling 
		them.</p>
		<h4>Consonant doubling</h4>
		<ol class="auto-style4">
			<li>consonant doubling often occurs in an effort to 'protect' the 
			short vowel sound.<br />If the consonant were not doubled in <em>hatter</em>, for example, the word 
			would be pronounced as <em>hater</em> (because the VCV pattern would compel 
			it) and the same goes for very many 
			other words or word pairs such as <em>diner-dinner, taper-tapper, 
			cuter-cutter, fate, fatter, later-latter </em>etc.&nbsp; This is the VCCV 
			principle.</li>
			<li>the consonant is doubled when adding an <em>-ed</em> or 
				<em>-ing</em> 
				ending <span class="style_underline">only</span> if the stress 
				is on the second syllable: <em>befit-befitting, remit-remitting</em> but 
				<em>offer-offering</em> etc.&nbsp; This rule is often broken so 
			we get, e.g., <em>focussed</em> and <em>focused</em>, <em>targetting</em> 
			and <em>targeting</em>.</li>
			<li>regardless of stress, British English doubles the consonant 
				if it is 'p' or 'l'.&nbsp; American English does not.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Spelling the /k/ sound</h4>
		<p>The /k/ sound (as in, e.g., 
		<em>click, black, corn, bacon</em> etc.) also 
			obeys principles:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style4">
			<li>single 'c' is the most <span class="style_underline">c</span>ommon 
				(and the way to bet) and <span class="style_underline">c</span>an 
				o<span class="style_underline">cc</span>ur anywhere: <em>actor, cactus, cart, because</em> etc.</li>
			<li>doubling of the 'c' follows the same principle as any other 
				consonant doubling: it protects the short vowel.&nbsp; So we 
				have <em>tobacco, Mecca</em> etc.&nbsp; This is the VCCV 
			principle, again.</li>
			<li>if the /k/ sound is followed by 'e', 'i' or 'y', 'k' is 
				used instead of 'c': <em>make, sketch, token, sake, slinky, skin</em> etc.</li>
			<li>'ck' similarly replaces 'cc' if it is followed by 'e', 'i' 
				or 'y': <em>panicky, tarmacked</em> etc.</li>
			<li>'ck' <span class="style_underline">always</span> follows a 
				short vowel: <em>luck, duck, back, fickle</em> etc.&nbsp; This 
			obeys the CVC principle because, as we saw, the 'ck' combination is 
			actually a single consonant sound (/k/).</li>
			<li>'k' follows any other vowel or consonant: <em>soak, coke, musk, 
				lark</em> etc.</li>
			<li>/kw/ is <span class="style_underline">always</span> spelled 
				'qu': <em>queen, quince, equine</em> etc.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Spelling the /dʒ/ sound (as in the 'g' in <em>gentle</em>)</h4>
		<ol class="auto-style4">
			<li>if the sound is followed by 'a', 'o' or 'u', the letter 'j' 
				is preferred: <em>injure, just, jangle, jumble</em> etc.</li>
			<li>if the sound is followed by 'e', 'i' or 'y', the letter 'g' 
				is preferred: <em>aged, ginger, gauge, original, mangy</em> etc.</li>
			<li>'j' cannot be doubled (to protect a short vowel, again) so 
				'dg' is used instead: <em>judged, budgerigar</em></li>
		</ol>
		<h4>v</h4>
		<p>no English words end in 'v' so we always have a following 'e': 
			<em>thieve, save, shave</em> etc.</p>
		<h4><em>ie </em>or <em>ei</em>?</h4>
		<p>Schoolchildren learn to chant <span class="style_black"><em><strong>I before E except after C</strong></em></span> 
		and for hundreds of words like <em>believe, perceive, ceiling, thieving</em> 
		etc., the rule works just fine.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are 
		exceptions, as usual.</p>
		<ol class="auto-style4">
			<li>Before <em>gh, gn</em> and <em>ght</em>: the spelling is <em>ei</em> 
			not <em>ie</em>:<br />
			<em>weigh, neigh, foreign, feign, reign, height, freight</em></li>
			<li>There are numerous exceptions which include:<br />
			<em>beige, counterfeit, either, forfeit, heir, leisure, neither, 
			rein, seize, their, veil, vein, weir, weird</em></li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Endings</h4>
		<ol class="auto-style4">
			<li>words ending in 'y'<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>if you add an 's', the 'y' changes to 'ie': <em>worry-worries, 
				cry-cries </em>etc.</li>
				<li>words ending in 'ey' <span class="style_underline">usually</span> do not change when an 's' or 'd' is added: 
				<em>valley-valleys, 
				player-players-played </em>etc.&nbsp; (<span class="style_underline">But</span>
				<em>lay-laid, say-said</em> etc.)</li>
				<li>'y' does not change when it's followed by 'i': <em>dry-drying, 
					cry-crying, spy-spying </em>etc.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>words ending in 'e'<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>words ending in consonant + 'e' drop the 'e' when adding 
					anything beginning with a vowel: <em>love-loving, 
					response-responsible </em>etc.&nbsp; (But, in this case, the long vowel is often 
					protected by retaining the 'e':<em> likeable, mileage</em> etc.)</li>
				<li>the soft 'c' (/s/) and 'g' (/dʒ/) sounds also mean that 
					the 'e' is retained: <em>manage-manageable, outrage-outrageous, 
				trace-traceable</em> 
					etc.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>words ending in 'ie' change to 'y': <em>die-dying, lie-lying</em></li>
			<li>words ending in 'ue' drop the 'e': <em>argue-argument, 
				true-truly</em></li>
			<li>words ending in 's', 'z', 'x', 'ch' or 'sh' take 'es': <em>watch-watches, match-matches, fizz-fizzes, fix-fixes, 
			bush-bushes, bus-buses</em> etc.</li>

		<h2>Why is English spelling irregular?</h2>
				</td>

		</table>
		<p>OK, so spelling in English is tough because a) there are lots of 
		confusing rules and b) even when you have mastered the rules, there's 
		always an exception.&nbsp; If you look back at the list above, you can 
		probably find an exception to every single rule.<br />
		English spelling is something of a mess because of its history:</p>
		<ul class="auto-style6">
			<li>Early printers were often not native speakers of English, even 
			in England, and the influence of Dutch (their first language, 
			frequently) is seen in, e.g., the insertion of the 'h' in <em>ghost</em>.&nbsp; 
			(Even Caxton, the first well known English printer, had spent 30 
			years outside the country and his grasp of English writing was 
			shaky.)</li>
			<li>English has a higher proportion than most languages of what are 
			called loan words (i.e., words imported from other languages).&nbsp; 
			This means that spelling in English sometimes follows the 
			conventions of Scandinavian languages, French, Latin or Greek among 
			others.&nbsp; Words may retain their spelling but the pronunciation 
			is often Anglicized so the mismatch between spelling and 
			pronunciation arises.&nbsp; The notoriously varied pronunciation of 
			<em>ough</em> (<em>cough, rough, thought, plough, through</em> etc.) is a product of this sort of confusion.</li>
			<li>English does not have a regulating authority to rule on correct 
			spelling or introduce reforms.&nbsp; French and Spanish have 
			and many other languages, German, Portuguese, Norwegian etc. have 
			undergone repeated reforms to try to simplify and codify the 
			spelling of words (often in the teeth of considerable opposition).&nbsp; 
			There are hundreds of such academies around the world, all devoted 
			to formalising, correcting and sometimes reforming the way a 
			language is used and written.&nbsp; For example, we have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Académie française for French<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nederlandse Taalunie for Dutch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rat für deutsche Rechtschreibung for German<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Institut d'Estudis Catalans for Catalan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Accademia della Crusca for Italian<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española for Spanish<br />
			and even<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pontifical Academy for Latin<br />
			as well as at least 12 focused on Arabic of various forms.<br />
			English has never had such an academy (although some have tried to 
			start one) so the language remains unreformed.</li>
			<li>English is spoken as a first or second language by around 800 
			million people and it is an official language in around 60 
			countries.&nbsp; There are small but significant differences in 
			spelling around the world.&nbsp; It is not only a difference 
			between British and American spellings, either.&nbsp; Canadian 
			English, for example, generally prefers <em>color</em> to <em>colour</em> 
			but retains the British <em>centre</em> instead of the American <em>
			center</em>.&nbsp; Indian English usually prefers to follow British 
			spelling conventions as does Australian English (at least nowadays) 
			despite Australians normally using an American computer keyboard layout, by the 
			way.</li>

		<h2>English spelling: the good news</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>One advantage of having a rather odd spelling system is that 
		meaning can often be inferred from spelling.&nbsp; For example, in 
		English, these three words are pronounced the same (they are 
		homophones):</p>
		<p class="auto-style40"><span class="style_black"><em><span class="auto-style7">rite, write, 
		right</span></em></span></p>
		<p>But, because of the different spellings, we can easily see which are 
		connected to the following words and if we know the base word, we can 
		have a good stab at inferring the meaning of the others:</p>
		<p class="auto-style40"><span class="auto-style8"><em>written, ritual, rightness, rights, 
		writing, rites, righteous</em></span></p>
		<p>Spelling and 
		meaning, in English, are connected.<br />
		Reforming English spelling would mean that this handy reference 
		would disappear and all three words would probably be spelled <em>rite</em>.<br />
		That, many argue, would be a loss.&nbsp; English, they point out, is not
		<span class="style_underline">meant</span> to have a phonetic spelling 
		system.</p>
		<p>So, next time your students despair of being able to spell correctly, 
		it may be worth pointing this out.</p>
		<p>Another thing to point out to despairing learners is that native 
		speakers also have trouble.&nbsp; We often see, for example, <em>dessicate, 
		acommodation</em> (or <em>accomodation</em>), <em>embarass, wierd, definately</em> and so on.<br />
		You, of course, can correct all those.</p>

		</table>
		<p>The term diacritic refers to the accent marks which exist in many languages and show a 
		difference in pronunciation (or used to).<br />
		Modern English retains the use of some accent marks on imported words, 
		almost always those from French, but it is often a matter of personal 
		taste.&nbsp; Using <em>role</em> instead of <em>r&ocirc;le</em> is 
		common and <em>h&ocirc;tel</em> is almost never seen, for example.&nbsp; 
		However, in other cases, words more recently or more obviously borrowed 
		from French retain the accents: <em>cliché, caf&eacute;, vis-&agrave;-vis, 
		tête-&agrave;-tête </em>etc.<br />
		When there is a possibility of ambiguity, the convention is to retain 
		the accent markers, so we have <em>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</em> and <em>
		resume</em>.<br />
		Loan words from other languages usually get stripped of their 
		diacritics, although <em>&uuml;ber</em> from German is seen alongside <em>
		uber</em>.&nbsp; The words <em>doppelganger</em> and <em>doppelgänger</em> 
		are in free variation and English usually removes the capital letter 
		obligatory on German on all nouns.&nbsp; The Turkish <em>döner</em> <em>
		kebap</em> is almost always spelled as <em>doner kebab</em> in English.</p>

		<h2><a name="bram"></a>English (BrE) and American (AmE)</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>English (BrE) and American spelling (AmE) differ as everyone knows 
		but the differences are not huge.&nbsp; The number of words affected is 
		probably fewer than 400.&nbsp; (Given that the 20-volume Oxford English 
		Dictionary contains entries for 171,476 words in current use, and the 
		Oxford website estimates that there are at least 250,000 distinct words 
		in English, that 
		represents a tiny proportion, less than 0.25%.)<br />
		In most cases, the AmE variant is simpler.<br />
		Here are the most commonly cited differences:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="greybulletlist">the 'u' is omitted for the BrE <em>
			colour, favour </em>etc. to give <em>color, flavor</em> etc.&nbsp; 
			In fact, the spelling without the 'u' was the normal one in Britain 
			until Shakespeare's time.&nbsp; By the way, <em>glamour</em> is 
			spelled the same in both varieties.</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">final 'e' is dropped from words like <em>
			axe</em> and when adding a suffix which makes the 'e' silent as in
			<em>ageing</em> (BrE) and <em>aging</em> (AmE).&nbsp; Note, however, 
			that both varieties usually keep the 'e' when losing it would affect 
			the pronunciation of the preceding consonant so both BrE and AmE 
			have <em>changeable, traceable</em> etc.&nbsp; BrE does in fact 
			often drop the 'e' in words like <em>lovable, movable, provable</em> 
			etc.</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">likewise the final silent vowels on words 
			like <em>catalogue</em> and <em>dialogue</em> are dropped to get the AmE <em>
			catalog</em> and <em>dialog</em>.&nbsp; (This does not happen with
			<em>tongue</em> which is spelled the same in both varieties.)</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">words in BrE which end '-mme' usually end 
			simple '-m' in AmE: <em>programme, program</em> is the only obvious example but 
			some British English speakers use <em>kilogramme</em> and <em>telegramme</em>.&nbsp; 
			That is becoming quite rare.</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">words ending '-re' in BrE are generally 
			spelled with '-er' in AmE: <em>centre, center, fibre, fiber, calibre, 
			caliber</em> etc.</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">words which end with '-ce' in BrE will 
			often end with '-se' in AmE: <em>defence, defense, offence, offense</em> 
			etc.</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">when BrE distinguishes between the noun 
			(e.g., <em>practice, licence</em>) and the verb (e.g., <em>practise, 
			license</em>), AmE does not, preferring the '-ce' ending for all.</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">BrE prefers, on the whole, '-ise' in 
			words like <em>organise</em> but both spellings are acceptable (the '-ize' 
			spellings are those preferred by Oxford University Press, for 
			example).&nbsp; AmE prefers '-ize' on such words although there are 
			exceptions in words like <em>advertise, comprise, exercise, 
			franchise </em>etc. due to the words' sources.&nbsp; The same 
			consideration affects the small number of words ending in '-yse' / 
			'-yze' where BrE prefers <em>analyse</em> and <em>paralyse</em>, 
			most AmE writers will use <em>analyze</em> and <em>paralyze</em>.<br />
			Some words, 
			such as <em>capsize</em> and <em>prize</em> are spelled with the 'z' 
			in both varieties.&nbsp; In fact, again, the '-ize' ending is the 
			older one and the '-ise' ending a relative newcomer.</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">there is a small and not especially 
			interesting debate concerning the alternative spellings of, e.g.,
			<em>connection/connexion, inflexion/inflexion</em> and so on.&nbsp; 
			It was the case that BrE preferred the 'x' spelling but this is no 
			longer standard in most texts.&nbsp; The differences were due to 
			British users' insistence on complying with the words' Latin 
			etymologies.&nbsp; On this site, <em>inflexion</em> is spelled with the 
			'x' alternative but the forms are in free variation in other cases.&nbsp; (There are two exceptions: <em>complexion</em> 
			and <em>crucifixion</em> are spelled with 'x' in all varieties.)</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">BrE doubles the final 'l' in, e.g., <em>
			label - labelled, cancel - cancelled</em> but AmE usually does not (<em>labeled, 
			canceled</em>).</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">BrE 'ae' and 'oe' spellings on foreign 
			words are usually reduced to 'e' in AmE so we have <em>encyclopaedia</em> 
			and <em>encyclopedia</em> etc.&nbsp; The simpler spelling is 
			becoming more common in BrE.</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">In British English, <em>inquiry</em> 
			means a formal investigation and <em>enquiry</em> means simply 
			questioning.&nbsp; In AmE, only <em>inquiry</em> exists.&nbsp; 
			Similarly, <em>insure</em> in British usage means <em>protect 
			against</em> and <em>ensure</em> means <em>make certain</em>.&nbsp; 
			In AmE usage, only <em>insure</em> is used.</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">There are some other minor, random 
			differences (BrE / AmE):<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>aeroplane / airplane<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			cosy / cozy<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; storey / story 
			</em>(for a building)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cheque / check </em>(with a change in meaning from money order to bill)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grey / gray<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gaol / jail
			</em>(the latter is now ubiquitous in BrE and the former 
			considered old fashioned)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mould / mold<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			plough / plow<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speciality / specialty<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			jewellery / jewelry</em></li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">Hyphenation is less frequently used in 
			AmE than in BrE so we get, e.g.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; re-enter / reenter<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			pre-empt / preempt</em><br />
			and so on.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>As a rule of thumb, Commonwealth countries tend to follow the BrE 
		rules although Canadian use is more often influenced by AmE.</p>
		<p>There's no test on all this but there are plenty of spelling tests to 
		be had on line (with a good one at

		<h2>Writing systems</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>This survey of English spelling would not be complete (as far as 
		teaching the system is concerned) without some consideration of other 
		people's writing systems.<br />
		There are three fundamental sorts:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Alphabetic systems<br />
			English has ostensibly an alphabetic system in which individual 
			letters represent individual sounds (phonemes) but, as we saw above, 
			spelling in English is not a good guide often to pronunciation and 
			vice versa.&nbsp; English may be described as having deep 
			orthographic depth.&nbsp; This means that the system is poor in 
			relation to shallow languages such as German or Serbo-Croat in which 
			there is a good correspondence between spelling and pronunciation.<br />
			Most European languages and many languages which have only recently 
			acquired a written form use an alphabetic system of writing although 
			scripts vary from Latin (in which this is written) through Greek and 
			Cyrillic to many other systems.&nbsp; For obvious reasons, 
			alphabetic systems are sometimes referred to as segmental systems 
			because each word can be broken down into sound segments.</li>
			<li>Syllabic systems<br />
			In these writing systems, each grapheme (i.e., independent symbol) 
			represents a syllable rather than a single sound.&nbsp; Examples 
			include Arabic, the Japanese Hiragana script, Hebrew and Amharic 
			among others.&nbsp; Languages which deploy scripts like these 
			usually have a syllabary (i.e., the total number of available 
			syllables) which is quite limited.&nbsp; English would be ill-suited 
			to such as system as the number of possible syllables is well over 
			10,000 and each would require a separate grapheme to represent it.&nbsp; 
			Japanese, by contrast, makes do with around 100 syllables so the 
			language is suited to this form of written representation.<br />
			The Arabic script is used incidentally, for many other languages 
			unrelated to Arabic (or only distantly so).</li>
			<li>Logographic systems<br />
			In these systems, each word is represented by a single symbol.&nbsp; 
			The most obvious and famous examples are the Chinese languages and 
			these are the only common surviving languages to use a logographic 
			system.&nbsp; For example, the symbol
			<img alt="sun" height="16" src="../../imagesgraphics/chinese_sun16x16.gif" width="16" /> 
			represents the concept of <em>sun</em> or <em>day</em>.&nbsp; 
			Egyptian hieroglyphics are another familiar form of logographic 
			writing.&nbsp; Chinese characters are extensively used in written 
			Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Each type of writing system is processed by readers in a different 
		way and there is good reason to suppose that these processing strategies 
		will, especially in the early stages of learning, be carried over to 
		attempts to read in English.&nbsp; For example, Arabic speakers may be 
		indifferent to vowels (as they are not represented in Arabic) and may 
		confuse, e.g., <em>glass</em> with <em>gallons.</em>&nbsp; Even speakers 
		of languages which use a Latin script such as Spanish may have problems 
		processing words in English because Spanish has a relatively shallow 
		orthography.</p>

		<h2>Spelling sounds</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>One area of clear irregularity in English concerns the spelling of 
		individual sounds rather than whole words.&nbsp; English is not unique 
		in this respect but it is, perhaps, an extreme example.<br />
		Many other languages, including Portuguese and Modern Greek have very 
		weak relationships between sound and spelling.&nbsp; Portuguese, for 
		example, has only 5 vowel symbols but these can be pronounced in 17 
		different ways and the language's 18 consonants have 30 pronunciations.&nbsp; 
		Modern Greek has no fewer than 6 ways to spell the long 'ee' (/iː/) 
		sound.</p>
		<p>This makes 
		writing unknown words down from dictation in English a very challenging and often 
		disheartening business.&nbsp; It is much easier to write down accurately 
		what you hear in some other languages, especially those that have 
		undergone occasional reform of the writing system to get closer to a 
		one-to-one relationship between the sound and the spelling, such as 
		German or Spanish.</p>
		<p>In the in-service section of this site, some detail is provided 
		concerning how consonant and vowel sounds are conventionally spelled in 
		English.&nbsp; For consonants, for example:</p>
		<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
			<li>the sound /b/ can be spelled 'bb' or 'b' as in <em>bubble</em> 
			so there are only two possibilities and bb can only come in the 
			middle of a word.</li>
			<li>the sound /k/, on the other hand, can be spelled c as in <em>cab</em>, 
			k as in <em>kid</em>, kk as in <em>trekker, </em>ch as in <em>chord</em>, 
			q as in <em>liquor </em>or cc as <em>account</em> so there are six 
			possibilities.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Vowel sounds are more variable so, for example:</p>
		<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
			<li>the long ee sound, represented as /i:/ can be spelled ee as in
			<em>meek</em>, ea as in <em>beat</em>, ie as in <em>field</em>, ei 
			as in <em>conceive</em>, i as in <em>ski</em>, ey as in <em>key</em> 
			and even oe as in <em>people</em> so there are at least seven 
			possibilities.</li>
			<li>the short vowel in a word like <em>sock</em> is almost always 
			spelled o as in <em>lock</em>, <em>hot</em>, <em>cot</em> etc. but 
			there are some exceptions such as a as in <em>watch</em>, au as in
			<em>sausage</em> and ou as in <em>cough</em>.</li>
