		</div>
		<div id="wordclass2" style="visibility: hidden"><p class="style_brown">Group A words are called 
			<strong>open-class</strong> items because in theory we 
		can keep adding more to the list indefinitely.&nbsp; Languages 
		consistently create new nouns, for example, to describe new events or 
		objects.<br />
		Group B words are <strong>closed-system</strong> items.&nbsp; We do not usually create 
		new prepositions (although we can) and introducing a new pronoun into 
		the language is extremely rare.<br />
			There are other classifications which we could use and popular one 
			is to divide words into member of two groups:</p>
			<ol class="style_brown">
				<li>
				Major words classes:<ol class="auto-style67">
					<li>Lexical verbs (which are verbs which carry intrinsic meaning 
				such as <em>hear, encourage, avoid, jump</em> etc.)</li>
					<li>Nouns</li>
					<li>Adjectives</li>
					<li>Adverbs</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
				Minor word classes<ol class="auto-style67">
					<li>Auxiliary verbs, which carry no intrinsic meaning but function 
				to express how the speakers feels about the main verb (<em>must, 
				can, should</em> etc.) or operate to make tense forms (<em>have</em> in 
					<em>he 
				has arrived</em>, <em>be</em> in <em>he is laughing </em>etc.).&nbsp; The first group 
				of these are called modal auxiliary verbs and the second group 
				are primary auxiliary verbs and there are guides to all of them 
				on this site.</li>
					<li>Pronouns</li>
					<li>Determiners (which includes articles and demonstratives 
					in the first division above)</li>
					<li>Prepositions</li>
					<li>Conjunctions</li>
					<li>Interjections</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is no simple way to divide the hundreds of thousand of words in the language as we shall see shortly.</p>
			</div>
			
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				<h3>Determiners: the missing class</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>There is, in fact, a word class missing from this list which is 
			used in more modern grammars: <strong>determiners</strong>.<br />
			Determiners are words which modify nouns (just as adjectives, 
			demonstratives and articles do).&nbsp; In older grammars, 
			determiners were often classed as adjectives (we can have <em>few 
			dogs </em>and <em>fewer dogs) </em>or as demonstratives (<em>these 
			books, that man</em>) or as articles (<em>the car, some sugar</em>) 
			or even as pronouns.<br />
			This is not satisfactory in many ways so the modern term for words 
			such as <em>each, all, more, the, a, several, these, either</em> etc. when 
			they come before nouns is simply 
			determiner.<br />
			How determiners work in English is not a simple matter to analyse 
			and is the subject of 
			<a href="../../inservice/lexicogrammar/determiners.html">a separate guide</a>.&nbsp; 
			Following that guide successfully will be quite difficult if the 
			area is new to you.&nbsp; You will almost certainly need to 
			understand issues of (un)countability in nouns before tackling it.</p>
		<p>Now <a href="wordclasshp.htm">click for a test</a> to 
		see if you can identify what these different word classes actually do in 
		the language.&nbsp; Don't worry if you don't get it all right.&nbsp; 
		It's explained below.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="overlap" height="166" src="../../images/overlapping_leaves250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style31">
				<h2>Overlapping word classes</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>It is a mistake to assume that we can look at a word and from its 
			meaning or appearance, consign it to one of the 10 or 11 word 
			classes we have identified.&nbsp; That's not how it works.<br />
			In fact, we consign words to classes by their positions in sentences 
			and their grammatical function.&nbsp; Meaning comes a distant third.<br />
			This is what is meant:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Some words are only members of one word class.&nbsp; So, for 
				example, <em>ceiling</em> is a noun and nothing else, <em>decide</em> 
				is a verb only, <em>between</em> is a preposition and so on.</li>
				<li>Many thousands of words can be members of two or more word 
				classes, however, depending on what they are doing in a sentence 
				so, for example, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please clean the car</em><br />
				the word <em>clean</em> is operating as a verb but in:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; The car is clean already</em><br />
				the word is operating as an adjective.</li>
				<li>Some words have characteristic of more than one word class 
				so, for example:<br />
				<em>that</em> is a demonstrative determiner which has a plural 
				form (<em>those</em>)<br />
				<em>little</em> is a determiner (and sometimes a pronoun) which 
				has comparative and superlative forms (<em>less</em> and <em>
				least</em>) which makes it work like an adjective.<br />
				Another example is that in<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is running</em><br />
				the word <em>running</em> is clearly a verb but in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Running is good exercise</em><br />
				the word is operating as a noun but still looks like a verb (and 
				retains its meaning).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			And so on.&nbsp; Do not be tempted to jump to conclusions and 
			suggest to learners that a word is always assigned to one of the 
			main classes.&nbsp; Context is vital.<br />
			The phenomenon we see here is called gradience or categorical 
			indeterminacy which simple means that we accept that word-class 
			boundaries are sometimes fuzzy.<br />

		<p><a name="10"></a>Apart from obvious (and slightly inaccurate) distinctions between abstract 
		nouns (<em>beauty, hope</em> etc.), 
		concrete nouns (<em>apple, table </em>etc.) and proper nouns (<em>James, Canada</em> etc.), there is a key distinction 
		learners (and you) need to understand:<br />
		
		<span class="style_brown">countability</span> 
		and <span class="style_brown">uncountability</span>.<br />
		Countable nouns can be preceded by a number (<em>two cats</em>), <em>some</em> 
		(<em>some dogs</em>) and <em>a few</em>.&nbsp; They usually take plural endings.&nbsp; 
		In the plural, we use a plural form of the verb with them <em>(are</em> 
		not <em>is</em>, for example).<br />
		Uncountable nouns are better referred to as mass nouns and 
		cannot be preceded by a number or <em>a few</em> (but can be preceded by
		<em>some</em>) and only take plurals in unusual meanings when we make 
		them countable.&nbsp; We use the singular form of the verb with these.<br />
		Divide these</p>
		<p class="auto-style20"><em><span class="auto-style21">sugar, pea, furniture, happiness, sheep, army, 
		money, attention, pliers, coffee, teacher, food, door, discomfort, 
		information, luggage, suitcase, chair</span></em></p>
		<p>and then click 
		<a href="#10" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'wordclass4',0,'style.visibility','visible')">here for some comments</a>.</p>
		<div id="wordclass4" style="visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">
		<p>It's not as easy as it looks, is it?&nbsp; There are two important 
		things to understand.</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>Some words (such as <em>sugar</em> and <em>door</em>) are clear cases of 
		uncountable and countable examples.&nbsp; Others are more complicated 
				because we can use them in both ways with different meanings.&nbsp; 
				Compare<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have my attention</em> (uncountable)<br />
				with<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His 
				attentions are unwelcome</em> (countable).<br />
				Some nouns, 
				such as <em>sheep</em> are countable but take no plural.&nbsp; 
				Some obviously countable things, such as <em>money</em>, are 
				treated as uncountable in English.<br />  Virtually all 
				uncountable nouns can be made countable in English when we are 
				using them to classify things. For example<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some coffees which are too bitter for me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have lots of German wines on the list</em> etc.</li>
				<li>Different languages deal with these things differently.&nbsp; 
				In German, for example,<em> information</em> is a countable 
				noun.&nbsp; In Greek, so is<em> money</em>.&nbsp; When introducing a 
				noun, remember that students will probably presume it's 
				countable unless you make it clear otherwise.<br />
				So you'll 
				get people saying <em>furnitures </em>and it'll be your fault, 
				not theirs!<br />

					<p class="style_brown">The issue here is called 
					transitivity.&nbsp; Transitive verbs take an object, 
					intransitive verbs don't but some verbs can do both.<br />
					We can say<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smoke<br />
					</em>with no object so intransitive, and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smoked a cigarette<br />
					</em>with the object so transitive.<br />
					We can say<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She carried the box<br />
					</em>transitive<em><br />
					</em>but not<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She 
					carried</em>.<br />
					because <em>carry</em> is always transitive.<br />
					We can say<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrived<br />
					</em>but not<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrived / went / came the airport</em>.<br />
					because arrive, go and come are all intransitive verbs.<br />
					Sometimes, there's a change in meaning:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He can hear<br />
					</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He can hear it<br />
					</em>are different meanings of the verb.<br />
					When you teach a new verb, bear in mind that languages deal 
					with transitivity differently.&nbsp; In some languages, for 
					example, you can say<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I jumped the table<br />
					</em>meaning 
					onto, not over, or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She 
					listened the music</em>.<br />
					Set verbs in a context and 
					make sure that your learners are aware of whether they are 
					transitive, intransitive or both.</p>

		<p>This a notoriously difficult area of English because there's seems 
		little rhyme or reason to which preposition we use where.&nbsp; The 
		other issue, as usual, is that languages differ.&nbsp; Some languages 
		don't use prepositions at all, preferring <em>post-</em>positions, so we 
		get <em>The bridge along</em>.<br />
		But there are some rules.</p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li>Distinguish between movement and position:<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>I went <span class="style_black">to</span> the station</em> (direction of movement)</li>
				<li><em>I arrived <span class="style_black">at</span> the station</em> (position)</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Distinguish between exact place and general place:<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>He is <span class="style_black">in</span> the station 
				<span class="style_black">at</span> the booking office</em></li>
				<li><em>He is <span class="style_black">in</span> London 
				<span class="style_black">at</span> the station</em></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Distinguish between prepositions which describe absolute 
			position and those which describe things from the speaker's point of 
			view:<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>The house is <span class="style_black">between</span> two trees / the house is 
				<span class="style_black">next to / 
				near</span> the cinema / the house is opposite the church</em> 
				(wherever you are standing)</li>
				<li><em>The house is <span class="style_black">behind</span> the trees / the house is 
				<span class="style_black">in front of </span>the garage</em> (from where you are standing)</li>

			<p>There is, of course, a separate 			<a href="adjectivesessentials.html" target="_blank">essential guide 
			to adjectives</a> so this will be brief.<br />
			Adjectives in English modify nouns (usually) to distinguish them in 
			some way and (usually) come in 
			one of two places:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Before the noun </strong>they describe (attributive 
				use):</dt>

				<span class="style_black">huge</span> house</em> etc.</dd>
				<dt>A<strong>fter the noun </strong>they describe and linked to 
				it by a verb such as be, look like, taste, smell, appear etc. 
				(predicative use):</dt>
				<dd><em>The cat is <span class="style_black">fat</span>, the 
				house appeared <span class="style_black">huge</span></em> etc.</dd>

				<h2>Articles</h2>

			</table>
			
			<p>Articles are a sub-class of determiners.<br />
			Again, there's 
			<a href="../../inservice/lexicogrammar/articles.html" target="_blank">a 
			more advanced guide to articles</a> on the site.<br />
			There are only three true articles in English: <em>a, an</em> and
			<em>the</em>.&nbsp; The other choice in English is no article at all 
			and that is usually represented by a zero sign, like this: <strong>∅</strong>.&nbsp; 
			The zero article is important because it is used in English to refer 
			to all instances of something.<br />
			(Some analyses will include <em>some</em> in the 
			list but it's actually not an article although it can work in a very 
			similar fashion.)<br />
			A few examples are all that's needed here:<br />
			<em><span class="style_black">a</span> house,
			<span class="style_black">a</span> university,
			<span class="style_black">an</span> apple</em> etc. (The 
			choice of <em>a </em>or <em>an</em> is determined by the <strong>sound</strong> of the following word, 
			not the spelling.)<br />
			<em><span class="style_black">the</span> house,
			<span class="style_black">the</span> man I met</em> etc.<br />
			<span class="style_black">∅</span> people often complain,
			<span class="style_black">∅</span> cars pollute etc.</p>
			<p>The rules for deciding which article to use are not simple so go 
			to the guide to articles for more detail.&nbsp; Essentially, the 
			rule is:</p>
		<p>Decide what you are talking about.&nbsp; There are <strong>only</strong> 
		three choices:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				One of many &ndash; indefinite specific reference (<em><span class="style_black">a</span> 
			house, <span class="style_black">a</span> person,
				<span class="style_black">an</span> idiot</em> etc.)
				</li>
				<li>
				All of them, everywhere &ndash; generic reference (<em><span class="style_black">∅</span> 
			people, <span class="style_black">∅</span> tigers,
				<span class="style_black">∅</span> computers</em> etc.)
				</li>
				<li>
				This one exactly &ndash; definite specific reference (<em><span class="style_black">the</span> 
			woman on <span class="style_black">the</span> corner,
				<span class="style_black">the</span> train for
				<span class="style_black">∅</span> London, 
				<span class="style_black">the</span> visitors to 
				<span class="style_black">the</span> park,
				<span class="style_black">the</span> tourist industry</em> etc.)</li>

			<p>Adverbs are words which modify verbs just as adjectives modify

			There is an <a href="adverbsessentials.html" target="_blank">

			what is meant will do here:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked <span class="style_black">slowly</span> and

			<p>Again, there are guides to pronouns on this site accessible from 			<a href="../initialindex.html">the initial plus training index</a>.<br />
			Pronouns stand in for or replace nouns so instead of saying <em>The 
			rain fell and the rain was heavy</em> we can say <em>The rain fell 
			and <span class="style_black">it</span> was heavy</em>. Essentially, 
			there are two sorts:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Personal pronouns.&nbsp; For example:</dt>
				<dd><em>Mary didn't have a pen so <span class="style_black">I</span> 
				gave her <span class="style_black">mine</span></em> (instead of
				<em>Mary didn't have a pen so this person gave Mary the pen 
				belonging to this person</em>)</dd>
				<dt>Other pronouns.&nbsp; For example:</dt>
				<dd><em><span class="style_black">Somebody</span> is at the door</em> 
				(instead of <em>An unknown person is at the door</em>)<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">Nothing</span> is too much trouble</em>

				<em><span class="style_black">He</span> wanted money so

			<p>Demonstratives are a sub-class of determiners.<br />
			There are four of these in English (<em>this, that, these, those</em>) 
			and they refer to what we want to talk about.&nbsp; In other words, 
			they <strong>demonstrate</strong> or point out what we are referring 
			to.&nbsp; There are two decisions to make:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Is it near or far?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Use <em>this</em> or <em>these</em> for things near to you:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want <span class="style_black">this</span> one, I can give 
				you <span class="style_black">these</span> tickets</em><br />
				Use <em>that</em> or <em>those</em> for things further away:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I have <span class="style_black">that</span> one? Take
				<span class="style_black">those</span> tickets over there</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Is it singular, uncountable or plural?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Use <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> for singular or 
				uncountable nouns:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give him <span class="style_black">that</span> wine, I 
				didn't ask for <span class="style_black">this</span> meal</em><br />
				Use <em>these</em> and <em>those</em> for plural nouns:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I take <span class="style_black">these</span> glasses? I 
				haven't opened <span class="style_black">those</span> bottles 
				yet</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Demonstratives can also act as pronouns:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want <span class="style_black">these</span> apples </em>
			(demonstrative), <em>I want <span class="style_black">those</span></em> 
			(pronoun).</p>
