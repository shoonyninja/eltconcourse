			<p>There are literally thousands of adverbs which end in -<em>ly</em> 
			and very often that is what students are told is the defining 
			characteristic but that can be misleading.&nbsp; If you see a word 
			which ends in -<em>ly</em>, you may be tempted to classify it as an 
			adverb.&nbsp; That is the way to bet but be careful of adjectives 
			like <em>friendly</em> or <em>wrinkly</em>, verbs like
			<em>sully</em> and so on.&nbsp; All of 
			the following can be adverbs and not one ends in -<em>ly</em>.<br />
			<em>now, yesterday, next week, here, often, seldom, ad infinitum, 
			afterwards, beforehand</em></p>
			<p><strong>If you want to identify an adverb, the only safe way is 
			to look at what it is doing (see above).</strong></p>

			<p>This category, a sub-category of time 
			adverbs gets its own section because it is troublesome for learners.<br />
			There are two sorts of these adverbs:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				Adverbs of definite frequency:<br />
				These refer to measurable amounts of time and include, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I get the newspaper daily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She travels to London weekly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We meet annually</em><br />
				The normal position for these adverbs is at the end of a clause, 
				after the verb, its object or any prepositional phrase.<br />
				Placing the adverbs anywhere else usually results in non-English 
				or special emphasis.<br />
				Apart from <em>annually</em> and <em>seasonally</em>, these 
				adverbs also functions as adjectives:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a monthly meeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a yearly trip<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a daily news broadcast</em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>
				Adverbs of indefinite frequency:<br />
				These refer to how often something happens but not in measurable 
				terms.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seldom go to see her</em><br />
				vs.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I often go to see her</em><br />
				are comparably different but tell us nothing more than a rough 
				idea of frequency.&nbsp; We do not know if the speaker means 
				daily, monthly, annually or once a year.<br />
				There are three issues with these adverbs:<ol class="auto-style66">
					<li>Strength:<br />
					It is a traditional classroom practice to place these on a 
					cline, like this:<br />
					<img alt="cline" height="135" src="../../imagesgraphics/frequency_adverbs.png" width="465" /><br />
					but that's only a guide because native speakers will often 
					disagree about where on the cline the adverbs occur.</li>
					<li>Sentence type:<ol class="auto-style67">
						<li>Two of the adverbs do not occur in negative 
						sentences:<br />
						We accept:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sometimes see my sister<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you occasionally meet your brother in London?</em><br />
						but not:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't sometimes see her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She does not occasionally meet her brother</em></li>
						<li>Five of these adverbs do not occur in questions or 
						negative sentences:<br />
						We accept<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hardly ever go to London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She scarcely ever asks for help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We seldom eat before seven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They never arrive on time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She rarely wants to eat out</em><br />
						but not, usually:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Do you hardly ever go to London?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I don't scarcely see her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She didn't seldom eat out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We don't never arrive on time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Does she rarely eat out?</em><br />
						etc.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Position:<ol class="auto-style67">
						<li>All these frequency adverbs usually appear before 
						the main verb and after any auxiliary verb so, we 
						accept, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seldom been to his house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can scarcely ever take the early train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sometimes work late</em><br />
						but not<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I have been seldom to his house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We scarcely ever can take the early train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They work sometimes late</em></li>
						<li>They occur, however, <span class="style_underline">
						before</span> semi-modal auxiliary verbs<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She often has to come in early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is often able to help me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They seldom used to entertain guests<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They seldom dare to go</em></li>
						<li>They always follow the verb <em>be</em>:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am always late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is never on time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are scarcely ever helpful</em></li>
						<li>The adverbs <em>often, usually, sometimes </em>and
						<em>occasionally</em> can occur at the end of clauses:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; They work late in the office sometimes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She comes to the house occasionally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He complains about having no money often</em><br />
						Others in this category can occur at the end of clauses 
						but only with some special emphasis.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Two adverbs of frequency are not in the lists above because they 
			have special characteristics:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><em><strong>generally</strong></em><br />
				This is an adverb of frequency but it is difficult to place it 
				on a cline because, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He generally doesn't come to see me = He 
				rarely comes to see me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She generally complains about the food = She usually 
				complains about the food.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you generally eat early? = Do you usually eat early</em><br />
				So, in positive and interrogative sentences, the word means <em>
				usually</em> but in negatives, it means <em>seldom</em> or <em>
				rarely</em>.</li>
				<li><strong><em>ever</em></strong><br />
				This is the positive form of <em>never</em> and occurs regularly 
				in questions to elicit a statement of frequency:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you ever go to the cinema?&nbsp; 
				Rarely, these days</em><br />
				It can also occur in negative sentences with the sense of <em>
				never</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't ever wait for an answer</em><br />
				and is generally in the sense of a complaint.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you can see, these adverbs have special characteristics which 
			are not paralleled in other languages and cause, in particular, 
			word-ordering problems for learners.&nbsp; Handle with care.</p>

			<p>Adjectives, as you know if you have 
			followed the guide, can usually be modified two ways to show 
			comparison or superlatives.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				By adding -<em>er</em> and -<em>est</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm older than her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's the youngest in the family</em></li>
				<li>
				By using <em>more</em> and <em>most</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hotel was more expensive than I 
				expected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the most beautiful painting</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Adverbs are a little different because they are almost always 
			compared using <em>more</em> and <em>most</em> so we do not say, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*He drive slowlier than me</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She came quicker than her brother</em><br />
			but say:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove more slowly than me</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came more quickly than her brother</em></p>
			<p>However, there are two issues:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Some short adverbs which do not end in -ly can be used with 
				-<em>er</em> and -<em>est</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked harder than anyone else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove faster than I did.</em><br />
				The other common adverbs that take this form are: <em>near, 
				soon, late, early</em>.<br />
				The adverb <em>often</em> can be used both ways informally but 
				some do not approve of <em>oftener</em>.</li>
				<li>In colloquial speech, we often hear short adverbs being 
				modified like adjectives (but it is considered wrong by most 
				people):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain fell heavier<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun shone brighter and brighter</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the classroom, the safest rule is that, apart from <em>fast, 
			soon, near, late, early</em> and <em>hard</em>, adverbs should not 
			be modified with -<em>er</em> and -<em>est</em>.</p>
			<p>There are some irregular forms:<br />
