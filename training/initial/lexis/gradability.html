		<h1>Gradability</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="3" height="207" src="../../images/three_apples_tape310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p>The following applies to both adjectives and adverbs because the 
		considerations are the same.</p>
		<p>Before we start, mark the following right or wrong in your head and 
		then click on the table for an answer.</p>
		<p>
		<img id="img1" alt="gradability task" height="269" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'../../imagesgraphics/gradabletask1ans.png')" src="../../imagesgraphics/gradabletask1.png" width="250" /></p>
		<p>If you have ticked <em>a bit uniquely</em> and crossed <em>very blue</em>, 
		don't worry.&nbsp; You are in good company.<br />
		The distinction here is that <em>freezing, marvellously</em> and <em>
		uniquely</em> are examples of what some call ungradable adjectives or adverbs but <em>
		tall, warm, blue </em>and<em> humid</em> are usually considered 
		gradable.&nbsp; This means:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We allow expressions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very warm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quite marvellously<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extremely humid</em><br />
				because we are using the right modifiers: <em>very</em> and <em>
				extremely</em> for gradable concepts and <em>quite</em> (meaning
				<em>completely</em>) for more extreme ideas.</li>
				<li>We do not allow expressions such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wholly warm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very marvellously<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slightly unique</em><br />
				because we are using the wrong modifiers to change the meanings 
				of gradable concepts.</li>

			</table>
			<p>The first thing we need to address is just what is meant by 
			gradable or ungradable.&nbsp; In some analyses, you will find the 
			following mixture of adjectives and adverbs all described as 
			ungradable:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;perfect, hideously, marvellously, fantastic, metal, 
			pregnant, disgustingly, completely</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			It is clear that the adjectives, <em>perfect, metal</em> and <em>
			pregnant</em> as well as the adverb <em>completely</em> are truly 
			ungradable so we cannot allow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *v<em>ery perfect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *somewhat metal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a bit pregnant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *absolutely completely<br />
			</em>because something or someone is either perfect or not, made of 
			metal or not, pregnant or not and you can finish something 
			completely or not finish it at all so there are no intermediate 
			stages as there are with, for example, gradable adjectives and 
			adverbs such as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; good, nastily, nice, imaginatively, fat, happily</em><br />
			and so on so it is perfectly OK to allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather nastily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quite nice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extremely imaginatively<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a little fat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very happily</em><br />
			to denote various shades of strength.</p>
			<p>However, other adjectives and adverbs in the list are not 
			ungradable as much as they are irregular graded and they include, 
			for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; marvellous, excellent, dreadful, 
			disgustingly, wonderful</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			These are often described as extreme adjectives and the suggestion 
			sometimes is that they are ungradable.&nbsp; They are not, because 
			we can allow:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fairly marvellous<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; really excellent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; utterly dreadful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; somewhat disgustingly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; totally wonderful</em><br />
			and all those phrases denote a grade of the adjective or adverb.<br />
			However, in none of these cases can we grade like this:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *very marvellous<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *very excellent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *very disgustingly</em><br />
			and so on and this is why some describe them as ungradable.<br />
			The truth of the matter is that we <strong>can</strong> grade the 
			words but only by using a more limited set of adverbs to do so.</p>
			<p>We have, therefore, to make a distinctions between:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Truly ungradable terms<br />
				which have no intermediate stages such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iron, dead, completely, fully, empty, shattered, waterless<br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>Items unusually graded<br />
				because they are extreme which are gradable but differently so 
				such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fantastic, boiling, soaking, enormous<br />
				and so on which are at one end or other of a scale and there is 
				simply nowhere to go from there with ordinary grading 
				expressions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In what follows, we will try to keep this distinction in mind.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>By some estimates (probably wild guesses, in fact) there are some 
		100,000 adjectives and adverbs in English and the overwhelming majority will be 
		gradable in the normal way.&nbsp; If we take a list of some common 
		adjectives in English and a list of less common ones which mean 
		something similar, this is what we can find:</p>

			<p>The general rule is, therefore, that the more extreme adjectives

			It is sometimes said, as a shorthand guide, that the extreme 
			adjectives in the right-hand column above are ungradable but they 
			are, in fact gradable.&nbsp; We just need a different kind of 
			modifier to grade them.<br />
			When it comes to wholly ungradable adjectives and adverbs we are, therefore, dealing with exceptions.&nbsp; Most common 
			adjectives and adverbs are gradable in some way.</p>

			<li>When we do modify them, we use an intensifying adverb such as <em>
			absolutely, completely, utterly, totally</em> etc.&nbsp; So we get
			<em>absolutely terrifying, utterly wonderful, totally unfeasibly </em>etc.</li>
			<li>They are not usually used in the comparative or superlative

			(Microsoft Outlook users will by now have become inured to the 
			admonition: <span class="style_black"><em>To see the most complete,

					<h2>3 classes of ungradable adjectives and adverbs</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>The normal way to analyse the issue is to identify three basic classes 
		of ungradable adjectives and adverbs:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Absolute meaning </strong>adjectives<br />
			These include words such as <em>ultimate(ly), total(ly), entire(ly), unique(ly), 
			absolute(ly), utter(ly), perfect(ly)</em> 
			where it is logically impossible to conceive of a grade.&nbsp; Terms 
			like <em>*more unique, *very perfectly</em> and so on are, therefore, 
			often considered wrong although you will find plenty of examples of 
			their use: <em>more average, less uniquely, very complete, more 
			extreme, more total </em>etc.&nbsp; Or even:<br />
			<img alt="most unique" height="78" src="../../imagesgraphics/most_unique.jpg" width="150" /><br />
			What one is prepared to accept is often a matter of formality and 
			personal preference.</li>
			<li><strong>Specific on-off quality </strong>adjectives<strong><br />
			</strong>These are 
			usually adjectives and adverbs such as <em>metal, pregnant, unlocked, French, 
			fatally, justly</em> 
			etc.&nbsp; The reason these are not gradable is that one is either 
			<em>pregnant</em> or not, something is either <em>metal</em> or it isn't, 
			<em>locked</em> or 
			<em>unlocked </em>and you are either <em>fatally wounded</em> or not (there's no intermediate stage).&nbsp; Again, this is often 
			a rule flouted in colloquial speech and terms such as <em>She's very 
			French</em> to refer to an attitude rather than a nationality are 
			common.&nbsp; Note, too, that we can have <em>less full, half empty</em> 
			and so on but not <em>*very empty</em> although <em>very full</em> 
			is heard.<br />
			In the Daily Telegraph (a British national newspaper), we find, 
			e.g.:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>We're just very grateful that he's 
			survived this incident because it could have turned out to be quite 
			fatal<br />
			</em><span class="auto-style14">(The Daily Telegraph website)</span></span></li>
			<li><strong>Extreme
			</strong> adjectives<strong>
			</strong> (w<span class="auto-style48">hich </span>include the concept of <em>very</em> 
			or <em>extremely</em>)<em><strong><br />
			</strong></em>It is often averred (and it is often told to 
			learners) that some 'extreme' adjectives and adverbs can only be 
			modified with words like <em>utterly, completely, really </em>etc.&nbsp; 
			The commonest lists include items such as:<br />
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style3">
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style5">Gradable form</td>
					<td class="auto-style7">Ungradable form</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style8">hot</td>
					<td class="auto-style4">boiling</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style8">cold</td>
					<td class="auto-style4">freezing</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style8">beautiful</td>
					<td class="auto-style4">stunning</td>

					<td class="auto-style8">surprisingly</td>

			</table>

			It is also sometimes said, as we noted above that these are 
			ungradable forms.&nbsp; They aren't; they just need a different 
			form of grading.</li>

			<h4>The key to all this is to think about scales.</h4>
		<p>Ungradable adjectives and adverbs are variously called, strong, 
		extreme or superlative adjectives and adverbs.&nbsp; They either:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Cannot be scaled because they represent ideas which are 
				either present or absent.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The original book is better than the film</em><br />
				contains an ungradable adjective because the book cannot be a 
				little original or very original.&nbsp; It is either original or 
				it is not.<br />
				If we use the adjective in a different sense, to mean something 
				like imaginative, then it is scalable so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has a very original mind.</em></li>
				<li>Cannot be scaled because they represent the top or bottom of 
				a scale already.<br />
				We can have a scale, for example, describing the weather which 
				could look like this:<br />
				<img alt="hot cold" height="132" src="../../imagesgraphics/gradability.png" width="465" /><br />
				but here the words <em>freezing</em> and <em>boiling</em> 
				represent the ends of the scale so they cannot be graded with a 
				word such as <em>very</em>.&nbsp; All the words in between can 
				be graded like that but for the ends of the scale, we need words 
				like <em>absolutely</em> or <em>unbelievably</em>.<br />
				We can do the same kind of thing with adverbs (here, the example 
				is of indefinite frequency words):<br />
				<img alt="adverbs" height="135" src="../../imagesgraphics/frequency_adverbs.png" width="465" /><br />
				and you can see that we can grade the terms in blue to get, 
				e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very seldom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quite rarely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quite often<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only sometimes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pretty usually<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very frequently<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very occasionally</em><br />
				and so on but the words <em>never</em> and <em>always</em> can 
				only be graded with words like <em>absolutely</em>.&nbsp; They 
				occupy the extremes of the scale and are ungradable.&nbsp; (The 
				word <em>ever</em> only occurs in this sort of chart with <em>
				hardly</em> and <em>scarcely</em> as grading adverbs.)</li>

		<p>Some purportedly ungradable adjectives and adverbs occur 
		commonly in superlative and comparative structures.&nbsp; For example<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		the most stunning performance of the evening<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		Language changes.&nbsp; Once, for example, the words <em>incredible</em> and 
			<em>awesome</em> were clearly superlatives 
				in themselves and only gradable with intensifying adverbs such 
				as <em>utterly, perfectly, absolutely</em> etc.<br />
		Now, 
				however, both words often mean something like <em>good</em> and 
				have become gradable in expressions <em>very incredible, very 
			awesome</em> etc.<p>The distinction is, however, still a useful one for some teaching 
		purposes if it's handled with care.<br />
		It is true that some 
		adjectives and adverbs can only <span class="style_underline">generally</span> 
		be modified with intensifying adverbs such as <em>utterly, completely</em> 
		etc. but there are many exceptions and matters of personal choice to take 
		into account.<br />
		What is also true is that wholly gradable forms cannot usually 
		be modified with these intensifiers:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I am completely cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *it is 
		utterly hot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I am utterly ready<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She ran completely fast<br />
			</em>etc. are not allowed but even in this case there are 
		questionable examples.&nbsp; Will you accept these?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>They are perfectly bad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What she said was utterly rude<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were absolutely well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spoke utterly happily</em></p>

		<p>We can consider what classes of 
		adjectives and adverbs <strong>truly</strong> are ungradable.&nbsp; Here's a short list:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Adverbs which act to join ideas (conjuncts):<br />
			We can't have, for example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*more however<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *less consequently<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>Intensifiers and downtoners such as <em>really</em> and <em>
			slightly</em>.&nbsp; We can't have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *more really<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a bit 
			somewhat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a little slightly</em> (although <em>very slightly </em>occur<em>s</em>).</li>
			<li>Adjectives which are only used attributively, i.e., which come 
			directly before or, more rarely, after the noun (see 
			the guide to 
			adjectives, linked below, for more) such as <em>main, principal</em> etc.&nbsp; 
			We can't 
			have, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*the very main reason<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *the less principal reason</em></li>
			<li>Additive adverbs and adjectives: we can't have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *more additionally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *most 
			furthermore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *more extra<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *more additional<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>Adjectives describing origin or place:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *more German<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *less 
			Italian<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *fully Martian<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *very London<br />
			</em>are all wrong unless 
			<span lang="x-none"></span>they describe 
			behaviour rather than provenance.</li>
			<li>Classifiers: these are not true adjectives but serve to tell us 
			what category of object we are dealing with rather than what it's like.&nbsp; 
			For example, you cannot have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a more medical doctor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a hugely 
			economic problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a very racing car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a hugely oak tree<br />
			</em>etc.&nbsp; 
			Classifiers may also be called noun adjuncts.</li>
			<li>Temporal and spatial adjectives and adverbs:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*more soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			*extremely present<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *less daily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *most annual<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *more here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *most above<br />
			</em>etc. are not allowed.&nbsp; (Although we can have <em>extreme left, 
			further east</em> etc.)</li>

			<dt><strong><em>fairly, really, pretty</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>although <em>pretty</em> is somewhat informal all three of these

			quite fascinating(ly) = absolutely fascinating(ly)<br />
			rather cold(ly) = fairly cold(ly)<br />

		<p>Some adjectives and adverbs are homonyms (words which look and sound

		<em>He writes very <span class="style_black">originally</span> </em>

		</em> (ungradable: shared)<br /><em>It's a <span class="style_black">common</span> problem</em> (gradable:

		<p>So beware.&nbsp; Gradability is not at all a simple matter of telling

		<p>Another cautionary note is that what are gradable adjectives and

		<p>It's easy enough to write tests and exercises focusing on gradability 
		but less easy to teach the forms and variability.&nbsp; The best advice 
		may simply be to consider the issue of (un)gradability as and when it 
		arises.&nbsp; What is not really arguable is that any attempt to learn 
		lists of ungradable words is likely to end in failure.&nbsp; There are 
		just too many and they come with too many exceptions.<br />
		However, if you do want to centre a teaching routine on the topic, here 
		are some ideas.<br />
		Any topic which is likely to require the deployment of a range of 
		adjectives and adverbs is suitable as a lesson theme aimed at 
		gradability awareness.</p>

			<strong>heat</strong>: <em>hot</em> [gradable], <em>cool</em>
