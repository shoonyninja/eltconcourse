	<h1>Personal pronouns</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="pronouns" src="../../imagesgraphics/pronoun_cloud310.jpg" /></p>
		<p>The clue's in the name.&nbsp; Pro-nouns stand for nouns.<br />
		If you have done the guide to them, you'll know that nouns can be 
		proper (<em>John, Paris</em> etc.), common count (<em>table, dog, house, 
		excuse </em>
		etc.), common mass (<em>love, help, water, happiness</em> etc.), 
		collective (<em>jury, army, flock, management </em>etc.) and plural (<em>scissors, 
		contents, clothes</em> etc.).&nbsp; Pronouns 
		can stand in for any of these sorts of nouns.</p>

		<p>Before we can understand pronouns, we need to understand three main 
		grammatical categories.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong><span class="auto-style40">person</span><br />
			<img alt="people" height="133" src="../../images/people200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			</strong>this refers to <strong>who</strong>.&nbsp; There are three categories 
			(in English):<ol class="auto-style24">
				<li>First person<ul>
					<li>Singular &ndash; 
					<span class="style_brown"><em>I,  
	me, my, myself</em></span> etc.</li>
					<li>Plural &ndash; <span class="style_brown"><em>we, us, our, 
					ourselves
					</em>
					</span>etc.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Second person (English does not usually distinguish 
				between singular and plural &ndash; 
					most languages 
				do.)<ul>
					<li>Singular &ndash; <span class="style_brown"><em>you, 
	your, yourself</em></span> etc.</li>
					<li>Plural &ndash; <span class="style_brown"><em>you, 
	your, yourselves</em></span> etc.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Third person<ul>
					<li>Singular &ndash; <span class="style_brown"><em>he, she, it,  
					one, him, her, his, hers, its, herself, himself</em></span>&nbsp;etc.</li>
					<li>Plural &ndash; <span class="style_brown"><em>they, them, 
					their, themselves</em></span> etc.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><span class="auto-style40"><strong>gender</strong></span><br />
			<img alt="gender" height="133" src="../../images/sign_gender200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			There are two definitions of gender in English:<ol class="auto-style24">
				<li>a reference to the usual two sexes, male or female, with 
				regard to social and cultural phenomena as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The company does not tolerate gender 
				discrimination</em></li>
				<li>a technical reference in the field of linguistics to a 
				grammatical category.<br />
				French, for example, has two genders which happen to be called 
				masculine and feminine but German, along with a range of other 
				languages has three, including neuter.&nbsp; The naming of 
				genders by sex leads to all kinds of confusion but the term 
				refers, in fact, to a class of nouns and has little to do with 
				the cultural and social definition.&nbsp; There is no obvious 
				reason why, for example, <em>table</em> should be seen as 
				feminine and <em>car</em> as masculine.&nbsp; In German, for 
				example, the term for <em>a young girl</em> is marked as neuter.&nbsp; 
				Some languages have more than three classes of nouns and some 
				have many more (up to 20, depending how you count and including 
				concepts such as animate <em>vs</em>. inanimate, dangerous <em>
				vs</em>. harmless and so on).<br />
				Old English had three genders as does Modern German but there 
				was a confusing and inconsistent use of gender even for nouns 
				which were marked for sex.&nbsp; The Old English word <em>
				fædernmæg</em>, for example, referred to the paternal side of 
				the family but was grammatically feminine.<br />
				In Modern English, gender is only shown in the pronoun system 
				and there is no longer a distinction between, for example, the 
				articles (<em>a, an, the</em>) used for nouns even when the 
				gender is marked on the noun so we have, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the duchess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the king<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a brother-in-law<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a lion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an actress</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				In the case of pronouns, however, English is also rather poor in 
				only distinguishing gender in the singular third person.<ul>
					<li><em>he, she, it</em></li>
					<li><em>him, her, it</em></li>
					<li><em>his, her, its</em></li>
					<li><em>his, hers, its</em></li>
					<li><em>himself, herself, itself</em></li>
				</ul>
				All other pronouns: <em>I, me, my, you, your, we, us, our, they, 
				them </em>etc. are unmarked for gender.&nbsp; Even the 
				limited-use third-person pronoun, <em>one</em>, is unmarked for 
				gender.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong><span class="auto-style40">case</span></strong><br />
			<img alt="case" height="133" src="../../images/case200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			this refers to who is doing what to whom or what belongs to 
			whom.&nbsp; There are four categories (but arguably only three in English):<ol class="auto-style24">
				<li><strong>Subject / nominative</strong> <strong>case </strong>– 
				<em class="style_brown">I</em> or
	<span class="style_brown"><em>we</em> </span>refers to 
			the subject of the verb.&nbsp; For example, in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;I smoke</em></span><br />
			the subject is <span class="style_brown"><em>I</em></span> 
				and in<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>John arrived</em></span><br />
			the subject is <span class="style_brown"><em>John</em></span>.<br />
			In English the subject usually comes first.</li>
				<li><strong>Direct object / accusative case</strong> – this refers to the recipient of the 
			action.&nbsp; For example, in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;I 
			told John</em></span><br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>I</em></span> 
			is the subject and <span class="style_brown"><em>John</em> </span>
				is the object and in<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drank the whiskey</em></span><br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>She</em> </span>
				is the subject and 
				<span class="style_brown"><em>the whiskey</em> </span>
				is the object.</li>
				<li><strong>Indirect object / dative case</strong> (in many 
			languages but in English this is also accusative) – refers to the recipient 
			of a direct object.&nbsp; A verb may have two 
			objects:<br />In<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave the book to John</em></span><br />
			we have one direct object (<span class="style_brown"><em>the 
			book</em></span>) and one indirect 
			object (<span class="style_brown"><em>John</em></span>).&nbsp; 
			In English we can reverse the order of the objects, dropping the 
			preposition, <span class="style_brown"><em>to</em></span>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;<em>I gave John the book</em></span><br />
			Languages with case grammars will often distinguish between the two 
			types of object by changing the form of the article or the noun (or 
			both).&nbsp; English does not have a separate pronoun for indirect 
			objects and for this reason, it is hardly worth taking the time to 
				identify the dative case in English.&nbsp; But some languages do.</li>
				<li><strong>Possessive / genitive case</strong> 
				– refers to possession (among other things).&nbsp; For 
			example, in<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw John's cat</em></span><br />
			the <span class="style_brown"><em>'s</em></span> 
			is referred as the 'genitive s' and in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;That's my book</em></span><br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>my</em> </span>
				is the genitive or possessive 
			marker.<br />
				It is slightly loose to call this possessive in English because 
				in phrases such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the leg of the table<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the policy of the company<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the people's vote<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the father of the children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary's letter to me</em><br />
				and so on, the sense is not of possession but of origin, 
				description or 
				attachment.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
<p>
				Many languages you may speak or have studied make much ado about case 
				and the technical term for the changes to words that result from 
				it is called <strong>declension</strong>, but English is (relatively) simple in this respect.<br />

			<li>As we will discover throughout, English lacks many pronouns 
			which exist in other languages:<ol class="auto-style24">
				<li>English has no polite and familiar forms of address for <em>
				you</em>.&nbsp; Compare French <em>tu</em> and <em>vous</em>, 
				German <em>du</em>, <em>Sie</em> and <em>ihr</em> etc.&nbsp; In 
				fact, English makes do with only one pronoun for both cases in 
				the singular and the plural where other languages may have up to 
				four forms.</li>
				<li>English uses <em>it</em> for both the subject and the object 
				case.</li>
				<li>English only distinguishes gender in the third person 
				singular.&nbsp; For the plurals, we don't.&nbsp; In this chart,
				<em>it</em> is referred to as neuter but, because English 
				actually doesn't worry too much about gender for inanimate nouns 
				(with rare exceptions), a better term is probably the 
				<strong>impersonal pronoun</strong>.&nbsp;
				It is analysed here rather than in the section on impersonal 
				pronouns simply because it shares structural characteristics 
				with personal pronouns.</li>

				The use of neuter plural forms, <em>their</em> and <em>theirs</em>, 
			is increasingly common to represent a singular person not marked for 
			gender.&nbsp; See the note below under avoiding sexist language.<p>Notes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The difference between the two columns:<br />
			In the first column, the words are <strong>determiners</strong>.&nbsp; They 
			identify or limit nouns in some way just like words like <em>the, some </em>and<em> 
			that</em> do<em>.&nbsp; </em>For example<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ate some bread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ate </i></span>  
			<span class="style_brown">her</span><span class="style_brown"><i> bread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			I stole the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stole </i></span> 
			<span class="style_brown">their money</span><br />
			and so on.&nbsp; The words in 
			the first column are sometimes called <strong>possessive 
			adjectives </strong>but that is rather an old-fashioned term<strong>.&nbsp; </strong>
			More accurately, and always on this site, they are <strong> possessive determiners</strong>.<br />
			In the second column, the words can stand as nouns (just like 
			'proper' pronouns).&nbsp; For example<br />
			<span class="auto-style41">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My coat is 
			here; </span> <span class="style_brown">hers</span><span class="style_brown"><i> isn't.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their car is more useful than </i></span>
			 
			<span class="style_brown">mine</span>.<br />
			We can replace possessive pronouns by reverting to the noun with the 
			possessive determiner so <em>mine = my car, hers = her coat</em> etc.&nbsp; 
			These words are, therefore, referred to as <strong>possessive 
			pronouns </strong>or<strong> nominal possessives</strong><em>.</em></li>
			<li>The reason <em>its</em> only appears once is that it is not 
			possible to use it as a possessive pronoun.&nbsp; We can use it as a 
			possessive determiner in, e.g.:<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's 
			wrong with the table?&nbsp; Its leg is loose</em></span>.<br />
			but not as a 
			possessive pronoun because that would give something like<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Which 
			leg is loose?&nbsp; Its</em></span>.<br />
			(It is marginally possible to use its as a possessive pronoun in a 
			comment such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_brown"><em>I hurt my leg and the dog hurt 
			its</em></span><br />
			but many would never accept that.)</li>
			<li>The possessive determiner <em>its</em> is frequently confused 
			with the contracted form of <em>it is</em> or<em> it has </em>(<em>it's</em>).&nbsp; 
			So we get, e.g.:<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Its important to ...</em></span><br />
			or<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It's leg is broken</em></span>.<br />
			Please don't do this.&nbsp; The form with the apostrophe is
			<span class="style_underline">always</span> the contraction of <em>
			is</em> or <em>has</em>.</li>
			<li><em>his</em> is both a possessive determiner and a 
			possessive pronoun<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is his book<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			It is his</em></span><br />
			That can confuse lower-level learners.</li>
			<li>English uses possessive determiners to refer to parts of the 
			body.&nbsp; Many languages will not have parallel structures for 
			something like<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She cut her finger</em></span><br />
			preferring<br /><em><span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She cut the finger</span><br />
			</em>or even<br />
			<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			*<em>She cut herself 
			the finger</em></span><br />
			We do, however, often use the article in 
			passive sentences.&nbsp; For example,<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			must have been dropped on the head as a baby</em></span><br />
			but even here 
			the possessive determiner is possible.</li>

			<li>These are referred to as co-referentials (i.e., they refer to

			<span class="style_brown"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sue wrote herself a note</em></span><br />
			When we use an object to refer to the same noun as the subject, in 
			other words, English uses the reflexive pronoun.</li>
			<li>English has few obligatorily reflexive verbs.&nbsp; We don't, for example,

			</em>(as we do in many languages) or (usually) <em>wash ourselves.</em>&nbsp;

				<h3>Intensive pronouns</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Intensive pronouns have, in English, exactly the same form as 
			reflexive pronouns but they perform a different role.<br />
			For example, if we take a sentence such as:<br />
			<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author congratulated 
			himself</em><br />
			then we can see that <em>the author</em> and <em>himself</em> refer 
			to the same person.&nbsp; That is to say that the object of the verb 
			is the same as the subject of the verb.&nbsp; That's what is meant, 
			of course, by the term <strong>reflexive</strong>.<br />
			However, in:<br />
			<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author signed my copy 
			himself</em><br />
			then we can see that the subject of the verb is still <em>the author
			</em>but the object of the verb is no longer <em>the author</em>, it 
			is <em>my copy </em>and the pronoun <em>himself</em> stands for 
			nothing at all in the sentence and just helps to emphasise that it 
			is important to the speaker.&nbsp; In other words, it intensifies 
			the expression.<br />
			The difference is that we can omit the pronoun altogether and still 
			retain the same meaning of the clause.<br />
			Here's another two examples to make the point clear:</p>
			<ol class="style_brown">
				<li><em>The President helped himself to lunch</em></li>
				<li><em>The President himself came to lunch</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In sentence 1. we cannot omit the pronoun and arrive at:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The President helped to lunch</em><br />
			because that makes no sense.&nbsp; The meaning of this sentence is 
			that the President served lunch to himself and was not waited on.<br />
			But, in sentence 2. we can omit the pronoun and arrive at:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President came to lunch</em><br />
			without altering the meaning of the sentence, although we lose the 
			emphasis that the speaker wants to signal: i.e., that it is 
			important.</p>
			<p>Above, we were careful to note that in English the reflexive and 
			intensive pronouns take the same form.&nbsp; That is not a language 
			universal and sometimes leads to some misunderstanding of what the 
			sentence really means.<br />
			For example:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>In German, the same effect is achieved with the pronoun <em>
				selbst</em> which simply means something like <em>self</em> but 
				stands for all the intensive pronouns (<em>myself, himself, 
				herself, ourselves </em>etc.).&nbsp; Sentence 2. above then 
				translates in German as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Der Präsident selbst kam zum Mittagessen<br />
				</em>Scandinavian languages such as Danish do something quite 
				similar as does Dutch.</li>
				<li>In French, the effect is achieved by the use of the -<em>même</em>, 
				which means something like <em>same</em>, combined with the 
				pronoun.&nbsp; So, for example, sentence 2. above would 
				translate as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Le président lui-même est venu déjeuner</em></li>
				<li>Most Romance languages, such as Italian, Spanish and others 
				such as Greek and so on are referred to as pro-drop languages 
				which simply means that the subject pronoun is usually not 
				included in the sentence.&nbsp; So, for example, the translation 
				of <em>he came</em> in Italian is simply <em>venne</em> (not <em>
				lui venne</em>).<br />
				To signal the importance of the pronoun, therefore, in a 
				pro-drop language, it is enough to insert it but Italian and 
				other Romance languages also have a word much like French and 
				German (<em>stesso</em>, 
				in the case of Italian) which can be inserted for emphasis.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Because the intensifying pronoun is often the focus of the 
			sentence, and often where the stress falls in spoken English, we 
			frequently move it to the end, after the object so, instead of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I myself did the work<br />
			</em>we usually prefer<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did the work myself<br />
			</em>with the pronoun shifted to the end.</p>

		<p>As we saw above, the pronoun <em>it</em> is usually analysed as a 
		personal pronoun because it shares the characteristics of the class (bar 
		the fact that there is no nominal use).&nbsp; More accurately, in terms 
		of meaning rather than structure, it should be described as an impersonal pronoun.&nbsp; Generally, as might be expected, the pronoun 
		stands for singular inanimate objects or 'lower' forms of life so we 
		have<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Where's the wasp?&nbsp; It's behind you.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's that?&nbsp; It's a new computer program.</em><br />
		and so on.<br />
		The pronoun has, however, some quirks in English, not always parallelled 
		in other languages.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The pronoun can be used to refer to people:<ol class="auto-style24">
				<li>If the sex is unknown or unimportant:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's her baby<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh?&nbsp; What's its name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that child OK?&nbsp; It looks a bit sick.</em></li>
				<li>With personal reference:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who's speaking?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's John</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>The pronoun is frequently used for higher animals if the sex is 
			unknown or unimportant.&nbsp; When the animal is, however, familiar 
			to the speaker, the appropriately marked pronoun is preferred.</li>
			<li><em>It</em> can refer to a previous text, written or spoken, in 
			the way the pronoun <em>that</em> can be used:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She failed her examination and that was a 
			shock.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She failed her examination and it was a shock.</em></li>
			<li>It can be a substitute for a prepositional phrase:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put it in the cupboard.&nbsp; It was the obvious place</em></li>
			<li>It can act as an empty or dummy subject when talking about the 
			time, the weather etc.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's snowing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's almost seven</em></li>
			<li>It can act as in anticipatory subject filling a similar role in 
			the sentence:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult to learn grammar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a shame that he can't come to the party<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is wrong to speak to her like that<br />
			</em>This is a phenomenon also called a dummy or anticipatory <em>it</em> or, 
			sometimes, the 
			existential <em>it</em>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In languages which have a neuter gender, such as German, Greek and 
		many Slavic languages, the neuter pronoun overrides the sex of the noun 
		so, for example, because the German word for <em>the girl</em> is a 
		diminutive and carries the neuter gender (as <em>das Mädchen</em>), the 
		correct use is, e.g.:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a girl outside and it is asking to talk 
		to you</em><br />
		Many languages do not deploy a dummy or anticipatory subject and that 
		can lead to inter-language error such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To speak Chinese is difficult</em><br />
		which is grammatical possible but unnatural.</p>

		Missing from the charts above is the impersonal, rather formal pronoun
		<em>one</em>.&nbsp; Here's how it works:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>As a subject pronoun, it is singular only and appears in clauses 
			such as<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<span class="style_brown"><em>One must always remember that ...</em></span></li>
			<li>There is no object pronoun form so we can't have<br />
			<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<em>*He told 
			one that ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Give it to one!</em></span><br />etc.&nbsp; It can, somewhat 
			rarely, and quite formally, be used in the passive, however:<br /><em><span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One has been told ...</span><br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>The possessive determiner is <em>one's</em> as in
			<em>One must always do one's best</em>.</li>
			<li>There is no possessive pronoun form so we can't have, e.g.,<br />
			<em class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose is that?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*It's ones.</em></li>
			<li>There is a rarely used reflexive pronoun, <em>oneself</em>, 
			which occurs in, e.g., <em class="style_brown">One must try to be true to oneself.</em></li>

			<p>In olden times (i.e., before around 1990) it was considered 
			acceptable for people to use <em>he, him, his </em>as what is called an 
			unmarked pronoun form applicable to either female or male people.&nbsp; 
			Times have changed and that is no longer the case so we have a 
			number of results:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The increasing use of plural forms for an unmarked pronoun.<br />
				Because English happens not to mark the gender of the referent 
				in the plural, the pronouns <em>they, them, theirs </em>and the 
				determiner <em>theirs</em> 
				are frequently used to avoid the awkward <em>his or her</em>,
				<em>he or she</em> formulations.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a new student registers, they are 
				given a test</em><br />
				Usually, it is a simple matter to avoid this in formal language 
				by making the whole utterance plural and having:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When new students register they are given 
				a test</em><br />
				and that conforms to the grammar of the language as well as the 
				norms of a non-sexist culture.<br />
				(There are times when this use is almost unavoidable, however, 
				as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever said that has got <strong>their</strong> 
				facts wrong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If someone said <strong>they</strong> saw me <strong>they</strong> 
				were mistaken.</em>)</li>
				<li>The occasional use in quite formal writing of alternate uses 
				of <em>he, she, his, hers </em>and so on to balance the article 
				or text.&nbsp; This can result in some clumsiness, especially 
				when instigated in alternating paragraphs.</li>
				<li>An increased use of the conveniently unmarked pronoun <em>
				one</em>.</li>
				<li>An effort by a few people to invent a non-sexist pronoun 
				set.&nbsp; This is difficult because pronouns are what is known 
				as a closed-class set of words and introducing new ones into 
				such sets is a rare and troublesome process.&nbsp; It can happen 
				but it usually takes many years for a new item to be accepted.&nbsp; 
				For example, <em>hizzer</em> has been suggested as an 
				alternative to <em>his or her</em> and <em>heesh</em> as an 
				alternative to <em>he or she</em>.<br />
				In around 1990, a mathematician, Michael Spivak, used three 
				personal pronouns which he sought to establish as unmarked forms.&nbsp; 
				They are:<br />
				<em>e</em> for the subject pronouns <em>he</em> and <em>she</em> 
				(pronounced /iː/)<br />
				<em>em</em> for the object pronouns <em>him</em> and <em>her</em> 
				(pronounced /əm/ or /em/)<br />
				<em>eir</em> for the genitive pronouns and determiners <em>
				his</em> and <em>her</em> (pronounced /eə/ or /eər/)<br />
				To those three others have added:<br />
				<em>eirs</em> for the genitive pronouns <em>hers</em> and <em>his</em> 
				(pronounced /eərz/ or /eəz/)<br />
				<em>emself</em> for the reflexive pronouns <em>herself</em> and
				<em>himself</em> (pronounced /əm.ˈself/ or /em.ˈself/)<br />
				This set of unmarked pronouns is usually referred to as the 
				Spivak pronouns but has yet to become popular, leave alone 
				conventional.<br />
				There are a number of other proposed systems for non-sec-marked 
				pronouns and more on that can be accessed in the guide to gender 
				in English, linked below.</li>
				<li>The <em>ad hoc</em> invention of new pronouns as writers go 
				along.&nbsp; Here's one from the British Broadcasting 
				Corporation:<p class="indentpara">
				the tendency of managers to hire two 
				or more subordinates to report to them so that neither is in 
				direct competition with the manager
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>themself</strong></span><br />
				<span class="auto-style110">BBC website, 2019 (emphasis added)</span></p>
				The pronoun <em>themself</em> does not actually 
				exist in Modern English.&nbsp; It is an uneasy mix of the plural 
				and singular and many users of English would disparage it.&nbsp; 
				See the footnote.</li>

			<p>There is increasing recognition that people do not universally 
			fall neatly into the categories of masculine and feminine and there 
			are many who claim to be non-binary and demand to be referred to as
			<em>they</em> or <em>them</em>.<br />
			One cannot, of course, successfully set down rules for people to use 
			in this way but it should be noted that the use of the ostensibly 
			plural <em>they</em> to refer to a single individual unmarked for 
			gender has a long history going back at least 600 years.<br />
			The use of <em>their</em> to refer to a singular person is often 
			scorned by grammarians but, according to the Oxford English 
			Dictionary, is attested from at least 1300CE and appears in the 
			writings of, e.g., Fielding, Goldsmith, Sydney Smith, and Thackeray.<br />
			Merriam-Webster made <em>they</em> their word of the year in 2019 to 
			recognise the increasing use of it to refer to a single person 
			irrespective of sex.</p>

			themself</em></span><br />
			There is no entry for <em>themself</em> in the current Oxford 
			English Dictionary online (https://www.oed.com).&nbsp; However, it 
			is noted that <em>themself</em> was the normal form of the third 
			person plural reflexive pronoun until about 1540.&nbsp; It had 
			disappeared by about 1570.&nbsp; Later, <em>themselves</em> became 
			the standard form.&nbsp; The form <em>themself</em> is labelled by 
			that source as <em>rare, disputed</em> or <em>not widely accepted</em>.<br />
			The Merriam-Webster dictionary (https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/themself) 
			notes that the rise of <em>themself</em>, if it occurs, will be 
			related to the increasingly common use of the singular <em>they</em>.&nbsp; 
			The editors did not judge that it was anything but rare in edited 
			and published materials.<br />
			The form may be re-emerging but an expression such as:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The manager may consider themself an expert</em><br />
			will still not be widely welcomed in formal writing.</p>
