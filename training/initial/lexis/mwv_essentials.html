			<p>This is an essential guide and will not cover the complications

			phrasal-prepositional verbs but we will distinguish between a 
			phrasal verb and a prepositional verb because that is the essential

			<p>Multi-word verbs (hereafter MWVs) are verbs which consist of more 
			than one word.&nbsp; For example, we can say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I postponed the 
			meeting<br />
			</em>or we can say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put off the meeting<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			put the meeting off<br />
			</em>with pretty much the same meaning.<br />
			The verb, in this case, is not just <em>put</em> &ndash; it is <em>
			<strong>put off</strong></em>.<br />
			In this guide, words like <em>off, on, about</em> etc. will often be 
			referred to as <strong>particles</strong> but you should know that 
			there is a bit more to it than that.</p>
			<p>See if you can identify the multi-word verbs in this paragraph:</p>

			<p>That was not an easy task and you will be forgiven for not having 
			the same answers.&nbsp; There are a number of possible reasons why 
			your answers may differ.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Why isn't </strong><em><strong>walk over</strong></em><strong> 
				in red?</strong><br />
				Compare these two sentences:<ol class="auto-style5">
					<li><em>He walked off his headache</em></li>
					<li><em>He walked through the park</em></li>
				</ol>
				In sentence a., we have a real multi-word 
			verb, <span class="style_red"><em>to walk off</em></span>, which 
			means something like <em>to make something better by walking</em>.&nbsp; 
			If you replace the particle <em>off</em> with another word, you will 
			change the meaning of the verb <em>walk</em>.&nbsp; For example, we 
			can't say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He walked over his headache<br />
			</em>Only <em>off</em> 
			will work.<br />
			In sentence b., we have a verb, <em>walk</em>, followed by <strong>a 
			prepositional phrase</strong> <em>through the park</em> and we can 
			change it in lots of ways but retain the meaning of <em>walk</em>:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked over the road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked across the park<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked 
			out of the meeting<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			This is the basic test of a multi-word verb: does the meaning change 
			if we change the particle?</li>
				<li><strong>Why isn't <em>Getting 
				into</em> in red?</strong><br />
				For the same reason.&nbsp; This is simply the verb get followed 
				by a preposition, <em>into</em>.&nbsp; We can get, 
				for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get over 
				an obstacle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get out of a train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get between two people</em><strong><br />
				</strong>and so 
				on.&nbsp; It is the verb <em>get</em> in its meaning of <em>move to a place 
				or position</em>.<br />
				Compare these two sentences:<ol class="auto-style5">
					<li><em>I got over my headache</em></li>
					<li><em>I got over the river</em></li>
				</ol>
				In sentence a., we have a real multi-word 
			verb, <span class="style_red"><em>to get over</em></span>, which 
			means <em>to recover from</em>.&nbsp; If you replace the particle
			<em>over</em> with another word, you will change the meaning of the 
			verb.&nbsp; You can't have:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I got by / across / between / into / 
			out of my headache<br />
			</em>etc. without changing the meaning of the 
			verb.<br />
			In sentence b., we have a verb, <em>get</em>, followed by a 
			prepositional phrase <em>over the river</em> and we can change the 
			preposition to make new meanings but keep the meaning of <em>get</em> 
			the same.&nbsp; We can have, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got across the river / into 
			the river / out of the river<br />
			</em>etc. and still <em>get</em> means 
			the same thing.</li>
				<li><strong>Why isn't <em>look at </em>in red?<br />
				</strong>For the same reason again but you will often find the 
				combination <em>look at </em>described as a multi-word verb or 
				even as a phrasal verb.&nbsp; It is neither because all we have 
				is the verb <em>look</em> (meaning use one's eyes) and the 
				preposition <em>at</em> which signals the direction<strong>.<br />
				</strong>This also explains why
			<span class="style_black"><em>got off, take to, pointed at, carried 
			into</em></span> and <span class="style_black"><em>went down</em></span> 
			are all left in black.&nbsp; They are simply verbs followed by 
			prepositions.</li>
				<li><strong>Why isn't </strong> <em><strong>running late</strong></em><strong> in red?<br />
				</strong>It is a metaphorical meaning of <em>run</em> in the sense of <em>
				make progress</em> but that doesn't make it a MWV.&nbsp; Here, 
				the word <em>late</em> is an <strong>adverb</strong> and it can 
				be replaced by something like <em>on time, early, quickly, 
				onwards, behind</em> etc. without changing the meaning of the 
				verb <em>run.</em></li>
				</ol>
			<p><span class="style_red"><strong>Website alert</strong></span>: 
			There are rather too many sites out here that cannot distinguish 
			between a real MWV and a simple verb followed by a preposition.&nbsp; 
			For example, one site describes <em>walk into a trap</em> as a 
			phrasal verb.&nbsp; It isn't.&nbsp; It isn't even a prepositional 
			verb.&nbsp; It is simply the verb <em>walk</em> followed by a 
			prepositional phrase (<em>into a trap</em>).&nbsp; It may be a 
			slightly metaphorical use of <em>walk</em> but that's another matter 
			altogether.<br />
			Another describes <em>run after the bus</em> as a phrasal verb.&nbsp; 
			No, it isn't.&nbsp; It's the use of a verb (<em>run</em>) with a 
			prepositional phrase (<em>after the bus</em>).&nbsp; We can change 
			<em>after</em> for any number of other words without changing the meaning of
			<em>run</em>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run behind the bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run in front of the bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run 
			alongside the bus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run past the bus<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			There are lots more examples of lousy analysis on the web in the 
			in-service guide to this area.</p>

				(<em>got</em>) + prepositional phrase (<em>into the train / into

			<h2>Separable and inseparable</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>As you saw, some verbs are separable and some cannot be 
			separated.&nbsp; Here's a short list of verbs.&nbsp; By making a 
			sentence like the ones above in your head, you should be able to see 
			which ones are separable and which ones are inseparable.<br />
			Click on the table when you have identified the two sorts.</p>
			<p>
			<img id="img1" alt="separability 2" height="283" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'../../imagesgraphics/separable2.png')" src="../../imagesgraphics/separable1.png" width="350" /></p>
			<p>
			There are reasons for this.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The verbs with are inseparable (on the left) are examples of
				<strong>prepositional verbs</strong> and that means that the 
				verb governs the preposition which is allowed but all the 
				prepositions are just parts of prepositional phrases.<br />
				We can allow, therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She called for the children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She called for them</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She called the children for</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She called them for</em><br />
				In other words, the only word order we allow is:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><strong>Verb + Preposition + Object 
				(noun or pronoun)</strong></span> and the same restriction 
				applies to all of the examples right down to the end where we 
				get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She cared for the children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She cared for them</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She cared the children for</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She cared them for.</em></li>
				<li>The verbs which are separable (on the right)&nbsp;are <strong>
				phrasal verbs</strong> and the vast majority of them must be 
				separated if we use a pronoun and can be separated if we use a 
				noun.&nbsp; So we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He added the figures up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He added them up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He added up the figures</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He added up them</em><br />
				The only word ordering we allow with these verbs is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;Verb + Adverb + Noun</strong></span><br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>Verb + Noun + Adverb</strong></span><br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>Verb + Pronoun + Adverb</strong></span><br />
				If you work down the list on the right, you will find the same 
				restrictions apply to all of them until you get to:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wore his pajamas out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he wore them out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wore out his pajamas</em><br />
				but not:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He wore out them.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The distinction is that</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>a phrasal verb is a combination of a
				<span class="style_black"><strong>Verb and an Adverb</strong></span></li>
				<li>other multi-word verbs are combinations of
				<span class="style_black"><strong>Verb + Prepositional phrase</strong></span>.</li>

			<p>Some MWVs never take an object, some always do and some can do both.&nbsp;

			<p>One of the problems faced by both teachers and learners of 
			English is that there is a good deal of confusion about what is and 
			is not a phrasal verb.<br />
			We saw above that a phrasal verb is a verb whose meaning is combined 
			with an adverb to make a new meaning so, for example, if we add and 
			adverb particle to the verb <em>look</em> as in changing:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked in the dictionary</em><br />
			in which verb <em>look</em> simply means <em>use your eyes </em>to<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked up the word in the dictionary</em><br />
			we can see that <em>look</em> plus <em>up</em> makes <strong>a new 
			meaning</strong>: <em>find in a reference book.</em></p>
			<p>Some people find this hard to grasp and insist that <em><strong>
			any</strong></em> verb which is followed by an adverb must be a 
			phrasal verb.&nbsp; That way madness lies because we can have, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked quickly</em><br />
			and in all these cases <strong>the meaning of the verb does not 
			change</strong>.<br />
			It is <span class="style_underline"><strong><em>not</em></strong></span> 
			true, therefore, that <em>walk away, walk back</em> or any of the 
			examples is a phrasal verb.&nbsp; They are cases of verbs being 
			modified by one-word adverbs, changing how we see the verb but
			<strong>the verb retains its meaning</strong>.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, if you look out here on the web for examples of 
			phrasal verbs, you will find lots of people posting nonsense and the 
			most common piece of that is that something like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She'll call back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I<span class="auto-style11"> want to </span>look around<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They ran out<br />
			</em>and many more contain examples of phrasal verbs.&nbsp; They do 
			not.</p>
			<p>You may think this is just a minor problem because lots of people 
			can't do very good language analysis and that's true but bad 
			analysis like this has implications for learners which are not good.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It means that learners are misled about what constitutes a 
				learnable phrase and what constitutes just a verb plus an 
				adverb.<br />
				If as a learner of English you encounter, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put the fire out</em><br />
				you would be right to think something like:<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; This 
				means that <em>put</em> plus <em>out</em> takes on a new meaning 
				(something like <em>extinguish</em></span>)<br />
				and you would be wholly correct and quite wise to try to learn 
				the verb <em>put out</em> as having something to do with <em>
				fire</em> and <em>flames</em>.<br />
				If, on the other hand, you come across:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put the cat out</em><br />
				you would be unwise to try to learn <em>put out</em> as a verb 
				which has anything to do with cats.&nbsp; You would be much 
				wiser to realise that <em>put</em> has its normal meaning and 
				the adverb <em>out</em> simply tells us where the cat was put.</li>
				<li>The second problem follows on and is to do with loading 
				learners with unnecessary problems and memorisation tasks.<br />
				If you tell students that <em>walk back, walk away, walk out</em> 
				etc. are all phrasal verbs, then they will try to remember them 
				separately (as you should with real phrasal verbs) but you will 
				be wasting your time because you already know the meaning of <em>
				walk</em> and the meanings of <em>ba<span class="auto-style11">ck, 
				away</span></em> and <em>out</em> so there is nothing new to 
				learn and you can get on with learning something useful.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Misleading learners is not forgiveable and made worse if 
			the misleading results in an extra and unnecessary learning load.</strong></p>
