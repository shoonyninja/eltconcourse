		<p>Now ask yourself why these are divided into two groups.</p>
		<p>When you have an answer, click

				<div id="wordclass2" style="position: relative; visibility: hidden"><p class="style_brown">Group A words are called 
			<strong>open-class</strong> items because in theory we 
		can keep adding more to the list indefinitely.&nbsp; Languages 
		consistently create new nouns, for example, to describe new events or 
		objects.<br />
		Group B words are <strong>closed-class</strong> items.&nbsp; We do not usually create 
		new prepositions (although we can) and introducing a new pronoun into 
		the language is extremely rare (although people keep trying).<br />
			There are other classifications which we could use and popular one 
			is to divide words into member of two groups:</p>
			<ol class="style_brown">
				<li>
				Major word classes:<ol>
					<li>Lexical or main verbs (which are verbs which carry intrinsic meaning 
				such as <em>hear, encourage, avoid, jump</em> etc.)</li>
					<li>Nouns</li>
					<li>Adjectives</li>
					<li>Adverbs</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
				Minor word classes<ol>
					<li>Auxiliary verbs, which carry no intrinsic meaning but function 
				to express how the speakers feels about the main verb (<em>must, 
				can, should</em> etc.) or operate to make tense forms (<em>have</em> in 
					<em>he 
				has arrived</em>, <em>be</em> in <em>he is laughing </em>etc.).&nbsp; The first group 
				of these are called modal auxiliary verbs and the second group 
				are primary auxiliary verbs and there are guides to all of them 
				on this site.</li>
					<li>Pronouns</li>
					<li>Determiners (which includes articles and demonstratives 
					in the first division above)</li>
					<li>Prepositions</li>
					<li>Conjunctions</li>
					<li>Interjections</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is no simple way to divide the hundreds of thousands of words in the language as we shall see shortly.</p>
					<p>One reason for separating word classes into these two 
					fundamental types is to allow us to think more clearly about 
					the language.<br />
					Closed-class, functional items are the concern of grammar but open 
					class items are the concern of lexis.<br />
					So, for example, choosing the correct item to go into a gaps 
					like this:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary gave John the video and 
					__________ was delighted with __________ </em><br />
					is fundamentally a grammatical issue of selecting the 
					correct pronoun.<br />
					However, choosing the correct item to go in the gaps in 
					this:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary went into the __________ and 
					__________ the fridge to get some cold juice</em><br />
					is a matter of making appropriate lexical choices of the set 
					(technical term) of nouns or verbs which can fill the gaps 
					and make an acceptably comprehensible statement.</p>

				<h3>Determiners: the missing class</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>There is, in fact, a word class missing from this list which is 
			used in more modern grammars: <strong>determiners</strong>.<br />
			Determiners are words which modify nouns (just as adjectives, 
			demonstratives and articles do).&nbsp; In older grammars, 
			determiners were often classed as adjectives (we can have <em>few 
			dogs </em>and <em>fewer dogs) </em>or as demonstratives (<em>these 
			books, that man</em>) or as articles (<em>the car, some sugar</em>) 
			or even as pronouns.<br />
			This is not satisfactory in many ways so the modern term for words 
			such as <em>each, all, more, the, a, several, these, either</em> etc. when 
			they come before nouns is simply 
			determiner.</p>
			<p>There is an 
			essential guide to determiners on this site linked in the list of 
			related guides at the end but how determiners work in English is not a simple matter to analyse 
			and is the subject of a separate 
			(and more difficult) in-service guide.&nbsp; 
			Following the second guide successfully will be quite difficult if the 
			area is new to you.&nbsp; You will almost certainly need to 
			understand issues of (un)countability in nouns before tackling it.</p>

			<p>It is a mistake to assume that we can look at a word and, from its appearance 
			or meaning, consign it to one of the 10 or 11 word 
			classes we have identified.&nbsp; That's not how it works.<br />
			In fact, we consign words to classes by their positions in sentences 
			and their grammatical function.&nbsp; Meaning comes a distant third.<br />
			This is what is meant:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Some words are only members of one word class.&nbsp; So, for 
				example, <em>ceiling</em> is a noun and nothing else, <em>decide</em> 
				is a verb only, <em>between</em> is a preposition and so on.</li>
				<li>Many thousands of words can be members of two or more word 
				classes, however, depending on what they are doing in a sentence 
				so, for example, in:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please clean the car</em><br />
				the word <em>clean</em> is operating as a verb but in:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; The car is clean already</em><br />
				the word is operating as an adjective.</li>
				<li>Some words have characteristics of more than one word class 
				so, for example:<br />
				<em>that</em> is a demonstrative determiner which has a plural 
				form like nouns (<em>those</em>)<br />
				<em>little</em> is a determiner (and sometimes a pronoun) which 
				has comparative and superlative forms (<em>less</em> and <em>
				least</em>) which makes it work like an adjective.<br />
				Another example is that in<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is running</em><br />
				the word <em>running</em> is clearly a verb but in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Running is good exercise</em><br />
				the word is operating as a noun but still looks like a verb (and 
				retains its verbal meaning).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			And so on.&nbsp; Do not be tempted to jump to conclusions and 
			suggest to learners that a word is always assigned to one of the 
			main classes.&nbsp; Context is vital.<br />
			The phenomenon we see here is called gradience or categorical 
			indeterminacy which simply means that we accept that word-class 
			boundaries are sometimes fuzzy.</p>

				<h2>Three ways to judge word class</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>
			How we assign words to classes can be managed by considering three 
			factors, the last of which is the most powerful and accurate.&nbsp; 
			They are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We can look at the meaning of words so we get rules such as:<ol class="auto-style87">
					<li>Words which describe things or people are adjectives</li>
					<li>Words which refer to objects and people are nouns</li>
					<li>Words which refer to actions are verbs</li>
					<li>Words which say where, when, how often or how an action 
					is done are adverbs</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			This works OK when the words in question are well behaved but, 
			unfortunately breaks down when we encounter words such as:</p>
			<ul class="smallredbullet">
				<li><em>politeness</em> which is descriptive rather than 
				referring to an object or a person but is not an adjective</li>
				<li><em>misfortune</em> which is a noun but doesn't refer to an 
				object or a person</li>
				<li><em>exertion</em> which refers to an action but is not a 
				verb</li>
				<li><em>frequency</em> which refers to how often something 
				happens but is not an adverb</li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">We can look at the form of words so we get rules 
				such as:<ol class="auto-style87">
					<li>Words which end in -<em>ly</em> are adverbs</li>
					<li>Words which take a plural form with -<em>s</em> or -<em>es</em> 
					are nouns</li>
					<li>Words which take -<em>d</em> or -<em>ed</em> to show a 
					past tense are verbs</li>
					<li>Words which can be altered to show degree by ending in -<em>er</em> 
					or -<em>est</em> are adjectives</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Again, this works well for many thousands of well-behaved words 
			but breaks down when we consider:&nbsp;</p>
			<ul class="smallredbullet">
				<li><em>put</em> which is a verb that doesn't change at all to 
				show tense</li>
				<li><em>sheep</em> is a noun which does not take a plural ending 
				at all (but can be plural)</li>
				<li><em>information</em> is a noun but it has no plural</li>
				<li><em>likely</em> is an adjective which ends in -<em>ly</em></li>
				<li><em>often</em> is an adverb that doesn't end in -<em>ly</em></li>
				<li><em>absent</em> is an adjective which has no endings for 
				degrees</li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">We can look at the grammatical function of a word 
				and see where it occurs in the structure of the language (its 
				distribution is the technical term).&nbsp; This does give us 
				workable rules because we can suggest:<ol class="auto-style87">
					<li>Nouns fill the gap in<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The __________ broke the window</em></li>
					<li>Verbs fill the gap in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She __________ the parcel</em></li>
					<li>Adjectives fill the gap in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was very __________ to see her 
					mother</em></li>
					<li>Adverbs fill the gap in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They __________ came to my house</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are other tests we can apply to decide on word class but in 
			what follows, we will be using a combination of all three, depending 
			mostly on the last one.</p>

		<p><a name="10"></a>Apart from obvious (and slightly inaccurate) distinctions between abstract 
		nouns (<em>beauty, hope</em> etc.), 
		concrete nouns (<em>apple, table </em>etc.) and proper nouns (<em>James, Canada</em> etc.), there is a key distinction 
		learners (and you) need to understand:<br />
		
		<span class="style_brown">countability</span> 
		and <span class="style_brown">uncountability</span>.<br />
		(There is a dedicated guide in this part of the site to mass and count 
		nouns linked in the list of related guides at the end.)</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Countable nouns can be preceded by a number (<em>two cats</em>), 
				<em>a</em> or <em>an</em> 
		(<em>a dog</em>) and <em>a few </em>(<em>a few letters</em>)<em>.</em>&nbsp; They usually take plural endings.&nbsp; 
		In the plural, we use a plural form of the verb with them <em>(are</em> 
		not <em>is</em>, for example).<br />
				So we get, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two people </em>
				<span class="style_underline"><em>have</em></span><em> arrived 
				and the woman </em><span class="style_underline"><em>is</em></span><em> 
				his sister</em></li>
				<li>Uncountable nouns are better referred to as mass nouns and 
		cannot be preceded by a number or <em>a few</em> (but can be preceded by
				<em>some </em>and<em> a little</em>) and only take plurals in unusual meanings when we make

			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>Some words (such as <em>sugar</em> and <em>door</em>) are clear cases of 
		uncountable and countable examples.&nbsp; Others are more complicated 
				because we can use them in both ways with different meanings.&nbsp; 
				Compare<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have my attention</em> (mass)<br />
				with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His 
				attentions are unwelcome</em> (countable).<br />
				Some nouns, 
				such as <em>sheep</em> are countable but take no plural.&nbsp; 
				Some obviously countable things, such as <em>money</em>, are 
				treated as mass nouns in English.<br />  Virtually all 
				mass nouns can be made countable in English when we are 
				using them to classify things.&nbsp; For example<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some coffees which are too bitter for me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have lots of German wines on the list</em> etc.<br />
				We also use mass nouns casually as if they were countable as in, 
				for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll get the coffees</em><br />
				which is just a short way of saying<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll get the cups of coffee</em></li>
				<li>Different languages deal with these things differently.&nbsp; 
				In German, for example,<em> information</em> is a countable 
				noun.&nbsp; In Greek, so is<em> money</em>.&nbsp; When introducing a 
				noun, remember that students will probably presume it's 
				countable unless you make it clear otherwise.<br />
				So you'll 
				get people saying <em>furnitures </em>and it'll be your fault, 
				not theirs!</li>

				<h2>Verbs</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Verbs in English, and many other languages, come in three 
			distinct flavours.&nbsp; This is what they are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Lexical or main verbs<br />
				<img alt="move" height="133" src="../../images/chess_2players200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>MOVE!</em></strong></span><br />
				These are what most people think of when they are asked to give 
				an example of a verb.<br />
				The verbs in this class carry their own meaning and can often 
				stand alone and still make sense so, for example, we can 
				understand what is meant if someone says:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drink</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				They also have a meaning which can be defined quite easily when 
				they occur in phrases and longer units of language as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We spoke to them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She altered it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I drank the beer</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				This is an open class of words so we can invent new verbs for 
				actions and states which we want to decribe.&nbsp; Hence we get, 
				for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Text me with the date<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the data</em><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>Copular or linking verbs<br />
				<img alt="looking" height="133" src="../../images/woman_act200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>LOOKING GOOD</em></strong></span><br />
				These verbs also carry some kind of meaning but cannot be 
				understood when they are used in isolation so, for example, 
				while we can happily understand:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She grew angry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They got lost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were in London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That appears correct</em><br />
				and so on, we cannot understand:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She grew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They got<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That appears</em><br />
				because we do not know what the subject of the verb is being 
				linked to.&nbsp; Without that information, the statements make 
				no sense.</li>
				<li>Auxiliary verbs<br />
				<img alt="EMPTY" height="133" src="../../images/empty200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>EMPTY</em></strong></span><br />
				These verbs carry no meaning at all because they are members of 
				a closed class of functional words and their role in the language is 
				grammatical.&nbsp; They cannot stand alone and mean anything to 
				most people unless another main verb is understood.<br />
				All the <span class="style_black"><strong>highlighted</strong></span> 
				verbs in the following examples are auxiliary verbs of some 
				sort:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We <strong>were</strong> given the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_black"><strong>has</strong></span> 
				sent the letter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black"><strong>had been</strong></span> 
				told about it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She<span class="style_black"><strong> can</strong></span>'t 
				sing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black"><strong>must</strong></span> go 
				soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_black"><strong>got</strong></span> 
				their house repaired<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We <span class="style_black"><strong>dare</strong></span>n't 
				ask<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That <span class="style_black"><strong>should</strong></span> 
				help a bit</em><br />
				You may be able to see from that list that there are two main 
				sorts of auxiliary verbs:<ol class="auto-style87">
					<li>Primary auxiliary verbs<br />
					These function to form tenses and other structures in the 
					language and on this site, we recognise four:<ol class="greybullet">
						<li><em>have</em><br />
						which makes what are called perfect tenses such as in:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has finished<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They hadn't arrived in time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have sold it by then</em><br />
						and also makes what are called causative structures as 
						in:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had the work done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had my pocket picked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had the house swept</em><br />
						and so on.</li>
						<li><em>be</em><br />
						which makes progressive tense forms such as in<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is working tonight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are spending a week in France<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is always thinking of you</em><br />
						and also operates in English to make what are called 
						passive sentences as in:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was told<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary isn't being invited<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will be sacked</em><br />
						and so on.</li>
						<li><em>do</em><br />
						which is used in English to make questions and negative 
						forms (and sometimes to emphasise a lexical or main 
						verb) as in, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you like this wine?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she see him?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn't he call?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't understand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We didn't go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do enjoy it</em><br />
						etc.</li>
						<li><em>get</em><br />
						which is not always considered a primary auxiliary verb 
						but functions as one, like <em>have</em>, to make a 
						causative as in, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the house painted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She got him to paint the garage</em><br />
						etc.<br />
						and can also be used to make what is called a dynamic 
						passive clause as in, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house got damaged in the 
						storm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They got allowed into the club</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Modal auxiliary verbs<br />
					These do not (with one exception) make tense forms or other 
					grammatical structures.&nbsp; What these verbs do is to make 
					the speaker / writer's stance clear.&nbsp; For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black"><strong>
					can</strong></span> arrange that</em> (expressing ability or 
					willingness)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You <span class="style_black">
					<strong>should</strong></span> go home</em> (expressing 
					obligation)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black"><strong>
					might</strong></span> help</em> (expressing possibility)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It <span class="style_black"><strong>
					must</strong></span> break under that pressure</em> 
					(expressing a general truth)<br />
					(The exception is the verb <em>will</em> and its past tense,
					<em>would</em>.&nbsp; This verb can express the speaker's 
					point of view as in, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_black">
					<strong>will</strong></span> do it if you ask </em>
					(expressing her willingness)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black"><strong>
					would</strong></span> come earlier if it helped</em> 
					(expressing my willingness)<br />
					but it can also function as a primary auxiliary verb to make 
					a future form as in:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black"><strong>
					will</strong></span> be 40 tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_black"><strong>will</strong></span> 
					have told her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next train to arrive at platform 3
					<span class="style_black"><strong>will</strong></span> be 
					the 4:10 for London Paddington<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_black"><strong>would</strong></span> 
					have arranged it earlier.</em>)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All these forms of verbs have their own essential guides on this 
			site and the following guides will open in new tabs:</p>

					</table>
					<p class="style_brown">The issue here is called 
					transitivity.&nbsp; Transitive verbs take an object, 
					intransitive verbs don't but some verbs can do both.<br />
					We can say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smoke<br />
					</em>with no object so intransitive, and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smoked a cigarette<br />
					</em>with the object so transitive.<br />
					We can say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She carried the box<br />
					</em>transitive<br />but not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She 
					carried</em>.<br />
					because <em>carry</em> is always transitive.<br />
					We can say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came<br />
					</em>but not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I arrived / went / came the airport</em>.<br />
					because <em>arrive, go </em>and <em>come</em> are all intransitive verbs.<br />
					Sometimes, there's a change in meaning:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He can hear<br />
					</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He can hear it<br />
					</em>are different meanings of the verb.<br />
					When you teach a new verb, bear in mind that languages deal 
					with transitivity differently.&nbsp; In some languages, for 
					example, you can say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I jumped the table<br />
					</em>meaning 
					onto, not over, or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She 
					listened the music</em>.<br />
					Set verbs in a context and 
					make sure that your learners are aware of whether they are 
					transitive, intransitive or both.</p>

				<h2>Articles</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Articles are a sub-class of determiners.&nbsp; We said above that 
			we would explain why we are usually concerned with only nine word 
			classes and it is because articles used to be considered a separate 
			class but are now included as a subset of determiners.&nbsp; They 
			have, however, some important characteristics and are usually 
			treated as a separate target for teaching purposes.<br />
			Again, there's 
			a guide to the
			essentials of articles linked at the end and from there you can 
			access a 
			more advanced guide to articles on the site.<br />
			There are only three true articles in English: <em>a, an</em> and
			<em>the</em>.&nbsp; The other choice in English is no article at all 
			and that is usually represented by a zero sign, like this: <strong>&Oslash;</strong>.&nbsp; 
			The zero article is important because it is used in English to refer 
			to all instances of something.<br />
			(Some analyses will include <em>some</em> in the 
			list but it's actually not an article although it can work in a very 
			similar fashion.)<br />
			A few examples are all that's needed here:<br />
			<em><span class="style_black">a</span> house,
			<span class="style_black">a</span> university,
			<span class="style_black">an</span> apple</em> etc. (The 
			choice of <em>a </em>or <em>an</em> is determined by the <strong>sound</strong> 
			at the beginning of the following word, 
			not the spelling.)<br />
			<em><span class="style_black">the</span> house,
			<span class="style_black">the</span> man I met</em> etc.<br />
			<span class="style_black">&Oslash;</span> <em>people often complain,
			</em>
			<span class="style_black"><em>&Oslash;</em></span><em> cars pollute,
			<span class="style_black">&Oslash;</span> smoking is bad for you,

			<p>The rules for deciding which article to use are not easy so go

		<p>Decide what you are talking about.&nbsp; There are <strong>only</strong> 
		three choices:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				One of many &ndash; indefinite specific reference (<em><span class="style_black">a</span> 
			house, <span class="style_black">a</span> person,
				<span class="style_black">an</span> idiot</em> etc.)
				</li>
				<li>
				All of them, everywhere &ndash; generic reference (<em><span class="style_black">&Oslash;</span> 
			people, <span class="style_black">&Oslash;</span> tigers,
				<span class="style_black">&Oslash;</span> computers</em> etc.)
				</li>
				<li>
				This one exactly &ndash; definite specific reference (<em><span class="style_black">the</span> 
			woman on <span class="style_black">the</span> corner,
				<span class="style_black">the</span> train for
				<span class="style_black">&Oslash;</span> London,

			<p>Adverbs are words which modify just as adjectives modify 
			nouns.<br />
			In English, adverbs do three things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>They modify verbs (hence the name):<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked <strong>slowly</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went <strong>outside</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They enjoyed the play <strong>immensely</strong></em></li>
				<li>They modify adjectives:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is <strong>extremely</strong> rich<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were <strong>deeply</strong> unhappy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's an <strong>unnecessarily</strong> rude thing to do</em></li>
				<li>They modify other adverbs:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove <strong>extremely</strong> 
				carefully<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came <strong>very</strong> late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They talked <strong>quite</strong> amicably</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In many languages they are not distinguished from 
			adjectives but English is not like that.<br />
			There is an 
			essential guide to adverbs on this site linked below so a few examples of 
			what is meant will do here:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked <span class="style_black">slowly</span> and
			<span class="style_black">carefully</span> to the door</em> 
			(answering <em>how</em>?)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's is coming <span class="style_black">soon</span></em> 
			(answering <em>when</em>?)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_black">sometimes</span> tells tall stories</em> 
			(answering <em>how often</em>?)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They wandered <span class="style_black">around</span> </em>
			(answering <em>where</em>?)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She <span class="style_black">mostly</span> enjoyed the 
			party </em>(answering <em>to what extent</em>?)<br />
			etc.</p>

				<h2>Pronouns</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Pronouns are a sub-class of what are called pro-forms and stand 
			for nouns or ideas.<br />
			There are guides to pronouns on this site accessible from
			the initial plus 
			words index.<br />
			Pronouns usually stand in for or replace nouns so instead of saying:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
			rain fell and the rain was heavy<br />
			</em>we can say:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain fell 
			and <span class="style_black"><strong>it</strong></span> was heavy</em>.<br />
			And, instead of:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I read the book, I realised how good the book was</em><br />
			we can say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I read <span class="style_black">
			<strong>it</strong></span>, I realised how good the book was</em><br />
			In the first example, the pronoun refers back to the noun (<em>rain</em>) 
			and in the second it refers forward to the noun (<em>book</em>).</p>
			<p>Sometimes, pronouns can stand for whole clauses or even longer 
			pieces of language as in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Getting the report written up and delivered to the right 
			people on time was difficult but she managed 
			<span class="style_black"><strong>it</strong></span></em><br />
			in which the pronoun <em>it</em> stands for the whole of <em>Getting 
			the report written up and delivered to the right people on time</em>.</p>
			<p>Essentially, 
			there are two sorts:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Personal pronouns</strong>.&nbsp; For example:</dt>
				<dd><em>Mary didn't have a pen so <span class="style_black">I</span> 
				gave her <span class="style_black">mine<br />
				</span></em>(instead of<br /><em>Mary didn't have a pen so this person gave Mary the pen 
				belonging to this person</em>)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Other pronouns</strong>.&nbsp; For example:</dt>
				<dd><em><span class="style_black">Somebody</span> is at the door<br />
				</em>(instead of <em>An unknown person is at the door</em>)<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">Nothing</span> is too much trouble<br />
				</em>(instead of <em>No action is too much trouble</em>)<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">He</span> wanted money so
				<span class="style_black">I</span> gave
				<span class="style_black">him</span> <span class="style_black">
				some<br />
				</span></em>(instead of <em>The male person wanted money so 
				this person gave the male person some money</em>)</dd>

			<p>Demonstratives are a sub-class of determiners.<br />
			There are four of these in English (<em>this, that, these, those</em>), 
			although some other expressions work rather similarly, 
			and they refer to what we want to talk about.&nbsp; In other words, 
			they <strong>demonstrate</strong> or point out what we are referring 
			to.&nbsp; There are two decisions to make:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Is it near or far?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Use <em>this</em> or <em>these</em> for things near to you:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want <span class="style_black">this</span> one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can give 
				you <span class="style_black">these</span> tickets</em><br />
				Use <em>that</em> or <em>those</em> for things further away:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I have <span class="style_black">that</span> one?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take
				<span class="style_black">those</span> tickets over there</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Is it singular, mass or plural?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Use <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> for singular or 
				mass nouns:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give him <span class="style_black">that</span> wine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
				didn't ask for <span class="style_black">this</span> meal</em><br />
				Use <em>these</em> and <em>those</em> for plural nouns:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I take <span class="style_black">these</span> glasses?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
				haven't opened <span class="style_black">those</span> bottles 
				yet</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Demonstratives can also act as pronouns:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want <span class="style_black">these</span> apples </em>
			(demonstrative), <em>I want <span class="style_black">those</span></em> 
			(pronoun).</p>
			<p>Demonstrative determiners are considered in the essential guide 
			to determiners, linked below.</p>

				<h2>Words and phrases</h2>

			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>In this guide, for the sake of simplicity, we have been focusing 
			on individual words to identify the classes into which they fall.<br />
			However, all word classes can sometimes be represented by phrases 
			so, for example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dogs are often faithful</em><br />
			we have four single words acting as representatives of word classes 
			(nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives respectively).<br />
			However, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter's old dog has been almost always 
			faithful and loving<br />
			</em>we have phrases forming representatives of phrase classes but 
			their grammatical functions are parallel.&nbsp; The phrases are:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noun: <em>Peter's old dog</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verb: <em>has been</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adverb: <em>almost always</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adjective: <em>faithful and loving</em></p>
			<p>Here are some more examples of phrases acting in the same ways as 
			single word classes:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>nouns</dt>
				<dd><em>car : William's old Volvo<br />
				house : corner house with a blue door</em></dd>
				<dt>verbs</dt>
				<dd><em>went : must have been going<br />
				have : can't have had</em></dd>
				<dt>conjunctions</dt>
				<dd><em>so : in order to<br />
				but : either ... or</em></dd>
				<dt>prepositions</dt>
				<dd><em>on : in front of<br />
				by : at the back of</em></dd>
				<dt>adjectives</dt>
				<dd><em>black : old, green French<br />
				sunny : cold and wet</em></dd>
				<dt>adverbs</dt>
				<dd><em>usually : now and then<br />
				carefully : slowly and thoughtfully</em></dd>
				<dt>determiners</dt>
				<dd><em>my: all the<br />
				the : half the many</em></dd>
				<dt>pronouns</dt>
				<dd><em>her : each other<br />
				us : one another</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>There is nothing particularly mystifying about this but it is 
			worth bearing in mind that when we talk of word class, we really 
			mean <strong>word <span class="style_underline">or</span> phrase 
			class</strong>.</p>

					<h2>An important distinction</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This distinction is one which confuses people new to the analysis 
			of English (and sometimes, alas, people who should know better).</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Word class<br />
				is to do with an item's <strong>syntactical</strong> function 
				but that does mean that it is the same as <strong>grammatical</strong> 
				function.<br />
				For example, we know that in something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the old __________ on the table</em><br />
				we can fill the gap only with a noun or a noun phrase to get 
				something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the old grammar books on the table</em><br />
				We know too that the phrase <em>grammar books</em> is a noun 
				phrase and that this is how we talk about its class.</li>
				<li>Grammatical function<br />
				is to do with how the items fit together in a sentence or 
				clause.&nbsp; In the example above, the phrase <em>grammar books</em> 
				is the <strong>object</strong> of the verb <em>put</em>.<br />
				Other word class items can also perform the grammatical function 
				of the object of a verb and they are highlighted
				<span class="styleblackbold">in black</span> in these examples:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I think </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>in the 
				corner</em></span><em> is a good place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>to go</em></span><em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>me</em></span><br />
				We can also make a noun or noun phrase the subject of a verb and 
				that is the grammatical function of the highlighted items in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold"><em>Fred </em></span><em>went 
				home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>The grass </em></span>
				<em>grew too long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>The people in the 
				corner </em></span><em>have not ordered yet</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				But other word-class items can also function grammatically as 
				subjects so we may also find:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold"><em>To visit </em></span><em>
				would be wonderful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><span class="styleblackbold"><em>Under the stairs </em>
				</span><em>is the best place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">We </span>left early</em><br />
				and so on.<br />
				Grammatical function refers to what the item is doing in 
				relation to the rest of the sentence but that is different from 
				an item's word or phrase class.<br />
				The three grammatical functions are usually confined to:<ol class="auto-style37">
					<li>subjects: <em><span class="styleblackbold">The old lady
					</span>gave her the money</em></li>
					<li>indirect objects: <em>The old lady gave
					<span class="styleblackbold">her </span>the money</em></li>
					<li>direct objects: <em>The old lady gave her
					<span class="styleblackbold">the money</span></em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>(The situation regarding grammatical function is actually a bit 
			more complicated than this, but, providing you are clear about the 
			difference between word class and grammatical function, that's 
			enough.)</p>
