	<h1>Countability and uncountability</h1>
		<p>
		<img height="207" src="../../images/measure_scales310.jpg" width="310" alt="scales" /></p>
		<p>If you have followed
		<a href="word_class_essentials.html" target="_blank">the guide to word class</a> 
		(new tab), you'll know that nouns can 
		be countable (<em>table, dog etc</em>.) or uncountable (<em>water, love, 
		sugar, anger</em>
		etc.).&nbsp; You'll also know that some can be both <em>(the seven seas, 
		the sea is rough, sugar is bad for you, two sugars, love is admirable, the loves of her life</em>)<em>.</em></p>
			<p>Here we look a bit harder at this very important distinction.&nbsp; 
		In the picture above, therefore, we can talk about an uncountable noun (<em>weight</em>) 
		and a countable one (<em>kilo[s]</em>).&nbsp; Note, too, that we can 
		have <em>weights</em> but in a different meaning.<br />
		This is not only a very important distinction, it is one that not all 
		languages share and which causes really serious problems for learners at 
		all levels.<br />
		In English, it is almost impossible to use a noun correctly unless one 
		first decides whether the noun is to be used as a count noun or as a 
		mass noun.</p>

		<p>The usual distinction made in classrooms is between countability and 
		uncountability and that's probably enough for most learners.&nbsp; 
		However, we teachers need to know a bit more about the area so a better 
		categorisation is between mass nouns and count nouns.&nbsp; Often, the 
		term uncountable noun is <strong>wrongly</strong> used for count nouns which are only plural but 
		obviously countable.&nbsp; We can say <em>three people</em> or <em>six cattle</em> 
		and this means that the nouns are count nouns but plurals (albeit 
		slightly odd plurals).&nbsp; Both <em>people</em> and <em>cattle</em> 
		are count nouns but they only occur in the plural.</p>
			<p>While the terms <strong>countable</strong> and <strong>uncountable
			</strong>nouns are helpful for some purposes, 
			they are misleading.</p>
		<p>For example, <em>money</em> is a 
			mass noun we can count.&nbsp; We cannot say<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *How many money?<br />
		</em>but have to choose<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much money?</em></p>
		<p>Almost all mass nouns can be made count 
			nouns by the use of another noun so we can have<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some cake </em>&rarr; <em>a slice of cake<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		some cheese &rarr; a bit of 
			cheese<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		lots of a information &rarr; two pieces of information<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		too much sugar &rarr; three kilos of sugar<br />
		</em>etc.&nbsp; What we do here is add a <strong>measure</strong> (<em>pint, 
		yard, kilo </em>etc.) or a <strong>partitive</strong> (<em>bit, piece, 
		lump, slice, rasher, pane, chunk</em> etc.)</p>
		<p>By the same token, it is arguably advisable to tell our learners 
			about count and mass <strong>uses</strong> rather than count and 
		mass nouns because that's nearer the truth of the matter.&nbsp; For 
		example, we can have:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much cheese is in the fridge?</em><br />
		and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many cheeses are in the fridge?</em><br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rough sea is coming over the harbour.</em><br />
		and<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rough seas are coming over the harbour.</em></p>

			</table>
			<p>There are two simple enough differences.&nbsp; Here they are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Count nouns form plurals, mass nouns do not.&nbsp; We allow, 
				therefore:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table-tables<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desk-desks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; house-houses</em><br />
				etc. but do not allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; petrol-*petrols<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information-*informations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help-*helps</em></li>
				<li>Mass nouns can occur without a determiner or plural form as 
				the subject and object of verbs.&nbsp; We can have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got advice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Money helped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have furniture</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information was provided</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rain fell</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I got suggestion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Window broke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She has pen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Chair was comfortable</em><br />
				although making the count nouns plural or adding a determiner 
				such as an article allows:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got suggestions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has her pen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the chair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drops fell</em></li>

			</table>
		<p>This is the simplest category but it's not always obvious from the 
		form whether a noun is a count noun or not.&nbsp; The usual defining 
		characteristic of a count noun is its ability to form a plural (usually 
		with <em>-s</em>) when it demands a plural verb form.&nbsp; Secondarily, is the 
		fact that one can use the indefinite article (<em>a[n]</em>) before it.&nbsp; 
		There are some important exceptions and irregular forms to consider.</p>
		<h4>Count nouns which <em>only </em>appear in the plural</h4>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li><em>cattle, people, police, vermin</em> etc.<br />
			But there 
			are corresponding nouns which can be used in the ordinary, count way:
			<em>cow, 
			person, police officer, rat</em>.</li>
			<li>objects containing two equal parts, e.g.:<br />
			<em>trousers, tongs, 
			scissors, glasses</em> etc.<br />
			are either never found in the 
			singular or have a different meaning in that form.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			A: <em>Where's my glass?</em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			B: <em>It's in front of you.&nbsp; Put your glasses on!</em></li>
			<li>Some count nouns have no singular form.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>annals, arrears, earnings, outskirts, valuables, savings</em> etc.<br />
			You can put a determiner such as <em>
			few, many </em>etc. before these but not a number (<em>many 
			valuables, *six valuables</em>)</li>
			<li>Count nouns may have a plural-only form but a singular or mass 
			form which has a different meaning.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>arms</em> 
			(weaponry, countable only plural) vs.<em> arm </em> 
			(limb, countable)<br /><em>grounds</em> 
			(reason, countable only plural) vs.<em> 
			ground </em> 
			(surface of the earth, mass noun)<br /><em>damages </em>(money awarded for by a court, countable only plural) 
			vs. <em>damage</em> (harm, mass noun)</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Irregular plurals</h4>
		<p>There are quite a number of common irregular plurals (mostly the 
		result of retaining older forms) and some other oddities to know about:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li><strong>old plural forms</strong>: <em>louse / lice, mouse / 
			mice, ox / oxen, man / men, foot / feet, tooth / teeth</em> etc.&nbsp; These are well 
			known and can be taught as they occur.&nbsp; There's no rule.</li>
			<li><strong>zero plurals</strong>: <em>sheep, deer, grouse, dozen</em> (when it's 
			exact, <em>dozens</em> when it means <em>lots</em>).&nbsp; The names 
			of many different animals (especially fish) work this way.&nbsp; We 
			can have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; five dozen people came </em>vs. <em>dozens arrived<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			one sheep </em>vs<em>. sixteen sheep<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			some fish for tea </em>vs<em>. three fish in the pond </em>[but <em>
			fishes</em> is also possible in this sense]</li>
			<li><strong>the <em>f</em> vs. <em>v</em> problem</strong>: plurals such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; roofs, 
			dwarfs, handkerchiefs<br />
			</em>are common but the regular form (and increasingly 
			the regular pronunciation) is to change the <em>f</em> to a <em>v</em> in the plural 
			and add <em>-es</em>:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wolves, halves, ?rooves</em></li>
			<li><strong>the <em>-os</em> vs. <em>-oes</em> problem</strong>: the regular plural of 
			nouns ending in -o is to add -s (<em>radios, kilos</em> etc.) but there are a number 
			which add -es (<em>potato, tomato</em>) and some which can do both (<em>mosquito</em>).</li>
			<li><strong>foreign plurals</strong>: sometimes English retains the 
			plural form of the language from which the noun has come:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phenomenon 
			/ phenomena, antenna / antennae, larva / larvae, crisis / crises<br />
			</em>sometimes we can choose either the foreign or English plural (<em>syllabuses 
			or syllabi</em>) and sometimes the word is pluralised in one use (<em>index 
			/ indices</em> in scientific writing but <em>indexes</em> in 
			non-scientific use)</li>
			<li><strong>plurals made singular</strong>: <em>graffiti, data</em> and <em>media</em> 
			are all plurals often treated as singular in English.&nbsp; The use 
			of <em>criteria</em> instead of <em>criterion</em> as a singular is 
			just wrong.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Nouns modifying other nouns</h4>
		<p>Many count nouns can work to modify other nouns, by a process called 
		compounding or by classifying the noun in some way, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		a book 
		sale, a pencil case, a saloon car, a windmill<br />
		</em>In this use the singular is used for the first noun unless there's 
		a possibility of ambiguity.&nbsp; So we get<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		a book shop, a two-hour shift, a four-year-old child, boy scouts, 
		child actor</em> etc.<br />
		but not:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *three bookshops, *a four-years-old child </em>etc.<br />
		There are some exceptions: <em>men friends, women doctors</em> and some 
		avoiding ambiguity such as <em>arms race</em>.<br />
		Notice here, too, that some nouns which are nearly always plural only 
		appear in the singular when modifying other nouns:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spectacle case, 
		binocular case, trouser pocket</em>.</p>

		<p>There are times when the amount of a count noun really doesn't matter &ndash; 
		it's the concept we want to express so we treat the nouns as mass nouns 
		and leave out the article.&nbsp; We get, therefore, example such as:</p>
		<p><em><span class="auto-style38">go to / be in </span>bed, church, 
		school, hospital </em>etc.<br />
		<em><span class="auto-style38">travel by / go by</span> car, bicycle, 
		plane, rail ferry</em> etc.<br />
		<em><span class="auto-style38">at / before / after / by / in</span> 
		dawn, sunset, sunrise, autumn, day, night</em> etc.</p>
		<p>Many reference books treat these kinds of thing as idioms to be 
		learned separately but it is conceptually easier to see them as unmarked 
		forms (Chalker 1987: 29).</p>
		<p>There are a number of other expressions in which the noun is not 
		marked for plural or singular forms.&nbsp; Here's a list (also based on 
		Chalker, op cit.):</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Other prepositional phrases:<br />
			<em>by chance, on call, by hand, in 
			mind, at heart<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>Parallel structures:<br />
			<em>arm in arm, eye to eye, year after year<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>Double structures:<br />
			<em>hand over fist, life after death, hand on 
			heart<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
		</ol>
		<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<img alt="mass" height="166" src="../../images/pour_milk250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Mass nouns</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>It's easy enough to spot normal mass nouns 
		because</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>
			you can't put the indefinite article in front of them (<em>*a milk, 
			*a 
			money, *a bread</em> etc.)</li>
			<li>they normally have no plural form (<em>*milks, *furnitures, *informations
			</em>etc.)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>So we get the common list of mass nouns:</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><em>advice, anger, 
		assistance, bread, chaos, courage, dirt, education, information, 
		leisure, luck, machinery, milk, news, permission, poetry, rubbish, shopping, 
		transport, weather </em>etc.</p>
		<p>These are mass nouns in English but 
		not in many languages.</p>
			<p>Many abstract nouns in English are mass nouns so we can include 
			in the list, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>advice, anger, happiness, information, knowledge, news</em> 
			etc.<br />
			but that is not an entirely reliable rule because:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>belief, joy, pleasure, prejudice, suggestion, theory </em>
			and <em>virtue</em><br />
			can all be used as count nouns.</p>
		<p>But:</p>
		<h4>Nouns with both mass and count uses</h4>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>These sometimes have subtle distinctions but the meaning is 
			close.&nbsp; Examples are:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Unemployment is affecting business</em> vs. <em>Businesses 
			are closing<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Noise is a problem here</em> vs. <em>The noises can be 
			disturbing<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Chocolate is addictive </em> vs<em>. These chocolates 
			are delicious</em></li>
			<li>Sometimes the distinctions are much greater in meaning.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Dress is formal</em> vs. <em>She's wearing a formal dress<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It's made 
			of iron</em> vs. <em>Most people have electric irons<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The works of 
			Shakespeare</em> vs. <em>Finding work is difficult<br />
			</em>(<em>Sex</em> is another of these nouns, by the way.)</li>
			<li>Occasionally, English users like to omit what are often called 
			unit nouns.&nbsp; Unit nouns (better known as partitives) are the items we use to express a 
			quantity of a mass noun.&nbsp; So we have, e.g.:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>a blade of grass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a 
			pint of beer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bit of cotton<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a piece of furniture<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a teaspoon of sugar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cup of coffee<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Sometimes, the unit noun is omitted to allow <em>two sugars, three 
			beers, a few coffees</em> etc.&nbsp; This is not particularly common 
			and can't occur with most mass nouns.&nbsp; It's also informal.</li>
			<li>Almost all mass nouns can be used as count nouns when we are 
			classifying: <em>Spanish wines, Greek cheeses, spicy foods</em> etc. 
			but some remain resiliently mass nouns (<em>furniture, information, 
			music</em>, for example).</li>

			<p>In English, but not in all languages, whether a noun is mass or 
			count controls how it is determined.&nbsp; Quantifiers are, for 
			obvious reasons, the most affected.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em>many</em> <em>vs</em>. <em>much</em></dt>
				<dd>many is used for count nouns:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has many problems<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were many people who disagreed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many knives are there?<br />
				much is used with mass nouns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have much work on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was much disagreement<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much cutlery is there?</dd>
				<dt>(<em>a</em>) <em>few</em> <em>vs</em>. (<em>a</em>) <em>
				little</em></dt>
				<dd>Except colloquially, few is used for count nouns:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were few people who disagreed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few children arrived late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are fewer things to do now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The winner is the one with the fewest points<br />
				(a) little is used for mass nouns:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need a little help here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less noise please!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The least wine makes be giddy</dd>
				<dt><em>a, each</em> and <em>every</em></dt>
				<dd>These only work with count nouns so we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every possibility</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *a furniture<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *each grass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *every anger</em></dd>
				<dt>articles</dt>
				<dd>The rules are:<ol class="auto-style81">
					<li>A count noun in the plural can appear with the zero 
					article:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parrots are interesting birds</em></li>
					<li>A count noun in the singular cannot appear with the zero 
					article:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Parrot is interesting bird</em></li>
					<li>A mass noun can stand with the zero article:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food for parrots must be carefully 
					selected</em></li>
					<li>A mass noun cannot appear with the indefinite article:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A food for parrots must be chosen 
					carefully</em></li>
					
				</ol>The consequence of these rules is that any usually count 
				noun used in the singular with no article is assumed to be meant 
				as a mass noun.&nbsp; So for example, if we say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An apple would be a good addition to this<br />
				</em>we are using the noun <em>apple</em> in its usual 
				count-noun guise, but if we say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apple would be a good addition to this<br />
				</em>we clearly intend that <em>apple</em> is understood as a 
				mass noun.</dd>

			<p>Often, what is called a superordinate is a mass noun and the 
			hyponyms which lie below it (and are included in the superordinate) 
			are count nouns.&nbsp; So for example, we get:</p>

			<img alt="hyponymy" height="221" src="../../imagesgraphics/hyponymy.png" width="310" /></p>
