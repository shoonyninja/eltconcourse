			</table>
			
			<p>There is, in fact, a word class missing from this list which is 
			used in more modern grammars: <strong>determiners</strong>.<br />
			Determiners are words which modify nouns (just as adjectives, 
			demonstratives and articles do).&nbsp; In older grammars, 
			determiners were often classed as adjectives (we can have <em>few 
			dogs </em>and <em>fewer dogs) </em>or as demonstratives (<em>these 
			books, that man</em>) or as articles (<em>the car, some sugar</em>) 
			or even as pronouns.<br />
			This is not satisfactory in many ways so the modern term for words 
			such as <em>each, all, more, the, a, several, these, either</em> etc. when 
			they come before nouns is simply 
			determiner.<br />
			How determiners work in English is not a simple matter to analyse 
			and is the subject of 
			<a href="../../inservice/lexicogrammar/determiners.html">a separate guide</a>.&nbsp; 
			Following that guide successfully will be quite difficult if the 
			area is new to you.&nbsp; You will almost certainly need to 
			understand issues of (un)countability in nouns before tackling it.</p>
		<p>Now <a href="wordclasshp.htm">click for a test</a> to 
		see if you can identify what these different word classes actually do in 
		the language.&nbsp; Don't worry if you don't get it all right.&nbsp; 
		It's explained below.<br />

		<p><a name="10"></a>Apart from obvious (and slightly inaccurate) distinctions between abstract 
		nouns (<em>beauty, hope</em> etc.), 
		concrete nouns (<em>apple, table </em>etc.) and proper nouns (<em>James, Canada</em> etc.), there is a key distinction 
		learners (and you) need to understand:<span class="auto-style10"><br />
		countability</span> 
		and <span class="auto-style10">uncountability</span>.<br />
		Countable nouns can be preceded by a number (<em>two cats</em>), <em>some</em> 
		(<em>some dogs</em>) and <em>a few</em>.&nbsp; They usually take plural endings.&nbsp; 
		In the plural, we use a plural form of the verb with them <em>(are</em> 
		not <em>is</em>, for example).<br />
		Uncountable nouns are better referred to as mass nouns and 
		cannot be preceded by a number or <em>a few</em> (but can be preceded by
		<em>some</em>) and only take plurals in unusual meanings when we make 
		them countable.&nbsp; We use the singular form of the verb with these.<br />
		Divide these</p>
		<p class="auto-style20"><em><span class="auto-style21">sugar, pea, furniture, happiness, sheep, army, 
		money, attention, pliers, coffee, teacher, food, door, discomfort, 
		information, luggage, suitcase, chair</span></em></p>
		<p>and then click 
		<a href="#10" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'wordclass4',0,'style.visibility','visible')">here for some comments</a>.</p>
		<div id="wordclass4" style="visibility: hidden" class="auto-style22">
		<p><span class="auto-style22">It's not as easy as it looks, is it?&nbsp; There are two important 
		things to understand.</span></p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>Some words (such as <em>sugar</em> and <em>door</em>) are clear cases of 
		uncountable and countable examples.&nbsp; Others are more complicated 
				because we can use them in both ways with different meanings.&nbsp; 
				Compare <em>You have my attention</em> (uncountable) with <em>His 
				attentions are unwelcome</em> (countable).&nbsp; Some nouns, 
				such as <em>sheep</em> are countable but take no plural.&nbsp; 
				Some obviously countable things, such as <em>money</em>, are 
				treated as uncountable in English.<br />  Virtually all uncountable nouns can be made countable in English when we are using them to classify things.  For example, <em>There are some coffees which are too bitter for me, They have lots of German wines on the list</em> etc.</li>
				<li>Different languages deal with these things differently.&nbsp; 
				In German, for example,<em> information</em> is a countable 
				noun.&nbsp; In Greek, so is<em> money</em>.&nbsp; When introducing a 
				noun, remember that students will probably presume it's 
				countable unless you make it clear otherwise.&nbsp; So you'll 
				get people saying <em>furnitures </em>and it'll be your fault, 
				not theirs!<br />

			<p>There is another key distinction here.&nbsp; Can you divide

					</table>
					<p><span class="auto-style22">The issue here is called 
					transitivity.&nbsp; Transitive verbs take an object, 
					intransitive verbs don't but some verbs can do both.<br />
					We can say, <em>I smoke</em> and <em>I smoked a cigarette</em>.&nbsp; 
					We can say, <em>She carried the box</em> but not <em>She 
					carried</em>.&nbsp; We can say <em>I arrived</em> but not 
					<em>I arrived / went / came the airport</em>.&nbsp; 
					Sometimes, there's a change in meaning: <em>He can hear</em> 
					and <em>He can hear it</em> are different.<br />
					When you teach a new verb, bear in mind that languages deal 
					with transitivity differently.&nbsp; In some languages, for 
					example, you can say <em>I jumped the table</em> (meaning 
					onto, not over) or <em>She 
					listened the music</em>.&nbsp; Set verbs in a context and 
					make sure that your learners are aware of whether they are 
					transitive, intransitive or both.<br />

		<em>I won't make the beds <span class="style_black">unless</span> you do the washing up</em> is an 
		example of <em>unless</em> acting as a <span class="auto-style10">subordinating</span>

			<p>Articles are a sub-class of determiners.<br />
			Again, there's

			more advanced guide to articles</a> on the site.<br />
			There are only three true articles in English: <em>a, an</em> and
			<em>the</em>.&nbsp; The other choice in English is no article at all 
			and that is usually represented by a zero sign, like this: <strong>∅</strong>.&nbsp; 
			The zero article is important because it is used in English to refer 
			to all instances of something.<br />
			(Some analyses will include <em>some</em> in the 
			list but it's actually not an article although it can work in a very 
			similar fashion.)<br />
			A few examples are all that's needed here:<br />
			<em><span class="style_black">a</span> house,
			<span class="style_black">a</span> university,
			<span class="style_black">an</span> apple</em> etc. (Note that the 
			choice of <em>a </em>or <em>an</em> is determined by the <strong>sound</strong> of the following word, 
			not the spelling.)<br />
			<em><span class="style_black">the</span> house,
			<span class="style_black">the</span> man I met</em> etc.<br />
			<span class="style_black">∅</span> people often complain,
			<span class="style_black">∅</span> cars pollute etc.</p>
			<p>The rules for deciding which article to use are not simple so go 
			to the guide to articles for more detail.&nbsp; Essentially, the 
			rule is:</p>
		<p>Decide what you are talking about.&nbsp; There are <strong>only</strong> 
		three choices:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				<p class="auto-style25" style="height: 30px">One of many &ndash; indefinite specific reference (<em><span class="style_black">a</span> 
			house, <span class="style_black">a</span> person,
				<span class="style_black">an</span> idiot</em> etc.)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p class="auto-style25" style="height: 30px">All of them, everywhere &ndash; generic reference (<em><span class="style_black">∅</span> 
			people, <span class="style_black">∅</span> tigers,
				<span class="style_black">∅</span> computers</em> etc.)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p class="auto-style25" style="height: 30px">This one exactly &ndash; definite specific reference (<em><span class="style_black">the</span> 
			woman on <span class="style_black">the</span> corner,
				<span class="style_black">the</span> train for
				<span class="style_black">∅</span> London, 
				<span class="style_black">the</span> visitors to 
				<span class="style_black">the</span> park,
				<span class="style_black">the</span> tourist industry</em> etc.)</p>
				<p style="height: 30px" class="auto-style25"></p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Adverbs are words which modify verbs just as adjectives modify 
			nouns.&nbsp; In many languages they are not distinguished from 
			adjectives but English is not like that.<br />
			There is an <a href="adverbsessentials.html" target="_blank">
			essential guide to adverbs</a> on this site so a few examples of 
			what is meant will do here:<br />
			<em>He walked <span class="style_black">slowly</span> and
			<span class="style_black">carefully</span> to the door</em> 
			(answering <em>how</em>?)<br />
			<em>He's is coming <span class="style_black">soon</span></em> 
			(answering <em>when</em>?)<br />
			<em>He <span class="style_black">sometimes</span> tells tall stories</em> 
			(answering <em>how often</em>?)<br />
			<em>They wandered <span class="style_black">around</span> </em>
			(answering <em>where</em>?)<br />
			etc.</p>
			<p style="height: 30px"></p>

				<td class="auto-style31">
				<h2>Pronouns</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Again, there are guides to pronouns on this site accessible from 			<a href="../initialindex.html">the initial plus training index</a>.<br />
			Pronouns stand in for or replace nouns so instead of saying <em>The 
			rain fell and the rain was heavy</em> we can say <em>The rain fell 
			and <span class="style_black">it</span> was heavy</em>. Essentially, 
			there are two sorts:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Personal pronouns.&nbsp; For example:</dt>
				<dd><em>Mary didn't have a pen so <span class="style_black">I</span> 
				gave her <span class="style_black">mine</span></em> (instead of
				<em>Mary didn't have a pen so this person gave Mary the pen 
				belonging to this person</em>)</dd>
				<dt>Other pronouns.&nbsp; For example:</dt>
				<dd><em><span class="style_black">Somebody</span> is at the door</em> 
				(instead of <em>An unknown person is at the door</em>)<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">Nothing</span> is too much trouble</em> 
				(instead of <em>No action is too much trouble</em>)<br />
				<em><span class="style_black">He</span> wanted money so
				<span class="style_black">I</span> gave
				<span class="style_black">him</span> <span class="style_black">
				some</span></em> (instead of <em>The male person wanted money so 
				this person gave the male person some money</em>)<p style="height: 30px"></p></dd>

				<td class="auto-style31">
				<h2>Demonstratives</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Demonstratives are a sub-class of determiners.<br />
			There are four of these in English (<em>this, that, these, those</em>) 
			and they refer to what we want to talk about.&nbsp; In other words, 
			they <strong>demonstrate</strong> or point out what we are referring 
			to.&nbsp; There are two decisions to make:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Is it near or far?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Use <em>this</em> or <em>these</em> for things near to you:<br />
				<em>I want <span class="style_black">this</span> one, I can give 
				you <span class="style_black">these</span> tickets</em><br />
				Use <em>that</em> or <em>those</em> for things further away:<br />
				<em>Can I have <span class="style_black">that</span> one? Take
				<span class="style_black">those</span> tickets over there</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Is it singular, uncountable or plural?</strong></dt>
				<dd>Use <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> for singular or 
				uncountable nouns:<br />
				<em>Give him <span class="style_black">that</span> wine, I 
				didn't ask for <span class="style_black">this</span> meal</em><br />
				Use <em>these</em> and <em>those</em> for plural nouns:<br />
				<em>Can I take <span class="style_black">these</span> glasses? I 
				haven't opened <span class="style_black">those</span> bottles 
				yet</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Note that demonstratives can also act as pronouns:<br />
			<em>I don't want <span class="style_black">these</span> apples </em>
			(demonstrative), <em>I want <span class="style_black">those</span></em> 
			(pronoun).</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>This is the simplest class of all.&nbsp; These words are not, in 
			a sense, 'real' words because they represent noises things and 
			people make.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>"<span class="style_black">Ouch</span>!" he cried.<br />
			</em>"<span class="style_black"></span><em><span class="style_black">Aaargh</span>! 
			I've done it again."<br />
			</em>"<span class="style_black"></span><em><span class="style_black">Pssst</span>." 
			he said.<br />
			The car went '<span class="style_black">clunkety-clunk</span>' and 
			stopped</em></p>
