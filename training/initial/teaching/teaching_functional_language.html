			<p>If you have followed
			<a href="../functions/form_function.html" target="_blank">the guide 
			to form, function and meaning</a>, you will be familiar with the 
			fact that a functional approach to analysing language is one which:</p>
			<p class="auto-style3" style="width: 486px"><em>starts from the 
			understanding that language is primarily a tool for getting meaning 
			across and that it is best analysed by looking at the functions bits 
			of the language actually perform.</em></p>
			<p>A functional view of language lies at the heart of a 
			communicative approach to teaching it.&nbsp; Communicative Language 
			Teaching is defined elsewhere on this site as:</p>
			<p class="auto-style3" style="width: 486px"><em>an approach to teaching which focuses more on successful 
			communication than structural or formal accuracy.&nbsp; There are 
			two forms:<br />
			Weak form: in which the study of grammar is combined with a focus on 
			function but communicative competence remains the objective.<br />
			Strong form: in which there is no study of structure or form at all.&nbsp; 
			Competence in this area is deemed to flow from authentic language 
			use alone.</em></p>
			
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" >
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style25">
					<img alt="warning" height="166" src="../../images/banana_skin250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style24"><h2>a word of caution</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>If you take the strong form of the approach, you may bewilder and 
			worry your learners, many of whom take the view that, although they 
			need above all to communicate effectively, learning the formal 
			structures, grammar, lexical systems and pronunciation of the 
			language is part and parcel of being able to do so.<br />
			They would not be alone in thinking so.&nbsp; As Widdowson puts it:</p>
			<p class="auto-style3" style="width: 486px"><em>&nbsp;... language learning is essentially learning how grammar 
			functions in the achievement of meaning and it is a mistake to 
			suppose otherwise.<br />
			&nbsp;.... A communicative approach does not involve the rejection of 
			grammar. On the contrary, it involves a recognition of its central 
			mediating role in the use of and learning of language.<br />
			</em>
			<span class="auto-style18">Widdowson (1990: 97/8)</span></p>
			<p>Add in lexical systems and pronunciation and you have (probably) the 
			majority view.</p>

			<p>This is not the place to repeat what has been said in the guide 
			to form, function and meaning but two essential aspects stand out:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Form and function do not exist in a one-to-one relationship.&nbsp; 
				A single form can realise a number of functions and a single 
				function can be realised in a number of linguistic ways.</li>
				<li>Functions rarely occur in isolation.&nbsp; Communication is 
				a two-way process and the participants need to respond to the 
				other person's functions with those of their own.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Think about those two statements a little and see if you can 
			exemplify what they mean.<br />
			<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'function1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have done that</a>.</p>
			<ol id="function1" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">
				<li>Form and function do not exist in a one-to-one relationship.<br />
				For example:<ol class="auto-style19">
					<li><em>Can I get the plates?<br />
					</em>is a question form which 
					could function as:<br />
					A simple question: <em>Do I have the ability or permission 
					to get the plates?</em><br />
					An offer: <em>I will get the plates for you.</em><br />
					A question about something else: <em>Is it time to get the 
					plates?</em><br />
					A statement as a reminder: <em>We need the plates now.</em><br />
					A suggestion: <em>Should the plates be got?</em></li>
					<li>The function of disagreeing with an opinion can be 
					realised by:<br />
					<em>Are you sure about that? </em>(an interrogative)<br />
					<em>I'm unconvinced</em> (a statement)<br />
					<em>Think that through a bit more</em> (an imperative or 
					order)<br />
					<em>Doesn't that make it nonsense?</em> (a negative 
					question)<br />
					<em>If you say so, I'll have to accept it but I'm still not 
					too sure </em>(a complex conditional)<br />
					<em>That can't be true!</em> (an exclamation with a modal 
					auxiliary verb)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Functions rarely occur in isolation.&nbsp; We have what are called <strong>adjacency pairs</strong>.<br /><em>Offering</em> is matched with <em>accepting</em> or <em>
				declining</em>, <em>asking for information</em> is matched with
				<em>giving information</em>, <em>excusing oneself</em> is 
				matched by <em>accepting </em>or <em>rejecting an excuse</em> 
				and so on.<br />
				For example, if someone makes a suggestion, such as <em>Shall we 
				go now?, </em>there are three possible response types:<ol  class="auto-style19">
					<li>Agree to a suggestion: <em>OK, let's get our coats.</em></li>
					<li>Reject a suggestion:<em> I'm happy where I am, thanks.</em></li>
					<li>Temporise:<em> Let's stay a little longer.</em></li>
				</ol>For a good deal more on adjacency pairs and a link to a list of some of them, refer to the guide in the in-service section, linked below.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It becomes obvious that we can't teach functions one at a time.&nbsp; 
			There is very little point in being able to make an offer if you 
			can't understand or produce the possible responses.</p>

			<p>Two key publications listing lots of functions are from the Council of Europe and are available on 
		the web:<br />
		<a href="http://www.ealta.eu.org/documents/resources/Waystage_CUP.pdf" target="_blank">
		Waystage 1990 by Van Ek and Trim</a><br />

			<p>When we are teaching structure or lexis, it is quite 
			straightforward to select by the level of the students what language 
			to teach, building on previous knowledge to extend our learners' 
			repertoire and lexicon.&nbsp; In other words, we teach the easy, 
			common stuff first and leave the hard grammar and lexis till later.<br />
			When it comes to choosing a function or set of functions to focus 
			on, however, things get more difficult because it is harder to state 
			that, e.g., apologising is more difficult than asking for directions 
			or greeting people is easier than asking for their opinion.</p>
			<p>For example, even an apparently simple function such as saying 
			sorry can be realised linguistically at various levels of 
			complexity:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="complexity" height="234" src="../../imagesgraphics/function_complexity.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>So, much depends on the language we teach to allow our learners to 
			realise the function.</p>
			<p>Because, as you know, there is no one-to-one relationship between 
			form and function, this means that the same function may be 
			addressed a number of times, each time extending and developing the 
			amount of subtlety and sophistication in language use.</p>
			<p>However, it is possible to have a rough idea about which 
			functions should be taught at each level based on:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style4">
				<li>how frequently they are likely to be needed and</li>
				<li>how complex the language is that we need to express the 
				function</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here's a very rough guide related to the Common European 
			Framework of language levels.</p>

			<p>As was said, this is a very rough guide indeed.&nbsp; There's no

			unnecessary or inappropriate in another case.<br />

			<h3>4 things to consider before you plan to teach</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>The intentions of the participants</strong></dt>
				<dd>Learners need to be aware of what they 
				want to <strong>do</strong> with the language.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Am I 
				offering something, demanding something, asking for something, 
				persuading someone or what?</em><br />
				There is a clear difference between <strong>interactional</strong> 
				and <strong>transactional</strong> purposes.<br />
				However, where the dividing lines are and how the terms are used 
				in the profession are not quite so clear.<br />
				Transactions have clear goals and often involve service 
				encounters and communication in specific settings (shops, 
				services, offices, factories etc.).<br />
				Interactions, on the other hand, are concerned with oiling 
				social wheels and getting along with other people.<br />
				It is important to be aware that most encounters involve <strong>
				both</strong> kinds of language.&nbsp; Even when you are only 
				buying a sandwich some of what is said will be purely 
				interactional (greetings, expressions of gratitude, politeness 
				forms etc.) and some will be purely transactional (expressing 
				needs and wants, giving information about price etc.).</dd>
				<dt><strong>The context and setting</strong></dt>
				<dd>You can't learn, use or understand language in a vacuum.&nbsp; 
				Where people are talking and what they are doing are important 
				data.&nbsp; For example, a conversation at work will differ from 
				one in a caf&eacute;, a letter to a friend will differ from one 
				to a landlord and so on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>The relationships</strong></dt>
				<dd>Who the people are, what the power relationships between 
				them are and even what their ages and sexes are is important 
				information.</dd>
				<dt><strong>The medium</strong></dt>
				<dd>Am I speaking, reading, texting, emailing, writing formally, 
				scratching a quick note or what?&nbsp; All of these will affect 
				what language I select and the style of what I say / write.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Think of examples of the way in which what we say is affected by 
			these 4 considerations and
			<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'function2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			then click here</a>.</p>
			<dl class="style_brown" id="function2" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden">
				<dt><strong>The intentions of the participants</strong></dt>
				<dd>Here are just two examples.<br />
				If I am asking for information, I have a number of means at my 
				disposal.<br />
				I can, for example, use a question form such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have 
				my address?<br />
				</em>a question tag<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have my address, don't 
				you?<br />
				</em>a statement with rising intonation<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have my 
				address?<br />
				</em>and so on.<br />
				If I am making an offer, I can also select from a range of 
				forms:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I help?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Let me help.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I'll help.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				You can't do that alone.<br />

				<dd>Here the speaker / writer needs to consider style, i.e., the 
				level of formality which is appropriate:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the window.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Please open the window.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Do you mind if we have the window open?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I wonder if you could open the window.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Dear Bill,<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Dear Mr Williams,<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I am writing to enquire whether ...<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Tell me ...</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>The relationships</strong></dt>
				<dd>Style matters here, too but so does the level of directness 
				and the type of function which is even appropriate at all.<br />
				Boss to employee:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come and see me tomorrow and talk about 
				your holiday dates, will you?<br />
				</em>Employee to boss:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you let me have a bit of time 
				later on to discuss my holiday dates?<br />
				</em>Employee to employee:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's sort out my holiday dates 
				today.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>The medium</strong></dt>
				<dd>Spoken language tends, on the whole, to be less formal, come 
				in shorter chunks, be characterised by hesitation and false 
				starts, leaves understood information out and is less complex.&nbsp; 
				Writing is more complex, more coherent and includes all the 
				data.&nbsp; Prepared speech is more like written language spoken 
				aloud.<br />
				Spoken:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's he is!&nbsp; That's him ... the man, I mean.&nbsp; 
				He was in the pub yesterday, wasn't he?&nbsp; He .. err you 
				spoke to ... to him.&nbsp; Well, had an argument really.<br />
				</em>Written:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Do you remember the man you spoke to, or 
				rather argued with, who was in the pub yesterday?</em></dd>

			<p>Spoken language is often presented <em>via</em> a dialogue (read 
			or heard) or some other kind of text.&nbsp; It can also be embedded 
			in interaction in the classroom.&nbsp; Whether this is done after 
			the learners have tried to express the target function for 
			themselves (a Test–Teach–Test approach) or at the outset (a 
			Present&ndash;Practise&ndash;Produce approach) is not our concern here.<br />
			Visuals or other aids help to make the setting clear but learners 
			still need the information under the 4 sections above to make sense 
			of the input.</p>
			<p>At lower levels such dialogues can be pretty short and simple, 
			along the lines of:</p>
			<p class="style_black">A tourist approaching strangers in the 
			street.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Excuse me, can you tell me where the Police Station is?<br />
				I'm sorry, I'm a stranger here.<br />
				Oh, well, thanks anyway.</em></li>
				<li><em>Excuse me, can you tell me where the Tourist Information 
				Office is?<br />
				Err, I'm not too sure.&nbsp; I think it's in the 
				station.&nbsp; Down there on the right but you should ask 
				someone else.&nbsp; I may be wrong.<br />
				OK.&nbsp; I'll try that.&nbsp; Thanks.</em></li>
				<li><em>Excuse me, can you tell me where the City College is?<br />
				Yes.&nbsp; It's just down here.&nbsp; Go to the end of the road, 
				turn right and it's on your left.<br />
				Thanks.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is a simple way to introduce how to use an indirect question 
			to make a request for directions and the three ways to respond to 
			it.&nbsp; The dialogues can be read, seen, heard or all three.</p>
			<p>At higher levels, things can get a bit more sophisticated.&nbsp; 
			For example,</p>

			<span class="style_brown">A dialogue of this sort is intended to

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see that's

			</em>It shows how we <strong>appeal to outside people</strong> and pressures (Julie 
			and Angela) to support our position.<br />
			It shows how we <strong>back up requests </strong>and statements with reasons, e.g.,<br /><em><span class="auto-style39">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>someone's asked me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they're pretty strict at the hospital<br />

			<p>Before learners can effectively and confidently produce language, 
			it needs to be highlighted and practised.&nbsp; There are lots of 
			ways to do this, including:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Listening to and repeating parts of the dialogue, aping 
				intonation and so on.</li>
				<li>Memorising the dialogue and acting it out together.</li>
				<li>Reading the dialogue in a way that makes one or other of the 
				characters aggressive or meek.</li>
				<li>Using the dialogue as a model to construct one in a similar 
				vein on a different subject.</li>
				<li>Practising small parts of the dialogue focusing on the 
				intonation and stress on the main verb in things like<br />
				<em>
				<span class="style_brown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can <strong>see</strong> it's difficult<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I can 
				<strong>see</strong> 
				that's tempting<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I <strong>know</strong> it does.</span></em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>or any combination of these and other ways.</p>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It isn't really difficult to set up a similar situation and then 
			get the learners to do the negotiating.&nbsp; However, we must bear 
			in mind that:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li>the role relationships should be equal.</li>
				<li>the participants are not close friends.</li>
				<li>there are external pressures on both of them.&nbsp; We will 
				need to identify what those pressures are, of course.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<p><span class="style_black">You share a flat with two friends and 
			take it in turns to babysit once a week for your landlady (who 
			reduces the rent).&nbsp; There are three roles (Learners A, B and 
			C):</span></p>
			<ol class="auto-style23">
				<li>It is your turn tomorrow.&nbsp; You have a new 
				boy/girlfriend who has invited you out so you don't want to 
				babysit.&nbsp; This is important to you.</li>
				<li>You know it is A's turn and you have done the babysitting 
				for him/her twice this month already.&nbsp; You have an essay to 
				write and want the evening to yourself.</li>
				<li>You are free tomorrow evening but you want to go to the 
				cinema to see a film you have read about.&nbsp; The last night 
				of the film is tomorrow.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This will have to be a carefully monitored exercise and the 
			learners will need time to prepare it together before they act it 
			out.&nbsp; They may need quite a lot of input and help.<br />
			Then they can try again with no preparation and different partners 
			(with the same or a different scenario).&nbsp; And again, probably.&nbsp; 
			It may seem a bit dull to you to do the same thing three or four 
			times but if you change the grouping and alter the scenario, it 
			won't be for your learners.<br />
			By the way, the learners may also need a nudge to realise that they 
			can agree to appeal to the landlady and see how important 
			babysitting actually is tomorrow (see the model dialogue and the 
			agreement to appeal to Julie).</p>
