			<p>We all take on different roles in our lives (teacher, dog-walker, 
			cook, gardener, advisor, waiter etc.) and the classroom is no 
			different.<br />
			In our classrooms, however, we need to be aware of what role we 
			adopt and make sure it is appropriate to what we are doing and to 
			our aims.<br />
			This is not easy to achieve.<br />
			The main issue here is an old truism:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black"><em><strong>We cannot teach a language but 
			we can create an environment in which it can be learned.</strong></em></span></p>

			<p>We'll look at each role in the order in the table.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Assessor<br />
				<img alt="assess" height="133" src="../../images/assess200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				You can be a formal assessor (setting and marking tests and 
				homework and so on).<br />
				And you are an informal assessor all the time in the 
				classroom asking questions of your students such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does .... mean?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				What's the plural of ... ?</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who gave the money to John?<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				and asking yourself questions like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are they doing?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this material working?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Have they understood the key meanings?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Can I move on or should I repeat and explain again?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				You need to assess the learners, their progress, the materials, the lesson and yourself.<br />
				For more, see
				the guide to asking good 
				questions linked in the table of related guides at the end.<br />
				Simply listening to what your learners are saying is also an 
				assessment role, even when you are mostly interested in the 
				content rather than the form.<br />
				The assessor role can be quite intimidating for some learners 
				because they feel they are being continuously judged.&nbsp; It's 
				as well not to overdo it.</li>
				<li>Contributor<br />
				<img alt="talk" height="133" src="../../images/talk_discussion200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				There are many times when the teacher wants simply to be part of 
				the class and not in charge of the class.&nbsp; For example, you 
				may take part in a brainstorming session and your opinion may 
				not be more valuable than anyone else's.&nbsp; You are simply 
				contributing, not leading or managing.</li>
				<li>Counsellor<br />
				<img alt="counsel" height="133" src="../../images/handholding200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Knowing your learners' needs will help you to advise them and lead them to 
				effective study 
				and learning skills.&nbsp; Additionally, in this role, you may 
				have one-to-one meetings with learners to discuss their progress 
				and any concerns they have.<br />
				Pastoral care in many institutions also falls on the teachers' 
				shoulders.</li>
				<li>Diagnostician<br />
				<img alt="diagnose" height="133" src="../../images/tools_stethoscope200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This involves being able to spot, analyse and explain learners' 
				errors.&nbsp; There is a guide to 
				handling error on this site (linked at the end).<br />
				Whenever a learner makes an error, you should ask four 
				questions:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sort of error is this?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Why did it happen?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Does it need to be corrected?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I need to correct it or can the learner or a colleague 
				correct it?</em></li>
				<li>Manager<br />
				<img alt="manage" height="133" src="../../images/teacher_point200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is to do, mostly, with teacher talk and getting things like 
				instructions and repair routines efficiently and comprehensibly 
				done.&nbsp; For more, see the guide 
				to teacher talk linked at the end.<br />
				Classroom management also includes the handling of aids, the 
				arrangement of furniture and factors such as heating, lighting 
				and ventilation.</li>
				<li>Disciplinarian<br />
				<img alt="no" height="133" src="../../images/woman_no_finger200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				With younger learners in particular (but not only with younger 
				learners), telling someone off for breaking the rules or the 
				class contract is something you will have to do from time to 
				time.<br />
				Remember, however, that if everyone has signed up to a class 
				contract, it is often possible to allow the class and the 
				learners to police themselves.</li>
				<li>Facilitator<br />
				<img alt="help" height="133" src="../../images/helping_up200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Often, learners need just a little help to get started on a task 
				or to get on with it efficiently.&nbsp; Your role here is to 
				facilitate (i.e., make things a little easier) by nudging and 
				encouraging, not, necessarily, by giving them the right answer 
				(that's next).<br />
				Being a facilitator is something you can only do if 
				the tasks you set are at the right level.&nbsp;
				It's a key role and means you can support the 
				learners' efforts.</li>
				<li>Knower<br />
				<img alt="know" height="133" src="../../images/book_consult200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				There are many times when you have set a task or a question to 
				answer that you have to be the arbitrator concerning what's 
				right and what's wrong.&nbsp; Learners often expect that but 
				they also expect you to be fair and clear.<br />
				This role includes that of what is known as a more knowledgeable 
				other, someone who can provide a judicious amount of information 
				and help at exactly the right time so that learners can complete 
				tasks satisfactorily.</li>
				<li>Language resource<br />
				<img alt="water" height="133" src="../../images/water200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				You are a walking, talking grammar book and dictionary for your 
				learners.&nbsp; This is only one reason you should be something 
				of an expert in the structure of the language, its lexicon and 
				its pronunciation.<br />
				If you allow yourself to play this role too often, two bad 
				things happen:<ol class="auto-style43">
					<li>your students will not develop the ability to use other 
					resources such as grammars, style guides, dictionaries and 
					the web</li>
					<li>you will spend too much time talking rather than 
					encouraging your learners to find things out or work out 
					rules for themselves</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Monitor<br />
				<img alt="woman" height="133" src="../../images/woman_direct200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				There are times when you only need to check that people are on 
				task and doing what you want (i.e., that your instructions 
				worked).&nbsp; At other times, monitoring is part of managing but it's also part 
				of assessing because you should be actively listening to what 
				the learners are saying or seeing what they write.<br />
				Feedback is what you do with the data you have collected.</li>
				<li>Narrator<br />
				<img alt="story teller" height="133" src="../../images/man_storyteller200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				A common role for the teacher to take is that of a story teller 
				or narrator.&nbsp; We often do this when we want to introduce a 
				text, skill or language item in a clear and personal context.&nbsp; 
				Learners are very often quite interested in their teacher's 
				experiences.</li>
				<li>Relationship builder<br />
				<img alt="harvest" height="133" src="../../images/man_harvesting200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Rapport between you and the learners and between the learners is 
				an important part of creating and maintaining a positive 
				learning atmosphere.&nbsp; You have to take the lead by treating 
				everyone fairly and not allowing prejudice or exclusion to 
				occur.<br />
				Setting an example by being approachable, pleasant and inclusive 
				is just the beginning.</li>
				<li>Methodologist<br />
				<img alt="monk" height="133" src="../../images/monk200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				When you are looking at materials and considering whether they 
				will fit with your syllabus, your teaching style and your 
				learners' needs, you are assessing things methodologically.&nbsp; 
				That means knowing a bit about methodology.&nbsp; See the guide 
				linked at the end.</li>
				<li>Planner<br />
				<img alt="plan" height="133" src="../../images/plan_three200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Obviously, the teacher must be a good planner to make sure that 
				the class get what they need, in the right order and at the 
				right level.<br />
				But planning doesn't stop when teaching begins.&nbsp; No lesson 
				plan is perfect so it is important to plan as you go, looking 
				forward to the next stage and seeing if it needs changing, 
				moving, delaying or abandoning.</li>
				<li>Designer<br />
				<img alt="design" height="133" src="../../images/desktop_graphic200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				When you are making your own materials, you need to think 
				carefully about whether they are error-free and fit for their 
				purpose as well as being attractive and accessible.&nbsp; 
				There's a guide, linked at the end.</li>
				<li>Reflector<br />
				<img alt="reflect" height="133" src="../../images/reflection_tree200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Good teachers are constantly reflecting on what they have done 
				and sometimes on what they are doing right now.&nbsp; Part of 
				being a professional is being able to introspect and be honest 
				with yourself about success and failure as well as being able to 
				plan to avoid the second and enhance the first.</li>

			<p>Inexperienced teachers usually feel quite comfortable taking on a 
			narrow range or roles: planner, manager and knower, for example.<br />
			However, a good developmental process is to look at the other 
			possible roles in the list of nine and decide to take on a different 
			one each week at some point.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			
			
				
			
			
			<ol id="advantages" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li>Task type<br />
				Some tasks, such as dictation activities, re-grouping for 
				feedback and so on require you to be an active manager.&nbsp; 
				That's the appropriate role.<br />
				Other tasks, however, require other roles.&nbsp; For example, 
				when learners are writing a short text, they may need help in 
				finding the right word and then your role is knower and 
				facilitator.<br />
				Some tasks, such as extended role plays or problem-solving 
				activities may need you to act in a number of roles: 
				facilitator, knower, monitor and assessor so the ability to take 
				on these roles will be very helpful.</li>
				<li>Variety<br />
				If the teacher is always the knower and the manager, lessons can 
				become quite boring and predictable.&nbsp; Variations in the 
				teacher's role lead to variations in interactions and 
				activities.</li>
				<li>Autonomy<br />
				Learners need some independence because the teacher will not 
				always be with them.&nbsp; If the teacher's role is limited to 
				knower and assessor, learners will not develop inferencing and 
				research skills and will not develop the skill of good guessing, 
				either.</li>
				<li>Helpfulness<br />
				Simply put: the more roles you can take on, the more you can 
				help your learners.&nbsp; That's professionalism.</li>

			<p>There is little point in being able to take on a variety of roles 
			if the learners are not aware of what they are.&nbsp; Here are some 
			simple ways of showing what role you are in.&nbsp; They may appear 
			simple, of course, but it is quite surprising how often even very

			<p>There are, naturally some other possible positions and 
			arrangements of learners (see the guide to grouping, linked below, 
			for more).&nbsp; The moral of the story is clear, however, always 
			think about where you should be and what signal your position sends 
			to the learners about your role.</p>

					<h3>Voice tone</h3>

			<p>Variation in voice tone signals intention and role just as much 
			as position in the room, just less visibly.<br />
			Keeping to a single voice tone is both confusing and dull at the 
			same time so it's an area all teachers need to develop.&nbsp; The 
			following could be extended but covers the main issues:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Loud and clear</dt>
				<dd>Clearly this is in the role of management.&nbsp; Your voice 
				tone needs to be loud enough to be easily heard and crisp and 
				clear when giving instructions or managing the class.&nbsp; 
				There's no need to shout but mumbling will get you nowhere.<br />
				Some people&nbsp; find a conventionalised signal such as a hand 
				clap or a loud call of <em><strong>Right!</strong> </em>is an 
				effective way of signalling that some form of management routine 
				is on its way.<br />
				The same tone, slightly quieter, can be used when in the role of 
				assessor, correcting and suggesting and in the roles of knower 
				and language resource.</dd>
				<dt>Intimate</dt>
				<dd>Lower in volume and softer, this is the tone to adopt when 
				working with pairs or very small groups.&nbsp; It's the tone to 
				adopt when you are a facilitator and helper.<br />
				It is also often effective when you are playing disciplinarian, 
				getting quite close to the culprit and using a friendly but firm 
				tone.</dd>
				<dt>Raconteur tone</dt>
				<dd>This is what you need to work on if you aren't a natural 
				story teller.&nbsp; Your tone needs to be quite quiet so people 
				are forced to attend carefully but you must maintain clarity and 
				articulate well.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Whatever tones you adopt, the effort needs to be made to be 
			consistent and clear in your intentions.&nbsp; You do not want 
			learners thinking:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a new instructions, the last one 
			rephrased or an aside to someone else that I can ignore?</em></p>
