		<p>Trick question?<br />
		No, not really.&nbsp; The point is that any of these activities can be
		<strong>seen</strong> as a form of testing.&nbsp; You are asking 
		questions or setting tasks to find something out about the learners' 
		abilities.<br />
		We can take them one at a time:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><em>a public examination</em></dt>
	<dd>This sort of test is instantly recognisable to most of us.&nbsp; It is 
	usually a very formal procedure with strict rules for its conduct.<br />
	The obvious examples are tests such as IELTS, Cambridge First Certificate 
	(and the other levels in that suite) and so on.</dd>
			<dt><em>doing that exercise</em></dt>
			<dd>In this case, the exercise is only marginally a test because the 
			only person who will look at the result is you.&nbsp; However, in a 
			classroom, you might set a task like this to find out what people already 
			know.&nbsp; In this case is was not a test but an awareness-raising 
			activity to get you thinking.</dd>
			<dt><em>asking someone if she understands</em></dt>
			<dd>this is a kind of test but it's a pretty poor one because the 
			answer won't tell you a great deal.&nbsp; Learners from a range of 
			cultural backgrounds will normally respond positively to a question 
			like this because that's the least threatening thing to do.&nbsp; A test to avoid.</dd>
			<dt><em>using a multiple-choice exercise</em></dt>
			<dd>You may be using such an exercise as a teaching tool, to alert 
			people to the range of choices, for example.&nbsp; However, most 
			learners will see it as some kind of test and the outcomes will, 
			presumably, be evaluated in some way.&nbsp; So it's a test.</dd>
			<dt><em>saying, "Can you pronounce this word?"</em></dt>
			<dd>This is a test if you want to hear the learner pronounce it 
			rather than being satisfied with an answer like "Yes, thanks" or a 
			nod.</dd>
			<dt><em>using a role play exercise at the end of a lesson</em></dt>
			<dd>The purpose of activities like this is twofold:<br />
			a) they give the learners an opportunity to use the language in a 
			freer way and make it a bit more personal to them but<br />
			b) they also allow you to discover if they can actually use it in the 
			way you hoped.<br />
			So it's a test.</dd>
			<dt><em>asking what a word means</em></dt>
			<dd>This is clearly a test.&nbsp; You want to know if the person 
			knows the word or not.&nbsp; Be aware, however, that giving an off-the-cuff definition of a word in a foreign language is very challenging (that's what keeps 
			dictionary writers in business). &nbsp;It's perfectly possible to know all you need to know about a word and still not be able to give a neat, clear definition of it.</dd>
			<dt><em>asking a learner to tell you about yesterday</em></dt>
			<dd>This may just be a bit of social chit-chat but in a classroom, 
			many learners will assume they are being tested and their production 
			evaluated.&nbsp; Good teachers will be listening carefully to see 
			how well the learner can do this.</dd>

				<li><strong>formal testing</strong><ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>this is what public examinations are but also what 
					end-of-week or end-of-course tests usually are.</li>
					<li>formal tests are very often written</li>
					<li>formal tests are not frequent</li>
					<li>formal tests are usually quite objective (or appear so)</li>
					<li>formal tests often have a set marking scheme (two marks 
					for this, three for that etc.)</li>
					<li>the results are communicated to the learners</li>
					<li>learners recognise such tests for what they are and 
					respond accordingly, i.e., they take them seriously</li>
					<li><strong>Example:</strong> at the end of every 20-hour 
					teaching block, you construct a formal test of what you have 
					covered.&nbsp; You mark the test as objectively as you can 
					and communicate the scores to the learners.&nbsp; You can 
					also rank the learners by how well they did.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>informal testing</strong><ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>happens frequently in classrooms</li>
					<li>can be anything from a simple question to a complicated 
					role play</li>
					<li>requires the teacher and the learner to evaluate rather 
					than assess by recording marks</li>
					<li>does not rely on outcomes being given to the learners 
					although feedback is often supplied somehow</li>
					<li><strong>Example:</strong> in the middle of a lesson in 
					which you have introduced some new words in a topic area, 
					you give the learners and exercise requiring them to match 
					definitions or pictures to the words you have targeted.&nbsp; 
					This alerts both you and the learners to what needs revising 
					or revisiting and allows you to have the confidence to go on 
					to using the language in a freer and more personal way 
					(providing the learners have responded satisfactorily).</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>formative testing </strong>can be formal or informal 
				and is designed to aid the 
				learning process by<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>telling the teacher what has been learnt well so far and 
					what needs more work</li>
					<li>focusing learners on what needs to be mastered</li>
					<li>being often quite frequent and done at the beginning, in 
					the middle or at the end of lessons</li>
					<li><strong>Example: </strong>You are about to embark on a 
					lesson on using <em>if-</em>clauses such as<br />
					<em>If you get lost, call me and I'll come and get you</em><br />
					At the beginning of the lesson, you show a short video clip 
					of someone on the telephone giving directions to her house.&nbsp; 
					In it, she uses expressions such as:<br />
					<em>If you see the post-office on your left, you have gone 
					too far<br />
					If you can't see the turning, look for the sign to Margate 
					and follow that<br />
					</em>etc.<br />
					You provide a test of their comprehension by asking some 
					simple True / False questions such as<br />
					<em>The visitor should look for a sign to Ramsgate<br />
					The visitor should turn right at the post-office</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					to see how much they can understand already and evaluate 
					their ability to understand the meaning of <em>if-</em>clauses.&nbsp; 
					From what emerges, you amend the lesson plan accordingly.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>summative testing</strong> is what happens at the 
				end of a process and is designed to discover how well the 
				targets have been learned.&nbsp; Examples are:<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>a public examination</li>
					<li>an end-of-course written test</li>
					<li>a final speaking exercise in a lesson</li>
					<li>homework tasks</li>
					<li><strong>Example: </strong>you are teaching a class 
					preparing for a public examination and, at the end of the 
					first semester, you give the whole class a full mock 
					examination to do at home.<br />
					They bring in their work and you spend a few lessons going 
					through model / correct answers to the tasks so everyone can 
					see how well they did.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is, of course, not always so clear cut.&nbsp; Tests can be:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt class="style_brown"><strong>formative and formal</strong></dt>
	<dd>end-of week tests<br />
	written homework to be handed in and marked etc.</dd>
			<dt class="style_brown"><strong>summative and informal</strong></dt>
			<dd>tasks set at the end of lessons to see what progress has been 
			made<br />
			end-of-course activities which combine many aspects of what has been 
			learned / taught</dd>
			<dt class="style_brown"><strong>summative and formal</strong></dt>
			<dd>end-of-course tests<br />
			public examinations</dd>
			<dt class="style_brown"><strong>formative and informal</strong></dt>
			<dd>checking understanding (<em>Can you tell me what John said?</em>)<br />
			checking pronunciation (<em>Where's the stress on this word?</em>)<br />
			checking grammar (<em>What's the past of 'go'?</em>)</dd>
</dl>
			<p>The last of these is very frequently done because informal, 
			formative testing goes on all the time in classrooms:<br />
			whenever a teacher is asking a question and whenever a teacher is 
			listening to the learners' production or reading what they have 
			written, informal, formative testing is happening.</p>
			<p>A graphical way of seeing this is:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="testing summary" height="335" src="../../imagesgraphics/testinginitial.png" width="350" /></p>

		<p>Good informal testing is something that comes with training and 
		experience.&nbsp; It's not rocket science and one of the best ways to do 
		it is to listen carefully to your learners and ask questions which 
		target what you need to know.<br />
		There's more on this in
		<a href="checklearning.html">the guide to checking learning</a> and 
		<a href="askingquestions.html">the 
		guide to asking good questions</a>.<br />
		What follows concerns more formal, often written, testing.</p>

		<p><strong>Validity</strong></p>
		<p>This is a term you will often hear applied to testing.&nbsp; It means 
		three things:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style6">
			<li><em>Does the test measure what we say it measures?</em><br />For example, if we set out to test someone's ability to 
				participate in informal spoken transactions, do the test items 
				we use actually test that ability or something else?</li>
			<li><em>Does the test contain a relevant and representative sample 
				of what it is testing?</em><br />For example, if we are testing someone's ability to write a 
				formal email, are we getting them to deploy the sorts 
				of language they actually need to do that?</li>
			<li><em>Does the test look like a proper test?</em><br />
			You want your learners to take it seriously so presentation is 
			important.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Simple.&nbsp; Of course, we want our test to be valid so here's a 
		short guide to how to write a good test.</p>
		<p>The test can be formative (in the middle of a course or even a 
		lesson) or it can be summative (coming at the end of a course or series 
		of lessons).</p>
		<p>The process:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="making a test" height="148" src="../../imagesgraphics/makeatest.png" width="700" /></p>
		<h3>Deciding what to test, prioritising and organising</h3>
		<p>This is where good record-keeping comes in handy.&nbsp; Briefly, this 
		means</p>
		<ul class="greybulletlist">
			<li>looking back and selecting the areas you think need testing.&nbsp; 
			You won't be able to test everything (unless you have taught very 
			little) so</li>
			<li>prioritise the list to make sure you are being fair to all your 
			learners.&nbsp; They will better at some skills than at others so 
			mix it up.</li>
			<li>now break the list down into skills (reading, writing, speaking, 
			listening), grammar and structures, pronunciation and lexis</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Selecting test items and working out how to mark the test</h3>
		<p>Now you have your list, you can decide how to test the items.</p>
		<h4>Types of tests</h4>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>true or false</strong></dt>
	<dd>This called an alternate-answer test.&nbsp; You can expand it slightly 
	to include True, False and Don't know (the answer isn't in the text).<br />
	For example:<br />
	<span class="style_black">In the list above there were three factors concerned with 
	Validity:<br />
	True: O<br />
	False: O</span></dd>
			<dt><strong>multiple-choice</strong></dt>
			<dd>This is sometimes called a fixed-response test.&nbsp; Typically, 
			the correct answer must be chosen from three or four alternatives.&nbsp; 
			The 'wrong' items are called the distractors.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<span class="style_black">Choose the best answer:<br />
			Summative testing is designed mainly to:<br />
			A: help the learning process<br />
			B: plan the rest of a lesson<br />
			C: focus the learners on what they need to learn<br />
			D: find out how well something has been learnt</span></dd>
			<dt><strong>structured response</strong></dt>
			<dd>In tests of this sort, you give a structure in which 
			to form the answer.&nbsp; Skeleton sentence items of the sort 
			which require the subject to expand a sentence are tests of this sort.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<span class="style_black">Use the words here to make a correct 
			English sentence:<br />
			He / come/ my 
			house / yesterday / 9 o'clock<br />
			______________________________________________________</span><br />
			(Answer: <em>He came to my house at 9 
			o'clock yesterday</em>)</dd>
			<dt><strong>free response</strong></dt>
			<dd>In these tests, no guidance is given other than the instructions 
			(called the rubric, incidentally) and 
			the learners are free to write or say what they like.&nbsp; A hybrid 
			form of this and a structured response item is one where the subject 
			is given a list of things to include in the response.<br />
			For example (free response):<br />
			<span class="style_black">Write 200 words about a good holiday 
			experience.</span><br />
			For example (hybrid):<br />
			<span class="style_black">Write 200 words about what method of 
			transport you prefer<br />
			Say:<br />
			What it is and when you last used it<br />
			Why you like it<br />
			List three advantages<br />
			List two disadvantages<br />
			Finish with a recommendation</span></dd>

		<p>Some of those test items require more judgement by the 
		marker (usually you) than others.<br />
		The more subjective the marking is, the less reliable will be the 
		results.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<ul class="greybulletlist">
			<li>Item 1 and 2 are either right or wrong so easy to mark but 
			remember that you can get 50% by guessing in item 1, and 25% in item 
			2.&nbsp; You can also get it right even if you don't understand most 
			of the text.</li>
			<li>In item 4, would you accept <em>She didn't play so many games as 
			she wanted to</em> when what you actually wanted was <em>She doesn't 
			play as many sports as she used to</em>?&nbsp; To get round the 
			problem, you can give the learner a selection of words to choose 
			from but that makes it easier, of course.&nbsp; The same issue 
			arises with item 3.</li>
			<li>Item 5 demands most of the marker because you will have to 
			assess against a range of criteria, such as:
			<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
				<li>use of lexis</li>
				<li>accuracy of grammar</li>
				<li>content</li>
				<li>ordering</li>
				<li>use of connectors<br /></li></ul>
				etc.<br />
		That's quite difficult to do and maintain 
		fairness at the same time.</li></ul>
		<p>There are, of course, many more variants and types of test item than 
		we can cover here.&nbsp; Look at tests in coursebooks and be aware that 
		most examination boards and ELT publishers have examples of tests and 
		test types on their websites.&nbsp; Go there for more ideas.</p>
