			<h1>Checking questions</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="question" height="207" src="../../images/animals_meerkats_two310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>You may like to follow
			<a href="asking_questions.html" target="_blank">the guide to asking 
			good questions</a> (new tab) before tackling this area but no 
			assumption is made that you have done so in what follows.</p>
			<p>There are two sorts of checking questions which all teachers need 
			to use frequently:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Instruction-checking questions (also known as ICQs)<br />
				These are asked to make sure that the learners know what they 
				are supposed to be doing and to alert them to the key meaning(s) 
				of the instruction.</li>
				<li>Concept-checking questions (also known as CCQs)<br />
				These are asked for two reasons:<ol class="auto-style51">
					<li>to lead the learner to understanding a concept (which 
					may be how a tense is used, the meaning of a word or some of 
					its other characteristics and so on).</li>
					<li>to help the teacher (and the learners) decide whether 
					they have grasped a concept adequately before moving on or 
					extending the learners' knowledge and skills.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Both sorts of questions are what are called display questions insofar as the 
			questioner knows the answer and the person being asked knows that 
			the questioner knows the answer.</p>
			<p>We will take each type separately but note when there is some 
			overlap.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>

				<img alt="teacher" height="166" src="../../images/teaching_front250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style31">
				<h2>Instruction-checking questions</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>We ask instruction-setting questions for very simple reasons:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>because we do not want people wasting time not knowing what 
				to do</li>
				<li>because we have designed an activity in a certain way that 
				makes it useful and effective and that's the way it should be 
				done</li>
				<li>because we want to spend our time helping, monitoring and 
				supporting our learners, not wasting it repairing our 
				instructions or repeating them</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Simple Rule #1:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>The more complicated the instruction 
			is, the more carefully it needs to be checked.</strong></p>
			<p>If your instruction is, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp; Please start now.</span><br />
			then is hardly needs checking because you can see whether or not 
			people are doing as you ask.</p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">If, on the other hand, your instruction is:</p>
			<p class="auto-style52">Now work in pairs to match the 7 underlined 
			words in the text to the 8 definitions at the bottom of the page.&nbsp; 
			There is one definition that you don't need.&nbsp; You have five 
			minutes to do this.</p>
			<p class="auto-style53">then there is rather a lot to check.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style48"><strong>Task:<br />
					</strong>Now, what would your questions be?&nbsp; 
			Remember, you have to ask questions which will alert the learners to 
			the important things <strong>and</strong> tell you that they have understood the 
			task.<br />

			<div id="questions" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" >
			<p class="style_brown">Here are some suggestions:</p>

				<li>Will you be working alone, in pairs or in a group?</li>
				<li>Which words are you looking for?</li>
				<li>How many are there?</li>
				<li>Where are the definitions?</li>
				<li>How many definitions are there?</li>
				<li>Why are there 8 definitions and only 7 words?</li>
				<li>How long do you have?</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>That's quite a lot to remember and quite a lot to ask so we have 
			simple Rule #2:</p>
				<ul class="auto-style58">
					<li><strong><em>Write out the questions when you plan the lesson</em></strong></li>
					<li><strong><em>Make sure you distribute the questions fairly</em></strong></li>
				</ul>
				<p>You can, of course, break down the instruction and ask 
				questions as you go along.&nbsp; Like this:</p>
				<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style54">
					<tr class="style_black">
						<td class="auto-style57">YOU:</td>

						Please start now.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>The last instruction, of course, doesn't need checking 
				because it's very simple.<br />
				Notice, too, that Mary understands what a definition is (<em>meaning</em>) 
				but she didn't have the word to hand, until now.<br />
				The teacher wisely does not interrupt the checking routine to 
				dwell on the definition of <em>definition</em>.</p>

				<h3>Why?</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Concept-checking questions are important for three reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Because they are efficient and targeted.&nbsp; In day-to-day 
				life, we often ask if someone has understood and expect to get a 
				clear answer but classrooms are slightly different.&nbsp; Simple 
				asking something like:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you 
				understand?</em></span><br />
				won't work well for two reasons:<ol class="auto-style59">
					<li>The learner may honestly believe she has understood and 
					answer Yes when, in fact, she has not really grasped the 
					point at all</li>
					<li>The learner may be reluctant for personal and/or 
					cultural reasons publicly to admit ignorance or lack of 
					understanding.&nbsp; This is a face-saving issue.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Concept-checking questions are infinitely reusable because, 
				once formed, they can be used every time your encounter the same 
				concept to check.&nbsp; For example, if you want to check 
				whether a learner has understood:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is going to 
				be here later</em></span><br />
				you can ask something like:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is she here 
				now?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When is she coming?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the speaker sure she is coming?</em></span><br />
				and those questions will work for a range of other sentences 
				(although they'll need a little amendment) such as:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary is going 
				to have a holiday in France<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to see my mother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's going to rain</em></span><br />
				and so on.</li>
				<li>Designing concept-checking questions requires that you, the 
				teacher, fully understands the concept you are teaching and that 
				means being clear in your own head what the form actually means 
				in English.&nbsp; As soon as you try to construct a 
				concept-checking question it will be instantly clear to you 
				whether you have understood what you are teaching or not.</li>
			</ol>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="bent" height="133" src="../../images/pencil_bending200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style31">
				<h3>How?</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>This is how you construct good concept-checking questions.<br />
			It's a two-stage process.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="1" height="121" src="../../imagesgraphics/step_one200.png" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style31">
				<h3>Understand the concept you are teaching</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>This should go without saying but unless you have a very good 
			understanding of the concept that lies behind the language or skill 
			that you are teaching, you can't help others to understand it at 
			all.&nbsp; Worse, you may end up giving people the wrong idea about 
			something and that, in a teacher, is unforgiveable.<br />
			Here are some examples of what is meant.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="tents" height="133" src="../../images/three_tents200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style31">
				<h4>Tense forms</h4>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>No two languages are completely parallel in terms of how they 
			conceptualise and chop up time and how speakers encode their view of 
			time and the events that happen in it.<br />
			Some languages are quite close to English, but some are very 
			different indeed.<br />
			In teaching terms, then, tense forms require very careful and 
			continual concept checking.<br />
			There is a guide on this site to using time lines, linked below, to 
			which you should refer for advice about <strong><em>presenting</em></strong> 
			the concepts.<br />
			Here, however, we are concerned with how you 
			check whether the presentation has been successful.</p>
			<p>For example, you are concerned to make the conceptual difference 
			between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be on holiday in France in June this 
			year</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to have a holiday in France in 
			June this year</em><br />
			because you know that learners often use the <em>will</em> form 
			because they think of it as 'the future tense' in English (an 
			assumption, incidentally, which is quite correct), and do not use
			<em>going to</em> to refer to present intentions concerning the 
			future.<br />
			The first thing you need to get clear, then is the fact that the <em>
			going to</em> structure refers to the present because it is about an 
			intention the speaker has NOW but the <em>will</em> form refers to 
			the future because it refers only to events which lie there.<br />
			You have put both the example sentences on the board (or projected 
			them).</p>

			<p>Another area of the language in which concepts are often very 
			difficult to grasp for learners is modality and the use of and 
			meaning of modal auxiliary verbs.<br />
			There are also many guides in the section in the in-service area of 
			the site that cover the concepts and realisations of modality.&nbsp; 
			That area, too, is linked below and will help you to plan your 
			teaching of modality concepts.</p>
			<p>You are concerned to establish the difference between these two 
			example sentences:<br />
			<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John could have been there</strong></em><br />
				and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; John couldn't have been there</strong><br />
			</em>This seems simple but it isn't because:</p>
			<ol>
					<li>When we use the verb <em>could</em> in the past it 
					refers to possibility (i.e., the speaker's understanding of 
					the likelihood of something being true).<br />
					When we use the verb in the present, however, it often 
					refers to ability.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could swim well when I was a child</em><br />
					refers to ability only, but:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could ask a question</em><br />
					means either that:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able / allowed to ask a question</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may ask a question in the future</em><br />
					Here, we are concerned with the past-tense use.</li>
					<li>The expression <em>couldn't have</em> is not just the 
					negative of <em>could have</em> because it implies a very 
					different level of likelihood.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John could have been there</em><br />
					implies that the speaker is not at all sure whether John was 
					there or not.&nbsp; It is low-level certainty, therefore.&nbsp; 
					However,<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John couldn't have been there</em><br />
					strongly implies that the speaker is quite sure that John 
					was not there (because it seems impossible).&nbsp; In other 
					words, it is the opposite of<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John must have been there.</em></li>
					<li>Even in the past form, there is some ambiguity so, for 
					example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John could have left his car at my house<br />
					</em>means either:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure whether John left his 
					car at my house or not</em><br />
					which expresses my doubt about the truth of something, or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I offered to let John leave his car 
					at my house but he didn't</em><br />
					which is not to do with my perception of the truth of 
					something but to giving someone <strong>permission</strong> 
					to do something.</li>

			<p>Many words and some structures have more than one meaning or

			questions on the context and function you want your learners to 
			grasp.<br />
			That means editing what you know down to what is manageable.</p>
			<p>Here's an example, using five lexemes as part of the targets for

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>operation</em> (n.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>recover</em>( vb.)</span><br />
			All the words appear in a text about someone's recent experience of 
			being very ill and the general meaning is probably clear from 
			context and co-text.</p>

			<p>Here are some ideas for how to elicit and check understanding of 
			lexis.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The word <em>nurse</em> is both a noun and, by what is 
				called conversion, can be used as a verb.&nbsp; So:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does a 
				nurse wear at work?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you use the word for men and women?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word is a noun in the first paragraph but what is it 
				doing in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em><strong>They nursed me 
				really carefully</strong></em><strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who can nurse someone?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can a car nurse someone?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you nurse a plant?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I say:<br />
				</strong>&nbsp;<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				She nursed in 1960?</strong></em><strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not?</strong></span></li>
				<li>The word <em>specialist</em> is a noun for people only even 
				though other things can be specialised.&nbsp; The suffix -<em>ist</em> 
				is used mostly for what people do, people's political views or 
				the instruments that people play.&nbsp; The suffix does not 
				usually affect the stressed syllable.<br />
				<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 
				text, what sort of specialist is the man talking about?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is his specialism?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the stress on the word?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the stress on </strong><em><strong>special</strong></em>?<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about these words?&nbsp; Where is the stress on: <em>
				bicycle / bicyclist, monarch / monarchist, feminine / feminist, 
				material / materialist, traditional / traditionalist</em>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a special cat.&nbsp; Is my cat a specialist?</strong></span></li>
				<li>The word <em>operate</em> is a verb but it is intransitive 
				(unlike <em>nurse</em> which is always transitive).&nbsp; It has 
				a dependent preposition, <em>on</em>.&nbsp; We are not concerned 
				here with the word's general meaning (<em>function</em>) but 
				with its meaning in this context (<em>perform surgery</em>).&nbsp; 
				We do, however, need to focus the learners on the word grammar 
				and pronunciation.<br />
				<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He operated me</em>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do I say?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the preposition?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the stress?<br />
				What is the noun from this verb?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the stress on the noun?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about these.&nbsp; Where is the stress on: <em>identify 
				/ identification, hospitalize / hospitalization, specify / 
				specification</em>?</strong></span></li>
				<li>The word recover is a verb but it is intransitive.&nbsp; It 
				has the dependent proposition <em>from</em>.<br />
				<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He recovered the 
				illness</em>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do I say?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the preposition?<br />
				Is the verb <em>recover</em> more like the verb <em>operate</em> 
				or the verb <em>nurse</em>?&nbsp; Think about the object and the 
				preposition.</strong></span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>You see how it works.&nbsp; The focus is maintained on the words 
			as they are used in the text and the attempt is to extend the learners' knowledge and 
			allow them to make associations with other words they know and, we 
			hope, see the patterns.<br />
			In the trade, we are encouraging <strong>noticing</strong>.&nbsp; 
			There's a guide to that, linked below.</p>

			<p>Using good checking questions is not as difficult as learning to 
			play the cello but, like that skill, it comes with practice and gets 
			easier.<br />
			If you are at the beginning of your career, then you would be well 
			advised to write out your check questions with your lesson plan.&nbsp; 
			The plus side to that is that you can refine them based on the 
			experience of using them and then use them again and again for the 
			same or similar concepts.<br />
			Pretty soon, concept- and instruction-checking questions become 
			second nature and you'll wonder what the fuss was about.</p>
