		<p>Trick question?<br />
		No, not really.&nbsp; The point is that any of these activities can be
		<strong>seen</strong> as a form of testing.&nbsp; You are asking 
		questions or setting tasks to find something out about the learners' 
		abilities.<br />
		We can take them one at a time:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt><em>a public examination</em></dt>
	<dd>This sort of test is instantly recognisable to most of us.&nbsp; It is 
	usually a very formal procedure with strict rules for its conduct.<br />
	The obvious examples are tests such as IELTS, Cambridge First Certificate 
	(and the other levels in that suite) and so on.</dd>
			<dt><em>doing that exercise</em></dt>
			<dd>In this case, the exercise is only marginally a test because the 
			only person who will look at the result is you.&nbsp; However, in a 
			classroom, you might set a task like this to find out what people already 
			know.&nbsp; In this case is was not a test but an awareness-raising 
			activity to get you thinking.</dd>
			<dt><em>asking someone if she understands</em></dt>
			<dd>this is a kind of test but it's a pretty poor one because the 
			answer won't tell you a great deal.&nbsp; Learners from a range of 
			cultural backgrounds will normally respond positively to a question 
			like this because that's the least threatening thing to do.&nbsp; A test to avoid.</dd>
			<dt><em>using a multiple-choice exercise</em></dt>
			<dd>You may be using such an exercise as a teaching tool, to alert 
			people to the range of choices, for example.&nbsp; However, most 
			learners will see it as some kind of test and the outcomes will, 
			presumably, be evaluated in some way.&nbsp; So it's a test.</dd>
			<dt><em>saying, "Can you pronounce this word?"</em></dt>
			<dd>This is a test if you want to hear the learner pronounce it 
			rather than being satisfied with an answer like "Yes, thanks" or a 
			nod.</dd>
			<dt><em>using a role play exercise at the end of a lesson</em></dt>
			<dd>The purpose of activities like this is twofold:<ol class="auto-style6">
			<li>they give the learners an opportunity to use the language in a 
			freer way and make it a bit more personal to them<br />
			but</li>
			<li>they also allow you to discover if they can actually use it in 
			the way you hoped.</li>
		</ol>
			So it's a test.</dd>
			<dt><em>asking what a word means</em></dt>
			<dd>This is clearly a test.&nbsp; You want to know if the person 
			knows the word or not.&nbsp; Be aware, however, that giving an off-the-cuff definition of a word in a foreign language is very challenging (that's what keeps 
			dictionary writers in business). &nbsp;It's perfectly possible to know all you need to know about a word and still not be able to give a neat, clear definition of it.</dd>
			<dt><em>asking a learner to tell you about yesterday</em></dt>
			<dd>This may just be a bit of social chit-chat but in a classroom, 
			many learners will assume they are being tested and their production 
			evaluated.&nbsp; Good teachers will be listening carefully to see 
			how well the learner can do this.</dd>

		<p>If almost everything we do can be seen as some sort of test, what are

				<li><strong>formal testing<br />
				<img alt="style" height="133" src="../../images/style_smart200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</strong>this is what public examinations are but also what 
					end-of-week or end-of-course tests usually are.&nbsp; They 
				have these characteristics:<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>formal tests are very often written</li>
					<li>formal tests are not frequent</li>
					<li>formal tests are usually quite objective (or appear so)</li>
					<li>formal tests often have a set marking scheme (two marks 
					for this, three for that etc.)</li>
					<li>the results are communicated to the learners</li>
					<li>learners recognise such tests for what they are and 
					respond accordingly, i.e., they take them seriously</li>
				</ol><strong>Example:</strong> at the end of every 20-hour 
					teaching block, you construct a formal test of what you have 
					covered.&nbsp; You mark the test as objectively as you can 
					and communicate the scores to the learners.&nbsp; You can 
					also rank the learners by how well they did.</li>
				<li><strong>informal testing<br />
				<img alt="listen" height="133" src="../../images/teaching_elicit200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</strong>happens frequently in classrooms and informal tests 
				have the following characteristics:<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>they can be anything from a simple question to a complicated 
					role play</li>
					<li>they require the teacher and the learner to evaluate rather 
					than assess by recording marks</li>
					<li>they do not rely on outcomes being given to the learners 
					although feedback is often supplied somehow</li>
				</ol><strong>Example:</strong> in the middle of a lesson in 
					which you have introduced some new words in a topic area, 
					you give the learners an exercise requiring them to match 
					definitions or pictures to the words you have targeted.&nbsp; 
					This alerts both you and the learners to what needs revising 
					or revisiting and allows you to have the confidence to go on 
					to using the language in a freer and more personal way 
					(providing the learners have responded satisfactorily).</li>
				<li><strong>formative testing<br />
				<img alt="form" height="133" src="../../images/form_pottery_a200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</strong>can be formal or informal 
				and is designed to aid the 
				learning process by:<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>telling the teacher what has been learnt well so far and 
					what needs more work</li>
					<li>focusing learners on what needs to be mastered</li>
					<li>being often quite frequent and done at the beginning, in 
					the middle or at the end of lessons or a series of lessons</li>
				</ol><strong>Example: </strong>You are about to embark on a 
					lesson on using <em>if-</em>clauses such as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you get lost, call me and I'll come and get you</em><br />
					At the beginning of the lesson, you show a short video clip 
					of someone on the telephone giving directions to her house.&nbsp; 
					In it, she uses expressions such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you see the post-office on your left, you have gone 
					too far<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					If you can't see the turning, look for the sign to Margate 
					and follow that<br />
					</em>etc.<br />
					You provide a test of their comprehension by asking some 
					simple True / False questions such as<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The visitor should look for a sign to Ramsgate<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The visitor should turn right at the post-office</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					to see how much they can understand already and evaluate 
					their ability to understand the meaning of <em>if-</em>clauses.&nbsp; 
					From what emerges, you amend the lesson plan accordingly.</li>
				<li><strong>summative testing<br />
				<img alt="abacus" height="133" src="../../images/abacus_beads200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</strong>is what happens at the 
				end of a process and is designed to discover, for you and the 
				learners, how well the 
				targets have been learned.&nbsp; Examples are:<ol class="auto-style6">
					<li>a public examination</li>
					<li>an end-of-course written test</li>
					<li>a final speaking exercise in a lesson</li>
					<li>homework tasks</li>
				</ol><strong>Example: </strong>you are teaching a class 
					preparing for a public examination and, at the end of the 
					first semester, you give the whole class a full mock 
					examination to do at home.<br />
					They bring in their work and you spend a few lessons going 
					through model / correct answers to the tasks so everyone can 
					see how well they did and, even more importantly, how well 
				they are prepared for the real thing.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is, of course, not always so clear cut.&nbsp; Tests can be:</p>
		<dl>
	<dt class="style_brown"><strong>formative and formal</strong></dt>
	<dd>end-of week tests<br />
	written homework to be handed in and marked etc.</dd>
			<dt class="style_brown"><strong>summative and informal</strong></dt>
			<dd>tasks set at the end of lessons to see what progress has been 
			made<br />
			end-of-course activities which combine many aspects of what has been 
			learned / taught</dd>
			<dt class="style_brown"><strong>summative and formal</strong></dt>
			<dd>end-of-course tests<br />
			public examinations</dd>
			<dt class="style_brown"><strong>formative and informal</strong></dt>
			<dd>checking understanding (<em>Can you tell me what John said?</em>)<br />
			checking pronunciation (<em>Where's the stress on this word?</em>)<br />
			checking grammar (<em>What's the past of 'go'?</em>)</dd>
</dl>
			<p>The last of these is very frequently done because informal, 
			formative testing goes on all the time in classrooms:<br />
			whenever a teacher is asking a question and whenever a teacher is 
			listening to the learners' production or reading what they have 
			written, informal, formative testing is happening.</p>
			<p>A graphical way of seeing this is like this.&nbsp; You can see 
			that both formative and summative testing can be either formal or 
			informal.<br />

		<p>Good informal testing is something that comes with training and 
		experience.&nbsp; It's not rocket science and one of the best ways to do 
		it is to listen carefully to your learners and ask questions which 
		target what you need to know.<br />
		For example, simply asking:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you understand the word
		<span class="styleblackbold">industrialised</span></em>?<em><br />
		</em>is going to elicit some information (often what the learners thinks 
		you want to hear) but it will need some expansion along the lines of:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can a person or an animal be industrialised?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can a country or a city be industrialised?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a verb or an adjective?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the noun?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Greenland an industrialised country?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about Britain?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What places in your country are industrialised?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you say that?</em><br />
		and so on.<br />
		There's more on this in
		the guide to checking learning and 
		the 
		guide to asking good questions, both linked below.</p>
			<p>What follows concerns more formal, often written, testing.<br />
			Although it is unlikely that you will be asked to design a very 
			formal examination for your learners, teachers are often required 
			(or want) to design a test which will either be summative and tell 
			you and the learners how well the course has helped them to learn or 
			formative which will tell you and the learners what has to be 
			recycled and developed.<br />
			It is in this area that some knowledge of the principles of 
			constructing a good test is helpful.</p>

		<p><strong>Validity</strong></p>
		<p>This is a term you will often hear applied to testing.&nbsp; It means 
		three things:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style6">
			<li><em>Does the test measure what we say it measures?</em><br />For example, if we set out to test someone's ability to 
				participate in informal spoken transactions, do the test items 
				we use actually test that ability or something else?</li>
			<li><em>Does the test contain a relevant and representative sample 
				of what it is testing?</em><br />For example, if we are testing someone's ability to write a 
				formal email, are we getting them to deploy the sorts 
				of language they actually need to do that?</li>
			<li><em>Does the test look like a proper test?</em><br />
			You want your learners to take it seriously so presentation is 
			important.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Simple.&nbsp; Of course, we want our test to be valid so here's a 
		short guide to how to write a good test.</p>
		<p>The test can be formative (in the middle of a course or even a 
		lesson) or it can be summative (coming at the end of a course or series 
		of lessons).</p>
		<p>The process:</p>

					<h3>Deciding what to test: prioritising and organising</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>This is where good record-keeping comes in handy.&nbsp; Briefly, this 
		means</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>looking back and selecting the areas you think need testing.&nbsp; 
			You won't be able to test everything (unless you have taught very 
			little) so</li>
			<li>prioritise the list to make sure you are being fair to all your 
			learners.&nbsp; They will better at some skills than at others so 
			mix it up.</li>
			<li>now break the list down into skills (reading, writing, speaking, 
			listening), grammar and structures, pronunciation and lexis</li>

					<h3>Selecting test items and working out how to mark the test</h3>

		<p>Now you have your list, you can decide how to test the items.</p>
		<h4>Types of tests</h4>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>true or false</strong></dt>
	<dd>This called an alternate-answer test.&nbsp; You can expand it slightly 
	to include True, False and Don't know (the answer isn't in the text).<br />
	For example:<br />
	<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the list above there were three factors concerned with 
	Validity:<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	True: O<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	False: O</span></dd>
			<dt><strong>multiple-choice</strong></dt>
			<dd>This is sometimes called a fixed-response test.&nbsp; Typically, 
			the correct answer must be chosen from three or four alternatives.&nbsp; 
			The 'wrong' items are called the distractors.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose the best answer:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Summative testing is designed mainly to:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			A: help the learning process<br />

			<dt><strong>structured response</strong></dt>
			<dd>In tests of this sort, you give a structure in which 
			to form the answer.&nbsp; Skeleton sentence items of the sort 
			which require the subject to expand a sentence are tests of this sort.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the words here to make a correct 
			English sentence:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			He / come/ my 
			house / yesterday / 9 o'clock<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			______________________________________________________</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			(Answer: <em>He came to my house at 9 
			o'clock yesterday</em>&nbsp; Yes, we had to move the time phrases 
			around.)</dd>
			<dt><strong>free response</strong></dt>
			<dd>In these tests, no guidance is given other than the instructions 
			(called the rubric, incidentally) and 
			the learners are free to write or say what they like.&nbsp; A hybrid 
			form of this and a structured response item is one where the subject 
			is given a list of things to include in the response.<br />
			For example (free response):<br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write 200 words about a good holiday 
			experience.</span><br />
			For example (hybrid):<br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write 200 words about what method of 
			transport you prefer<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Say:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			What it is and when you last used it<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Why you like it<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			List three advantages<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			List two disadvantages<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Finish with a recommendation</span><br />
			These sorts of tests can also be done orally.<br />
			For example (free response):<br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me about the last 
			film your saw.</span><br />
			For example (hybrid):<br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask your partner about 
			his last holiday and find out:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where he went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who he went with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what he enjoyed the most and the 
			least</span></dd>

		<p>Some of those test items require more judgement by the 
		marker (usually you) than others.<br />
		The more subjective the marking is, the less reliable will be the 
		results.&nbsp; For example:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>Item 1 and 2 are either right or wrong so easy to mark but 
			remember that you can get 50% by guessing in item 1, and 25% in item 
			2.&nbsp; You can also get it right even if you don't understand most 
			of the text.</li>
			<li>In item 4, would you accept <em>She didn't play so many games as 
			she wanted to</em> when what you actually wanted was <em>She doesn't 
			play as many sports as she used to</em>?&nbsp; To get round the 
			problem, you can give the learner a selection of words to choose 
			from but that makes it easier, of course.&nbsp; The same issue 
			arises with item 3.</li>
			<li>Item 5 demands most of the marker because you will have to 
			assess against a range of criteria, such as:
			<ul class="smallgreybullet">
				<li>use of lexis</li>
				<li>accuracy of grammar</li>
				<li>content</li>
				<li>ordering</li>
				<li>use of connectors<br /></li></ul>
				etc.<br />
		That's quite difficult to do and maintain 
		fairness at the same time.</li></ul>
		<p>There are, of course, many more variants and types of test item than 
		we can cover here.&nbsp; Look at tests in coursebooks and be aware that 
		most examination boards and ELT publishers have examples of tests and 
		test types on their websites.&nbsp; Go there for more ideas.</p>
