		Correcting learners is a key teaching skill.&nbsp; It can 
		be overdone and some learners feel it gets tedious so handle with some 
		care.<br />
		In this guide, we are mostly concerned with correcting learners' production.&nbsp; 
		However, if you have followed the guide to the essentials of error 
		analysis (linked below), you will know that learners also make receptive errors.&nbsp; 
		That is to say, they misunderstand or misinterpret what they hear or 
		read.<br />
		The following assumes you have followed the essential guide to error and 
		understand terms such as referential, covert, phonological and 
		syntactical error etc.<br />
		If you don't try that guide first by
		<a href="error_essentials.html" target="_blank">opening it in a new tab</a>.</p>

		<p>Here is where teachers need to think on their feet.&nbsp; There are 
		questions to ask whenever you hear an error in the classroom or see one 
		in your learners' written work.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Am I going to correct this?</strong></dt>
			<dd>If the error isn't holding up communication and has nothing to 
			do with the subject of the lesson, it may be that correcting it will 
			lead you off on a tangent, chasing red herrings and serve to slow 
			down the lesson and confuse the learners.&nbsp; If that's the case 
			ignore it.<br />
			If, on the other hand, the error is impeding comprehension or is 
			made in the language that is the target of what you are doing, then 
			you will have to deal with it.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Do <em>I</em> need to correct this?</strong></dt>
			<dd>Very often, learners can correct their own production so a 
			quizzical look or stopping learners and getting them to 
			retrace their steps and reconsider may be more effective than your correcting the 
			error.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Can anyone else correct the error?</strong></dt>
			<dd>If the learners can't correct their own errors, perhaps someone 
			else in the class can. &nbsp;If you think this is the case, give them the 
			chance to do so.</dd>
			<dt><strong>How will I correct?</strong></dt>
			<dd>A last resort is normally to give 
			the correct answer yourself.<br />
			How we correct is next.</dd>

					<img alt="ooops" height="166" src="../../images/woman_surprised250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Handling spoken error</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We said above that correction is a key teaching skill and, like 
			all skills, it improves with practice.&nbsp; There are, however, 
			some tried and trusted methods which we can learn outside the 
			classroom and then apply with increasing levels of confidence and 
			appropriateness.<br />
			Here are some of them:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="clues" height="133" src="../../images/woman_mechanic200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Looking for clues</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It is often enough just to give a few clues or hints to lead the 
			learner to the correct answer.&nbsp; This is especially the case if 
			you suspect that the learner can self-correct or be led carefully to 
			do so with questions and suggestions such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's 
			something wrong with the order of the words.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What preposition do 
			we need here?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What tense should this be?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who did the work?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we talking about 
			tomorrow or today?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a long 'a' sound or a short one?</em><br />
			and so on.<br />
			If all else fails, however, there are, obviously, times when  
			providing the right answer is the best approach <strong>providing</strong> you make 
			sure that the learner can produce the correct language independently 
			after you have done so.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="grimace" height="133" src="../../images/woman_grimace200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Grimacing</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This only applies to times when you know for certain that 
				the learner can self correct.&nbsp; If you use the technique at 
				other times, for example, when the learners clearly have no idea 
				what the right word is, how to pronounce something or how to 
				form a correct bit of syntax, then you will frustrate and 
				irritate them.&nbsp; That's not good.<br />For example:</p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td><em>
					<img alt="hmm" height="133" src="../../images/man_sceptical_colourful200.jpg" width="200" /></em></td>
					<td><em>
					<img alt="shocked" height="133" src="../../images/man_shocked200.jpg" width="200" /></em></td>
					<td class="auto-style29" rowspan="2"><em>or </em></td>
					<td><em>
					<img alt="ouch" height="133" src="../../images/man_ouch200.jpg" width="200" /></em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="style_black">
					<td class="auto-style30"><em>Probably not</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style30"><em>What!</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style30"><em>Ouch</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<br />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
			<img alt="fingers" height="133" src="../../images/fingers_statue200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Finger correction</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is a technique which works very well for simple syntactical 
			errors such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We arrived to the hotel very late in the 
			evening<br />
			</em>in which the learner has not recognised that, in English, the 
			verb <em>arrive</em> is usually followed by a prepositional phrase 
			with<em> at</em>.&nbsp; This is an understandable mistake 
			because we do say:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came to my house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got to the station<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			The technique involves using the fingers to count and stopping and 
			grabbing the third finger with the other hand.<br />
			The learner is then primed to notice where the error lies rather 
			than starting to doubt that the whole sentence is wrong (which it 
			isn't).</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="drill" height="133" src="../../images/drilling_soldiers200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Phonological error: drilling and other techniques</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Phonological errors are traditionally addressed by some sort of 
			mini-drill and there's a guide to drilling on this site, linked 
			below.<br />
			A particularly useful technique, explained there is called back 
			chaining.<br />
			Other techniques include tapping out the rhythm of a 
			sentence to get the stress right or using the phonemic script (if 
			the learners are familiar with it) to show the difference between, 
			e.g., <em>sit </em>and <em>seat</em> or <em>hop</em> and <em>hope</em> (/sɪt/ 
			and /siːt/ or /hɒp/ and /həʊp/).<br />
			Rhymes are also useful tools because if a learner can pronounce, 
			e.g., <em>station</em> then the fact that a difficult word such as
			<em>nationalisation</em> rhymes is some help to being able to 
			pronounce it.<br />
			Isolating sounds is another way to help.&nbsp; If, for example, a 
			learner can correctly pronounce the short <em>i</em> sound in <em>
			hit, bit, sit</em> etc. you can lead her to the pronunciation of the 
			second syllable in <em>contribution</em> quite painlessly.</p>

					<h3>Using time lines</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>When it is clear that the concept of a tense form is in question 
			and learners have not grasped, especially, the relationship between 
			tenses, a time line can help (with presentation as well as 
			correction, of course.<br />
			Here's an example to explain the concept of what is known as the 
			future in the past:<br />
			<img alt="time line example" height="165" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line_future_in_past2.png" width="465" /><br />
			And that will work just as well for:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about to go out when he rang<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I She was on the point of losing her temper<br />
			</em>and so on.<br />
			There is a dedicated guide on this site to constructing and using 
			time lines, linked below.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="postit" height="133" src="../../images/note_postit200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Noticing and using the model</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>When teaching a syntactical or structural point, most people will 
			opt for a model sentence or sentences which will exemplify the 
			issues.&nbsp; For example, when teaching simple time adjuncts, 
			people might got for displaying and explaining:</p>
			<p class="auto-style31"><em>He lived here during his studies<br />
			She left an hour ago<br />
			I have been here since 1998</em></p>
			<p>However, leaving it at that is not adequate if you want the 
			learners to notice the critical issues a syntactical error is likely 
			to arise unless you revisit the board and have something like:</p>
			<p class="auto-style31"><em>He lived here </em>
			<span class="style_underline"><em><strong>during</strong></em></span><em> 
			his studies<br />
			She left an hour </em><span class="style_underline"><strong><em>ago</em></strong></span><br /><em>I have been here </em><span class="style_underline"><strong><em>
			since</em></strong></span><em> 1998</em></p>
			<p>and even then you will need to expand that to something like:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="grid" height="199" src="../../imagesgraphics/correction_grid.png" width="310" />&nbsp;</p>
			
			<p>and with that in front of your learners, you can easily point 
			out:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the correct tense form (past simple vs. present perfect)</li>
				<li>the prepositions (<em>during</em> and <em>since</em>)</li>
				<li>the postposition (<em>ago</em>)</li>
				<li>the appropriate form of time expression (events, periods, 
				dates)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>so, when they make a mistake, you can quickly point out which bit 
			of the table they have got wrong.</p>
			<p>This technique relies on getting learners to notice the salient 
			features of the language.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="2" height="133" src="../../images/birds_two_gulls200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Echoing</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is more than simply repeating what a learner has just said 
			(which is useless and deeply irritating, by the way).<br />
			Echo correction means taking the learner's statement and stressing 
			the bit that you want to focus on.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said you <span class="style_underline">
			<strong>SEE</strong></span> him yesterday?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				There were three <span class="style_underline"><strong>CHILD</strong></span>?</em></p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="cast" height="133" src="../../images/net_cast200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Recasting</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is a subtler way to correct and requires the learner to be 
			paying some attention because the aim is to get the learner to 
			notice the gap, not just the structure as we saw above under the 
			model.<br />
			Again, you have to make sure they can do that by stressing the 
			feature in your production which differs from what has been 
			produced.<br />
			For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learner: <em>I will taking the train.</em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Teacher: <em>Oh, you will <span class="style_underline"><strong>
			BE TAKING</strong></span> the train.<br />
			</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learner: I should to go.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Teacher: Oh, you should <span class="style_underline"><strong>GO</strong></span>.</em></p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="late" height="133" src="../../images/man_hurry200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Delayed correction</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Correction, especially if badly times, can be interruptive and 
			frustrate learners who are trying to get on and communicate 
			something important.<br />
			So, during communicative activities, unless the error is very 
			serious (an preventing communication), keep quiet and take notes.&nbsp; 
			Then, when you reach the end of the activity, you can call 
			everyone's attention to the errors and see if they can self-correct.<br />
			If they can't, you need to backtrack, of course, because something 
			has gone very wrong with the teaching and learning procedure.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<h2>Handling written error</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>One of a teacher's many chores is correcting learners' written 
			work.&nbsp; It may be a chore but learners appreciate the guidance 
			and help you can give when not under pressure in the classroom.<br />
			The same considerations apply here in many cases.&nbsp; It is not 
		very motivating to receive a piece of homework covered with lots of red 
		marks, crossings out and rewritten sections.&nbsp; So, try:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="write" height="133" src="../../images/write_plan200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Encouraging self-correction</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Instead of correcting errors in written work, we can simply 
			underline them and get the learner to proofread the text and try to 
			correct as many as they can.<br />
			This is a rather hit-and-miss procedure, however, because learners 
			are often not aware of what to look for so, to help them, develop a correction code like:<br />
			<img alt="code" height="77" src="../../imagesgraphics/correction_code.png" width="465" /><br />
			It doesn't matter too much what sorts of code symbols and letters 
			you use, providing only that you are consistent and the learners 
			understand it.<br />
			You should also, of course, have a code for something which is good.<br />
			Many people use of
				<img alt="tick" height="14" src="../../../gfx/tick_green16.png" width="16" /> 
				for that.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Working together and peer correction</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We can encouraging peer-correction by having learners write 
			together (with all of them writing the same text or agreeing on the 
			right answers) and helping each other.&nbsp; We can also ask the learners to give their writing to others for 
				comments and correction.<br />
			Do not overdo this for the sake of authenticity.&nbsp; Writing is 
			often a skill that we practise alone.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<img alt="owl" height="133" src="../../images/birds_owl200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>Wisely ignoring error</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Just as we saw concerning spoken error in the classroom, it is 
			often wise to ignore some written errors.<br />
			This is especially true if learners attempt language so far beyond 
			their current mastery level that correcting it would be confusing 
			and frustrating.<br />
			It is also true if you see something which is obviously just a slip 
			or a typographical error.</p>
