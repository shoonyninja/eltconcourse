			Here, we are concerned with the kinds of overall approaches which it

			used to refer to any piece of language above the level of a 
			sentence, whether it is read, heard, written or spoken.)</p>

					<h2>
					Why teach skills at all?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This is a deceptively good question.<br />
			Language skills are not like bricklaying or pottery which are skills 
			to be acquired by imitation, instruction and practice because in 
			most cases, unless we are teaching young children, we can assume 
			that our learners are already able in their own first language(s) to listen for gist, to read for 
			specific information, to talk to people to get things done or oil 
			social wheels and write both formally and informally for a variety 
			of reasons.<br />
			Most people, however, can't build a straight wall or make a teapot 
			so the skill of doing so has to be taught if they have ambitions to 
			be able to.<br />
			None of those sorts of assumptions can be made about learning 
			pronunciation, lexis and structure because we know that these are 
			not abilities that our learners already have.&nbsp; That is why they 
			are in our classrooms in the first place.</p>
			<p>If it is true that nearly all learners are literate in their own 
			languages, able to extract data from the written word and able to 
			put their thoughts in writing as well as being able to hold down and 
			carry on a conversation and listen to and watch a news story on the 
			television, all that arguable needs to happen is that they apply the 
			skills they already have to working with texts in English.<br />
			All that requires, the theory goes, is the transfer of strategies 
			and tactics from first-language use to subsequent-language 
			acquisition and learning.<br />
			So, logically, we do not need to teach skills, we need simply to give 
			learners the opportunity to use knowledge of English lexis, 
			phonology and grammar to understand and produce various kinds of 
			texts.</p>
			<p>There is, naturally, another school of thought that rejects this 
			view.&nbsp; People in that camp will argue that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Skills in accessing and producing texts are not 
				automatically transferred from first-language use to 
				second-language learning so people have to be explicitly taught 
				to apply them in English.</li>
				<li>All languages have unique aspects of generic, structural and 
				phonological phenomena which make the simple transfer of skills 
				impossible without explicit instruction.</li>
				<li>Skills and language knowledge are not separable.&nbsp; Part 
				of knowing, for example, how to speak politely, how to write 
				assertively, how to listen intensively and how to read 
				efficiently is knowing how to apply formal knowledge of the 
				language systems in the handling of texts.&nbsp; That is a 
				language-specific skill and not a generic skill that all 
				learners already possess.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is no attempt here to take sides in this argument but what 
			follows assumes that you have at least one foot in the second camp 
			and can see a rational need to focus some of your teaching on skills 
			rather than on systems.</p>

			<p>The usual way of classifying skills is like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="skills" height="183" src="../../imagesgraphics/skills310.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>and that is neat and memorable but flawed for two reasons.</p>
			<p>Firstly, it hides the interconnected nature of the skills, 
			suggesting that they are either receptive
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>or</strong></span> productive 
			and independently used.<br />
			That is not, in fact, how language is used in the real world, most 
			of the time.<br />
			Only the two written skills (reading and writing) are employed 
			independently and then not always by any means.&nbsp; The aural / 
			oral skills (listening and speaking) are almost never deployed 
			independently of each other, unless one is praying alone or 
			listening without responding to something like a radio programme, an 
			announcement or a lecture.<br />
			Sometimes the skills are employed simultaneously.&nbsp; For example, 
			in most natural conversations, we listen and speak not in discrete 
			sections but virtually simultaneously and we often read while 
			listening to something else and most children can write a homework 
			task and watch television or play a video game at the same time.<br />
			At other times the skills are employed consecutively.&nbsp; We may, 
			for example, read an email and then write a response, hear a lecture 
			and later write up our notes, write a poem and read it aloud, ask a 
			question and listen to the response, read a newspaper article and 
			then discuss it with or explain it to another person.&nbsp; We may 
			read something of interest and summarise it in writing in a 
			communication of some sort and so on and on.</p>
			<p>The second reason that the diagram is flawed is that these four 
			skills are not by any means the only communicative skills humans 
			possess.&nbsp; We also have the ability to read another person's 
			body language and facial expressions and we can communicate our own 
			thoughts and feelings, sometimes very exactly without recourse to 
			language at all.<br />
			We are able to draw inferences from pictures, the visual layout of 
			texts, real-life events around us, diagrams, numbers, graphics, 
			people's clothes, their physical positions, their activities, job 
			titles and much more.<br />
			These are all communicative skills and not trivial ones either but 
			few have seriously suggested that these skills need to be taught 
			in the language classroom.&nbsp; That's not the point &ndash; there 
			may be no need to <strong>teach</strong> such universal (albeit often culturally 
			determined) skills but that does not mean we shouldn't or can't 
			<strong>exploit</strong> them.<br />
			Above all, of course, we have the skills of thinking and feeling.</p>

					Purposes</h2>
					</td>

			</table>
			<p>Everything happens for a reason and skills are no exception.<br />
			We do not just sit down and write.&nbsp; We write to communicate 
			something if only to ourselves.<br />
			We do not just listen.&nbsp; We listen to find something out, to be 
			entertained, to show sympathy and rapport and for a host of other 
			reasons.<br />
			We do not, unless we are very young or quite eccentric, just speak.&nbsp; 
			We speak to get things done, to show solidarity, to pass the time of 
			day or to maintain our relationships and a bunch of other reasons.<br />
			We do not simply read.&nbsp; We read something we have selected, or 
			which has been selected for us, for a purpose.&nbsp; That may be to 
			learn something or it may be purely for entertainment.&nbsp; It may 
			even be to practise our English-language reading skills and learn 
			some new words.</p>
			<p>The teaching of skills, therefore, has to begin with the 
			identification of a reason for using the skill.&nbsp; Without that, 
			the endeavour fails before it starts because humans will respond 
			very badly if they respond at all to being asked to use a skill 
			without being given or developing for themselves a reason for using 
			it.</p>
			<p>Like the car above, real texts are not designed as vehicles for presenting 
			language (although that is too often how they are used) but 
			phenomena in themselves which have purposes and are produced for 
			reasons which are, if not transparent, discernible with some 
			thought.<br />
			You know why this guide has been written and you know why you are 
			reading it.&nbsp; Those purposes may not, by the way, be the same 
			ones as the author intended because we all bring our own needs and 
			desires to what we do.</p>

			Examples may help.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Example 1: listening for a purpose<br />
				<img alt="listen" height="133" src="../../images/listen_intensive200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>If I am listening to find out which platform my train leaves 
				from, I will listen very differently from the way I listen to my 
				friend's story about how she lost her boyfriend.<br />
				In the first case, I simply monitor until I hear my destination 
				and then I listen very hard indeed to get the vital piece of 
				information I want.&nbsp; I will dismiss anything else I hear 
				and simply switch off.&nbsp; I will listen in silence and try to 
				cut out extraneous noises.<br />
				In the second case, I will listen quite carefully because I know 
				I am expected to provide some sort of ongoing feedback along the 
				lines of:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh dear</em><br />
				or whatever.&nbsp; I also know that I will be expected to have 
				understood all the important facts because there will be a test 
				later to see how much I can remember when I am asked for a 
				reaction.&nbsp; I will provide one, of course, because I know 
				that's expected and both I and my friend may listen and speak 
				simultaneously.</dd>
				<dt>Example 2: speaking for a purpose<br />
				<img alt="talk" height="133" src="../../images/talk_cafe_two200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>If I am sitting in a café with a friend, I will have few 
				plans, probably, for how the conversation may develop.&nbsp; I 
				may comment on what we see around us, on family matters, the 
				government, the state of the football season, our mutual friends 
				and a host of other matters.&nbsp; I know, too, that my friend 
				may do the same and neither of us has come with an agenda.&nbsp; 
				The conversation will wander but each turn will be taken up in 
				some way by the next speaker because that's how conversations 
				carry on and fill the time.&nbsp; Unless we are meeting for a 
				prearranged discussion about something, neither of us knows 
				where the conversation will go.&nbsp; We will also be 
				unconcerned by non-sequitur comments and irrelevant details.<br />
				If I am participating in a seminar in a university, I will speak 
				very differently, possibly using a different accent or dialect.&nbsp; 
				I will be careful what I say because I know others are judging 
				how rational, insightful and reasonable my points are and I'll 
				try to avoid irrelevance or following red herrings.&nbsp; I will 
				also be careful to use grammatically accurate language and 
				specific, perhaps technical, lexis.</dd>
				<dt>Example 3: reading for a purpose<br />
				<img alt="read" src="../../images/reading_paper_bw200.jpg" /></dt>
				<dd>If I have just taken delivery of a new washing machine, I 
				know it will come with a set of instructions which will often be 
				badly translated into my language from the language spoken where 
				it was made.&nbsp; I will read these as carefully as patience 
				allows before I plug it in and trust my new shirts to it.&nbsp; 
				In other words, I'll read intensively until I think I've got the 
				essentials and then skim read the rest so I know where to find 
				things for the future.<br />
				If, on the other hand, I am looking casually at a notice board 
				in my workplace or school, I will probably just skim my eyes 
				over the heading of each notice until I light on something that 
				interests me.&nbsp; In other words, I'll skim read until I stop 
				and read intensively.</dd>
				<dt>Example 4: writing for a purpose<br />
				<img alt="write" height="133" src="../../images/write_paper200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>If I am writing an email responding to my friend's note 
				about her holiday dates and troubles at work, I'll write very 
				differently from how I would write a proposal for a new product 
				to my bosses.<br />
				In the first place, I'll write casually, with little planning 
				and feel free to include all kinds of irrelevance such as 
				telling him about my problems and plans for a holiday.&nbsp; I 
				may even hardly respond to the contents of his email except in 
				passing.<br />
				In the second case, I will write carefully to make sure I am 
				being clear and accurate in my use of English.&nbsp; I'll also 
				probably write, read, re-write and re-read a number of times 
				before I am satisfied that I have made my case as logically, 
				briefly and yet informatively as possible.&nbsp; I may start by 
				just jotting down a few notes and then expand them when I get 
				going on a computer.&nbsp; I may even ask a colleague to read 
				what I have written or read what I have written aloud to her to 
				get some feedback which I will incorporate in the next draft.&nbsp; 
				All this will take a considerable amount of time.</dd>

			<p>And even consequences have consequences.<br />
			Before we can begin to consider teaching or practising a skill or 
			any of its subskills we have to give the matter a little thought.<br />
			The following are unhelpful to the point of being actually damaging 
			to the process:</p>
			<ol>

			<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'because',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
			Click here when you have an answer</a>.</p>
			<ol id="because" style="visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">
				<li>Because I don't know why I'm listening, I don't know what it 
				will be about, I don't know what I can get from it so I don't 
				know how to listen.&nbsp; I will do it because you are the 
				teacher but I will gain virtually nothing from it.</li>
				<li>Because I didn't choose this text, I don't know what it's 
				about, I don't know why I'm reading it and I can't bring my 
				knowledge of the world into play because I have no time to 
				think.</li>
				<li>Because I don't know what my partner knows already, I don't 
				know what she will do with any information I give, I don't know 
				what she wants to say and I don't have any time to get my 
				thoughts in order.</li>
				<li>I don't know what to write about, I don't know who the 
				audience for the writing will be, I don't know how formal or 
				informal to be and I don't, above all, have a reason for doing 
				this other than to cooperate with my nice teacher.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>That wasn't a terribly difficult little test but the moral is 
			clear.<br />
			Skills, as much, if not more, than language systems teaching has 
			to be set in a clear context.&nbsp; Learners need to know:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The type of texts they are dealing with.</li>
				<li>What happened to stimulate the production or the 
				comprehension of language</li>
				<li>Why they are using the skill</li>
				<li>Which subskills are appropriate</li>
				<li>What the outcomes of the practice will be</li>
				<li>Who is involved and what their roles and relationships are</li>
				<li>What is in it for them</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If we don't provide that information somehow (see below), the time will be wasted and possibly counterproductively used.</p>

			<p>Now we know what our learners need to know before they are 
			exposed to or asked to produce text of any kind, we need a way to 
			categorise the information we give them.&nbsp; The following will 
			work as a handy <em>aide memoire</em> for planning purposes:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="ftm" height="354" src="../../imagesgraphics/field_tenor_mode_2.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>In real life, of course, whenever we speak, listen, read or 
			write, we are already (sub)consciously aware of the field in which 
			the text is set, the relationships between ourselves and whoever is 
			writing or speaking, listening to or reading what we produce (the 
			tenor) and we know how communication is happening&nbsp;(the mode).&nbsp; 
			Put all that together and we have what is called the <strong>Context 
			of Situation</strong>: what people need to know.<br />
			In classrooms, however, that information is not always obvious and 
			needs to be made explicit.<br />
			One way to do this is to produce a simple questionnaire for skills 
			activities along the lines of:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="ftm" height="376" src="../../imagesgraphics/ftm_questionnaire.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>Not all these categories will be appropriate for all skills 
			lessons but most of them will.&nbsp; Do not assume that your 
			learners know what they are doing.<br />
			A form like this will take about three minutes to complete (and 
			people get even quicker with practice).&nbsp; If the time is used to 
			make sure that people know what they are doing, why they are doing 
			it and with whom, it will be time well spent.<br />
			You can, of course, do this as a whole-class exercise (which may be 
			wise the first time) but it is more effective in raising awareness 
			if it is done individually or in the pairs or groups that people 
			will be working in.</p>
			<p>Here's an example of the form filled in for someone completing 
			the following task:</p>

			<p>Now, the learners are alert to the skills needed for the task and 
			what to do in terms of language functions.<br />
			They know that they will have to learn and/or use some technical 
			language for the email and the conversation but that will be 
			simplified by writing it first and listening and speaking about it 
			second.&nbsp; The learners will, in fact, be primed to learn the 
			language they need because this is a simulated real-world task.&nbsp; 
			That makes learning the lexis more effective because they can see 
			what they are learning it for and how they will have to use it.<br />
			They know, too, that they are contacting a friend so the email 
			doesn't need to be formal and nor does the speaking phase.<br />
			With luck, that will help to get the tone and content of what is 
			written correct and prepare for a speaking phase to follow.<br />
			This also means, of course, that you are more aware of what needs 
			teaching and the learners of what needs learning.&nbsp; That helps 
			you all along the way considerably.</p>
