			<h1>Asking good questions</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="question" height="207" src="../../images/animals_meerkats_two310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Asking questions is an important communicative tool and we all 
			ask lots of them.<br />
			In the language classroom, the ability to formulate appropriate 
			questions is also a key <strong>teaching</strong> tool.</p>

				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>If you have followed <a href="../functions/formfunction.html">the guide to form and function</a>, you'll be 
			alert to the fact that what looks like a question may not be one and 
			what looks like a statement may in fact be a question.<br />
			Here are some examples.&nbsp; What functions do the utterances perform?<br />
			Click on the graphic when you have an answer.</p>

			<p>Even here, we may disagree slightly because much depends on tone 
			of voice, setting, shared knowledge between speaker and hearer and 
			so on.&nbsp; It is, however, plain to see that form does not always 
			represent function and <em>vice versa.<br />
			</em>Here we are concerned with <strong>real questions</strong>, 
			whatever form they take.</p>

			</ol>
			<ol id="q1" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li><em>What's the capital of France?<br />
				</em>This is the kind of question a primary school teacher might 
				ask.&nbsp; The answer can come in one word, is right or wrong 
				and known to the questioner.</li>
				<li><em>How old are you?<br />
				</em>Again, this is answerable in one word but there's no right 
				or wrong answer and the questioner probably doesn't know the 
				answer.</li>
				<li><em>Do you have a brother?<br />
				</em>Another one-word answer &ndash; yes or no.&nbsp; The answer 
				may include more information but it doesn't have to.&nbsp; The 
				questioner doesn't know the answer.</li>
				<li><em>Where did you go to school?<br />
				</em>This requires a bit more output &ndash; probably 
				information about town and country.&nbsp; The questioner doesn't 
				know the answer.</li>
				<li><em>How do you make an omelette?<br />
				</em>This requires a lot of output because it's a complicated 
				answer.&nbsp; The questioner may or may not know the answer.</li>
				<li><em>Why are you sad?<br />
				</em>Another question requiring considerable output, probably 
				(although less than Question 5).&nbsp; The questioner doesn't 
				know the answer.</li>
				<li><em>What's the meaning of 'dirigible'?<br />
				</em>This might require considerable output to explain clearly 
				or only one word (<em>airship</em>)<em>.</em> <em>&nbsp;</em>If 
				asked by a teacher, the answer is known.&nbsp; In other 
				circumstances, it isn't.</li>
				<li><em>When are you leaving?<br />
				</em>This might require quite a long answer.&nbsp; The 
				questioner doesn't know the answer.</li>
				<li><em>Who did you meet?<br />
				</em>This might require quite a long answer.&nbsp; The 
				questioner doesn't know the answer.</li>
				<li><em>Is this important?<br />
				</em>This only requires a yes/no answer.&nbsp; If asked by a 
				teacher, the answer is known.&nbsp; In other circumstances, it 
				isn't.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>How you classified types of question may differ from the 
			following.&nbsp; It's a place to start.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>closed questions</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="closed" height="133" src="../../images/eye_closed200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				require a simple yes or no.&nbsp; Examples are Questions 3 
				and 10.</dd>
				<dt><strong>open questions</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="open" height="133" src="../../images/eye_female_open200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				may have one-word answers but are not yes-no questions.&nbsp; 
				Often, they require more output, sometimes lots more.&nbsp; 
				Examples are those beginning with <em>wh-</em> words (1, 2, 4, 
				5, 6, 7, 8 and 9).&nbsp; Questions using <em>how</em> 
				and <em>why</em> usually require much more from the responder 
				than those using <em>when, which, what, where, whom </em>and <em>who</em>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>display questions</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="display" height="133" src="../../images/woman_mask200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				are asked so that the learner can display his/her knowledge.&nbsp; 
				Examples are Questions 1, 5 (probably), 7 and 10.</dd>
				<dt><strong>communicative questions</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="communicative" height="133" src="../../images/communicate_tin_strings200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				are asked when the questioner really does not know the 
				answer.&nbsp; Examples are Questions 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>how</em> questions</strong></dt>
				<dd>Questions with <em>how</em> are usually concerned with manner but 
				manner of four different sorts and we should know what sort of 
				response we are looking for:<ol>
					<li>an adjectival phrase such as <em>quite excited, a bit 
					down, unhappy</em> etc. in answer to, e.g:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>How did she appear?</em></li>
					<li>an adverbial modifier such as <em>hurriedly, with great 
					care, in a rush</em> etc. in answer to, e.g.:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>How did she do it?</em></li>
					<li>a response, such as <em>from Mary, John explained it, I 
					looked it up</em> 
					etc. in answer to, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did she find out?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you know that?</em></li>
					<li>a measure of extent or amount such as <em>very, a lot, 
					extremely, 20 dollars, three miles</em> etc. in answer to, 
					e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long was the jorney?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much did he worry?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How angry was the boss?</em></li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt><em><strong>why</strong></em><strong> questions</strong></dt>
				<dd>The word <em>why</em> has two possible meanings in terms of the 
				questioner's intentions and we should be slightly careful when 
				using it.<ol>
					<li><em>Why</em> meaning <em>How come</em>:<br />
					If we ask, for example<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is John happy?</em><br />
					we are enquiring about causes so the question demands that 
					the learner recalls previous events and states to see 
					connections between those and the present condition of John.&nbsp; 
					That requires that the learner recalls the information, 
					understands it and applies it.&nbsp; That is often quite a 
					challenging question along the lines of, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does water float on ice?</em><br />
					or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does iron become a liquid at 1538 
					degrees Celsius?</em></li>
					<li><em>Why</em> meaning <em>What for</em>:<br />
					If we ask, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did he stop the car?</em><br />
					we are not asking about causes but we <strong>are</strong> 
					asking about reasons and that requires a different way of 
					processing the data.<br />
					Now the learners needs not only to recall the facts of the 
					story.&nbsp; They need to understand them, apply them and 
					analyse them in terms of intentions.<br />
					That is cognitively even more demanding.</li>

			<h3>using closed and open questions</h3>
			<p>Closed questions are the simplest to answer because there are 
			only two possible responses: yes or no.&nbsp; That may lead you to 
			think they are less useful for language teaching but it all depends 
			on purposes.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Checking</strong><br />
				<img alt="checking" height="133" src="../../images/examine_eye200.jpg" width="200" /><br />Closed questions are useful for checking concepts and 
				instructions because they are quick to formulate and allow of 
				only two possible answers (one right or one wrong in this case).&nbsp; 
				Here are some examples:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I say, "It's a tall ceiling?"&nbsp; Can I say, "It's a 
				high ceiling?"</em> (collocation concept checking)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you working alone on this task? 
				</em>(instruction 
				checking)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it important to read the first sentence in each 
				paragraph?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have to understand every word?</em> 
				(checking a skills task)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you going to write notes?</em> (checking a procedural 
				issue)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that the correct past tense of 'make'?</em> (encouraging 
				self-correction)<br /><span class="style_red"><strong>Warning:</strong></span><br />Avoid questions which require the learner to use a 
				presupposition or understand an implication.<ul class="redbulletlist">
					<li>If you want to check that the instruction to work in 
					pairs has been understood, you can ask:<ul class="greybulletlist">
						<li><em>How are you going to do this?</em><br />but that requires a 
						<strong>presupposition</strong> that 
						the question refers to alone or with a partner and could 
						equally be understood another way (<em>I'm working hard, 
						I'm working in writing</em> etc.)<br />A better question might, therefore, be:</li>
						<li><em>Who is your partner for this?</em><br />because that 
						<strong>entails</strong> the fact that it 
						is pair work.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If you want to check a concept, the same considerations 
					apply so a question such as:<ul class="greybulletlist">
						<li><em>What time was his action?</em><br />is open to a number of interpretations depending on the 
						learner's understanding of the <strong>implication</strong> 
						(<em>at 4 o'clock, after his brother came home, when he 
						finished breakfast</em> etc.).<br />A better question might be:</li>
						<li><em>Does the verb refer to the present or the past?</em><br />because only one of these can now be true.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Easy questions first</strong><br />
				<img alt="salesperson" height="133" src="../../images/salesperson200.jpg" width="200" /><br />An old salesperson's trick is to ask an easy 
				<em>yes-no</em> question to 
				lull the customer into a sense of security and then follow it up 
				with a question which requires more thought and deliberation as 
				well as commitment.&nbsp; We get, therefore, exchanges such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I help you? </em>(an offer masquerading as a question)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, please</em> (that's the easy answer)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of hat are you looking for?</em> (now the 
				customer needs to commit)<br />Teachers can do this, too (and for nicer reasons).<br />Weaker learners or those that are more reticent can be drawn 
				into an exchange by posing easy yes-no questions first and then 
				encouraged to commit more by follow-up questions so we could 
				get, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you looking for a particular kind of word?</em> (easy 
				question: the answer is almost certainly yes)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Good.&nbsp; What sorts of words do you need to find?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Er.&nbsp; The verbs and nouns.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Great.&nbsp; What sort of verbs?</em><br />and so on.<br />Note that the first 
				<em>wh-</em> question has a limited answer 
				but the second requires much more thought.</li>
				<li><strong>From the factual to the personal</strong><br />
				<img alt="personal" height="133" src="../../images/woman_proud200.jpg" width="200" /><br />The same sort of procedure can be used to encourage a certain 
				amount of investment from learners and move gradually from easy 
				yes-no responses to responses requiring some commitment.&nbsp; 
				For example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do many people eat large breakfasts in your country? 
				</em>(a 
				simple yes-no question to which the teacher may even know the 
				answer so there's little pressure on the learner to get it 
				'right')<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have a large breakfast? 
				</em>(another simple yes-no 
				question but requiring personal commitment)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you usually have? 
				</em>(now the learner has to 
				deploy the target language and make it personal and memorable)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you say it's your favourite meal of the day? / Why 
				don't you eat much for breakfast? </em>(this requires a bit of 
				thought and some quite complex language use to answer properly)<br />If you start with the final question, especially with 
				weaker or more reticent learners, you'll get very little 
				response.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>using display and communicative questions</h3>
			<p>Teachers spend a good deal of their professional lives asking 
			questions to which they already know the answers.<br />
			Outside the classroom, in the real or normal world, pointing at 
			something obvious (like a loudspeaker) and asking:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the name 
			for that?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you think of two adjectives to describe it?</em><br />
			would 
			draw odd looks at the very least and possibly attention from the 
			authorities.<br />
			In a language classroom, however, such questions are quite normal.&nbsp; 
			Indeed, learners expect them.</p>
			<h4>display questions</h4>
			<p>As we saw, these sorts of questions simply give the learner the 
			opportunity to display knowledge.&nbsp; Sometimes, such questions 
			really are useless (of which more later) but they do have serious 
			pedagogical functions as well.<br />
			Here's a selection of useful ones (with their ulterior purposes).</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style5">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="disappears" height="166" src="../../images/accident_cycling250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style4">
					<p class="style_black"><strong>Cyclist disappears on country 
					road</strong></p>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p class="auto-style9"><strong>Questions:<em><br />
			Look at the picture and the headline.&nbsp; What's the text 
			about?</em></strong></p>
			<p>The answer is obvious but the teacher wants explicitly to elicit 
			something like 'a mystery' or 'a disappearance' from the learners:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To check if they have understood the language in the 
				headline (is, e.g., <em>cyclist</em> understood?)</li>
				<li>To see if they can recognise the formation of the noun from the verb: <em>
				disappear</em> to <em>disappearance</em></li>
				<li>To activate what they know about such things happening</li>
				<li>To prepare them for what will follow in the text and allow 
				them to make some predictions about what the text might contain</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and one display question has done all that.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="how do you say it" height="133" src="../../images/listen200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style7"><strong>Question:<br />
					<em>Where's the stress?</em></strong></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Again, it's pretty clear that the teacher is not asking for 
			information, she's asking for production.&nbsp; She clearly knows 
			where the stress should be.&nbsp; So why is she asking?</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To get the learner to produce language so she can check for 
				accuracy</li>
				<li>To get the learner to focus explicitly on stress</li>
				<li>To get the learners (all of them) to notice where the stress 
				falls and decide if that's where they would put it</li>
				<li>To prepare the learners to use the target in a later phase 
				without stumbling over the pronunciation</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="display question iwb" height="206" src="../../imagesgraphics/displayquestion.png" width="500" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style7" valign="top"><strong>Questions:<br />
					<em>What goes in the gap?<br />
					Can you move the right one?<br />
					What colour is the right answer?</em></strong></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Clearly, again, the teacher can just go to the interactive 
			whiteboard and simply move the green box into the gap because she 
			knows the answer.&nbsp; But, wisely, she elicits the correct 
			response because:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The cognitive effort makes the right form more memorable</li>
				<li>The act of getting up and doing something with the 
				interactive whiteboard makes the solution memorable</li>
				<li>Some people may even find that colour selection helps the 
				memory</li>
				<li>The teacher also wants to know if teaching up to now has 
				been effective.&nbsp; If it has, everyone in the class should 
				get it right.&nbsp; If they don't, it's time to backtrack.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are thousands of possible display questions so this list 
			stops here.&nbsp; The key fact to note is that they have a purpose 
			and you should know why you are asking them.</p>
			<h4><a name="2"></a>communicative questions</h4>
			<p>These are the ones to which the teacher does not know the answer.&nbsp; 
			They can be open or closed and include things like:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Is there a music shop in your hometown? </em>(a yes-no 
				factual question)</li>
				<li><em>What sort of music does it sell? </em>(a <em>wh-</em> 
				factual question)</li>
				<li><em>Do you enjoy music?</em> (yes-no personal fact question)</li>
				<li><em>What sorts of music do you like?</em> (a <em>wh-</em> 
				personal fact question)</li>
				<li><em>Do you think it's OK to download music from the web?</em> 
				(yes-no opinion question)</li>
				<li><em>What should the penalties be for breaking copyright like 
				this?</em> (a <em>wh-</em> opinion question)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>What do you notice about the ordering of the examples above?&nbsp;

			Starting at the beginning, question 1 is a simple and easy to answer 
			because it is about external facts and not controversial.<br />
			Question 2 requires a bit more data from the learner and is slightly 
			harder.<br />
			Question 3 is harder again because it requires giving personal 
			information (something that intimidates some students).<br />
			Question 4 is slightly harder because it requires both more data and 
			is personal.<br />
			Question 5 puts the learner on the spot because it requires opinion 
			not personal data and that's scary for many (and culturally 
			difficult for some).<br />
			Question 6 is the hardest of the lot because it not only requires 
			the student to be vulnerable in expressing personal opinion but it 
			also requires more data than a yes-no answer and may require 
			justification.</p>
			<p id="moral" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
			<strong>The moral of the story<br />
			</strong>It makes sense to grade questions in this order 
			(although they may not all be relevant) to increase the 
			challenge gradually and to ease learners in to answering questions of 
			increasing difficulty.&nbsp; If you start with questions 5 and 6, 
			don't be surprised if a stunned silence greets you.<br />
			The same considerations of challenge apply to display 
			questions.</p>
			<p><strong><a name="2a"></a>Why should you ask communicative questions?</strong><br />

				<li><strong>Real communication</strong><br />
				The theory is that using the target language to exchange (note: 
				it's a two-way process) real information not known to the other 
				speaker is both satisfying and memorable.</li>
				<li><strong>Simulation</strong><br />
				As was said above, in the real world, we do not usually ask 
				questions to which we already know the answer.&nbsp; Using 
				communicative questions in the classroom simulates real-world 
				encounters and prepares people for them.</li>
				<li><strong>Motivation</strong><br />
				Sharing personal fact and opinion is a basic social function.&nbsp; 
				People enjoy it if they don't feel threatened and that increases 
				commitment and motivation.&nbsp; Engagement, in other words.</li>
				<li><strong>Affect and personalisation</strong><br />
				People like to be asked about themselves, where they live and 
				their opinions.&nbsp; It values them and that increases 
				engagement.</li>
				<li><strong>Authenticity</strong><br />
				It has been argued that conversation (which requires the 
				exchange of previously unknown fact and opinion) is the 
				authentic setting in which language is acquired, developed and 
				deployed.&nbsp; We should strive for authenticity in the 
				classroom, too.</li>

			<p>There are two main sorts of follow up to learners' display 
			answers:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Positive endorsement:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, Good, That's right<br />
				</em>etc.&nbsp; 
				This simply tells the learner that the response to a display 
				question is exactly what you hoped.&nbsp; Don't overdo it.</li>
				<li>Negative outcome:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not quite<br />
				</em>which usually means<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not at all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, think again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, can anyone help?<br />

			</table>
			<p>A teacher's first instinct is often to praise whatever the 
			learner says providing the language is acceptable and the 
			communicative effect is appropriate.&nbsp; That is not always a wise 
			choice in this case.<br />
			On many occasions, the natural follow-up to a response is simply 
			something like 'Oh' because the hearer has been made aware of 
			something they didn't know.&nbsp; It is not particularly authentic 
			to respond to, e.g., "I'm allergic to cats" with either a positive 
			"Right, good" or a negative "No, that's not right."<br />
			The moral is that we should respond primarily to content and only 
			secondarily to form when people answer communicative questions.&nbsp; 
			And in that order.&nbsp; So, for example, a better response to "I'm 
			allergy to cat" might well be:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, are you?&nbsp; That must be difficult sometimes.&nbsp; Are you 
			aller</em><strong><em>gic</em></strong><em> to dog</em><strong><em>s</em></strong><em>, 
			too?</em><br />
			Often, stressing the correction when you echo is enough to alert the 
			learner to what's wrong.&nbsp; You may, of course, have to follow 
			that up with a focus on form.&nbsp; (It's called a re-cast, 
			incidentally.)</p>

			<p>If a question is asked at the wrong time, and learners aren't 
			prepared, don't be surprised if they can't answer you.<br />
			For example, how would you respond to an opening gambit such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think the punishment should fit the crime?<br />
			</em>Right.&nbsp; The most common response would be to temporise 
			with something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it depends, I guess.&nbsp; What sort of crimes are you 
			talking about?<br />
			</em>Temporising is a) something that is hard to do in a foreign 
			language and b) probably not going to carry the lesson forward with 
			a great deal of momentum.<br />
			If you want to ask something to activate what the learners know 
			about crime and punishment and 
			introduce the topic,</p>
			<ol class="auto-style10">
				<li>What would be a better set of opening questions?</li>

				<dt><strong>First questions</strong></dt>
				<dd>should be closed and factual so something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a lot of crime in your country / town / city / 
				London?</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Second questions</strong></dt>
				<dd>can be open but should still be factual and non-personal 
				because it's too early to ask people to take risks.&nbsp; So, 
				something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sorts of crime are most common?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				What sorts of crimes do you read about in the papers?<br />
				</em>would be appropriate</dd>
				<dt><strong>The next step</strong></dt>
				<dd>might well be a bit of task-based learning, getting the 
				learners to brainstorm all the crimes they know and then order 
				them by seriousness.<br />
				When that's done, you can safely move on to the meat of the 
				lesson and give the learners some lexis, structure and practice 
				in talking about the topic in a controlled way, unthreatened by 
				the need to process complicated thoughts and take risks.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Finally</strong></dt>
				<dd>You can start to get answers to:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Closed personal factual questions, e.g., <em>Have you ever been 
				the victim of a crime?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</em>Open personal factual questions, e.g., <em>What happened?&nbsp; 
				How did you feel?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</em>Closed opinion questions, e.g., <em>Do you think crime X is 
				more serious than crime Y?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</em>Open, personal opinion questions, e.g., <em>How best can we 
				deal with crime?&nbsp; What sorts of punishments do you think 
				are the most effective?<br />
				</em>Ideally, the learners should be asking each other these 
				sorts of questions, of course.</dd>

			<p>Lastly, don't forget that processing a question and formulating 
			an answer takes time in a foreign language.&nbsp; The more 
			elementary you are, the longer it may take.&nbsp; The more cognitive 
			effort we have to put in, the longer it will take.<br />
			As we saw above, 
			too, there are grades of challenge in questions both in terms of 
			language and in terms of social pressure.<br />
			There is evidence from some research that teachers rarely wait long 
			enough so curb your desire to move on to the next learner too 
			quickly or supply the answer yourself.&nbsp; Allowing adequate time 
			has been shown to increase learner involvement and responsiveness.<br />
			There are two sorts of wait time:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The time you wait after asking the question, allowing the 
				learner(s) to formulate a response</li>
				<li>The time you wait after asking a question and before 
				nominating who should answer it.&nbsp; Again, some research 
				shows that waiting a short time before you nominate someone to 
				respond increases everyone's involvement.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Be prepared to wait</strong>.</p>
