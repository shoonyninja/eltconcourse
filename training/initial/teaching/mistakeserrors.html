		<p>Traditionally in English Language Teaching, we make a distinction 
		between two types of mistake: an error and a slip.&nbsp; Errors 
		are caused by a lack of language knowledge or communication strategies and slips are caused by 
		tiredness, inattention or just having too much to think about at the 
		time.<br />
		For example, two of the following are just slips which can be ignored 
		(unless they persist) but three are real errors that may need us to do 
		something constructive in the classroom.&nbsp; (All of them are real, 
		noted in the classroom, by the way.)<br />
		Can you identify which is which?&nbsp; 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'errormistake1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you 
		have an answer</a>.</p>

			<li><em>He go fishing every Sunday</em> (advanced learner talking 
			about his father)</li>
			<li><em>There are stone stairs down to the beach</em> (low-level 
			learner describing a picture)</li>
			<li><em>The house's roof is blow off</em> (intermediate learner 
			summarising a newspaper report about something which happened last 
			week)</li>
			<li><em>The car won't starting because something is wrong with the 
			engine</em> (intermediate-level learner explaining a problem)</li>
			<li><em>Please give that me</em> (upper-intermediate learner asking 
			a classmate to pass a pen)</li>

		<div id="errormistake1" style="visibility:hidden" >
		<p><span class="style_brown">Right.&nbsp; Numbers 1, 4 and 5 are just 
		slips or mistakes.&nbsp; It's unlikely that an advanced learner doesn't 
		know that it should be<em> he goes</em>.&nbsp; It's also unlikely that an 
		intermediate speaker doesn't know that<em> won't </em>is followed by the 
		infinitive, not the<em> -ing </em>form and that an upper-intermediate 
		student doesn't know that it should be <em>it </em>not<em> that </em>in 
		this case.</span></p>
		<p><span class="style_brown">Numbers 2 and 3, however, are real errors.&nbsp; 
		In 2. the speaker clearly doesn't have the word <em>steps</em> in his or 
		her vocabulary and in 3. there are lots of errors: the form of the 
		genitive (it should be <em>the roof of the house</em>), the form of a 
		passive (it should be the verb <em>be</em> followed by the past 
		participle, <em>blown</em>) and the tense of the verb (it should be<em> 
		was</em> or<em> has been</em>).</span></p>

		View 1: is often held by those who believe that learning a language is 
		mostly about forming good habits and, through lots of practice an 
		repetition, we can get the point where we are producing correct language 
		automatically, almost without thinking.<br />
		View 2: is often held by those who see language learning as a process of 
		thought: learning by testing hypotheses, adjusting our theories, 
		comparing what we say with what we hear and noticing gaps in knowledge 
		for ourselves.<br />
		These are fundamentally different ways of seeing the process.</span></p>

			<p>The following assumes that you are closer to those that hold view 2 
		than view 1.</p>
		<p>There are three main steps:</p>
		<h4>Step 1: RECOGNITION</h4>
		<p>This may sound obvious.&nbsp; After all, we all know when something 
		is wrong, don't we?<br />
		Usually, yes but there are two sorts of error we need to be aware of 
		where it isn't so clear:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Receptive error</strong></dt>
			<dd>We can make a mistake in understanding what we read or hear so 
			it is important that we have ways in the classroom to find out 
			whether something has been adequately understood or not.&nbsp; To do 
			that, we ask questions or make sure the language has a clear context 
			so we can judge.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Covert error</strong></dt>
			<dd>If, for example, a student says, "She has been to London.", how do 
			we know if it is right or wrong?&nbsp; The form looks and 
			sounds OK but the learner might have meant, "She went to London." or 
			"She has gone to London." and that's another reason we need a clear context for 
			all the language we practise in the classroom.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h4><a name="4"></a>Step 2: EXPLANATION</h4>
		<p>Can you think of any reasons why students may make errors?<br />
		<a href="#4" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'errormistake5',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have thought of something</a>.</p>
		<div id="errormistake5" style="visibility:hidden">
		
		<dl class="style_brown">
			<dt>Ignorance</dt>
			<dd>the learner may simply have never learnt the form of the meaning 
			and is just stabbing in the dark.&nbsp; This is most common at lower 
			levels because that's where learners' needs often outstrip their 
			abilities to produce language.</dd>
			<dt>Overgeneralising the rule</dt>
			<dd>sometimes, when a 'rule' has been learned, learners will 
			over-extend it.&nbsp; For example, if you have learned the rule to 
			add <em>-ed</em> to make a past tense, it seems logical to form <em>
			catched</em>.&nbsp; Equally, over-extending a rule might lead to the 
			production of <em>wonderfuller.</em></dd>
			<dt>First language interference</dt>
			<dd>all learners, especially adult ones, will draw on language(s) 
			they know to try to figure out a new one.&nbsp; This is most obvious 
			in the area of pronunciation, of course, but occurs frequently in 
			other areas:<br />
			Structure: the learner's first language may have a structure that 
			looks similar but means different things.&nbsp; For example, the 
			German structure of <em>ich habe gesehen</em> [<em>I have seen</em>, 
			literally] often is better translated into English as <em>I saw</em> 
			rather than <em>I have seen</em>.&nbsp; That's only one reason for 
			finding out a bit about our learners' first languages.<br />
			Lexis: many languages, and not only European ones, have words which 
			look the same but have different meanings.&nbsp; For example, <em>
			simpatico</em> in Italian means <em>nice</em> or <em>friendly</em>,
			<em>sensibel</em> in German means <em>sensitive</em> and <em>un 
			smoking </em>in French is <em>a dinner jacket</em>.&nbsp; There are 
			many hundreds of these so-called false friends.&nbsp; There's
			<a href="../../../learners/exercises/falsefriends/elt_concourse_false_friends_index.html">
			a set of exercises on this site focused on false friends</a>.<br />
			Appropriacy: in many languages, such as Greek, it is perfectly 
			acceptable, for example, to go into a shop and state <em>I want ...</em>or<em>&nbsp; 
			Give me ... </em>with no <em>please</em> to soften the instruction.&nbsp; 
			That will not work well in most English-speaking cultures.</dd>
		</dl>
		</div>
		
		<h4><a name="5"></a>Step 3: REMEDY</h4>
		<p>Here is where teachers need to think on their feet.&nbsp; There are 
		questions to ask whenever you hear an error.&nbsp; What might these be?<br />
		<a href="#5" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'errormistake6',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have thought of 
		some ways to handle error</a>.</p>
		<div id="errormistake6" style="visibility:hidden">
		
		<dl class="style_brown">
			<dt><strong>Question 1: am I going to correct this?</strong></dt>
			<dd>If the error isn't holding up communication and has nothing to 
			do with the subject of the lesson, it may be that correcting it will 
			lead you off on a tangent, chasing red herrings and serve to slow 
			down the lesson and confuse the learners.&nbsp; If that's the case 
			ignore it.<br />
			If, on the other hand, the error is impeding comprehension or is 
			made in the language that is the target of what you are doing, then 
			you will have to deal with it.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Question 2: do <em>I</em> need to correct this?</strong></dt>
			<dd>Very often, learners can correct their own production so a 
			quizzical look or stopping learners and getting them to 
			retrace their steps and reconsider may be more effective than your correcting the 
			error.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Question 3: can anyone else correct the error?</strong></dt>
			<dd>If the learners can't correct their own errors, perhaps someone 
			else in the class can. &nbsp;If you think this is the case, give them the 
			chance to do so.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Question 4: how will I correct?</strong></dt>
			<dd>A last resort is normally to give 
			the correct answer yourself.&nbsp; Often, learners can be led to discover 
			the right answer with questions and suggestions such as "There's 
			something wrong with the order of the words.", "What preposition do 
			we need here?", "What tense should this be?", "Are we talking about 
			tomorrow or today?", or "Is this a long 'a' sound or a short one?" 
			and so on.<br />
			If all else fails, however, there are, obviously, times when  
			providing the right answer is the best approach <strong>providing</strong> you make 
			sure that the learner can produce the correct language independently 
			after you have done so.</dd>
