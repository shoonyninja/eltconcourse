					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>If you are taking or have just taken an initial training course, 
			you will probably have encountered one of English Language 
			Teaching's most durable mythologies:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>Teacher Talking Time is always bad.</strong></p>
			<p>Even on in-service training courses such as the Cambridge Delta 
			or Trinity Diploma, the myth endures in one form or another and 
			trainees are constantly told to reduce their teacher talk (TTT) to a 
			minimum.<br />
			It is undeniable that the more a teacher talks, the less opportunity 
			there is for learners to talk but the reasoning behind the assertion 
			usually stops there and assumes:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style61">
				<li>all teacher talk is the same</li>
				<li>learners learn best by talking</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Some teacher talk is poor and it may be vague, disjointed, 
			space-filling chit-chat or lecturing about something the learners 
			should be finding out for themselves.&nbsp; It may also be 
			long-winded explanation and instruction giving which is difficult to 
			penetrate for meaning.&nbsp; That is bad teacher talk.<br />
			Some learners probably do learn as they talk and the pressure to 
			communicate ideas is a compelling factor in encouraging people to 
			upgrade their language skills and practise what they already know.&nbsp; 
			To assert, however, that all learners learn best when they are 
			obliged to talk regardless of what they are learning, their 
			cultural backgrounds and personal preferences is, frankly, nonsense.<br />
			Many people also learn by listening, thinking, noticing what others 
			say and reading.</p>
			<p>Here, we are not concerned with the quantity of teacher talk 
			(that's TTT or Teacher Talking Time), we 
			are concerned with its quality (i.e., TTQ).</p>

			<p>There are those who will tell you that we should avoid 
			the use of 
			the learners' first language where possible.&nbsp; We want to establish an English-only environment because:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>With some classes it just isn't possible to do anything 
				else.&nbsp; Some classes have a mix of first languages and you 
				are unlikely to know them all.&nbsp; Having a group who mostly 
				but not all speak a particular language is sometimes challenging 
				because the majority can exclude the minority.</li>
				<li>We want people to start thinking and interacting in English 
				even when they are only using the language for social purposes 
				in the classroom.</li>
				<li>We do not want to encourage people to translate everything 
				into their first language(s) because:<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li class="greenbullet">it slows down the speaking, reading 
					and listening processes in particular</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">translation between languages is 
					rarely precise because words cover different concepts and 
					may be used in different styles, like this:<br />
					<img alt="translation" height="119" src="../../imagesgraphics/semantic_space.png" width="250" /><br />
					with only the area represented by the green colour being 
					common to both languages.<br />
					The reason for this is that words occupy different semantic 
					spaces in different language.&nbsp; For example, the words
					<em>cup, mug</em> and <em>glass</em> are clearly 
					differentiated in English but in other languages (such as 
					Spanish, German and French) only two words cover all three 
					ideas with no differentiation between <em>cup</em> and <em>
					mug</em>.&nbsp; Other languages, such as Turkish, may 
					differentiate between <em>mug</em> and the other two nouns 
					but use the same word for <em>cup</em> and <em>glass</em>.&nbsp; 
					Others again, may have three words or even only one for all 
					three objects.</li>
					<li class="greenbullet">translation is a specialist skill and not one that most of 
				our learners will need.</li>

				<dt><strong>For counselling and pastoral care reasons</strong></dt>
				<dd>Especially with younger learners, you need to be able to 
				respond to social problems sensitively and helpfully.&nbsp; That 
				is often best done in the learner's first language.</dd>
				<dt><strong>With very elementary groups</strong></dt>
				<dd>The sooner you can teach the chunks for the language 
				functions people need, the better (there is a guide, linked 
				below, to 
				identifying learners' language which covers this point more 
				thoroughly).&nbsp; However, at 
				the outset of learning, it is often quicker and more efficient 
				to give instructions and some explanations in the learners' 
				first language.</dd>
				<dt><strong>With abstract concepts or unusual words</strong></dt>
				<dd>A concept such as <em>a cosy relationship</em> is actually 
				very difficult to define in other English words so recourse to 
				translation is an option.<br />
				Unusual words, for example, for some types of machines or 
				animals, may only be needed for a few minutes to understand a 
				text and it is not worth spending time trying to draw pictures 
				of things like <em>ferret</em> (it is one of these):<br />
				<img alt="ferret" height="133" src="../../images/animals_ferret200.jpg" width="200" />)</dd>
				<dt><strong>When comparing languages</strong></dt>
				<dd>Learners' first languages are often seen as a source of 
				error but they are also a resource for learning.<br />
				For example, related languages will often have similar 
				structures.&nbsp; Drawing learner's' attention to the fact can 
				be a useful shortcut.<br />
				Related languages will also have cognate words (words which come 
				from the same source) and, while some will carry different 
				meanings, most will be the same.&nbsp; That's another useful 
				shortcut to meaning.<br />
				It is often useful to know how our first language differs from a 
				language we are learning so we can be alert to the differences 
				and avoid errors caused by word-for-word translation.</dd>
