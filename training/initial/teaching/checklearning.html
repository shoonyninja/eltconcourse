		of something to put in the right-hand column.</p>

		<p>You see the problem.&nbsp; Asking direct questions such as these may 
		get the answer you want to hear (or the learner thinks you want to hear) or may simply demonstrate that the 
		learner either doesn't know or won't give a straightforward answer.&nbsp; 
		Bear in mind, too, that learners from some cultural backgrounds expect 
		you to expect them to say <em>Yes</em>.<br />
		Obviously, the better your learners know and trust you and the safer 
		your classroom is as a place to take risks and be open, the better will 
		be your success with questions like this but there are better ways to 
		get at the data you need.</p>

		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>Display questions vs. Real questions</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>display questions are those the teacher asks to which he/she 
			already knows the answer.&nbsp; The learner has to display his/her 
			knowledge.&nbsp; Real questions are those you ask for which you do 
			not know the answer and may be more interesting for the learner to 
			answer.<br />
			Asking display questions is a legitimate teaching technique but be 
			aware that learners tire of them.<br />
			For example,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does it say in the text about the city?<br />
			</em>is usually a 
			display question because you know, and the learners know you know, the 
			answer better than them.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you think of this character?<br />
			</em>is, however, a real 
			question.&nbsp; The learner knows that you don't know the answer but 
			the response can still tell you how much the learner has understood 
			about the character in a text.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Open vs. closed questions</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Open questions require a much more elaborate answer than closed 
			questions.&nbsp; For example,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is he?<br />
			</em>simply requires a one-word answer like <em>
			Margate</em> unless you insist on making your learners produce 
			inauthentic language ('Answer in a full sentence, please').&nbsp; 
			It's a closed question.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he happy<br />
			</em>is also a closed question.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is he not happy?<br />
			</em>is an open question because it demands 
			a fuller response.&nbsp; It may, of course, still be a display 
			question.<br />
			We need to be slightly careful here because a question beginning 
			with Why can be asking for <strong>purposes</strong> as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did John take the money?</em><br />
			or it can be asking for <strong>reasons</strong> as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why was the house dirty?</em><br />
			Generally, questions which require the learner to say when, where, 
			who, what are closed questions but questions that require them to 
			state a reason or speculate about why or how are open questions and will give you 
			more data about how the learners are thinking and understanding.<br />
			Questions which use the word <em>if </em>are also open questions 
			requiring more data from the learners.&nbsp; For example,<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What 
			will/would happen if ... ?</em></dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Other types of questions</strong></em></dt>
			<dd><strong>Clarifying questions</strong>: <em>What do you mean by ..., 
			Can you tell me more about ...</em> etc. are open questions which will 
			tell you more than closed questions and will stretch your learners.<br />
			<strong>Questions which ask for critical awareness</strong> such as: 
			<em>What are your reasons for saying that?</em> are useful to give you some 
			insight into the thought processes of your learners.<br />
			<strong>Comparison questions</strong>: <em>What is different about X 
			from Y?</em> etc. also require the learner to demonstrate what 
			he/she knows or has understood about X or Y.<br />
			<strong>Affective questions </strong>are generally real: <em>What do 
			you feel about ... ?, How did the story affect you?</em> etc. and 
			these are important to engage and interest learners in a text's 
			content rather than just using the text as a vehicle for something 
			else.</dd>

					<h2>Concept checking</h2>

				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>It was noted above that asking a learner to come up with a dictionary 
		definition of a word or a grammar rule is rarely successful.&nbsp; Most 
		native speakers will have trouble doing that and it's unfair to ask a 
		learner of the language to attempt it.<br />
		However, we do need to check whether learners have understood a concept 
		expressed through a particular structure or a piece of new lexis.<br />
		Concept-checking questions (CCQs in the trade) are one good way but they 
		need to be thought about.&nbsp; The more experience you have the easier 
		it becomes to ask good concept-checking questions.<br />
		Two examples:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You have just taught the meaning of the verb in <em>They 
			unearthed a whole new temple.<br />
			</em>Some possible CCQs:<ol class="auto-style4">
				<li><em>Did they dig the temple up or bury it?</em></li>
				<li><em>Does this verb take an object?&nbsp; Always?</em></li>
				<li><em>What else can you unearth, for example?</em></li>
				<li><em>What's the opposite of unearth?</em></li>
				<li><em>Can you unearth an idea?&nbsp; A fish?&nbsp; A secret?&nbsp; 
				A reason?</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>You have just introduced <em>going to</em> in a dialogue about 
			someone's plans for the evening.<br />
			Some possible CCQs:<ol class="auto-style4">
				<li><em>How sure is he that he is going to the restaurant on the 
				corner?</em></li>
				<li><em>When did he make the decision to go?</em></li>
				<li><em>Has he just decided to go or did he decide yesterday when he 
				was invited?</em></li>
				<li><em>When did Mary invite him?&nbsp; Did he say Yes or No?&nbsp; 
				When did he say Yes?</em></li>
				<li><em>Why did he agree to meet at the restaurant?</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>and so on.&nbsp; The purpose of a CCQ is to make it 100% clear to you 
		and the learners that the concept has been grasped.&nbsp; If it hasn't 
		you may need to abandon the plan and re-present the language somehow or 
		go back to the dialogue.<br />
		Notice that a good concept-checking routine will often include a check 
		of meaning and form as in Example 1 above, which also checks collocation 
		and transitivity.</p>
		<p>Can you come up with some good CCQs for the teaching points on the

		<p> 
		All the above is about checking learning as you go along but we also 
		need to check at the end of a lesson somehow.&nbsp; Learners, too, want 
		some way of knowing whether their efforts have been successful.<br />
		The most obvious way is to give the learners a test of some sort but if 
		the ability to use the target language or skill naturally was the 
		objective of the lesson, that may not be a good guide.<br />
		Fortunately, there are ways to check which don't look like tests:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>Reducing the amount of control</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>It's normal near the beginning of lessons (especially if the 
			target is new to the learners) to get them to understand and use the 
			language in very controlled situations.&nbsp; This may be through 
			things like recognition exercises, gap-fill texts or controlled 
			writing of sentences and so on.<br />
			As the lesson progresses, it is also normal gradually to reduce the 
			amount of control so that the learners start to engage with the 
			language more personally.&nbsp; For example, exercises such as <em>
			Finish the sentences in a way that is true for you, Find out three 
			things that the other two people at your table used to do and have 
			given up</em> etc.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Free(r) practice</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>By the end, the learners should have control of the form or 
			skill so they can deploy it naturally in language which means 
			something to them personally and which is produced entirely by them.&nbsp; 
			Very few exercises in classrooms are entirely free of course because 
			you will still be bearing the targets in mind and requiring the 
			learners to use language or a skill you have taught.<br />
			Examples of this kind of exercise are writing a personal note to 
			each other, skimming a TV listing to find something they are going 
			to watch tonight, talking to each other about future plans and 
			hopes, a group discussion about what's wrong with the place they 
			live in and so on.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>When you plan a lesson, ask yourself whether you have included 
		appropriate and clear ways to check learning.&nbsp; If you haven't, go 
		back and think again.</p>
		<p>Your role when activities like this are happening is to monitor and 
		listen / read very carefully.&nbsp; You need to know if the learners 
		have mastered the target language or skill and whether they feel happy 
		and comfortable using it.</p>
