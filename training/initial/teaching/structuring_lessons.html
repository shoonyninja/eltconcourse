	<h1>Structuring lessons: the essential guide</h1>
		<p>
		<img height="207" src="../../images/structure_bridge310.jpg" width="310" alt="bridge" /></p>
		<p>Lesson structure concerns the way you get from where you are now to 
		where you want to be.</p>
		<p>There are many possible ways to structure a lesson in English 
		language systems or skills.&nbsp; Here we look at two.</p>
		<p>As our examples, we are going to take a reading skills lesson 
		concerned with skimming and scanning skills and a grammar (systems) lesson focused 
		on using the present perfect tense to talk about experiences which have 
		changed your life.&nbsp; We are assuming that the learners know little 
		or nothing about either.&nbsp; If you don't either, it might be an idea 
		to look at two guides (both of which will open in new tabs):
		<a href="../skills/reading_overview.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
		the nature of reading skills</a> and
		<a href="../../tenses/present_perfect.html" target="_blank">the guide to the 
		present perfect</a> first.</p>

			<p>The first things we need to decide on are the stages in the lesson 
		that have to be present if it is going to have any chance of success.&nbsp; 
			Think about a good lesson that you have been taught or taught and 
			decide what made it successful.<br />
			What were the stages in the lesson?<br />
			Think for a moment about what stages you believe

				<dt><em><strong>Presentation of the focus</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>At some point in the lesson you are going to have to present

				<dt><em><strong>Controlled practice</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>In this phase, the learners will get some practice at

			<h3>A few comments</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>Presentation</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>This is a key stage where you explain and exemplify the language 
			or skills point.<br />
			For our example of teaching the present perfect, you might start 
			with a personal anecdote about how 3 things you have done have 
			changed your life, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have learned a language<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had a baby<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have become a teacher</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			A few concept checking questions would follow that, such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I still speak French?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did I tell you when I had my baby?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I still teaching?</em><br />
			so that the learners understand that we use this form to speak about 
			things that have happened in the past which have changed the 
			present.<br />
			In other words, the form refers to <strong>a past event embedded in 
			the present</strong>.<br />
			Here you could, if the learners are up to it, explain the difference 
			between:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I learned French at school (but have 
			forgotten it)</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have learned French (and can speak it now)</em><br />
			Then you'd present the form and its pronunciation and concept check 
			the meaning again to make sure everyone has it right.<br />
			This means using what is called a model sentence (or two or three) 
			so you would write on the board or project something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has become a teacher (and is a teacher
			<span class="style_underline">today</span>)</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have learned Italian (and can speak it
			<span class="style_underline">now</span>)</em><br /><br />
			For the example of the skills focus, you could use examples of two 
			real texts, one that you would skim to find what you want (a 
			newspaper is an example) and one you would scan for data (a 
			timetable, for instance).<br />Then you'd explain / elicit how you go about doing these two things.<br />
			For skimming, the usual way with a text of this sort is to look at 
			any picture or graphic, read the first sentence of the first two 
			paragraphs and then decide whether you want to read it all or not.<br />
			For scanning, the usual way is to have a certain time or destination 
			in mind and then run your eyes over the text looking only for the 
			data you need.<br />If you have followed the guide to how learning happens 
			(linked below), you will 
			be aware that there are usually two approaches to this stage: an 
			inductive one or a deductive one (or, sometimes, both).</dd>
			<dt><strong><em>Practice</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>At this stage you would set up a controlled task or series of 
			tasks.<br />
			For a grammar point, this might include a range of task types such 
			as picking the right form to answer a question, gap-filling a 
			sentence, expanding a skeleton sentence and so on.<br />
			For the reading skills, this stage would probably involve some timed 
			reading tasks such as finding four dates and three numbers in a text 
			(scanning) or a race to match headline to text (skimming).<br />
			This is the stage in any lesson where your active monitoring and 
			help functions in two ways.<br />
			<ol>
				<li>It allows you to check that the structure / skill is being 
				applied correctly and help where it isn't.</li>
				<li>It allows you to gather data for a feedback stage which is 
				focused on what they did rather than what you hope they did.</li>
			</ol>
			</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Production</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Here you want the learners to apply the language or the skill as authentically as is possible in the classroom.<br />
			For the grammar point, this might mean sharing experiences together 
			about three things that they have done which changed their lives 
			(refer back to your anecdote).&nbsp; You will need to give people a 
			little time to think, of course, and may have to help by supplying 
			some obvious topics such as learning a skill, getting a 
			qualification, getting married, having children, moving to a 
			different country etc.<br />
			For the skills focus, you could set a realistic task such as 
			deciding what to watch on TV (scanning for timings and channels, 
			skimming to see if it's interesting enough) or working in groups to 
			pick a present for each other from a catalogue (scanning for prices 
			and things etc.) or picking a class reader by skimming the first 
			page or two of a book to see if they are interested in reading 
			it together).<br />
			Here again, you are checking learning so you need to be active, 
			alert and supportive.</dd>

		<p>In this approach, you first find out what the learners can and can't 
		do by setting them a task.&nbsp; Then, having identified the issues, 
		you teach the target language or skill and then test again with a 
		different but parallel task.&nbsp; Again, put together some ideas about what goes in

		<h3>A few comments</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>Test</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>You still have to introduce the topic of the lesson, of course, 
			but here you refrain from explaining and simply set a task of some 
			sort.&nbsp; With the skills example, that could be a reading text 
			with two tasks to do, one requiring skimming, one scanning.<br />
			With the grammar structure, the opening test could be to talk about 
			or write about life-changing events.<br />
			In either case, you need to design a feedback phase and monitor 
			carefully so you can detect the learners current (lack of) knowledge 
			or skill and focus them on it.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Teach</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>This section looks very much like the presentation and practice 
			stage of a PPP approach because that's what it is.&nbsp; See above 
			for what goes into it.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Test</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Now you set a parallel task to the one in the first phase and 
			get the learners to apply what they have learned.&nbsp; With any 
			luck (or good planning and teaching) the learners will be 
			demonstrably more successful and/or accurate.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Follow up</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>In most T-T-T lessons a follow-up phase rather like the free(r) 
			production stage of a PPP lesson is necessary to help the learners 
			internalise and personalise the language or skill.</dd>

		<p>It is rarely a bad idea to reserve five minutes of the end of a lesson 
		to get the learners to articulate what they have learned.<br />
		You can put them in small groups to write a list of what they have 
		learned and then report back, get everyone to stand and tell you 
		something they have learned before they leave, have a mingle exercise to 
		see if they have learned the same things as other people or use other 
		methods.<br />
		This is not time wasted.</p>

		<p>By the way of things, the PPP approach is probably better suited to 
		an initial presentation of something new and a TTT approach to something 
		that is being revised or revisited at a higher level but there's no 
		reason to confine yourself that way.&nbsp; There are pros and cons on 
		both sides:</p>
