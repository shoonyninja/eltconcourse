			<h1>Context</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="context" height="207" src="../../images/buildings_houses310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>A dictionary definition of context will be something like:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">the parts of a discourse or treatise which 
			precede and follow a special passage and may fix its true meaning: 
			associated surroundings, setting<br />
			<span class="auto-style57">(Chambers 20th Century Dictionary)</span></p>
			<p>As you see, the definition is in two parts.</p>
			<ol class="auto-style62">
				<li>the language around the part of special interest</li>
				<li>the general setting in which the text occurs</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the world of English language teaching, we need to 
			distinguish a little more carefully between these two related concepts.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Context</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to the social setting in which language occurs<br />
				For example, the language item:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's cold in the bedroom</em><br />
				means different things in these two contexts:<br />
				Context 1: a guest standing at a hotel reception desk talking to 
				the manager<br />
				Context 2: someone suggesting a good place to store apples<br />
				Many other language items can only be understood if the context 
				is made clear.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Co-text</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to the language immediately surrounding the item in 
				question which tells us its meaning.<br />
				For example, the word <em>bark</em> is a noun in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The tree has silver bark</em><br />
				and a verb in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I wish that dog wouldn't bark</em> <em>so much</em><br />
				Only the co-text allows us to understand which meaning of the 
				word is the correct one to assume.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The dictionary definition covers both these 
			meanings, but for us, there should be a difference.<br />
			Here we are concerned with context, not co-text.</p>

				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Wearing an angel costume would be inappropriate in all but a few 
			social settings: fancy dress parties, dramas and carnivals are the 
			only obvious ones.<br />
			The acceptability of the costume comes from nothing intrinsic to the 
			person wearing it or the costume design.&nbsp; It is entirely 
			produced by the setting in which it is worn.&nbsp; So it is with 
			language.</p>
			<p>We do not only have to show our learners how language is formed 
			or how skills are used (usage), we need also to let them notice how 
			it is used, by whom, where and for what purposes (real use) and it 
			is here that context comes to our (and their) aid.<br />
			Context-free language is:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>meaningless</li>
				<li>difficult to remember</li>
				<li>uninterpretable</li>

				<dt><strong>Setting</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="cafe" height="133" src="../../images/talk_cafe_two200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This refers to where the language is situated.&nbsp; What 
				may be appropriate and acceptable in a meeting with friends in a 
				caf&eacute; may be wholly inappropriate in a business meeting or 
				a church service.<br />
				What it may be acceptable to say in a text message to a friend 
				will not, probably, be acceptable in a letter of application for 
				a job.<br />
				For example, at an informal work meeting where the participants 
				are all more or less equal in authority, it may well be 
				acceptable for anyone to say:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>OK.&nbsp; Let's get the ball rolling, shall we?</em><br />
				but that would not be acceptable at all in a more formal meeting 
				being run by the boss of a department.&nbsp; At that kind of 
				meeting, most people will wait in silence until the boss starts 
				the meeting by greeting people and thanking them for coming.<br />
				If learners are unaware of the social setting of the 
				language, they cannot be expected to develop any knowledge of 
				appropriacy and functional acceptability.<br />
				The level of formality of the setting will affect the way in 
				which functions are realised, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I just ask ...?</em><br />
				vs.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hang on!&nbsp; What about ...?</em><br />
				and may also affect the intonation patterns people use 
				(assertive vs. tentative), how they pronounce individual items 
				(carefully or casually) and the lexis which is chosen (formal 
				and precise vs. casual and imprecise).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Participants</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="4" height="133" src="../../images/four_men200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				There are four of these in all interactions but people may 
				play multiple roles.&nbsp; These four are:<ol>
					<li>addressor – the person who initiates the message</li>
					<li>speaker / writer – the person who articulates / writes the message</li>
					<li>hearer / reader – the person who accepts / reads the message</li>
					<li>addressee – the intended receiver of the message</li>
				</ol>
				In a conversation between two people the addressor is also the 
				speaker and the hearer is also the addressee.<br />
				However, many more complex situations are possible.&nbsp; In an 
				exchange between two people in a group, for example, one 
				person may say something to another but the intended receiver of 
				the message may be the whole group or certain individuals in it.<br />
				When we have a comment such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary has asked me to find out if Jane 
				wants to come shopping on Thursday</em><br />
				we may have a speaker and a hearer but the addressor (Mary) and the 
				addressee (Jane) are absent.&nbsp; That could easily happen in writing, 
				too.<br />
				To complicate matters, of course, roles switch very rapidly in 
				spoken discourse so addressor may become (or be) speaker at one 
				moment and then be a hearer / addressee a second later.<br />
				For more, see 
				<a href="../../inservice/discourse/turn-taking.html" target="_blank">the guide to turn-taking</a>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Power relationships</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="police" height="133" src="../../images/woman_police200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Another facet of the participants in an exchange is 
				authority.&nbsp; When you are quizzed by an immigration officer 
				at an airport, the way questions are posed and the way you respond may be different from when a 
				car-rental sales person is asking for the same information.<br />
				In the former case, the questioner is in charge and will see no 
				need to be polite and deferential.&nbsp; The traveller knows 
				this and will answer politely.<br />
				In the latter case, the customer is in charge and the questions 
				will be posed deferentially.&nbsp; Answers may be much more curt 
				and, indeed, questions may be avoided altogether.<br />
				(By the way, in neither case is the questioner the addressee 
				of the answers.&nbsp; In the first case, it is the government 
				security people and in the second, the employee's company and 
				insurance partner.)<br />
				To exemplify what's meant:<br />
				In the first case, the questions may be quite abrupt, such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the reason for your visit?</em><br />
				and in the second case, the question will be softened to 
				something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me the reason for your 
				visit?</em><br />
				Answer forms will vary depending on perceived power 
				relationships and in the first case it would probably be wise 
				not to respond with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't need that information</em><br />
				although that would be acceptable, if a little curt, in the 
				second case.<br />
				There are naturally gradations in this from small to large power 
				distances between the speakers / writers and hearers / readers and 
				some cultures are characterised by large power distances so the 
				language has been adapted to show deference in more 
				sophisticated ways.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Intentions and purposes</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="aim" height="133" src="../../images/aim_archer200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The participants' aims will also form part of the context.&nbsp; 
				If, for example, the participants have no aim other than to 
				maintain social relationships, the expression<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are you?</em><br />
				may simply be phatic and not intended as a real question (as it 
				might in a range of other languages).&nbsp; However, if the 
				questioner is seriously concerned to discover the state of the 
				hearer's well-being, the question might be posed as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How </em><strong><em>are</em></strong><em> 
				you, really?<br />
				</em>stressing the verb.<br />
				In formal meetings, as another example, there will be a socially 
				determined format to who poses questions, who greets whom and how 
				turns will be taken and invited (and by whom).&nbsp; In other 
				words, the intentions and roles of those present (whether it is to 
				contribute, to inform, to learn or whatever) will determine what 
				they say, if they say anything at all, and when they will say 
				it.<br />
				If, say, the purpose of the manager of the meeting is to get 
				opinions from everyone present, he or she may well nominate by 
				name, as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does Fred think?</em><br />
				and any volunteering of opinion or enquiry will normally be done 
				tentatively as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [raised hand] <em>I think I can provide that information</em>.<br />
				or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [raised hand] <em>May I ask a question here?</em><br />
				Within this area we may also consider the tenor of the discourse 
				and the spirit of the communicators because the tone in which an 
				interaction is conducted is also part of the context for the 
				language.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>I</strong><em><strong>↗</strong></em>
				know<em><strong>↗</strong></em>
				(with stress on the pronoun and rising intonation)<br />
				is very different from<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I may<em><strong>↗</strong></em> have the answer<em><strong>↘</strong></em>
				(with stress on the modal auxiliary verb and falling intonation at the 
				end).<br />
				Equally, in informal dialogues, <br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wonderful<strong>↘</strong></em><br />
				spoken with falling intonation may mean the exact opposite of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wonderful!<strong>↗</strong></em><br />
				spoken with rising and excited intonation.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Face</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="face" height="133" src="../../images/animals_face_baboon200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Brown and Levinson (1978) (drawing on Goffman (1976)) 
				defined face as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; </em><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;something that is 
				emotionally invested and can be lost, maintained or enhanced</em><br />
				<span class="auto-style16">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (in Coulthard, 1985: 50)<br />
				</span></span>The key is to understand that asking for help or 
				demanding something of someone else threatens either the 
				speaker's face or the hearer's face.&nbsp; They are, in the 
				literature, Face-Threatening Acts (FTAs).&nbsp; Who stands to 
				lose or gain face in an interaction is part of the context for 
				the language.<br />
				For example, one can say:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Get this done by Friday</em><br />
				but that formulation threatens the hearer's face by placing them 
				in a subordinate role.&nbsp; Therefore, the demand may be altered by:<br />
				using an inclusive pronoun:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to get this done by Friday</em><br />
				referring to an outside force:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bank needs this by Friday</em><br />
				making the sentence passive and avoiding personal attribution of 
				demand and duty:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can it be done by Friday?</em><br />
				acknowledging the imposition:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know it's a bit of a bore but can you 
				get this done by Friday?</em><br />
				Requests are often made in a way that does not threaten the 
				hearer's face so we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could I borrow just a little milk?</em><br />
				using <em>borrow</em> instead of <em>have</em>, and softening 
				the request with<em> just a little</em> but
				which actually means<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me some milk</em><br />
				Invitations can work in a similar way but this time it is the 
				speaker's face which is threatened by a refusal so invitations are often 
				emphasised and made firmer as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do have some more</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please do try to make it</em><br />
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Topic or Field of Discourse</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="field" height="133" src="../../images/field_a200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Up to now, we have been mostly concerned with how the 
				context of an interaction affects issues of style and how that 
				may be realised in the language forms selected by speakers and 
				writers.<br />
				The topic area or, in Halliday's term, the Field of Discourse 
				also forms part of the context.<br />
				Mostly this area concerns the register in which the language 
				exists.<br />
				For example,<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Port 20</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please, turn a little to the left here</em><br />
				may actually both mean the same thing but the former is in the 
				field of marine commands and the latter is a polite request to a 
				driver, perhaps.<br />
				Participant roles are also important here because the level of 
				expertise which is claimed or assumed will affect the language 
				which is used.&nbsp; A conversation between an architect and a 
				building engineer is likely to be very different from one 
				between the architect and the customer although both may 
				transfer the identical information.<br />

			<p>Context may occasionally be provided by co-text alone 
			for a limited range of language items but 
			it is the <strong>social</strong>  context that determines the 
			meaning of most of what is said or written.<br />
			All the ingredients above that form the setting for language to be 
			meaningful and comprehensible can be made clear by the use of 
			well-chosen and engaging contexts.</p>
			<p>In the classroom, language needs to be carefully set in context 
			so learners can see how it is used, by whom, where and about what.&nbsp; 
			The question now is:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><strong>What sources are at our disposal to 
			generate context?</strong></span></p>
			<p>The answer is twofold:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Context may be generated from the personal worlds of the 
				teacher and the learners</li>
				<li>Context may be generated from the outside world</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />

					<h2>The personal world</h2>

				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>We all have two worlds:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>our current physical surroundings</li>
				<li>our experiences and memories</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Both can be exploited for context.</p>
			<p>Because the physical surroundings for most learners are quite 
			restricted (being, normally, the classroom and the institution in 
			which it exists), opportunities for exploiting it for context are 
			limited but should not be ignored.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>At beginner level, the classroom and the objects within it 
				can be exploited for:<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li>lexis &ndash;<br />
					nouns: <em>chair, table, floor, ceiling, projector, 
				socket, window frame </em>etc.<br />
					adjectives: <em>comfortable, warm, cool, 
				sweltering, freezing</em> etc.<br />
					verbs: <em>sit, stand, write, take notes, 
				open, close, refer to, examine, change</em> etc.</li>
					<li>grammar –<br />
					existential <em>There is / are<br />
					</em>prepositional phrases: 
					<em>on the floor, over the board</em> etc.<br />
					adjectival phrases: 
					<em>an awful colour, a dreadfully uncomfortable chair</em> etc.<br />
					and 
					so on.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Most classrooms have a window and this can form the basis 
				for much language.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="bluebullet">
					<li>articles – new and old information<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can you see?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see <strong>a</strong> police officer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's <strong>the</strong> police officer doing?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's writing down <strong>the</strong> number of 
				<strong>a</strong> car.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is <strong>the</strong> car parked?<br />
					</em>etc.</li>
					<li>present tenses – obviously and both simple and 
					progressive forms can be practised:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The driver is getting out of his car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trees look great in the spring<br />
					</em>etc.</li>
					<li>relative pronoun clauses –<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see a house which is ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man who 
				is ...<br />
					</em>etc.</li>
					<li>adjective order and epithets vs. classifiers –<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a large, blue saloon car parked on the corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's an overflowing litter bin by the bus stop</em><br />
					etc.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.&nbsp; Only your and the learners' imagination is the 
				limiter.</p>
			<p>Experiences and memories are a much richer source and provide not 
			only a context but a personal context which can make the language 
			more memorable and activities more engaging.&nbsp; The following can 
			be based on learners or the teacher or both, of course.<br />
			The list of possible contexts generated from the personal memories 
			and experiences of the people in most classrooms would fill a book 
			but there are general categories to consider:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><strong>Personal stories</strong> and anecdotes can be used to introduce or 
				practise a range of language forms not limited to narrative 
				tense forms</li>
				<li><strong>Educational experiences</strong> can be used as a springboard for 
				discussions, a way of setting past habit forms in context and so 
				on</li>
				<li><strong>The learners' world of work</strong> is often a place to start if the 
				focus is to be on appropriate register and style in work-related 
				contexts</li>
				<li><strong>The learners' personal worlds</strong> are 
				productive in terms of where they live, what their home setting 
				is like and so on and can be used to intrigue others as well as 
				make the language very personal indeed</li>
				<li><strong>Hobbies, pastimes and leisure activities</strong> can be used to set 
				various target language forms in context and to practise, e.g., 
				gerund forms and verbs of emotion and feelings</li>
				<li><strong>Habits and routines</strong> are obviously a setting for 
				present-tense forms but can also be used effectively to 
				introduce, present and practise adverbials at any level</li>
				<li><strong>Health and well-being</strong> is a particularly productive setting 
				because it allows the recounting of experience as well as 
				forming a good context for the presentation of modal auxiliary verbs and 
				much else</li>
				<li><strong>Aesthetic views and opinions</strong> need not be confined to more 
				advanced levels because elementary learners also have views and 
				opinions which they need to express simply and efficiently</li>
				<li><strong>Social views </strong>are productive in terms of hedging and modality 
				using verbs, nouns and adjectives</li>
				<li><strong>Political views </strong>are often avoided for fear of causing 
				offence but being able to state your views, suitably softened 
				with adverbials, is a key communicative skill</li>
				<li><strong>Travel experiences </strong>can form the background setting for a 
				huge range of language from narrative verbs, through routines to 
				expressions of feelings and emotions</li>

			<p>The outside world provides two main sources of context:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>events and stories</li>
				<li>situations</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Events and stories will include everything from history-changing 
			occurrences to trivial incidents.&nbsp; They can also be factual or 
			fictional.<br />
			Situations, too, will range from the important such as disasters and 
			wars to the trivial and personal such as a restaurant, a classroom 
			or a workplace.<br />
			They can both be brought into the classroom to form context for 
			language by, for example:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><strong>print</strong>: newspapers, magazines, pictures, images and cartoons 
				etc.&nbsp; Images are level-independent and can be used to 
				introduce, present and practise for an almost unlimited range of 
				language and skills work</li>
				<li><strong>video</strong>: TV reports, soap operas, game shows, news items etc. 
				need to be chosen with care to be accessible to the learners but 
				can be immediate, authentic and engaging</li>
				<li><strong>the web</strong>: news sites, blogs, stories, rants and raves etc. 
				are increasingly used in classrooms for language functions and 
				skills previously confined to printed materials</li>
				<li><strong>audio</strong>: radio reports, plays and interviews etc. are free 
				from visual distraction and can often allow a greater focus on 
				the language forms that speakers select.&nbsp; Audio-only 
				recordings are often criticised for being unnatural because we 
				rarely listen with the ability to interrupt, ask questions and 
				so on.&nbsp; There are times, however, when we need to do just 
				that and the skills we employ to monitor what we hear for 
				something relevant to us or gist listen to decide if something 
				is important enough to warrant our attention are valuable ones 
				to present and practise</li>

			<h4>There are two:</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Teaching a language differs fundamentally from teaching 
				virtually anything else.&nbsp; Teaching a language has been 
				described as teaching backwards:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>In 'normal' teaching, the teacher and the learners share 
					a language but their experiences and knowledge differ.<br />
					<strong>The teacher's job is to use the language to impart the data 
					and train people in how to process it.</strong></li>
					<li>In language teaching, the teacher and the learners share 
					much knowledge of the world, people, relationships and so on 
					but their languages differ.&nbsp; We all share contexts but 
					have differing experiences and preferences within those 
					contexts.<br />
					<strong>The teacher's job is to exploit the shared 
					experience of contexts and knowledge to teach 
					the language.</strong></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Contexts are complex and, as we saw above, include many 
				ingredients but they will not all be important at all times to 
				understanding the nature of the language use.<br />
				For some targets such as everyday functions, the relationships 
				between speakers and the formality of the setting will be critical.&nbsp; 
				Speaking to friends, speaking to strangers and speaking to 
				people more powerful or less powerful than you will all affect 
				the language we need to use.&nbsp; Whether I select, for 
				example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if you can tell me where the post office is?</em><br />
				with its embedded and slightly tricky indirect question form or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Where's the post office?</em><br />
				may depend on all these factors.<br />
				For other targets, such as appropriacy of lexical choice, the 
				field of discourse will play a bigger role.&nbsp; Speaking about 
				one's hobby, work or leisure activities will often require 
				mastery of a set of lexical items and grammatical forms which 
				are specific to the topic.<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My swing's improving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This needs to be machined to an accuracy of less than one 
				hundredth of an millimetre<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We welcome beginner surfers to the club</em><br />
				and so on are all examples of lexical or grammatical use 
				specific to certain registers.<br />
				The keys are to:<ol class="greenbullet">
					<li>Match the context to the strongest influences on the 
					language choices made.<br />
					To do that, we need to look at the analysis above to see 
					which elements of the context are the most telling.<br />
					Choose from:<ol class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>setting:<br />
						influencing formality and who does the talking</li>
						<li>participants:<br />
						influencing formality, roles and turn-taking strategies</li>
						<li>power relationships:<br />
						influencing levels of politeness, disclosure and 
						deference</li>
						<li>intentions:<br />
						influencing the language functions we need to use to 
						achieve our objectives</li>
						<li>face-threatening acts:<br />
						influencing the ways in which commands, requests and 
						invitations etc. are realised in the appropriate 
						language forms</li>
						<li>topic or field of discourse:<br />
						influencing our choice of lexis and grammatical form</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Make sure you help your learners to notice what it is 
					about the context which determines the language choices.<br />
					Just setting the language in a context is, naturally, very 
					helpful but the learners also need to notice <strong>
					explicitly</strong> which elements of the context are 
					determining the language forms or the skills used.&nbsp; For 
					that, again, you need to refer to the list above and may 
					need to get the learners to identify and describe the 
					context.<ol class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>That can be done with elicitation such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Do these people know each other well?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there someone in the group who is more powerful than the 
						others?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does she say Welcome rather than Hello?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does Mary want from the conversation?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does John want?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will they feel if Jane says she will not come to the 
						party?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's a putter and where do you use it?</em><br />
						and so on.&nbsp; Eliciting the key data like this 
						ensures that the learners are aware of the important 
						features of the context.</li>
						<li>or through simple explanations like:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen to these two old friends talking on the train.&nbsp; 
						One of them wants to ask a big favour.&nbsp; How does he 
						ask?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a conversation between a policeman and a motorist 
						after a small accident.&nbsp; Watch the conversation and 
						...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry is in charge of this meeting.&nbsp; Watch and listen to 
						how he invites people to speak and deals with 
						interruption.</em><br />
						and so on.&nbsp; Supplying the data needs to be followed 
						up by checking that it has been absorbed so a few 
						questions need to be posed such as:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are these two friends 
						talking?&nbsp; Is that a public place?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the policeman and the motorist friends?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is the boss?<br />
						</em>etc.</li>
