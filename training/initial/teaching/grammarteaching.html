		<h2><a name="0"></a>Why do we teach grammar?</h2>
		<p>There are teachers who will tell you, with a straight face, that what 
		English language teaching is, or should be, about is teaching people to 
		communicate rather than teaching the grammar of English so they don't do 
		it.&nbsp; It is as if they believe that the two can be separated or that 
		we can separate teaching people new words from helping learners to 
		communicate better.&nbsp; The assumption is that learners will absorb 
		the grammar by exposure and the need to communicate their ideas.<br />
		That is not the line taken here.&nbsp; In this guide we start from the 
		premise that:</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black">
				<em>... language learning is essentially 
			learning how grammar functions in the achievement of meaning and it 
			is a mistake to suppose otherwise. .... A communicative approach 
			does not involve the rejection of grammar.&nbsp; On the contrary, it 
			involves a recognition of its central mediating role in the use of 
			and learning of language.<br />
		</em><span class="auto-style30">(Widdowson, 1990: 97/8)</span></span></p>
		<p>and</p>
		<p class="indentpara"><span class="style_black">
				<em>... we are still too ignorant about the basic processes of 
		language learning to be able to state dogmatically what can and cannot 
		contribute to them.<br />
		</em><span class="auto-style30">(Littlewood, 1981: 9)</span></span></p>
		<p>That's still true, unfortunately.</p>
		<h3 class="auto-style12">Can you think of two good reasons for teaching 
		grammar?</h3>
		<p class="auto-style13">
		<a href="#0" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'teachinggrammarreasons',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
		Click here when you have</a>.</p>
		<ul id="teachinggrammarreasons" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
			<li class="redbulletlist">If Widdowson is right, grammar cannot be 
			separated from the ability to communicate effectively.<br />
			If I say, e.g.,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had my car washed at the service station<br />
			</em>instead of:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had washed my car at the service station<br />
			</em>I will convey the wrong meaning purely because I am ignorant of 
			the grammar.</li>
			<li class="redbulletlist">There are many times when accurate grammar 
			is socially required.<br />
			If I say, e.g.,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't can came to the party<br />
			</em>then a sympathetic listener may well mentally correct the 
			sentence to<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			She's telling me she couldn't come to the party</em><br />
			and extract the meaning (possibly).<br />
			However, three things follow:<ol class="greybulletlist">
				<li class="greybulletlist">the speaker is placing unreasonable 
				strain on the listener</li>
				<li class="greybulletlist">a less sympathetic, imaginative or tolerant 
				listener may actually not understand the message</li>
				<li class="greybulletlist">the speaker may appear ignorant.&nbsp; 
				As teachers, we expect mistakes and may see them as a natural 
				part of the learning process.&nbsp; Most of us are not teachers 
				and may take a less sympathetic view.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There are probably more bad reasons for teaching grammar and they 
		include, e.g.<em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because that's how I learned the language<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I 
		can test it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it's a nice tidy system</em> (even though it isn't, 
		really)<br />
		and so on.</p>

		Some learners enjoy the challenge of 
		learning grammar and unravelling the systems of a foreign language.&nbsp; 
		These learners look forward to grammar lessons with bated breath.&nbsp; 
		They are not, however, in 
		the majority.<br />
		Most learners want to <strong>do</strong> things with the language, not 
		study it as another subject at school like history or physics.<br />
		What are the implications of all this?&nbsp; Think for a moment and then
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'teachinggrammar1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">
		click here</a>.<ul id="teachinggrammar1" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
			<li class="redbulletlist">Implication #1:<br />
			Grammar must be set in context and be seen to be doing something 
			useful.</li>
			<li class="redbulletlist">Implication #2:<br />

			is unlikely to inspire your learners or help them be better users of 
			English.</li>
			<li class="redbulletlist">Implication #3:<br />
			Learners of the language need to see the importance of accurate 
			grammar in allowing them to say something important and personal.</li>

		lost my wallet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had an awful bedroom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I complained to the 
		manager<br />

		</em>Those are all in the past simple but the learners don't

		meanings about a finished, past event.</span></p></div>
			<p> The point here is that it is unwise to tell students who 'don't 
			like grammar' that the lesson they are about to endure is focused on 
			it.&nbsp; You need to imagine ways of using the grammar to make 
			meaning rather than learning the grammar and then using it.</p>
		<h3>Focusing on meaning</h3>
		<p> 
		A simple way to do this is to start the lesson with meanings.&nbsp; 
		Here's an example of an introduction to a lesson.</p>

		might be</a>.&nbsp; There are a number of possibilities.</p>
		<ul id="teachinggrammarpossibilities" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
			<li class="greybulletlist">The obvious one is tense form we use for 
			plans such as <em>going to</em>:<em> I'm going to have a holiday, 
			I'm going to visit New York, We're going to ski in France, He's 
			going to have a horse-riding </em>holiday etc.</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">This might be combined with or an

			booked, hotel arranged etc.): <em>We're going bird watching, riding, 
			skiing, hiking </em>etc.</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">Verbs followed by the <em>to-</em>infinitive: <em>I hoping to go to New York, I plan to have a beach 
			holiday, I want to go horse-riding in Wales, I intend to learn to 
			ski etc</em>.</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">The grammar of comparison is also a 
			possibility: <em>I'd prefer to have a beach holiday but my wife 
			wants to go skiing, She likes active holidays more than visiting 
			cities</em> and so on.</li>
			<li class="greybulletlist">A focus on memories of holidays using 
			past forms is another possibility.<br />
			<br />
			You may have thought of other possibilities.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Other ways</h4>
		<p>You don't need to use visuals to present grammar point of course, 
		although they are very helpful.</p>
		<dl>

			<dd>
			<img alt="reading" height="133" src="../../images/reading_libarary200.JPG" width="200" /><br />
			Depending on the level and the targets, you can find or invent a 
			reading text which helps the learners to notice the grammar point.<br />

		<p class="auto-style19"><strong>The important point here is that the context and intentions

		<h3>Checking concepts</h3>
		<p>Presenting grammar by putting meaning first is only half the story.&nbsp; 
		As you present a model such as:</p>
		<p><em>I'm going to New York next week</em></p>
		<p>you need persistently and consistently to check that your learners 
		have grasped the essence of the meaning implied:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="redbulletlist">Is he talking about now?</li>
			<li class="redbulletlist">Does he already have a plan in his head?</li>
			<li class="redbulletlist">Has he bought the flight tickets?</li>
			<li class="redbulletlist">Is he sure he's going?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Answers to questions like this do two things: they reinforce the 
		concept and they tell you whether the learners have got it.<br />
		For more on concept checking see
		<a href="checklearning.html" target="_blank">the guide to checking 
		learning</a>.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2> Mind the gap</h2>
		<p> Gap-fill tasks are often a good way of giving learners controlled 
		practice of the form but they aren't the only way.</p>
		<p> Which is the more interesting task?</p>
		<p> 
		<img alt="more interesting" height="370" src="../../../development/developmentimages/abtasks.png" width="500" /></p>
		<p> It is sometimes actually easier to write an exercise which gets the 
		learners to say something about themselves which is true and mildly 
		interesting than to write a gap-fill task which is dull, unmotivating 
		and doesn't lead to any kind of communication.</p>

		<p> Human beings make meaning from pictures so using them is a good way 
		to connect grammar and meaning.&nbsp; What's more, the more impressive 
		or touching an image is, the more memorable will be the form connected

		'fascinating pictures' or 'emotional pictures' you'll find a huge range
