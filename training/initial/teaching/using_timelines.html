			<p>Time lines are a very useful way of making the concepts of the 
			tense system in English clear to those who respond well to images 
			and diagrams (i.e., most of us).<br />
			They are often a quick and easy way to demonstrate meaning rather 
			than explain it.&nbsp; They need, however, to be properly planned 
			and accurately reflect the concepts you are clarifying or they do 
			more harm than good.</p>
			<p>Here's an example of a time line used to clarify what is called 
			the future in the past using the structure <em>was / were going to</em>.&nbsp; 
			In English, the structure is used to suggest a frustrated or 
			cancelled plan in, 
			e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to see the doctor but I felt a lot better and 
			cancelled my appointment.</em></p>
			<p><a name="1"></a>
			<img alt="time line example" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line_future_in_past2.png" /></p>
			<p>A time line like this can be drawn on the board quite quickly but 
			there are three important things to notice.<br />
			<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'list1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have noticed them</a>.</p>
			<ol id="list1" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">
				<li>The line has an arrow pointing towards the future because 
				that's how most of us perceive the direction of 'time's arrow'.</li>
				<li>There is a clear indication of where Now is on the diagram.</li>
				<li>There is some indication of the speaker's perception of the 
				events.&nbsp; This is important because many tense forms 
				represent how the speaker feels about events and their 
				relationship to each other.<br />
				For example, if I say,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to America<br />
				</em>I am telling you about an event I see as finished and completed in 
				the past but if I say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been to America<br />
				</em>I am 
				implying quite strongly that the fact is relevant to the 
				present or very recent or, often, both.<br />
				An eye looking right (to the future) or left (to the past) can 
				be quickly drawn on the board with three curves and a small 
				ellipse, like this:<br />
				<img alt="eye" height="102" src="../../../gfx/eyeright100.png" width="100" /></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now see if you can suggest what the time lines here represent.&nbsp; 
			Click on the

				<p>Normally, of course, you would present the time line with an 
				example, marker sentence so it would look something like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="past time line" height="124" src="../../imagesgraphics/pasttimeline3a.png" width="400" /></p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td>
					<img alt="using" height="166" src="../../images/coffee_grinder250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h2>Using time lines</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are two ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Off the cuff:<br />
				</strong>When you encounter a learner clearly having 
				difficulties with the concept which lies behind a tense form, it 
				is worth considering whether quickly sketching a time line on 
				the board will help.&nbsp; It is often a quick 
				and efficient way of making a concept clear.</li>
				<li><strong>Prepared:</strong><br />
				You can also integrate the use of a time line into the 
				presentation part of a lesson focused on a tense or tenses.&nbsp; 
				This means that you can make it very precise and more 
				attractive.&nbsp; Adding in graphics provides extra information 
				and aids memorisation.&nbsp; Here's an example, for the marker 
				sentence:<br />
				<em><strong>We have been working hard in the garden all summer 
				and I'm really pleased with how it looks.</strong></em><br />
		<img alt="gardening" height="296" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line_gardening.png" width="600" /></li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="building" height="166" src="../../images/work_construction250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style21">
					<h2>Building time lines</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Whether you have prepared an attractive time line&nbsp;beforehand or 
			are using one in response to an emerging need, you need to carry the 
			learners with you as you go.&nbsp; It is
			<span class="style_underline">much</span> better to build up the 
			time line, explaining each part as you go, than to present your 
			learners with the finished article and get them to try to work out 
			what it all means.<br />
			Like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Start with the marker sentence:<br />
				<strong><em>I have been trying to telephone her but I give up 
				and I'm going to visit her.</em></strong></li>
				<li>Then add the place markers for time (Past, Now, Future, 
				The Future etc.):<br />
				<img alt="time line 1" height="74" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line1.png" width="300" /><br />
				Concept check the direction of time: not all cultures see time 
				as progressing from left to right.</li>
				<li>Then draw in the nature of the events<br />
				<img alt="Time line 2" height="89" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line2.png" width="300" /><br />
				Checking at each stage:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How often did 
				he try?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he trying now?.</em></span><br />
				<img alt="time line 3" height="78" src="../../imagesgraphics/t-line3.png" width="300" /><br />
				Check the concept again.<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When does he 
				decide?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When is the visit?</em></span></li>
				<li>Give the learners time to copy this as a record to take away.&nbsp; 
				That's important.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To repeat a little: learners will rarely get the full benefit of thinking things 
			through if you just present the 
			finished article.&nbsp; If you use PowerPoint in your lessons or a 
			smart board, this kind of slow build-up is easy to prepare.<br />Here's an example for you to download and watch (and even use).<br />Things like this are time-consuming to prepare but can be used again 
			(and again and again).</p>
			<p>Here's a video of showing how to build up a time line or two on 
			the board.&nbsp; It runs quite slowly because learners need a bit of 
			space after each transition to understand what's going on.<br />
			The slides automatically transition every 7 seconds.&nbsp; You may 
			need to adjust that if you use it in the classroom or pause the 
			presentation to give yourself 
			time to explain and check the concepts as you go along.</p>
