			<img alt="tasks" height="207" src="../../images/four_tasks.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>You should follow <a href="activity_types.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
			Activity Types</a> (new tab) before doing this.&nbsp; The assumption is that 
			you have and know the difference between awareness-raising, 
			skill-getting and skill-using activities.</p>
			<p>This is not a guide to task-based learning.&nbsp; There is
			one on this site, linked in the list of related guides at the end, 
			and if you follow it, you will be aware that in that tradition, the 
			term <em>task</em> is used in a special sense.<br />
			In this guide, we are using the word to mean any exercise that 
			you give learners at any stage in the lesson.&nbsp; It mostly excludes 
			teacher-fronted activities and focuses on the kinds of things you 
			can get students to do in class and why you should ask them to carry 
			out some kind of task.</p>

					<h2>Embedding tasks in activities: the relationship between 
					task and activity purpose</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>As you know if you have followed the guide to activity types, we 
			need to focus on activities which are purely to raise people's 
			awareness, those which help them acquire new language or a skill and 
			those which give them the opportunity to put the language or skill 
			into action.</p>
			<p>Tasks can be classified in the same way but the picture is a 
			little more complicated because single task types can be embedded in 
			all three activity types.<br />
			Here's an example of what is meant using a popular task type: 
			<strong>the 
			matching exercise</strong>.</p>

					and on understanding what's said and what happened.<br />

				</tr>

					did it?" and so on.<br />
					They are practising (i.e., using) speaking and listening 
					skills along with the grammar and some quite unpredictable 
					lexis.<br />
					It is a free task with uncontrolled output from the 
					students.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>It's important for you to see that in all three cases here, the 
			task <strong>type</strong> is unchanged &ndash; they are all 
			matching activities of some sort.&nbsp; What changes is the activity 
			type into which the task is embedded and with it, the purpose of 
			the task and the amount of feedback which is required.</p>

			There is a huge range of task types that can be used in classrooms

			What follows is an introduction to some of the commonest.<br />
			At 
			the end of each description and example, you'll be asked to think

			<p>These are almost always very controlled tasks and frequently

			<p>
			<a name="1"></a>To read about what gap-fill tasks are like,
			<a href="task_typeshp.htm">click here to try a gap-fill test 
			for yourself</a>.</p>
			<p>
			Gap fills can be quite versatile and you can design one with 
			virtually any text, including dialogues and so on.&nbsp; The gaps 
			can be as large or as limited as you like but the more words that 
			have to be inserted, the more variable will be the possible 
			solutions.<br />
			Gap-fill tasks also work well for while-listening tasks at all 
			levels if you want your learners to <strong>notice</strong> certain 
			items in the text.&nbsp; You can also use gap-fill tasks in 
			dictations for the same purpose.<br />
			There is a guide to 
			noticing on this site (linked below) in the in-service section but it is 
			somewhat technical.</p>

			<p><a name="2"></a>Role play tasks come in a variety of flavours and are extremely 
			versatile.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Free role-play tasks<br />
				In these, it is up to the learners to take the dialogue where it 
				will go and only the sketchiest of instructions need be given.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're on a train and have just met a 
				college-friend you haven't seen for five years.&nbsp; OK?&nbsp; 
				Go.</em></span></li>
				<li>Assigned role-play tasks<br />
				In these, learners do not react as themselves but in a role or 
				as a character that you give them.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student A is a very unhappy customer because the expensive 
				camera he bought burst into flames in his car.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Student B is the manager of the shop and has had a very bad day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				His patience is thin and he thinks this customer is not telling 
				the truth.</em></span></li>
				<li>Controlled role-play tasks<br />
				In these, the roles and the language to use may both be 
				specified.&nbsp; For example, such a task might require learners 
				to use particular tense forms and take on particular characters.&nbsp; 
				Ask-and-answer scenarios are popular such as enquiring about 
				future plans, advising a fellow student, encounters between 
				strangers and locals etc.</li>
				<li>Mixed role-play tasks<br />In these, there are 
				possibilities:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>The roles may be assigned but not the language.</li>
					<li>The language may be prescribed but students act as 
					themselves.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>

			</table>
			<p>Skeleton tasks are allied in some ways to gap-fill tasks but the 
			gaps are not explicitly signposted.&nbsp; Usually, these tasks focus 
			on structure, often tense forms, and are used to consolidate 
			language learning and encourage noticing.<br />
			As the name and the graphic imply, the learner is presented with a 
			skeleton of the text and is asked to expand it by inserting words 
			and, sometimes, changing words.<br />
			They can be quite finely focused.<br />
			Here are two examples:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><a name="3"></a>Expansion only:</dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="1" height="111" src="../../imagesgraphics/skeletonstory.png" width="465" /><br />
				Learners can work alone or in small groups on tasks like these 
				to come up with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday I was watching TV when my neighbour arrived to 
				complain about the noise of/from my washing machine<br />
				</em>and so on.</dd>
				<dt>Expansion and alteration:</dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="2" height="123" src="../../imagesgraphics/skeletonstory2.png" width="465" /><br />
				Here the learners have to do a lot more work to end up with 
				sentences such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I left her in a shop and went for a coffee 
				before doing my own shopping.<br />
				</em>This is a much harder exercise.</dd>

			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Transformation tasks</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are generally severely form based and require learners 
				to change one form into another.&nbsp; At their dullest and 
				least useful they ask people to change all tenses from, say, 
				present to past, or make all first conditionals into second 
				conditional forms.<br />
				Exercises like this are poor because speakers use forms to match 
				communicative aims, not the other way around so if someone says, 
				e.g.,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door was opened very quietly<br />
				</em>instead of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She opened the door very quietly</em><br />
				there is a reason for the choice (to do with marking the theme, 
				in fact).<br />
				Simply transforming one structure into another is rarely a 
				productive thing to do.<br />
				There are times when it is a useful focusing and form-practice 
				task, however.&nbsp; Here are two examples:<br />
				<strong>Direct to indirect speech:</strong><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen to the interview between 
				the reporter and the police officers and then write the 
				newspaper report.</em></span><br />
				This actually does practise a real-life skill because we 
				often report what someone has said to us directly into indirect 
				speech along the lines of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>John told me that ...<br />
				</em>Doing it in writing allows the learners to focus on form 
				before they have to use it in spoken exchanges.<br />
				<strong>Style shifting:</strong><br />
				Transforming a text from an informal email to a formal one or 
				vice versa is often a good way for learners to be made aware of 
				and focus on the lexis and structure which is characteristic of 
				the style.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We made up our minds to put the do off<br />
				</em>might become<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was decided to postpone the celebration</em></dd>
				<dt><strong><a name="7"></a>Transfer tasks</strong></dt>
				<dd>Given, for example, a graphical representation of data, 
				learners need to transfer the information to another medium such 
				as prose or a spoken presentation.&nbsp; For example, given 
				this:<br />
				<img alt="graph" src="../../imagesgraphics/graph.jpg" height="248" width="465" /><br />
				learners might be required to summarise the data in speech or in 
				writing.<br />
				This is a skill demanded in some examinations such as IELTS and 
				is also useful for those studying English for Academic Purposes.<br />
				<strong>Picture stories</strong>, too, fall into this category 
				because they are frequently used to provide a stimulus for 
				speaking through the use of a set of images.&nbsp; (A search 
				engine request for 'picture stories' or using images from the 
				web will find plenty of material, incidentally.)</dd>

				<dt><strong><a name="6"></a>

			<p class="nomarginbottom">Tasks come with instructions and one simple

			intend people to follow when doing the task.<br />

			sentence, the instruction may just be something like:</p>
			<p class="auto-style89">Please underline all the nouns in this

			<p class="auto-style89">Organise your list into mass nouns and 
			countable nouns and look at the articles we use with them.</p>
			<p class="auto-style90">then it is clear that you are demanding a 
			good deal more of your learners.</p>
			<p class="auto-style90">At the most demanding level, a task may have 
			an instruction such as:</p>
			<p class="auto-style89">Write the procedure for a guest concerning 
			how to use the heating controls in your house and what to do with 
			the burglar alarm when they go out and come in.</p>
			<p class="auto-style90">then you are being very demanding indeed and 
			you cannot expect learners to be able to do that without a good deal 
			of careful preparation.</p>
			<p>Here's a checklist of instructional language organised, from left

			<p>What tasks do depends to some extent on the lesson structure you 
			use (and there's 			a guide to structuring lessons 
			on this site, linked below).</p>
			<p>In <strong>Test &ndash; Teach &ndash; Test</strong> lessons, skill using will 
			often come before skill getting and then skill using will again be 
			the focus.<br />
			Awareness raising still usually comes first and what is described 
			above as a skill-using task will often, in fact, be used as an 
			awareness-raising task which alerts the learners to their need to 
			acquire the language or skill they must have to do the task.</p>
			<p>In <strong>Task-based Learning</strong> lessons, awareness raising has to come early but then the focus is on 
				entwined skill using and skill getting.&nbsp; The theory is that 
				skill using stimulates skill getting.</p>
			<p>So there's no single right way to order the activities.&nbsp; We 
			do, however, need to make sensible judgements about what sorts of 
			tasks we need and into which kinds of activities they are embedded or lessons can 
			become incoherent and procedures will not match aims.</p>
