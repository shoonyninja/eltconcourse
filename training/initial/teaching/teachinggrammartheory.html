			<p>This guide will assume that whatever structural or grammatical 
			target you have for a lesson or series of lessons, you at least have 
			done the research and have mastered the area.&nbsp; There isn't too 
			much point in going on if you haven't.<br />
			There is <a href="grammarteaching.html">a more practical guide on 
			this site for some ideas of how to teach grammar</a>.&nbsp; Here we 
			are more concerned with the underlying theory and principles.</p>

			</table>
			<p>The distinction between grammar and structure is not a simple 
			one.&nbsp; However, for the purposes of this guide we'll make the 
			distinction like this:</p>
			<p><strong>Grammar is the overarching formal nature of a language</strong>.&nbsp; 
			It consists of:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Syntax: the arrangement of words in phrases, clauses and 
				sentences to make properly formed strings of language</li>
				<li>Morphology: the ways in which words are formed and changed 
				to make new words or to show, number, case, tense, aspect and so 
				on</li>
				<li>Orthography: the nature of the language's spelling and 
				writing system and it relationship to how words are pronounced</li>
				<li>Phonology: the sound system of the language</li>
				<li>Semantics: the study of meaning</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To that list some might add etymology, the study of the origins 
			of words and their development through time, but that is usually 
			only tangentially relevant to language teaching.&nbsp; When it is 
			relevant, however, a knowledge, however sparse, of the origins of 
			words can be extremely helpful in a range of grammatical areas.</p>
			<p><strong>Structure refers to individual elements of grammar</strong>.&nbsp; 
			It is easier to define what we mean by example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Syntax<ol class="auto-style5">
					<li>Tense structure<br />
					English has a number of ways to talk about the past.&nbsp; 
					For example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					She was going but hadn't yet decided when<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					They had gone before I arrived<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					We used to go often but haven't been for ages</em><br />
					etc.<br />
					That is a description of the syntactical structures used to 
					signal time and the relationships between events.</li>
					<li>Interrogative forms<br />
					To make a question in English with an auxiliary verb, we 
					reverse the order of the subject and the auxiliary so we 
					convert, e.g.,<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She can see it</em><br />
					to<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can she see it</em>?<br />
					and<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has arrived</em><br />
					to<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has she arrived?</em><br />
					If no auxiliary is present, we use the appropriate form of 
					the verb <em>do</em> before the subject, followed by the 
					base form of the verb, as in converting<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went</em><br />
					to<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did I go?</em><br />
					That is a description of the main syntactical rules for 
					forming questions in English.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Morphology<br />
				To make the noun from <em>happy</em>, we convert the <em>y</em> 
				to an <em>i</em> and add the suffix <em>-ness</em>.&nbsp; To 
				make its antonym, we insert the prefix <em>un-</em> and so form
				<em>unhappiness</em>.<br />
				That is a description of one type of morphological structure and 
				also, in passing, of an orthographic structure to do with the 
				spelling of the language.</li>
				<li>Phonology<br />
				The word <em>and</em> in a phrase such as <em>fish and chips</em> 
				is often reduced to /ən/ and the whole phrase transcribed as /fɪʃ 
				ən tʃɪps/.<br />
				That is a description of a common phonological structure in 
				English to do with the rhythm of connected speech.</li>
				<li>Semantics<br />
				The lexeme <em>bank</em> can be both a noun, as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the bank and took out the money<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I went to the bank, sat down and started fishing</em><br />
				and a verb, as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plane banked sharply to come in to land<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I banked the money</em><br />
				In both cases, the word has two distinct and unrelated meanings 
				so we are dealing with homonymy.<br />
				That is a description of a particular semantic structure in 
				English.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In a classroom, then, when teachers refer to 'grammar', they are 
			usually talking about syntactical structures and references to other 
			elements of grammar are referred to as, e.g., word formation, 
			pronunciation, lexis and spelling etc.<br />
			In this guide, we will be referring to the teaching of any of the 
			formal elements of the language and including all five of the areas 
			listed under grammar above.&nbsp; The main focus will, however, be 
			on syntax because that is what many teachers understand by teaching 
			'grammar'.</p>

			<p>There are some who will aver that just as the internal combustion 
			engine and electrification doomed steam transport to the status of a 
			museum item, so the advent of communicative, natural and lexical 
			approaches to English language teaching removed the obligation to 
			teach grammar, and, indeed, the rationale for teaching it at all.<br />
			This is partly a matter of fashion and, like the width or trouser 
			bottoms and the height of hemlines, fashions swing in regular 
			cycles.&nbsp; Currently, we are enjoying, or enduring, depending on 
			your point of view, the anti-grammar swing but there are indications 
			that the pendulum is on its way back to the pro-grammar side.<br />
			At least part of the reason for these shifts in focus is the fact 
			that nobody is at all sure how much effect the explicit teaching of 
			grammar actually has and whether it is worth doing at all, however 
			one does it.<br />
			The view which underlies what follows is that some explicit focus on 
			grammar and structure is important for these reasons (which are in 
			no particular order):</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>Exposure to rich and comprehensible examples of the language 
				in use is no doubt very helpful in terms of acquiring language 
				and being able to notice important features.&nbsp; However, in 
				many parts of the world, where English is not the first language 
				of the environment outside the classroom and classroom time 
				itself is very limited, learners need explicit teaching of 
				grammar points, some of which are hard to learn.</li>
				<li>Learners expect and are reassured by some explicit focus on 
				structures.</li>
				<li>Accuracy is important.&nbsp; While an obsession with 
				accuracy in the classroom is counter productive (because it 
				often leads to teaching and re-teaching trivial points), there 
				are many situations in which people are judged by their ability 
				to handle the core structures of English to a reasonable level 
				of competence.&nbsp; This is especially true for learners who 
				need to use English in the workplace.</li>
				<li>Examination boards are keen to point out (usually) that 
				their tests measure the ability to use English in 'the real 
				world' but, as a glance at the content of many examinations will 
				reveal, much of the testing is of accuracy in one or other of 
				the five areas of grammar listed above.</li>
				<li>Theories abound about how children learn their first 
				languages (for more, see
				<a href="../../inservice/background/flasla.html">the guide to 
				first and second language acquisition</a>).&nbsp; None of the 
				theories suggests that they do so by having grammar rules 
				explained, exemplified and practised.&nbsp; However, there is no 
				unequivocal evidence that the learning of a second language 
				should parallel the experience of learning a first language.</li>

			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li><strong>Inductive or Deductive?<br />
				<img alt="think" height="133" src="../../images/think200.gif" width="200" /><br />
				</strong>If you have followed <a href="learning.html">the guide 
				to how learning happens</a>, these terms will be familiar.&nbsp; 
				The difference is this:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li><strong>Deductive</strong> approaches are those in which 
					the rule is presented and exemplified and then applied to 
					the data by the learners.<br />
					For example, having been told and shown that function words 
					such as<em> for, and, to, at</em> etc. are reduced using /ə/ 
					instead of the full vowel, learners are required to practise 
					the forms in connected speech, monitoring themselves and 
					being monitored by the teacher to be sure they are producing 
					/ənd/, /fə/, /tə/, /ət/ not /ænd/, /fɔː/, /tuː/, /æt/.<br />
					That is progression from knowledge of the rule to 
					production.</li>
					<li><strong>Inductive</strong> approaches are those which 
					rely on the idea that people are good at seeing patterns and 
					working things out for themselves rather than being told the 
					rule.&nbsp; It is often averred that the effort of doing so 
					makes the information more memorable.<br />
					For example, when presented with a number of adjectives 
					which in end in <em>-y</em>, such as <em>happy, nasty, 
					friendly, shaggy, shabby, cosy, greasy</em> etc. and a few 
					derived nouns such as <em>happiness, nastiness</em> and <em>
					friendliness</em>, learners are led to noticing the pattern 
					(replace <em>-y </em>with <em>-i-</em> and add <em>-ness</em>) 
					and can then produce parallel constructions such as <em>
					prettiness, ugliness</em> and so on.&nbsp; If they are later 
					presented with adjectives which do not form nouns in this 
					way, such as <em>sunny, funny, messy</em>, they can then 
					amend their rule to take account of those adjectives for 
					which there is already and noun available and from which 
					they are themselves formed (<em>sun, fun, mess</em>).<br />
					That is progression from example to rule formation.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>The as-and-when approach<br />
				<img alt="stop" height="133" src="../../images/finger_stop200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</strong>This approach to teaching grammar relies on the 
				teacher's judgement concerning the importance of the grammar 
				point in question and the possibility of teaching it as and when 
				it surfaces as a problem in the learners' efforts to 
				communicate.&nbsp; In other words, it means interrupting the 
				flow of the lesson to tackle an issue when it arises before 
				getting back on track.&nbsp; There are two ways to implement the 
				as-and-when approach:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>With no explicit grammar syllabus in mind, the teacher 
					adapts the teaching programme to take account of and 
					integrate grammatical instruction into a communicative 
					approach when the need is apparent.&nbsp; Whether the 
					structure in question is presented and practised inductively 
					or deductively is immaterial.&nbsp; Approaches such as Dogme 
					and other conversation-based lessons rely heavily on this 
					focus on emergent need.</li>
					<li>With a specific focus in mind, the teacher deliberately 
					creates a task or communicative activity which will demand 
					grammar just beyond the learners' current competence and 
					then plans to deal with it when it arises.&nbsp; The theory 
					is that the learners will recognise the gap between their 
					ability and their needs and be motivated to fill it.<br />
					Approaches such as task-based learning and lesson structures 
					like Test-Teach-Test rely heavily on this focus on emergent 
					need.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Noticing<br />
				<img alt="notice" height="133" src="../../images/man_notice200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</strong>There is
				<a href="../../inservice/teaching/noticing.html">a guide to 
				noticing</a> on this site.&nbsp; Here, it is enough to note that 
				such an approach to teaching grammar relies on the learners 
				noticing two important phenomena:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>how their own production differs from that of a model 
					(noticing the gap)</li>
					<li>how their first languages differ in terms of the 
					structures of English (noticing the difference)</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Explanation</strong><br />
				<img alt="explain" height="133" src="../../images/explain_board200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Whatever form the teaching of grammar takes, there is likely to 
				be a time when the teacher needs to explain an issue.&nbsp; The 
				starting point has to be that the teacher knows and understand 
				the area.<br />
				Explanation needs to be:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>sufficient to allow the learners of whatever level to 
					understand the essential point.&nbsp; Adding superfluous 
					data to an explanation in an effort to be complete is rarely 
					helpful.</li>
					<li>accurate insofar as what is said is not wrong (although 
					it may not be the whole truth).&nbsp; This is a pedagogic 
					exercise, not an exercise in detailed language analysis.</li>
					<li>couched in language the learners can readily understand.&nbsp; 
					If this means using the learners' first language to explain 
					a grammatical point of some kind, that is entirely 
					acceptable, especially at lower levels.&nbsp; It is not 
					language which is being taught at these times, it is 
					information <strong>about</strong> language.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Use and usage</strong><br />
				<img alt="use usage" height="133" src="../../images/face_change200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is a key point which affects all grammar teaching.&nbsp; 
				The distinction is:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li><strong>Usage</strong> is the form of the language 
					independent of its meaning.&nbsp; For example, we can 
					explain to learners and exemplify the fact that <em>I am 
					going to have lunch now</em> refers to a present intention 
					regarding the immediate future.&nbsp; That is its 
					significance as an utterance.</li>
					<li><strong>Use</strong> is the real communicative purpose 
					to which the language is put.&nbsp; For example, we can 
					explain and exemplify the fact that <em>I am going to have 
					lunch now</em> can be used to explain to a colleague why it 
					is not possible to discuss something immediately.&nbsp; That 
					is its value as an act of communication.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Exemplifying</strong><br />
				<img alt="drowning" height="133" src="../../images/drowning200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				The rise of computer-based, corpus linguistics to identify 
				natural uses of language has been very beneficial in allowing 
				teachers to see what native speakers are likely to say and write 
				and how they typically use lexis and syntax.&nbsp; The down side 
				is that it has led to the false assumption that examples must be 
				authentic at all times so we are sure to have an example of
				<strong>use</strong> rather than mere <strong>usage</strong>.&nbsp; 
				This can lead to drowning our learners in detail.<br />
				It is obviously important to avoid examples for which no 
				possible communicative purpose can be imagined (<em>Whose leg is 
				that?&nbsp; It's Maud's leg.</em> is a famous, usage-only 
				example).&nbsp; However, exemplifying in a way that is both 
				natural and lacks the obscuring detail that often comes with an 
				authentic instance of the language is also a legitimate aim.<br />
				For example, presenting the use of <em>may have been</em> to 
				express doubt about a past action could be done using an 
				authentic example plucked from the web such as:<br />
				<span class="style_black">
				<em>‘I’m turning into a bunny boiler’: Charlotte Crosby admits 
				she MAY have been a bit too full-on with Geordie Shore co-star 
				Gaz Beadle'</em> <span class="auto-style6">(metro.co.uk 4th May 
				2016)</span></span>.<br />
				It would arguably be more effective to set the scene and then 
				exemplify the syntax with something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He may have been driving too quickly to avoid hitting the 
				bus.</em><br />
				To be avoided, however, is a usage-only example such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John may have been a postman when he was at school</em>.<br />
				which is grammatical flawless but communicatively valueless.</li>
				<li><strong>Practising</strong><br />
				<img alt="practice" height="133" src="../../images/music_practice_piano200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				Here we need to distinguish again between use and usage but a 
				focus on usage can often be helpful because it narrows the 
				learners' field of view.&nbsp; This is particularly important 
				when the target is either complex inherently, such as the 
				English language's tendency to string auxiliary verbs together 
				in clauses like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This car should have been being serviced today but </em>...<br />
				or when the target item is very different from the learners' 
				first languages and requires a more or less fundamental 
				re-thinking of an issue.&nbsp; Examples might be teaching 
				prepositions in a setting in which the learners' first language 
				using post-positions or teaching articles to learners whose 
				first language does not have an article system at all.<br />
				In these cases, it is often advisable to have exercises which 
				focus on the mechanics of getting the language right and the 
				words in the right order without the distraction of trying to 
				communicate something important.&nbsp; Gap-fill, sentence 
				re-ordering, skeleton sentence tasks and so on are all 
				legitimate if unexciting ways to target the nuts and bolts of a 
				structure before asking learners to deploy it for communicative 
				purposes.&nbsp; The drilling of pronunciation of particular 
				rhythmic patterns or difficult (for these learners) phonemes 
				falls into the same category.</li>
