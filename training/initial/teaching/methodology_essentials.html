			<p>A dictionary definition of methodology is
			<span class="style_black"><em>a system of methods used in a particular 
			area of study or activity</em></span></p>
			<p>If you have followed the very brief guide to 
			<a href="../../common/what_is_methodology.html" target="_blank">what a methodology 
			is</a>, some of the following may be familiar to you.&nbsp; Here we are 
			concerned less with what a methodology is and more with identifying 
			some important ones.<br />
			However, before we start, we have to have some structure to work 
			within and the choice has fallen on the definition provided by 
			Richards and Rodgers (2001).<br />
			It looks a bit like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="methodology" height="340" src="../../imagesgraphics/methodology_grid.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>The three green boxes contain the essential elements:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Approach<br />
				As you see, there are two parts to this:<ol class="auto-style36">
					<li>What is language?<br />
					This seems a simple question but it proves quite difficult 
					to answer and any answer will depend on whom you ask.<br />
					Is language, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a set of structures into which words are inserted to make 
					sentences?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a large number of words which determine what we mean when we 
					speak or write?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a means of communicating with other people?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a set of concepts and ideas?</li>
					<li>How do people learn languages?<br />
					This is not easy to answer because nobody really knows 
					although there are lots of plausible (and a few very 
					implausible) theories.<br />
					Do we learn, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by forming good habits and imitating teachers and native (or 
					near native) speakers?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by thinking carefully about the rules and trying to apply 
					them to what we speak and write?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by simply listening and picking the language up?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by figuring things out or by being told?</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Design<br />
				For any methodology to be worth the name, it has to have a set 
				of recognisable design characteristics.&nbsp; What these are 
				will often (not always) depend on the answers to the first set 
				of questions about the Approach.<br />
				For example, a methodology may contain:<ol class="auto-style36">
					<li>A set of objectives such as accuracy in production, 
					correct pronunciation, the ability to do things in the 
					language, the ability to read with understanding, the 
					ability to write clearly and the ability to enter into 
					conversations with other speakers.<br />
					The objectives will often depend on understanding why the 
					learners are in the classroom in the first place.</li>
					<li>A syllabus which will be written with the objectives in 
					mind and that may cover grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary 
					and so on but may also include specific writing, speaking, 
					listening and reading skills.</li>
					<li>Some recognisable activity types which will depend 
					on what we think learning is.&nbsp; A methodology may have, 
					for example, lots of listen-and-repeat activities, a good 
					deal of grammatical exercises, some role play and maybe some real-life tasks to complete in the language.</li>
					<li>Some understanding of the roles of the teacher and the 
					learners.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are learners active or passive?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the 
					teacher the leader or a member of the group?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the 
					teacher set the pace or do the learners do that?</li>
					<li>A set of materials which can be used to target the 
					objectives and will contain the items on the syllabus.&nbsp; 
					Whether the materials are ordered by grammatical structure, 
					communicative function or by other considerations will 
					depend to a great extent on our answer to what we think 
					language is.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Finally, a methodology will be recognisable in the classroom 
				because we will be able to see what actually happens:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What techniques do the teachers use?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do the teachers do?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do the learners behave?<br />
				and so on.<br />
				This may include things like drilling, setting up role plays, 
				dictation, pair work tasks and so on for the teacher and 
				reading, writing, answering questions, contributing to 
				discussions, doing drills and so on for the learners.</li>

			<p>We are going to cheat slightly here and consider three main 
			methodological strands.&nbsp; Within the strands, there are distinct 
			differences which should not be underestimated but the methodologies 
			share enough of the central characteristics we have set out to 
			discover for them to be considered in only three separate sections.</p>
			<p>There is plenty more information about the detail of 
			methodologies and some of their alternatives on this site so use the 
			table of related links at the end if you want to know more.<br />

				<h3>The Classical Method and Grammar translation</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Grammar translation and its forerunner the Classical Method have 
			been around for a very long time and are familiar experiences for 
			people around the world.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Approach<ol class="auto-style36">
					<li>Theory of language<br />
					Language is seen as a way in to understanding and 
					appreciating the culture of the language we are learning 
					whether it is to read Ancient Greek and Latin texts or 
					access Modern German literature.<br />
					Language is primarily a cultural resource and a window into 
					culture.</li>
					<li>Theory of learning<br />
					We learn a language in much the same way as we learn 
					anything else, by memorising words and structures and being 
					able to render thoughts and ideas in our own language into 
					another as well as being able to render the foreign language 
					into our own.<br />
					Hence the second name of the methodology (but it hasn't always been 
					called that).</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Design<ol class="auto-style36">
					<li>The objective is to give the learners the tools they 
					need to understand the literature of another culture, living 
					or dead.</li>
					<li>The syllabus is ordered by topic area and difficulty 
					with an equal emphasis being given to vocabulary and 
					grammar.</li>
					<li>Activities include memorising lists of vocabulary with 
					their translations into the mother tongue of the learners 
					and to memorising rules and structural items such as 
					genders, verb endings and plural forms.<br />
					A good deal of time is devoted to translating out of and 
					later in to the target language.</li>
					<li>The teacher's role is mostly as a knower, being able to 
					explain rules, provide translations and discuss the meaning 
					of texts.&nbsp; It is also the teacher's role to set tasks 
					and provide feedback and set the learning objectives for 
					every stage and lesson in a course.<br />
					The learners will mostly do as they are told and complete 
					tasks in the classroom and for homework.</li>
					<li>The materials will usually be specially designed to 
					allow easy access to simple vocabulary and structures before 
					more difficult items but later the course materials will 
					often be authentic literature with, perhaps, guides to style 
					and meaning.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Procedure<br />
				In the classroom, learners will not be expected to speak very 
				much unless they are reading aloud and will not be asked to use 
				the language to express personal ideas and needs.&nbsp; Theirs 
				is the task of unravelling the code.<br />
				There will be a good deal of teacher presentation of vocabulary 
				and testing of understanding as lessons proceed but little in 
				the way of communication.<br />
				Structural issues will be tackled by explanation and 
				mini-lectures.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You may, of course, be tempted to dismiss Grammar Translation 
			methodology as hopeless old fashioned and dull.&nbsp; That's fair if 
			you are expecting language learning to result in the ability to 
			order a second-class railway ticket or negotiate a major 
			international peace treaty in the target language.&nbsp; However, if 
			we consider the methodology in the light of its objectives and 
			understanding of the nature of language and learning, we may feel 
			more sympathetic to the approach that is taken in the classroom.<br />
			If you are learning to access literature and culture, it makes sense 
			to be able to apply translation techniques to what you read.</p>

			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Although these describe slightly different methodologies, we'll 
			consider them together because they share a good deal of the three 
			characteristics of a methodology we are using as our structure.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Approach<ol class="auto-style36">
					<li>Theory of language<br />
					Language is seen as a set of structures which form a pyramid 
					of complexity from individual sounds at the lowest level, 
					through the building blocks of words, morphemes and 
					inflexions, to words and on upwards to phrases, clauses and 
					sentences (which is where the analysis usually stops).<br />
					Language is primarily a set of structures with associated 
					words.<br />
					Like this:<br />
					<img alt="pyramid" height="166" src="../../imagesgraphics/language_pyramid_structure.png" width="250" /></li>
					<li>Theory of learning<br />
					Learning is about making the language automatic and that 
					involves forming good habits.&nbsp; We need to give people 
					the ability to respond immediately and without too much 
					thought to something like:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What would you like to eat?</em><br />
					with<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll have the tomato soup and then 
					the casserole, I think.</em><br />
					In particular, we need to focus (at least as far as most 
					forms of these methodologies are concerned) on combining 
					functional words such as<em> I, you, the, then, up, across, 
					because, so</em> etc. with content words such as <em>tomato, 
					soup, casserole, think, have, want, expect</em> etc. into 
					fluently produced and structurally accurate utterances.<br />
					People will also learn if we combine the right stimulus to 
					produce the required language and reward and congratulate 
					our learners when they get things right.<br />
					We should try to avoid error.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Design<ol class="auto-style36">
					<li>The objective is to give the learners the tools they 
					need to be able to enter into a conversation or a written 
					exchange with other speakers of the language in order to get 
					things done in the situations we predict they will need to 
					operate.</li>
					<li>The syllabus is ordered accordingly around settings in 
					which we expect or predict our learners will need to 
					operate.&nbsp; We will have units of the course entitled
					<strong><em>in a coffee shop, at the negotiating table, on 
					an aeroplane, in the classroom</em></strong> and so on which 
					will be presented via visual and aural information depending on what we predict the learners will need.<br />
					The syllabus will be ordered, too, in terms of the 
					difficulty of the structures and the vocabulary items we are 
					concerned to teach bearing in mind the hierarchy we believe 
					underlies language use.</li>
					<li>Activities will include memorising dialogues and 
					repeating them on demand, matching words to pictures and the 
					places where they will be encountered, listening and 
					repeating, mechanical drills of pronunciation and other 
					items all with the aim of making our learners' output as 
					automatic as possible.<br />
					The use of the first language of the learners will be 
					avoided because translation inhibits automatisation.</li>
					<li>The teacher's role is not to explain, it is to present 
					and practise.&nbsp; In fact, the teacher should avoid 
					explanation in favour of exemplification.<br />
					The learners will mostly do as they are told and complete 
					tasks in the classroom and for homework.</li>
					<li>The materials will usually be specially designed to 
					allow easy access to simple vocabulary and structures before 
					more difficult items but control of functional words will 
					always be emphasised.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Procedure<br />
				In the classroom, use will often be made of visual and audio 
				recordings of language produced at natural speeds and requiring 
				near-instant responses to the stimuli.<br />
				Language laboratories and computer enhanced or delivered lessons 
				will be frequently used.<br />
				Learners will not be expected to respond too personally to the 
				material; theirs is a response and habituation role.<br />
				Structural issues will be tackled by exemplification of 
				patterns, never by explanation.&nbsp; Enough exposure to 
				carefully selected examples of the patterns we want people to 
				internalise will help them succeed.<br />
				Vocabulary will be introduced in unambiguous and obvious 
				settings to make the meanings clear.<br />
				The pronunciation of individual vocabulary items and longer 
				phrases will be intensively practised through repetition drills.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You may be tempted to say that these methodologies are too 
			mechanical and impersonal allowing little imaginative and personal 
			use of the language.&nbsp; However, you may also consider that 
			although you may not want the tomato soup, the ability to produce a 
			pre-formed sentence frame such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I'll have the ... and then the ...</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like some ... ?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you ... the ...</em> to ... ?<br />
			etc.<br />
			is an enormous aid to fluent speech.<br />
			In fact, native users of any language have thousands of such frames 
			at their command and they use them without conscious thought leaving 
			thinking space for the really important content.<br />
			Much speech is an automatic process and a methodology which 
			recognises this is a valuable one.</p>

				<h3>Communicative Language Teaching and Task-based Learning</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>We are taking these two methodologies together because, although 
			they differ quite markedly in terms of design and procedure, the 
			approach on which they both depend is identical.<br />
			Task-based Learning is often considered a subcategory of 
			Communicative Language Teaching but there are many who feel it is 
			different enough in terms of lesson design and procedures to form a 
			category of its own.<br />
			To see exactly how they differ, refer to the list of related guides 
			at the end.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Approach<ol class="auto-style36">
					<li>Theory of language<br />
					Language is not fundamentally a set of structures.&nbsp; It 
					is a means of communication of ideas between people.&nbsp; 
					Structure and the lexicon are the vehicle but the driving 
					force is the need to communicate.&nbsp; Whenever language is 
					produced <em>via</em> whatever medium, there lies behind it 
					a communicative purpose.<br />
					Almost any language can achieve a desired functional outcome so, for 
					example, I can say:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have any paper?<br />
					</em>and that can mean<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please give me some paper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want you to write something down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to know what you have with you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want you to give some paper to someone else</em><br />
					and many other things depending on the context, the roles we 
					are in and the intentions of ourselves and the people around 
					us.<br />
					Structural theories of language, it is argued, fall far 
					short of a systematic analysis of meaning.&nbsp; 
					Communicative approaches are all about meaning.</li>
					<li>Theory of learning<br />
					Language is communally constructed in the course of 
					communication.&nbsp; We learn language not by memorising 
					rules but under the pressure to get our meaning across in 
					the most precise and appropriate way we can.<br />
					The effort to communicate will result in the learning 
					because communication comes before structure.<br />
					We cannot and should not expect language to be perfectly 
					formed and we know, too, that making mistakes and then 
					realising where we have gone wrong so we can refine our 
					output is all part of the learning process.<br />
					We can get from<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paper!<br />
					</em>to<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you let me have some paper?<br />
					</em>not by being told what's right but by being given 
					examples in context and refining our own production to 
					conform to the social needs we encounter.<br />
					Motivation to improve comes from successful but not perfect 
					communication and error is part of that process.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Design<ol class="auto-style36">
					<li>The objective remains the same as it is for and 
					Audio-lingual or Situational methodology: it is to give the 
					learners the tools they need to be able to enter into a 
					conversation or a written exchange with other speakers of 
					the language in order to get things done in the situations 
					we predict they will need to operate.</li>
					<li>The syllabus is, accordingly, ordered around situations 
					and what is appropriate language use in them.&nbsp; We will 
					have units of the course entitled <em><strong>asking for and 
					giving personal information, persuading others to do what we 
					want, agreeing and disagreeing, explaining processes and 
					recounting events</strong></em> and so on depending on what 
					we want our learners to be able to do and, moreover, on what
					<strong>they</strong> want to be able to do.&nbsp; All the 
					target functions will be embedded in recognisable and 
					realistic settings.<br />
					The syllabus may be ordered, too, in terms of the difficulty 
					of the structures and the vocabulary items we are concerned 
					to teach but some operating in this paradigm will not 
					consider that necessary because we can, as we have seen, use 
					very simple language to realise complex functions and 
					complex language to realise elementary functions.</li>
					<li>Activities will vary very considerably.&nbsp; Task-based 
					approaches focus on achieving the aims of a task such as 
					ordering items by preference, designing procedures, carrying 
					out surveys, planning events and much more.<br />
					In other traditions, situations will be used in which to 
					insert the practice of functional language to communicate 
					and areas of human experience such as <em>talking about habits, 
					suggesting courses of action, describing oneself </em>and so on 
					will be more to the fore.</li>
					<li>The teacher's role is not to explain, it is to present 
					and enable practice.&nbsp; In a strict task-based approach 
					explanation and practice follow the achievement of the task 
					and in a strongly communicative tradition, explanations of 
					grammar and drilling of items are abjured altogether.<br />
					In other situations, it is often considered acceptable to 
					use any technique that comes to hand providing the target of 
					the process is communicative competence not structural 
					knowledge.<br />
					The learners will be far more active and will often work 
					together to complete tasks and do activities and will be 
					encouraged to make the language they are using relevant and 
					personal to them whenever that is possible.</li>
					<li>The materials will sometimes be specially designed to 
					allow easy access to simple vocabulary and functions but the 
					use of authentic, unaltered materials is generally 
					considered a useful contribution because it is the 
					complexity of the task one is set not the difficulty of the 
					materials which is the deciding factor when it comes to 
					success.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Procedure<br />
				In the classroom, use will also often be made of visual and 
				audio recordings of language produced at natural speeds but the 
				emphasis is not on immediate response but on presenting a rich 
				resource for the learners to incorporate into their own 
				production when set the task of trying to communicate personal 
				intentions.<br />
				Learners will be expected to respond personally to the material 
				and to extend their repertoire by exposure to, and active 
				noticing, of the language they see and hear.<br />
				Structural issues will be tackled in weaker and less strict 
				forms of the methodologies but by exemplification of patterns 
				and appropriacy in terms of style and setting.&nbsp; In many 
				versions of these methodologies, explanation is 
				not forbidden.<br />
				Vocabulary will be introduced in unambiguous and obvious 
				settings to make the meanings and appropriacy of use clear.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These two methodologies, which share many characteristics, 
			are now almost the only ones that many teachers employ.&nbsp; Of 
			late, there has been increasing recognition that structural issues 
			are also important and that cognitive (i.e., active thinking) 
			processes are important in acquiring the level of language accuracy 
			which is needed for precise communication.&nbsp; In other words,

				<h2>What is not methodology</h2>

			<p>It is common for some ways of doing things to be referred to as 
			method or methodology but this is to misunderstand the terms as they 
			are used in our field.&nbsp; In non-technical language, of course, 
			method just means a way of doing something but that is not how it 
			should be used in ELT.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Structuring a lesson along the lines of Test &gt; Teach &gt; Test 
				or Presentation &gt; Practice &gt; Production is not to use a 
				methodology.&nbsp; It is simply a way to arrange procedures and 
				tasks in a lesson.&nbsp; Both these structures can inhabit very 
				different methodologies.</li>
				<li>Taking an inductive approach in which learners are asked to 
				figure out the patterns and rules from language examples or a 
				deductive approach in which learners are given the rule and 
				asked to apply it to language are just ways to approach making 
				things learnable and accessible.&nbsp; Neither qualifies as a 
				methodology and neither can be used in isolation.&nbsp; This is 
				not an either-or distinction.&nbsp; Even if one starts with a 
				purely inductive approach in the classroom, the aim has to be 
				for the learners to hypothesise a rule (preferably the right 
				one) and then apply it to further examples of the target 
				language.&nbsp; The second procedure is, of course, purely 
				deductive.&nbsp; There is little point in putting learners to 
				the trouble of constructing a rule from exemplification if they 
				are not then encouraged to apply it.</li>
				<li>Making lessons learner centred by, for example, negotiating 
				the syllabus with the learners, making feedback routines come 
				from the class rather than the teacher or encouraging 
				peer-teaching and peer-correction does not count as a 
				methodology.&nbsp; It may be an approach to classroom management 
				but it is not a methodology.</li>
				<li>Even approaches taken by people who claim to be employing a 
				methodology may not really qualify.&nbsp; Dogme, for example, is an 
				approach to teaching which sits comfortably within Communicative 
				Language Teaching so it is probably better described as an 
				approach to lesson design rather than grandly calling it a 
				methodology.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the way, if you are taking or have just taken an initial 
			training course, you may be tempted to think there is something 
			called a CELTA or CertTESOL methodology.&nbsp; That is nonsense.&nbsp; 
			Initial training courses usually focus on some form of weak or 
			strong communicative methodology but that is a function of its 
			position in the profession and the training of the tutors on such 
			courses.&nbsp; There really is no such thing as a methodology 
			arising from a training programme.</p>

			language, hypotheses about learning, procedures and techniques, see
