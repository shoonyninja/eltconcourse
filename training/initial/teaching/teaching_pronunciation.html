		<h1>Dealing with pronunciation: the essential guide</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="dealing" height="207" src="../../images/woman_cards310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p>
		Especially at the beginning of their teaching careers, some people are reluctant 
		to treat pronunciation very thoroughly in the classroom.&nbsp; This is 
		because:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>It is a technical area and that's slightly intimidating</li>
			<li>They don't know what to do apart from getting learners to repeat 
			the teacher's model</li>
			<li>Teachers who are non-native speakers of English are worried that 
			their own pronunciation is faulty</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Here are some counter arguments:</p>
		<ol class="redbullet">
			<li>It is a technical area and that's slightly intimidating<ol class="redbullet">
				<li class="greybullet">Yes, it is in parts but the basics of 
			phonemic transcription can be learned in a few hours and the 
			terminology needn't be used with learners.&nbsp; It's the what of 
			pronunciation which is important not the what's-it-called.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>They don't know what to do apart from getting learners to repeat 
			the teacher's model<ol class="redbullet">
				<li class="greybullet">There are some ideas on this page for 
			getting beyond modelling</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Teachers who are non-native speakers of English are worried that 
			their own pronunciation is faulty<ol class="redbullet">
				<li class="greybullet">That's often true because it is very 
			difficult, after a certain age, to learn native-like pronunciation 
			but the teacher's production is still going to be better than most of 
			the learners' efforts.&nbsp; Teachers who are native speakers of 
			the learners' first language are often better placed than most to know 
			where the problems lie.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>So, don't shy away from teaching pronunciation.&nbsp; Most learners
		<span class="style_underline">need</span> explicit help, most learners
		<span class="style_underline">know</span> they need help and most 
		learners <span class="style_underline">appreciate</span> their teacher's 
		help in this area.</p>
		<p>For this guide it will be useful if you have followed either
		<a href="../../glossaries/glossary_ip_phonology.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
		essential phonology terminology</a> or
		<a href="../pronunciation/pronunciation_essentials.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
		the essentials of pronunciation</a> (preferably both).<br />
		If you have completed
		<a href="../../courses/transcription1/transcription.html" target="_blank">the course for learning to transcribe English phonemes</a>, that's even 
		better because this guide has to use some transcription.<br />

			If you are a native or fluent speaker of your learners' first 
			languages, you have an immediate advantage because you know where 
			the issues lie.<br />
			Most learners will attempt to impose the phonology of their first 
			language on the phonology of the language they are learning.&nbsp; 
			So, for example:</p>

						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
		
		<ul class="greenbullet">
			<li>Dutch, Danish or German speakers will often use an unvoiced consonant at the 
			end of words instead of the English voiced consonant and say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His 
			name is Bop<br />
			</em>(/hɪz.ˈneɪm.z.bɒp/)<br />instead of<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His name is Bob<br />
			</em>(/hɪz.ˈneɪm.z.bɒb/)<br />
			or:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's my back</em><br />
			(/ðæts.maɪ.ˈbæk/)<br />
			instead of<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; That's my bag</em><br />
			(/ðæts.maɪ.bæɡ/</li>
			<li>Many languages lack the 'th' sounds in words like <em>thank</em> 
			and <em>this</em> and even those that do have the sound (such as 
			Spanish or Greek) will not always differentiate between the voiced 
			/ð/ sound (in <em>this</em>) and the unvoiced /θ/ sound (in <em>
			thank</em>).&nbsp; The temptation is to use a substitute such as 
			/f/, /s/ or /z/ so a French speaker may say <em>fankyou</em>, a 
			German speaker may say <em>zankyou</em> and so on.</li>
			<li>In English, the sounds /p/, /t/ and /k/ are often aspirated at 
			the beginning of words (as in <em>pat, cat</em> and <em>tack</em> [/pʰæt/, 
			/kʰæt/ and /tʰæk/]).&nbsp; Spanish, Dutch and Russian speakers, for 
			example, may sound like they are saying <em>bat, gat</em> and <em>
			dat</em> for these words.</li>
			<li>The voiced sounds /dʒ/ and /ʒ/ (as in <em>jab</em> [/dʒæb/] and
			<em>leisure </em>[ˈle.ʒə/]) do not exist in many languages and 
			learners may use a native language alternative such as /tʃ/ or /ʃ/ 
			saying <em>chap </em>or<em> chab</em> and <em>lesher</em> 
			respectively.</li>
			<li>Many languages, such as most Slavic languages, do not make a 
			great (or any) difference between /w/ and /v/ and that results in
			<em>vite</em> for <em>white</em> etc.&nbsp; German, incidentally, 
			does make the distinction but the spelling of the /f/ sound in 
			German is often 'v', and the spelling of /v/ is often 'w' leading 
			German speakers to confuse the sounds.</li>
			<li>What are distinguished in English as full phonemes, making, for 
			example, a distinction between <em>pit</em> and <em>bit</em> (/pɪt/ 
			vs. /bɪt/) in English are not phonemes in other languages (such as 
			most varieties of Arabic) so, even if the sounds exist in the 
			learners' first languages, they may not perceive any difference 
			between <em>pox</em> and <em>box</em> or <em>cot</em> and <em>got</em> 
			and so on.</li>
			<li>On the other hand, some languages, such as Thai use /pʰ/, /kʰ/ 
			and /tʰ/ as distinct phonemes from the non-aspirated allophones /p/, 
			/k/ and /t/.</li>
			<li>Some sounds such as /h/ are often missing from languages, like 
			Greek, which do not contain it so the substitution is often with /x/ 
			as in the Scottish <em>loch</em>.</li>
			<li>Thai has a very limited number of final consonants so /d/, /s/, 
			/z/, /dʒ/, /ʒ/ /tʃ/, /ʃ/, /ð/ and /θ/ may all be replaced by /t/ or 
			left out altogether.</li>

			<li>The vowel /æ/ as in <em>sad</em> does not exist in many

			as /e/ and say <em>pet</em> for <em>pat</em>.</li>
			<li>Vowel length is extremely variable across languages so speakers 
			of many languages (Italian, Greek, French, Chinese languages etc.) 
			will often not distinguish, or <span class="style_underline">hear</span> 
			the distinction, between <em>heap</em> and <em>hip </em>(/hiːp/ vs.

			<li>Languages like Japanese, the Chinese languages and Greek have a 
			much more limited range of vowels than does English so substitution 
			is a real issue with /iː/ for /ɪ/, /e/ for /ɜː/ and many more.</li>
			<li>Speakers of Thai and other South Asian languages will sometimes 
			pronounce English diphthongs as long pure vowels so /eɪ/ becomes 
			/e:/ and /əʊ/ becomes /o:/ making <em>day</em> sound like <em>dare</em>

			<li>Timing affects the production of weak vowel sounds and broadly

		<p>This list could be considerably extended so you will need to do your 
		own research.&nbsp; If you are not a native or fluent speaker of your

		make a note of the issues you hear.&nbsp; There are useful reference 
		books such as Swan and Smith's <em>Learner English</em> (2001), Cambridge 
		University Press and internet sources, if handled with care and 
		scepticism, are often very helpful.<br />
		To help a little, here is a list of languages divided by the nature of 
		the timing of syllables and sounds.&nbsp; It is not complete and 
		disguises the fact that languages exists on a cline from highly syllable 
		timed to highly stress timed with most occupying part of the middle 
		ground:</p>

		<p>You also need to be aware of when languages do not differ so you 
		don't waste time teaching and practising the already known.<br />
		For example:
		Spanish shares 16 consonants with English, Greek even more, German 
		somewhat fewer and
		Russian shares 17 vowel sounds with English, Thai 14 but Italian only 7.</p>

			<p>
			Among teachers of English, there are two views about how to handle 
			pronunciation:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>As and when<br />
			</strong>In this view pronunciation work is 
			only undertaken when it arises naturally out of the lesson and the 
			learners' production.&nbsp; This approach:<ol class="auto-style22">
				<li>requires the teacher to be alert to and prepared for 
				problems as they arise</li>
				<li>means that pronunciation teaching is often unplanned</li>
				<li>does not allow for specially designed materials</li>
				<li>may interfere with the timing and pacing of a lesson by 
				inserting unplanned phases</li>
				<li>is instant and gratifying for learners</li>
				<li>can be short, sharp and to the point</li>
				<li>takes advantage of language needs as they emerge</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Planning</strong> a series of dedicated pronunciation 
			lessons<br />
			This approach:<ol class="auto-style22">
				<li>requires the teacher thoroughly to research the learners' 
				likely problems bearing their first language(s) in mind</li>
				<li>allows for time to plan and design targeted materials</li>
				<li>is often appreciated by learners as a sign that the teacher 
				takes the matter as seriously as they do</li>
				<li>can be effectively combined with the as-and-when approach by

		There are conflicting theories concerning the usefulness of drilling

		learning a language is essentially a process of acquiring new habits and 
		those who believe that learning involves a cognitive, thinking process.&nbsp; 
		The arguments include:</p>

			<p>Before learners can employ a listen-and-imitate strategy, they

			<img alt="access" height="133" src="../../images/doors200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			This means that the salient feature you are trying to get 
			learners to imitate is obvious to them.<br />
			If the pronunciation of a single phoneme is your target, that should 
			be the model.&nbsp; If, for example, the distinction between the 
			short /iː/ for /ɪ/ sound as in <em>pip</em> and the longer /iː/ for /ɪ/ sound 
			as in <em>peep</em> is the concern (as it often is) don't bury the sounds in 
			long tongue twisters at the modelling stage.&nbsp; Just form the two 
			vowels clearly avoiding other sounds such as the initial /pʰ/ and 
			final /p/ in both words which may also be difficult for some 
			learners.&nbsp; Why not use <em>deep</em> and <em>dip</em> instead, 
			if that's easier for your learners, or just model the vowel in 
			isolation?<br />
			Make sure that the shape of your mouth and your lips are
			<span class="style_underline">clearly</span> visible to everyone.&nbsp; 
			With some sounds, /ʊ/, /uː/, /ɔː/ and /əʊ/ as in <em>put, loose, 
			caught</em> and <em>coat</em>, respectively, it is important to get 
			the mouth shape right to be able to make the sounds accurately.&nbsp; 
			That requires lip rounding.&nbsp; The amount of rounding varies 
			and this affects the sound.&nbsp; Other vowels, such as /e/ and /iː/ 
			as in <em>bed</em> and <em>bead</em> are not rounded but the latter requires lateral stretching of the 
			mouth &ndash; say <em>cheese</em>.&nbsp; This should be obvious to 
			learners so drilling from an audio recording or even a video 
			recording is often unwise because the learners cannot see the 
			information they need.<br />
			In terms of drilling stress and, especially, intonation, some form 
			of exaggeration is often required so that the learners can easily 
			identify the pattern they are being asked to imitate.&nbsp; This is 
			particularly true for learners whose first languages exhibit a 
			narrower pitch or stress range than does English (i.e., most of 
			them).</dd>

			Obviously, you have to be drilling the sound you want the 
			learners to produce so if you have a regional accent or your first 
			language does not have the sound in question, you'll need to 
			practise a little.&nbsp; We should be aiming at enabling our 
			learners to pronounce the sounds in a regionally neutral manner.&nbsp; 
			There's nothing wrong with, e.g., having a Newcastle, Mississippi or 
			Hong Kong accent but you need to consider whether that is the accent 
			you want your learners to acquire (and whether they want it).<br />
			Be careful with stress and intonation in this, because it takes some 
			practice to be able to model a stress pattern over a sentence 
			consistently in the same way so that learners are not being given 
			conflicting messages.&nbsp; Audio taped models are useful in this 
			respect because they are unchanging.</dd>

			We need to distinguish here between the connected-speech version 
			of a sound and its citation form (i.e., when it is pronounced in 
			isolation, perhaps in a list).&nbsp; Many words change their form in 
			connected speech and, for example, while clothes is pronounced /kləʊðz/ 
			in isolation, it will often be pronounced as <em>close</em> (/kləʊz/) 
			in connected speech.<br />
			Weak forms are another obvious case.&nbsp; For example, the word <em>
			for</em> will rarely be pronounced as /fɔː/ and almost never as /fɔːr 
			/ but will usually simply be /fə/.<br />
			Even at lower levels, it pays to avoid losing naturalness for the 
			sake of clarity so be unafraid to practise contractions, elisions 
			and weak forms.</dd>

		<p>An effective model is sometimes a silent model.&nbsp; Just mouthing 
		vowels, especially, and some consonants such as the unvoiced /θ/ in <em>
		thank</em> can be as effective as saying it aloud because it allows the 
		learners to focus on mouth shape and not worry about how they sound.&nbsp; 
		You can do it like this:</p>
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width: 200px">

				<img alt="eee" height="100" src="../../images/eee100.jpg" width="100" /></td>

		<p>Actors often learn their lines by breaking up the part and learning 
		the last section first.&nbsp; Dog trainers sometimes teach the final 
		part of a command before the beginning and so do animal trainers in 
		circuses.&nbsp; The theory, such as it is, is that the learners focus on 
		the form not the meaning of what they are doing.</p>
		<p>The procedure is simple.&nbsp; Instead of drilling the whole of a 
		long word, phrase or sentence from the beginning, start at the end.&nbsp; 
		E.g.:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Don't</strong> drill: <em>inde &gt; indep<strong>e</strong>n 
			&gt; indep<strong>e</strong>ndent &gt; indep<strong>e</strong>ndently<br />
			</em>Drill instead:<em> ently &gt; p<strong>e</strong>ndently &gt; dep<strong>e</strong>ndently 
			&gt; indep<strong>e</strong>ndently</em></li>
			<li><strong>Don't </strong>drill: <em>I would &gt; I would <strong>love</strong> 
			&gt; I would <strong>love</strong> t' come <br />
			</em>Drill instead: <em>t' come &gt; <strong>love </strong>t' come &gt; 
			would <strong>love</strong> t' come &gt; I would <strong>love</strong> 
			t' come</em></li>
		</ol>

		<p>Many teachers confine themselves to drilling the whole class together 
		or drilling individuals only.<br />
		The problem with drilling the whole class, especially if it's large, is 
		that a) you can't hear everyone and b) people don't start and finish 
		together so you get an overlapping cacophony.<br />
		Here are some alternatives:</p>
		<ul class="redbullet">
			<li>Drill in small groups. If you have island tables in the room, 
			that's easy.&nbsp; If you have rows or sides of a rectangle, drill 
			one row or side at a time.&nbsp; It's easier for you and the 
			learners to hear if they are getting it right.</li>
			<li>Drill males and females separately.&nbsp; The mixed voice tones 
			when they speak together make it difficult to hear what's right and 
			wrong.</li>
			<li>Select groups to drill randomly (or, actually, quite carefully):<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>give everyone a letter and drill all the Bs, all the Ds etc.</li>
				<li>everyone wearing something red</li>
				<li>everyone wearing jeans</li>
				<li>everyone over 25</li>
				<li>everyone who drank coffee at breakfast time<br />
				etc.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>After you have modelled the target, get a learner to do the 
			group selection or decide who should repeat.</li>
		</ul>

			<p>Drilling has its critics because it is often seen as a 
			behaviourist throwback to a time when we believed that learners 
			acquired the targets by a process of imitation, repetition and the 
			acquisition of good habits.&nbsp; No longer.<br />
			If it is true that the language-learning process is one of forming 
			and adjusting hypotheses based on the input you notice, then there 
			is no obvious reason why this should not apply to the acquisition of 
			the phonological system as much as it does to the grammar and 
			lexical systems.</p>
		<p>There are three possible approaches:</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="aha" height="133" src="../../images/aha200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>An inductive approach</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>You can, of course, expose your learners to rich examples of how the 
		language is pronounced&nbsp;and assume that, being thinking animals, they 
		will eventually work out how to form the sounds of the language 
		acceptably.&nbsp; In other words, this is a modelling approach with the 
		drilling that follows it.<br />
		It might work.</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="deduce" height="133" src="../../images/deductive_holmes200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h3>A deductive approach</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>This requires a bit more work on the teacher's part.&nbsp; A 
		deductive approach to grammar, for example, involves providing the 
		learners with the rules and then letting them loose on the data to form 
		acceptable syntax.<br />
		A deductive approach to pronunciation involves telling learners 
		explicitly how the sounds are formed and getting them to follow the 
		rules to produce the sounds.<br />
		This is easier said than done because it requires some quite 
		sophisticated understanding of mouth part positioning and, especially, 
		tongue positioning for vowel sounds.<br />
		The usual way for all sounds is to use a diagram like this:<br />
		<img alt="vocal tract" height="419" src="../../imagesgraphics/vocal_tract620.png" width="620" /><br />
		</p>
		<p>Sorting out the difference between voiced and unvoiced sounds is the 
		easy part because you can get learners to place their hands on their 
		throats to feel the vibrations that voiced sounds need.</p>
		<p>Getting learners to distinguish between aspirated and non-aspirated 
		sounds is also a simple matter of getting them to hold a small piece of 
		paper in front of their mouths and try to make to move on /pʰ/, 
			/kʰ/ and /tʰ/ but not move on /p/, /k/ and /t/.</p>
		<p>Moving on to something more difficult, it is then possible to explain 
		to learners, for example, the nature of a labio-dental voiced fricative 
		(/v/) by telling them to position their bottom lips to touch the top set 
		of front teeth and blow air between them while at the same time using 
		some voice cord vibration.&nbsp; The same can be done for a range of 
		consonant sounds that cause problems.<br />
		It is easier, usually, for people to produce the unvoiced sound before 
		adding in voice so get people to produce /f/ before /v/,
		/ʧ/ before /ʤ/ and so on (i.e., <em>fan - van, chain - Jane </em>etc.).</p>
		<p>Vowels are more of a challenge but some understanding of the required 
		tongue position in terms of height above the floor of the mouth and 
		distance from the back of the mouth can actually be quite productive.&nbsp; 
		For that, you'll need a different diagram:<br />
		<img alt="vowels" height="245" src="../../imagesgraphics/vowel_grid310.png" width="320" /></p>
		<p>If you try saying <em>beat, bit, bet, about, verse, cup, cap, cruise, 
		foot, hot, fought, bark</em> you will feel the tongue position change 
		from left to right, top to bottom of the grid.&nbsp; In your mouth, 
		it'll move up and down and forward and back depending on the vowel.&nbsp; 
		If you can do this, so can your learners.<br />
		If you start with the extremes and distinguish between the sound /iː/ 
		in, e.g., <em>keys</em> and the /ɔː/ sound in <em>caught</em>, for example, it becomes 
		somewhat easier for learners to identify what they <strong>should</strong> 
		be doing.<br />
		Once learners can do some of that, you can move on to lip rounding and 
		vowel length in a similar way.<br />
		There are four defining characteristics of vowels: tongue position 
		(forward or back), tongue height (up or down), length (long or short) 
		and lip rounding (or stretching laterally)</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Now that making an audio (or even video) recording is so much simpler 
		in classrooms, it is possible to apply a consistent noticing approach to 
		the pronunciation issues your learners face.<br />
		A recording of your model (or someone else's) which learners can compare 
		to their own output is often useful to help them notice the gap between 
		their and a model production.</p>
		<p>A noticing approach can be taken with all aspects of pronunciation 
		from individual sounds, word stress, sentence stress, features of 
		connected speech up to intonation patterns across longer utterances.&nbsp; 
		Be aware, however, that the longer the targets and the more data the 
		learners have, the harder it is for them to identify the aspects you 
		need them to notice so be careful to guide and help.</p>
		<p>A noticing approach can, naturally, be combined with either a 
		deductive or an inductive approach to pronunciation work.</p>
