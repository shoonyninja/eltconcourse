			<ol id="instructions" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden;">
				<li>B is easier.&nbsp; The verb <em>close</em> is simple and 
				straightforward.&nbsp; The separation of <em>push </em>and<em> 
				to </em>is difficult to follow.</li>
				<li>B is again easier.&nbsp; The verb <em>need</em> has a quite 
				complicated grammar.&nbsp; Here, it is used for obligation but 
				at lower levels many learners will only know its meaning of <em>
				require</em>.</li>
				<li>B again.&nbsp; There are a number of issues with Sentence A:<ol class="auto-style15">
					<li>it has three pieces of information crammed into it and 3 
					verbs</li>
					<li>It has a subordinating conditional structure with <em>if</em></li>
					<li>it uses the slightly unusual meaning of <em>enter</em> 
					(which in many languages would be rendered by <em>do</em> or
					<em>make</em>)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Sentence A is easier.&nbsp; The message is broken into two 
				distinct halves.&nbsp; The use of the <em>to</em> infinitive 
				following the adjective and including a prepositional phrase is actually quite difficult to get.</li>
				<li>Sentence B again.&nbsp; We have a multi-word verb in 
				sentence B (<em>hand in</em>) which may not be understood from 
				its constituent parts.</li>
				<li>Sentence A is easier.&nbsp; Complex tenses with two 
				auxiliary verbs are hard to understand.</li>
				<li>Sentence A is certainly less polite, although tone and 
				facial expression will make it courteous, but it is easier to 
				understand.&nbsp; Sentence B relies on people being able to 
				ignore the <em>I would like you to</em> and understand the word
				<em>teams</em>.</li>
				<li>Simply saying what the target is and holding it up is very 
				much more effective than embedding the instruction in sentences.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>General rules</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Avoid multi-word verbs, such as <em>come along, hand in, 
				speak up </em>etc., at lower levels.&nbsp; They are routinely 
				misunderstood.</li>
				<li>Avoid politeness phrases such as <em>I would like you to ...</em> 
				or <em>What I would like you to do is ...</em> .&nbsp; They are 
				redundant in instructions and muddy the message.&nbsp; You can 
				be friendly and polite by facial expression and tone of voice.</li>
				<li>Avoid complex tenses when simple ones will do.</li>
				<li>Demonstrate and show people what is required whenever you 
				can.</li>
				<li>Break messages down and try to avoid coordinating or 
				subordinating conjunctions (like <em>but, and</em> or <em>if, 
				when</em> respectively).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This may all seem rather obvious but it is surprising how often 
			simple rules are forgotten under stress.</p>
			<p>Making instructions clear is a real skill that many almost never 
			master.&nbsp; The first step it to look at your lesson plan and 
			script exactly what you are going to say for each stage for which you 
			need to give an instruction.&nbsp; After a while, it becomes 
			automatic.</p>

			<h3>The general rule</h3>
			<p>There are those who will tell you that Teacher-Talking Time (TTT) 
			is always A Bad Thing.&nbsp; It is not necessarily true but the 
			<strong>quality</strong> of 
			teacher talk is important.&nbsp; See the guide to teacher talk, 
			linked below, for more on this.<br />
			The general rule is to try to keep your talking to a minimum by 
			explaining things graphically and by eliciting as much as you can 
			from your learners.&nbsp; You know the answer and your job is to get 
			your learners to see it.<br />
			It is not your job to talk about language or give mini-lectures.</p>

			<dl id="explanationlist" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<dt><strong>Clear</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is obvious.&nbsp; An explanation that the learner 
				doesn't understand wastes everyone's time.&nbsp; Whenever 
				possible, use a variety of media to explain: visuals, questions, 
				mime, sound etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>As complete as possible</strong></dt>
				<dd>It is not always possible to provide all the information and 
				it is not always desirable to try.&nbsp; What is needed is 
				called a <strong>pedagogical explanation</strong>, i.e., one 
				that provides the necessary amount of information bearing the 
				level of the learner(s) in mind.&nbsp; Overloading learners is 
				as bad as confusing them.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Unambiguous</strong></dt>
				<dd>Learners do not, especially at more elementary levels, want 
				to hear<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can sometimes say this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it depends</em><br />
				or <br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
				some cases that's possible</em><br />
				Certainty is what they crave.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Checked</strong></dt>
				<dd>There is little point in giving an explanation unless you 
				check that you have been understood.&nbsp; Just asking, "OK?" 
				or "Do you understand?" is inadequate because in many cases 
				you'll get the answer, "Yes" when the right answer is quite 
				possibly "No" or "I'm not sure".</dd>
