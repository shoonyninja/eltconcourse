		<p>When we think about what words mean, we are usually considering
		<strong>denotation</strong>, i.e., what the words signify.&nbsp; For 
		example,<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		ship = floating transport<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		table = flat surface on legs</p>

		<div id="lexis2" style="visibility: hidden">
		<p><span class="style_brown">We won't all have the same reactions but it is clear that words also have

		attributes but the others in this list clearly do depending on 
		your culture and your own attitudes.&nbsp; It's true for most English 
		speakers that <em>thrifty</em> is positive and <em>tight-fisted</em> is 
		negative, just as <em>mulish</em> is negative, usually, and <em>
		determined</em> is usually positive.<br />
		If a word we are teaching is likely to have connotations such as 
			these, we need to make sure we teach them along with the word's 
			spelling, its grammar, collocations and pronunciation.&nbsp; If you 
			are unsure about the term 'collocation' go to the
			language guide to 
			collocation, linked in the list of related guides at the end, for a short review.</span></p></div>

					<h2>What do learners need to know about words?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>This is not a complete list but it's a place to start.&nbsp; There 
		are six things that learners need to know about new words that they 
		encounter but they don't all have to be introduced at once.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Meaning</strong><br />
			Rather obviously, learners need to know what a words means but, as 
			we saw above, meaning includes both denotation and connotation so if 
			a word has a strong emotional tone, we need to tell our learners 
			about it.<br />
			Dealing with meaning is one of the most difficult things to do in a 
			classroom and also the most important.&nbsp; See below for some 
			comments about context and co-text.</li>
			<li><strong>Word class</strong><br />
			Words can inhabit more than one word class at a time and learners 
			need to know what the word's grammatical function in a sentence is.&nbsp; For 
			example, in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll bank all the money straight away</em><br />
			the word <em>bank</em> is functioning as a verb<br />
			but in<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll put all the money in the bank</em><br />
			the word is acting as a noun.<br />
			Learners always need to know in what word class a new item lives so 
			we need to show it when we present the word.&nbsp; Here's how it is 
			normally done:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seem (<span class="style_black">v.</span>)<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			seemingly (<span class="style_black">adv.</span>)<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			seemly (<span class="style_black">adj.</span>)</em><br />
			There is an essential guide to 
			word class on this site, linked below.</li>
			<li><strong>Pronunciation</strong><br />
			Learners need to be able to pronounce items they learn 
			satisfactorily.&nbsp; That means pronouncing the individual 
			syllables acceptably and also knowing where to put the stress.<br />
			We need, therefore, to mark the stress on the word when we present 
			it.<br />
			You can do this by simply putting a box above the stressed syllable, 
			like this:<br />
			<img alt="stress" height="35" src="../../imagesgraphics/word_stress1.gif" width="83" /><br />
			or you can use small circles for each syllable, making the stressed 
			one larger and/or in a different colour, like this:<br />
			<img alt="stress" height="44" src="../../imagesgraphics/word_stress2.gif" width="83" /><br />
			Pronunciation is a slightly technical area (actually very technical) 
			but modelling the pronunciation of a word is usually simple 
			(providing you know how to pronounce it).<br />
			Modelling doesn't always work very well, however, because many 
			learners simply can't hear the difference between their production 
			and the model.&nbsp; That's why many teachers use phonemic 
			transcription to help.&nbsp; (If you want to learn how to 
			transcribe, there's a link to a course on this site at the end.)<br />
			The word <em>seemingly</em>, for example, is transcribed as /ˈsiː.mɪŋ.li/ 
			and if you look carefully at the transcription, you can see five 
			facets of the pronunciation:<ol class="auto-style43">
				<li>the first vowel is quite long (/iː/) and requires a slight 
				stretching of the mouth laterally to say it correctly (say <em>
				cheese</em>).&nbsp; In transcriptions, long vowels are denoted 
				by placing ':' after them.</li>
				<li>the letters <em>ng</em> form a single sound (/ŋ/) and 
				it requires you to let the air flow out through the nose (so it's 
				called a nasal sound).</li>
				<li>the last sound in the word is similar to the first long 
				vowel but it is shorter and the same as the last sound in, e.g.,
				<em>happy</em>.</li>
				<li>there are three syllables and the transcription divides them 
				with a '.' between them<span class="auto-style44">: </span><em>see.ming.ly.</em></li>
				<li>the stress fa<span class="auto-style44">lls on the first 
				syllable and that is marked in the transcription with a small 
				raised mark, <strong>ˈ</strong>, before the syllable which is 
				stressed.</span></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Word grammar</strong><br />
			You may be surprised to learn that words have grammar associated 
			with them but many do.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is large</em><br />
			the word <em>large</em> is a simple adjective from which we can form 
			<em>larger</em> and <em>largest</em> so we can also say<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is very large</em><br />
			but in:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is enormous</em><br />
			we cannot insert <em>very</em> so<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The house is very enormous</em><br />
			is wrong but:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is truly enormous</em><br />
			is OK.<br />
			This, by the way, is all to do with the concept of gradability (to 
			which there is a guide on this 
			site, linked below) but there are lots of other sorts of word grammar.<br />
			Another critical area is to do with verbs.&nbsp; We can, for 
			example, say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I arrived</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took the money<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I expected the train</em><br />
			but we cannot say:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I stood the forest<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I arrived the hotel</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I took<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I expected</em><br />
			The reason is that some verbs in English never take an object, some 
			always take an object, some can do both and some can take two 
			objects.&nbsp; The phenomenon is called transitivity.&nbsp; For 
			more, see the guide to 
			the essentials of verbs, linked below.<br />
			If the word has some important grammar associated with it, we need 
			to make sure our learners know what it is.</li>
			<li><strong>Collocation</strong><br />
			Certain words are more likely to appear with other 
			words.&nbsp; So for example, <br />
			the word <em>torrential</em> will often precede the word <em>rain</em><br />
			We can say:<ol class="greenbullet">
				<li><em>a strong wind</em> but not <em>a heavy wind</em></li>
				<li>we can have <em>heavy rain</em> but not <em>strong rain</em></li>
				<li><em>a huge, beautiful, peaceful, sheltered garden</em> not
				<em>a thoughtful, depressed, unkind</em> 
			or <em>embarrassed</em> <em>garden</em></li>
				<li><em>make a mistake</em> but not <em>do a mistake</em></li>
				<li><em>be in a meeting, participate in a meeting, hold a 
				meeting, have a meeting</em> but not <em>do a meeting, make a 
				meeting </em>or<em> eat a meeting</em></li>
				<li><em>pay attention</em> but not <em>do attention</em></li>
				<li><em>scream loudly</em> but not <em>scream wistfully</em></li>
				<li><em>whisper quietly</em> but not <em>whisper overtly</em><br />and so on.<br />
			Any word which is used in particular collocations should be 
			presented that way.<br />
				There is a guide to 
				collocation on this site, linked below.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Spelling</strong><br />
			It is sometimes asserted that English spelling is a nightmare of 
			irregularities and exceptions and it is true that it is a tricky 
			area for everyone (not just learners of English).<br />
			However, there <span class="style_underline">are</span> rules and 
			many English words can be successfully spelled simply by listening 
			to how they are said and writing them down.<br />
			If, on the other hand, one is teaching a word like <em>plough</em>,
			<em>utterance</em> or <em>quintessential</em>, then it makes sense 
			to point out and give some practice in how they are written.&nbsp; 
			Writing a word down correctly is an aid to memory, too, of course.<br />
			For more, see the guide to spelling, linked below.</li>

					<img alt="context" height="166" src="../../images/teddybear250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Context</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table><p>Very few words mean anything at all when they stand 
		alone.&nbsp; For example, if someone says:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; teddy bear</em><br />
		the utterance carries almost no real meaning.&nbsp; Although we know what a 
		teddy bear is, nobody who didn't know would be able to guess the meaning from what 
		was said.&nbsp; However, if someone says:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little girl took her toy teddy bear with her to the park and sat 
		him on a bench in the sunshine</em><br />
		then we will be able to guess that a teddy bear is something children 
		have and something you can sit on a bench.&nbsp; That's probably enough 
		for the meaning to be clear.<br />
		If we combine that with the picture, then we have all the meaning we 
		need.<br />
		We have to present any word in two ways:</p>
		<ol class="bluebullet">
			<li>With a co-text (i.e., the words around it)</li>
			<li>With a context (i.e., <em>where, who, with whom, by whom, when, what for</em> 
			etc.)</li>

		<p>Given a context and a co-text, learners can often deduce the meaning

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Many words (particularly adjectives) live on a cline between a 
			minimal use and a more extreme meaning of the concept.&nbsp; For 
			example, words which describe size may be set on a cline from very 
			small to very large, like this:<br />
			<img alt="size" height="133" src="../../imagesgraphics/cline_size.png" width="465" /><br />
			and words which refer to movement can be similarly arranged, like 
			this, for example:<br />
			<img alt="move" height="133" src="../../imagesgraphics/cline_move.png" width="465" /><br />
			and those to do with the size of entities can be show as:<br />
			<img alt="places" height="87" src="../../imagesgraphics/cline_places.png" width="465" /></p>
			<p>You could probably draw similar diagrams to express concepts such 
			as heat (<em>freezing</em> up to <em>boiling</em>), light (<em>pitch 
			black </em>up to <em>blinding</em>), wetness (<em>arid</em> up to
			<em>inundated</em>), feelings (<em>detest</em> up to <em>adore</em>), 
			houses (<em>slum</em> up to <em>palace</em>) and so on.<br />
			As a quick way of making the relative strengths of words or the 
			attributes to describe these notions, clines like this are 
			easy to draw on a whiteboard even if you do not have time 
			to prepare them beforehand.</p>
			<p>However, there are some issues to consider:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Collocation:<br />
				Not all the words will naturally operate in the same 
				relationships.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mouse ran across the room</em><br />
				but not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The mouse galloped across the room</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A minute speck of dust</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A minute stone</em><br />
				and both<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pretty village<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pretty hamlet</em><br />
				but not<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; A pretty city</em></li>
				<li>Connotation:<br />
				Some words carry positive or negative senses for most speakers 
				so while:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ambled down to the pub</em><br />
				implies a pleasant, unhurried movement,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She crawled into the garage</em><br />
				implies an uncomfortably slow manoeuvre.<br />
				Equally, <em>infinitesimal</em> implies unimportant in a way 
				that <em>microscopic</em> does not.</li>
				<li>Definitions and relativity:<br />
				Any two speakers of English are unlikely to agree exactly where 
				on the cline certain words fit and, moreover, many are relative 
				so, for example, while a mouse is <em>tiny</em> in comparison to 
				a horse, it is <em>huge</em> in comparison to a flea.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Nevertheless, dealt with sensibly with due regard to these 
			issues, clines are a useful way to embed the concepts.&nbsp;</p>
