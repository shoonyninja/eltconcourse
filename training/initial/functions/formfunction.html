		<h1>Form, function, meaning</h1>
	
		<img alt="form and function" height="207" src="../../images/birds_heron310.jpg" width="310" /><p>To understand a little about this area, it's necessary to distinguish 
		between two basic forms of language analysis:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>formal theories of language<a name="1"></a></li>
			<li>functional theories of language</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Can you make a stab at 
		the difference?&nbsp; 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'form1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here for an answer</a>.</p>
		<div id="form1" style="visibility: hidden">
			<ol class="auto-style6">
				<li>Formal theories of language are concerned with defining the 
				different elements of the language (verbs, nouns etc.) in a way 
				that explains how they operate with each other.&nbsp; A good deal of 
				the language analysis on this site takes this approach.</li>
				<li>Functional approaches start from the understanding that 
				language is primarily a tool for getting meaning across and that 
				it is best analysed by looking at the functions bits of the 
				language actually perform.</li>
			</ol>
			</div><p>Examples may help.<br />
			In everyday life, away from the analysis of language, we are 
			actually more interested in the function of things than the labels 
			we put on them.&nbsp; For example, when faced with something that 
			looks like this:<br />
			<img alt="door" height="133" src="../../images/door_knob200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			we would normally ask something 
			like<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where does that door lead?</em><br />
			rather than<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's that?</em><br />
			when we hope for an answer such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the garden</em><br />
			In fact, the question <em>What's that?</em> when referring to a door is likely to raise an 
			eyebrow.<br />
			In this 
			case, asking<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's that?</em><br />
			would probably elicit:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you think it is?</em></p>
			<p>On the other hand, when faced with:<br />
			<img alt="press" height="133" src="../../images/press200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			then the question:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's that?</em><br />
			is more legitimate and the answer you are likely to get is more 
			informative.&nbsp; It might be something like:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure.&nbsp; It looks like an early 
			printing press or something.</em></p>
			<p>In the classroom, especially with learners at lower levels, 
			teachers can often be trapped into asking questions such as:<br />
			<img alt="pencil" height="133" src="../../images/hand_pencil200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's this?<br />
			</em>expecting an answer:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a pencil<br />
			</em>which is, of course, not an example of real communication at 
			all because, unless one is talking to quite unusual people, it is 
			clear to everyone what the thing in question is and all the teacher 
			is really asking is<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know the name for this in English?<br />
			</em>and, if that really is the question, learners may be forgiven 
			for asking:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then why didn't you ask me that question?<br />
			</em>It may also be the case that the teacher is encouraging the 
			learner to demonstrate that she can use the verb phrase <em>It's
			</em>and follow it with a suitable noun.&nbsp; That is a reasonable 
			focus on form but the exchange is still not anything like real 
			communication.</p>
			<p>We can, therefore analyse any piece of language two ways.&nbsp; 
			Take, for example, something said such as:</p>
			<p class="auto-style24"><em><strong>My house is on the corner</strong></em></p>
			<p>We can analyse that two ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>The formal way:</strong><br />
				We have 6 words divided into three parts, like this:<ol class="auto-style25">
					<li><span class="style_black"><strong>my</strong></span> +
					<span class="style_black"><strong>house</strong></span> = 
					the subject of the sentence, made up from a possessive 
					determiner (<span class="style_black"><em>my</em></span>) + 
					a simple noun (<span class="style_black"><em>house</em></span>)</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><strong>is</strong></span> = 
					the verb which links the first two words to the rest of the 
					sentence</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><strong>on</strong></span> +
					<span class="style_black"><strong>the</strong></span> +
					<span class="style_black"><strong>corner</strong></span> = a 
					phrase telling us where something is, made up from
					<span class="style_black"><em>on</em></span> (a preposition) 
					+ <span class="style_black"><em>the</em></span> (an article) 
					+ <span class="style_black"><em>corner</em></span> (a noun)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>The functional way:</strong><br />
				We have a simple utterance of six words and it might mean:<ol>
					<li><em><span class="style_black">Please stop there and let me out</span> </em>
					(passenger to driver)</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em>This will help you to find my house</em></span> 
					(giving instructions)</li>
					<li><em><span class="style_black">My house has a bigger garden than most of them in my 
					street</span> </em>(explaining a fact)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This simple sentence might mean a number of other things 
			depending on who is talking to whom, where they are and what they 
			need to communicate.</p>

			</table>
			<p >Functional approaches to 
			teaching the language came into vogue in the 1970s and have remained 
			to the fore ever since.&nbsp; More recently, there has been 
			something of a resurgence of interest in combining formal approaches 
			(understanding and learning structure) with communicative approaches 
			(learning to get things done in the language).&nbsp; Here's a 
			quotation from a leading theorist in the field:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">&nbsp;... language learning is essentially learning how grammar 
			functions in the achievement of meaning and it is a mistake to 
			suppose otherwise.<br />
			&nbsp;.... A communicative approach does not involve the rejection of 
			grammar. On the contrary, it involves a recognition of its central 
			mediating role in the use of and learning of language.”<br />
			<span class="auto-style18">Widdowson (1990: 97/8)</span></p>
		<p>The moral is that our learners need both types of information: 
		formal, <strong>linguistic competence</strong> to make structurally 
		correct language and <strong>communicative competence</strong> to <em>
		use </em>the language appropriately.<br />
		Ideally, many believe, lessons should combine both approaches so that learners are 
		confident that they are getting the language right and able to see what 
		communicative ends the language serves.</p>

			<li>structural (the functions of the modal <em>should</em>)</li>
			<li>pragmatic (the <strong>intended</strong> meaning behind saying

			<li>semantic (the meaning of <em>bank</em>)</li>

			<h3>How many functions are there?</h3>
		<p>Lots.&nbsp; However, it's quite easy to find lists which include 
		items such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; giving / getting permission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; asking for and giving 
		factual information<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apologising and accepting apologies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expressing 
		hopes and wishes<br />
		</em>and so on.<br />
		Two key publications are from the Council of Europe and are available on 
		the web:<br />
		<a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Waystage_CUP.pdf" target="_blank">
		Waystage 1990 by Van Ek and Trim</a><br />
		<a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Threshold-Level_CUP.pdf" target="_blank">
		Threshold 1990 by Van Ek and Trim</a><br />
		Waystage contains a long list of functions and notions for lower levels 
		and Threshold does the same for more advanced learners.&nbsp; Warning: 
		these are large files.<br />
		If you want a manageable list of 68 basic functions, there is one in
		<a href="functionsessentials.html">the introduction to functions</a>.</p>
		<h3>Adjacency pairs</h3>
		<p>Functions often come in pairs, because one function often requires 
		its counterpart(s).&nbsp; For example, asking for someone's name is a 
		useful function to control but less so if you don't know how to respond 
		by introducing yourself.&nbsp; Here are some more adjacency pairs with 
		examples:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tablebrownborder">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style16" style="width: 50%">apologising</td>
				<td class="auto-style23">accepting or rejecting apologies</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style16" style="width: 50%"><em>I'm awfully 
				sorry<br />
				Excuse me!<br />
				Sorry!</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style23"><em>That's OK<br />
				Not just now<br />
				No you aren't</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%">asking for 
				permission</td>
				<td class="auto-style17">granting or denying permission</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%"><em>May I see you 
				for a minute?<br />
				Can I ask a question?<br />
				Will you let me help?</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style17"><em>Yes, of course<br />
				Wait till I have finished<br />
				No</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%">asking directions</td>
				<td class="auto-style17">giving directions</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%"><em>Can you tell me 
				where the station is?<br />
				Is this the right way to the beach?</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style17"><em>Yes, it's at the end of the next 
				road on the left<br />
				I don't know</em></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		
			<p>and, of course, it makes sense to teach and practise them 
			together.&nbsp; There's not much point in being able to ask for 
			permission 3 different ways if you are unlikely to understand the response.<br />
			You may also have noticed that many functions have alternate 
			responses: positive, negative and somewhere in the middle, called 
			temporising.</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="one and many" height="166" src="../../images/navy250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>One function, many forms</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>The other side of the coin is that we can use a number of forms to 'realise' 
		the same function.&nbsp; If I want to advise you, I can say, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You 
		should see a doctor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You ought to get to the doctor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think it wouldn't be a good idea to see a doctor?<br />
		</em>etc.<br />

			<tr class="auto-style6">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's 
				near the pub on the corner of the park</em>.<br />
				If you are a complete stranger, I'll have to be much more 
				explicit and use something like<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go straight along the High 
				Street until you see Waterstone's on your left.&nbsp; Take the 
				first right after that and then you'll see the bank at the end 
				of the street.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Relationships and roles</strong></dt>
				<dd>If one party is more powerful than the other (in this 
				setting) then different language is employed.<br />
				Asking someone to sit down could take the form of<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please sit 
				there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sit, boy!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if I could ask you to sit here<br />
				</em>or whatever.</dd>
				<dt><strong>The medium</strong></dt>
				<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I speaking or writing?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If I'm writing, is it an 
				email or a letter?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is this a formal lecture or a chat?<br />
				Things like this will affect the kind of language I choose.&nbsp; 
				Will I start with<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear sir,</em>?<em><br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I need to 
				introduce myself?<br />
				etc.</dd>

				<li><strong>Intention:</strong><br />
				We need to be clear about what certain forms say about the 
				purposes of the user.&nbsp; We can only introduce and practise 
				language successfully if the learners are aware of what they 
				want to <strong>do</strong> with the language and how they want 
				to appear.</li>
				<li><strong>Context and setting:</strong><br />
				You can't learn, use or understand language in a vacuum.&nbsp; 
				Formal grammar exercises and drilling have their place, 
				allegedly, but when introducing or practising language forms we 
				need to set a clear context and the learners also need to know 
				where and when they are using the target language.</li>
				<li><strong>Relationships and roles:</strong><br />
				In the classroom, relationships between the teacher and the 
				learners and between learners are often informal and equal.&nbsp; 
				Outside, in the real world, that's often not the case so we need 
				to set up scenarios in which learners can practise choosing the 
				appropriate language.</li>
				<li><strong>The medium:</strong><br />
				If we are practising either speaking or writing, we need to have 
				the audience and the speaker / writer's role in mind at all times.</li>
