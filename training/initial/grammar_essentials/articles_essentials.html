	<h1>The essential guide to the article system</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="articles" height="207" src="../../images/bricabrac310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p>Articles in English form a sub-class of determiners.&nbsp; 
		If you want the overview first, therefore, you should look at
		<a href="../lexis/determiners_essentials.html" target="_blank">the 
		essential guide to determiners</a> 
		(new tab).</p>
			<p>This guide covers the essentials only (there is a link to a more 
			comprehensive one in the in-service section in the list of related 
			guides at the end) and focuses only on English which happens to have 
			a reasonably well-developed article system.<br />
			However, at the outset, you should be aware of the fact that 
			languages differ:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li>Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, Bosnian, Czech etc.) as 
				well as Chinese languages, Indonesian, Japanese, Hindi and Urdu 
				do not have an article system.</li>
				<li>Turkish, Persian languages and Arabic (which often encodes the definite 
				article as a prefix) have no indefinite article.</li>
				<li>Many other European languages have an article system but the 
				rules are different and may be transferred into English by 
				learners.</li>
				<li>A wide range and large number of languages have gender 
				systems of some sort and the gender of a noun is often 
				recognisable by the form of the article its takes.&nbsp; English 
				does not do this but shows other characteristics of a noun by 
				the article choice.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>English has three sorts of articles.&nbsp; Here are six examples, 
			showing two incidents of each of the English articles.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>That's an interesting idea</em></li>
				<li><em>He went to the museum</em></li>
				<li><em>Do not wash in hot water</em></li>
				<li><em>Give me a piece of that</em></li>

			</table>
			<ol id="articles1" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li>The indefinite article occurs in:<br />
				Sentence 1.: <em>That's <span class="style_black"><strong>an</strong></span> 
				interesting idea</em><br />
				and<br />
				Sentence 4. <em>Give me <span class="style_black"><strong>a</strong></span> 
				piece of that<br />
				</em>In English this is either <em>a </em>or <em>an</em> but some 
				will include <em>some</em> as a plural indefinite article.<br />
				The article <em>an </em>occurs slightly irregularly.<br />The general rule is that we 
				use<em> an
				</em>before a vowel 
				sound, but we use <em>a </em>before a consonant sound and in 
				both cases disregard how the word is spelled because this is a 
				pronunciation issue.&nbsp; So we get, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>an </strong></span>artist<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>a </strong></span>sculptor<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>a </strong></span>European issue
				</em>(because the first sound in <em>European</em> is pronounced 
				as a consonant like '<em>y</em>')<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>an </strong></span>honourable man
				</em>(because the '<em>h</em>' is silent)<br /><em></em>When the /h/ sound is very 
				weak, many British English speakers will 
				also use <em>an </em>instead off <em>a </em>so we have::<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an historic moment<br />
				</em>but if the /h/ sound is clear, we choose <em>a</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's <span class="style_black"><strong>a</strong></span> 
				happy woman</em></li>
				<li>The definite article occurs in:<br />
				Sentence2.: <em>He went to <span class="style_black"><strong>the</strong></span> 
				museum</em><br />
				and<br />
				Sentence 5.: <em><span class="style_black"><strong>The</strong></span> Ambassador is coming</em><br />
				In English, there is only one unchanging definite article but it 
				is pronounced in two different ways, and it doesn't matter about 
				the spelling.<br />
				It is pronounced with a long 'e' sound /ði/ before a vowel sound 
				(so rhymes with <em>she, see, me</em> etc.)<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>the</strong></span> apple </em>(/ðiˈæp.l̩/)<br />
				It is pronounced with a very short sound /ðə/ before a consonant 
				(so it rhymes with <em>her, fur, sir</em> etc.)<br />
				For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>the</strong></span> man </em>(/ðə.mæn/)<br />
				(There are times when <em>the</em> is pronounced differently 
				depending on how a word is stressed and that is explained in the 
				in-service guide to this area, linked below.)</li>
				<li>The zero article: is the most difficult one to spot because 
				it isn't there!&nbsp; It occurs in:<br />
				Sentence 3: <em>Do not wash in <span class="style_black">
				<strong>&Oslash;</strong></span> hot water</em><br />and<br />
				Sentence 6.: <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash;</strong></span> <em>Houses are expensive here</em><br />
				As the name implies, this is an absence of an article and is 
				usually represented as &Oslash;.<br />
				We call this the zero article instead of saying that there is no 
				article because the idea is still present and there are rules, 
				as we shall see, for how this is used in English which are 
				different from other languages.</li>

					<h2>Three key concepts in English</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Notice that we say '<em>in English</em>' here.&nbsp; English 
			speakers need to have a clear concept of what they are talking about 
			before they can use the article system properly but the concepts are 
			different from many languages.<br />
			French and Spanish speakers, for example, need to know what gender 
			(masculine or feminine) a noun is before they can use an article but 
			English makes different demands on its speakers.<br />
			Before you can teach the system, you need to have these three 
			concepts very clear in your head (and so do the learners).</p>
			<p>These are the concepts:&nbsp;</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Is this noun definite or indefinite?</strong><br />
				This means we need to decide if we are talking about
				<span class="style_underline"><strong>any</strong></span> 
				example of the noun or <span class="style_underline"><strong>
				this</strong></span> example of the noun.&nbsp; It is the 
				difference between:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>A</strong></span> 
				salesman came to <span class="style_black"><strong>the</strong></span> 
				door</em><br />
				in which we know what sort of person came but we do not know who 
				came exactly.&nbsp; In other words we know <strong>what</strong> 
				he was but not <strong>who</strong> he was.<br />
				We say <em>the</em> door because we are not talking about <em>
				any door</em>: we probably mean <em>my front door</em> and we 
				both know about it and again, here we know both <strong>what</strong> 
				it was and <strong>which</strong> it was.<br />
				When a noun is used indefinitely, we know only what kind of 
				thing it is.<br />
				When a noun is used definitely, we know two things:<ol class="auto-style81">
					<li>what kind of thing or person it is and</li>
					<li>which or who it is</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Are we using the noun in a specific or 
			non-specific (or generic) way?</strong><br />
				When we say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>A</strong></span> 
				salesman came to <span class="style_black"><strong>the</strong></span> 
				door<br />
				</em>We are being specific because we have identified the sort 
				of person and we have been very clear about which door.<br />
				However, if we say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash;</strong></span> 
				Salespeople knock on<span class="style_black"><strong> &Oslash;
				</strong></span>doors</em><br />
				we are not being specific at all.&nbsp; We are talking about 				<strong>all salespeople in general</strong> and <strong>all 
				doors in general</strong>.&nbsp; That is what is meant by 
				generic reference.</li>
				<li><strong>Is it a mass or count noun?</strong><br />
				If you have followed the guide to countability (linked below) 
				this will be a familiar idea.<br />
				When we say, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash;</strong></span> 
				Butter is good for you</em><br />
				we are using <em>butter</em> as a mass noun but when we say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash;
				</strong></span>Dogs need a lot of care and attention</em><br />
				we are using <em>dogs</em> as a count noun and making it plural.<br />
				We can't make a mass noun plural and we cannot use it with a 
				plural verb form so we cannot have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Butters are good for you<br />
				</em>There are four rules here worth making clear:<ol class="auto-style81">
					<li>A count noun in the plural can appear with the zero 
					article:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parrots are interesting birds</em></li>
					<li>A count noun in the singular cannot appear with the zero 
					article:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Parrot is interesting bird</em></li>
					<li>A mass noun can stand with the zero article:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food for parrots must be carefully 
					selected</em></li>
					<li>A mass noun cannot appear with the indefinite article:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A food for parrots must be chosen 
					carefully</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>

				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Decide what you are talking about.&nbsp; There are <strong>only</strong>  
		three choices:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>One or some of many &ndash; indefinite but specific reference.</strong><br />
			This means that the speaker / writer is referring to a specific 
			<strong>class</strong> of nouns but not to the specific <strong>instance</strong> of the noun.<br />
			For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><span class="style_black"><strong>A </strong></span>man arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash; </strong></span>People arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash;</strong></span> Information got lost<br />
			</em>In these examples, we only know what sort of 
			noun is in question (i.e., we are specific about the <strong>sort</strong> of noun) but 
			we do not 
			know any more about the noun (i.e., we are indefinite about <strong>exactly</strong> 
			what is being talked about).<br />
			The reference is <strong>indefinite but specific</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>All of them, everywhere &ndash; generic reference.</strong><br />
			This 
			also means the speaker / writer is referring to a whole <strong>class</strong> of nouns, 
			not a single <strong>instance</strong> of the class.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>The</strong></span> wheel was an important invention<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>A</strong></span> solicitor deals with legal matters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash; </strong></span>Doctors charge a lot in my country<br />
			</em>This is different from point 1. because in these examples, the speaker / writer is referring not to
			<strong>single</strong> instances of the nouns but to <strong>the whole class</strong> of nouns in 
			general.<br />
			The reference is, then, <strong>generic but indefinite </strong>
			(because nothing is being singled out).</li>
			<li><strong>This one exactly &ndash; definite 
			<span class="style_underline">and</span> specific reference.</strong><br />
			This 
			means the speaker / writer is referring to a single, known instance 
			of the noun.&nbsp; We are not being vague and indefinite and we are 
			not talking about a class of the noun.&nbsp; We are being both 
			definite and specific.<br />
			For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>The</strong></span> man spoke to me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash; </strong></span>London is the capital of Britain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>The</strong></span> wind is getting stronger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash; </strong></span>Sugar is 
			on the shelf over there<br />
			</em>Here, the reference is both definite (we know <strong>which</strong> noun is 
			being referred to) and specific (we know <strong>what</strong> sort of noun is in 
			question).<br />
			The reference is <strong>definite and specific</strong>.</li>

		<p>Now we can start to select the right articles depending on what we 
		are talking about.<br />
		In each of these categories, there's a choice of which article to 
		use.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>If we are talking about indefinite but specific reference (<strong>one of 
		many or some of many</strong>), we can have, e.g.,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<em><span class="style_black"><strong>A</strong></span> man came in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash; </strong></span>Men 
		came in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash; </strong></span>Good furniture is expensive<br />
				</em>And the rules for mass and count noun articles which we 
				identified above come into play.&nbsp; We cannot have:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash; </strong></span>
				Man came in<br />
				</em>because count nouns in the singular must take a determiner.<br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<span class="style_black"><strong>A</strong></span> 
				good furniture<br />
				</em>because mass nouns cannot take the indefinite article.</li>
				<li>If we are talking about generic reference (<strong>all of 
				them or it, everywhere</strong>), we can have<em>:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>A</strong></span> car is useful in the country<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash; </strong></span>Cars pollute<br /></em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash; </strong></span>Petrol is expensive<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
				<strong>The</strong></span> cat is an independent animal<br />
				</em>And, again, the rules for mass and count noun use apply.</li>
				<li>If we are talking about definite specific reference (<strong>this 
		one or amount exactly</strong>), we can have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>The</strong></span> car is outside<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<span class="style_black"><strong>The</strong></span> sugar is 
		in the cupboard<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
				<strong>The</strong></span> guests are here<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>&Oslash; </strong></span>Great Britain is an island</em></li>

			<p>It matters if the noun is countable or uncountable (i.e., a mass 
			noun), singular or 
		plural.<br />
			English is not unique but it does has a fundamental and very 
			important distinction between mass and count nouns.&nbsp; Languages 
			which do not have this distinction (or in which the distinction is 
			not grammatically significant) generally have much simpler article 
			systems, or none at all.&nbsp; It is almost impossible to use a noun 
			correctly in English unless one has first considered whether it is 
			being used as a mass noun or a count noun.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, Rule 3 is quite simple:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style80">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style75">&nbsp;</td>
					<td class="auto-style70" style="border-top-color: #663300; border-top-width: 1px">Count nouns</td>
					<td class="auto-style77" style="border-top-color: #663300; border-top-width: 1px">Mass nouns</td>

					<td class="auto-style78"><em>the pictures<br />
					&Oslash; 
					pictures</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			To put that table into words we'll repeat ourselves a little:<ol>
				<li>Singular count nouns must take <em>a/an</em> or <em>the</em>.&nbsp; 
				We allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parcel is here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A parcel is here</em><br />
				but not:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *Parcel is here</em></li>
				<li>Plural count nouns must take <em>the</em> or <em>&Oslash;.&nbsp;
				</em>We allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parcels are here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parcels are here</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A parcels are here</em></li>
				<li>Mass nouns must take <em>the</em> or <em>&Oslash;</em>.&nbsp; We 
				allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The packaging is expensive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Packaging is expensive</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A packaging is expensive</em></li>

		<p>The English article system is often wrongly presented as an 
		impossibly difficult area.&nbsp; As we saw, however, the rules are quite 
		simple.&nbsp; There are, however, a few quirks and exceptions concerned 
		with the use of the definite article.&nbsp; Many of these, however, can 
		be traced back to the rules above.<br />
		These aren't lesson topics &ndash; they should be taught as and when 
		they arise.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The known-unknown rule<br />
			This is a supplementary rule for teaching purposes because it is 
			actually covered in the rules we have seen so far.<br />
			It is, however, quite teachable and concerns when the noun has been mentioned or it can be assumed 
			that a unique reference is intended <strong>and understood</strong>.<br />
			So we get, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A car drove by and the driver waved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
			toilet's probably upstairs<br />
			</em>etc. because a car only has one driver and most houses only 
			have one toilet.<br />
			In the following:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bought <span class="auto-style62">
			<strong>a</strong></span> new car.&nbsp;
			<span class="auto-style62"><strong>The</strong></span> car broke 
			down on her first journey</em>.<br />
			the explanation
			is:<ol class="auto-style5">
				<li>in the first instance, we are referring to an <strong>indefinite</strong> 
				specific reference for a countable noun and that, as we saw, 
				requires the indefinite article.</li>
				<li>in the second instance, we are now referring to a <strong>definite</strong> 
				specific reference for a countable noun (because we now know 
				that the car was hers) and that requires the 
				use of the definite article.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>When a noun is modified (by saying who, what, which or where 
			something or someone is), it's also a sign of definite specific 
			reference.<br />
			So we get, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who is married to the Minister<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author of this guide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl in the corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flowers in her window<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>Unique objects (or objects unique in a certain shared setting):
			<em>the sun, the moon, the Milky Way, the queen, the president </em>
			etc.&nbsp; A subset of this category contains things like 
			nationalities, geographical areas and superlatives: <em>the Greeks, 
			the French, the biggest building, The Atlantic </em>etc.<br />
			The last of those 
			can be explained by noting that the modifier has been omitted: <em>
			The Atlantic (Ocean),
			The (River) Amazon, The Tate (Gallery) The Alps (Range), The Hilton 
			(Hotel).&nbsp; </em>Note the convention to capitalise the article in 
			some cases.&nbsp; Plural countries always take the article: <em>The 
			Netherlands, The Bahamas, The Seychelles.</em></li>
			<li>Families count as plural definite specific reference: <em>Take 
			tea with the Windsors</em></li>
			<li>Rivers always take the definite article<em> the</em>, even if 
			they aren't unique: <em>The Stour, The Thames, The Nile.&nbsp;
			</em>Lakes don't usually but modification (<em>The Great Lakes</em>)<em>
			</em>occurs.</li>
