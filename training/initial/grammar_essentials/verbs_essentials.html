			<h1>Verbs: the essentials</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="activities" height="207" src="../../images/four_activities310.png" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This guide covers the essentials that you need to know.&nbsp; 
			There are links below and at the end to take you to guides which explain the 
			different types of verbs in English in more depth.</p>
			<p>For the purposes of this guide, a verb is defined as<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a word used to describe an action, 
			state, or occurrence</em></span></p>
			<p>So, taking the four pictures above we can construct sentences containing
			<strong>verbs</strong> as follows:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>The lake <strong>is</strong> lovely<br />
				</em>describing a state</li>
				<li><em>They <strong>have played</strong> the sonata<br />
				</em>describing an occurrence</li>
				<li><em>She <strong>sat</strong> bedside her dog<br />
				</em>describing an action</li>
				<li><em>She <strong>must</strong> <strong>study</strong> for an 
				examination<br />
				</em>describing a state</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In these cases, the verbs are performing slightly different 
			functions, as we shall see.</p>

			<h2>Three sorts of verbs</h2>
					<h3>Fundamentally in English, and many (but not all) other languages, 
			there are three types of verb.</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Lexical or main verbs</strong><ol class="auto-style2">
					<li>Examples: <em>smoke, go, enjoy, imagine, come, decide, think, 
				spin </em>etc.</li>
					<li>Meaning: these verbs carry intrinsic meaning.&nbsp; Even 
					in isolation, for example, a statement such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jump!<br />
					</em>can be understood and the verb can be defined.</li>
					<li>Form: these verbs alter according to predictable, if 
					sometimes irregular, patterns.<br />They often change form to show:<ol class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>person<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
				smoke<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					she smoke<strong>s</strong></em></li>
						<li>tense<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I come<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I c<strong>a</strong>me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I imagine<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I imagine<strong>d</strong></em></li>
						<li>aspect<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I 
				<strong>decide</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					I <strong>am</strong> decid<strong>ing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						</strong>I <strong>have</strong> decide<strong>d</strong></em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Auxiliary verbs</strong><ol class="auto-style2">
					<li>Types<ol class="auto-style51">
						<li>Modal auxiliary verbs, for example:<br />
						<em>can, may, might, should, 
					must, could<br />
						</em>etc. occurring in, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She may be late<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They might complain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should go now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must get the car fixed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could understand</em></li>
						<li>Primary auxiliary verbs, for example:<br /><em>have, get, be, do<br />
						</em>occurring in, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spent the money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the car fixed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is writing to him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you understand?</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Meaning<br />
					Auxiliary verbs do not carry meaning alone so, for example:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do</em><br />
					are all meaningless unless we know what the main verb is or 
					we state it.<ol class="auto-style51">
						<li>Modal auxiliary verbs express the speaker / writer's 
						viewpoint concerning the main verb so, for example:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <strong>must</strong> study<br />
						</em>expresses the speaker's view of obligation<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <strong>might</strong> not be 
						at home<br />
						</em>expresses the speaker / writer's view of likelihood<br />
						and so on.</li>
						<li>Primary auxiliary verbs express how the main verb 
						should be understood in relation time and to other 
						events so, for example:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John <strong>has</strong> read 
						the book</em><br />
						expresses two things:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) the reading of the book is a finished past event and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) the reading of the book has changed the present in some 
						way so now we can follow it with something like<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and he can tell you what he 
						thinks about it.</em><br />
						Other primary auxiliary verbs can express ongoing 
						actions or states as in<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She </em><strong><em>is</em></strong><em> 
						still running the company</em><br />
						These verbs also signal question forms as in<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Do</strong> you want 
						anything else?<br />
						</em>passive ideas as in<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <strong>was</strong> taken to 
						hospital<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <strong>got</strong> hurt in the accident<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter <strong>had</strong> his house decorated<br />
						</em>and imperatives as in<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Do</strong>n't take that!</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Form:<ol class="auto-style51">
						<li>Many modal auxiliary verbs do not show changes 
					for person, tense and aspect but some do so we can change, 
						e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <em>can</em> swim well<br />
					to<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could swim well<br />
						</em>We cannot, however, change <em>must</em> to <em>musted</em> etc.<br />
						We can also change form to show person with some modal 
						auxiliary verbs, for example, changing<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to go<br />
						</em>to<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has to go<br />
						</em>and we can show some aspects as in, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She should have finished by now<br />
						</em>etc.</li>
						<li>Primary auxiliary verbs change form much like 
						lexical or main verbs although they are all irregular, e.g.:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had the car fixed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have got the house painted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were arrested<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you get the money?</em></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Copular verbs</strong><ol class="auto-style2">
					<li>Meaning<br />
					These verbs act to link noun subjects to some kind of 
					attribute or make it equivalent to another noun.&nbsp; The 
					archetypal copular verb is <em>be </em>but there are a 
					number of other verbs that act in the same way.&nbsp; For 
					example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <strong>is</strong> a doctor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That <strong>seems</strong> interesting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <strong>appear</strong> tired<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That <strong>smelt</strong> terrible</em></li>
					<li>Form: these verbs alter to show number, tense and aspect 
					just like main or lexical verbs so we have, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She
					<strong>became</strong> the Chief Executive<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
					<strong>was</strong> 
					<strong>getting</strong> angry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <strong>seemed</strong> a little tired<br />
					</em>etc.</li>

			<h2>Lexical or main verbs</h2>
					<h3>These verbs carry intrinsic meaning</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We can categorise lexical or main verbs in a number of ways.&nbsp; The 
			first two categories are the really crucial ones.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Intransitive verbs</strong><br />
				Some verbs never take an object and can stand alone.&nbsp; We 
				can say, for example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <strong>came</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <strong>responded</strong><br />
				</em>etc.,
				and 
				the meaning is clear.<br />
				However, for example, we cannot say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She arrived the hotel<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *It occurred the rain<br />
				</em>because neither of these verbs 
				can refer to a noun directly, i.e., they cannot take an object.&nbsp; We can, and frequently do, 
				insert a preposition to get, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She arrived <strong>at</strong> the hotel<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It occurred <strong>to</strong> me<br />
				</em>but the verb is still not taking 
				an object in these cases.<br />
				Other examples of generally intransitive verbs include<br /><em>agree, appear, belong, collapse, die, disappear, exist, 
				fall, go, happen, inquire, laugh, live, look, remain, respond, 
				rise, sit, sleep, stand, stay, vanish, wait.<br />
				</em>Most of these can be followed by a prepositional phrase 
				such as<em> about the weather, at six o'clock, of hunger </em>
				and so on but these are <strong>not</strong> objects of the 
				verb.&nbsp; Technically, they are referred to as <strong>
				complements</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Transitive verbs</strong><br />
				Verbs which are always transitive must have an object complement.<br />
				For example, we cannot have a sentence such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He brought<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She sent<br />
				</em>because the verbs <em>bring</em> and <em>send
				</em>must have an object to make any sense.&nbsp; We need to 
				know both who or what did it and what or who it was done to.<br />
				Other examples of generally transitive verbs include: <em>buy, 
				cost, get, give, make, owe, pass, show, take, tell.<br />
				</em>We can divide transitive verbs into two more categories:<ol class="auto-style2">
					<li>Those transitive verbs which can take only one object.&nbsp; 
					These are called <strong>monotransitive</strong> verbs.&nbsp; 
					For example, we can say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <strong>drank</strong> the coffee<br />
					</em>but 
					not<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She drank me the coffee</em>.<br />
					Other examples 
					of verbs which only take one object when they are transitive 
					include <em>eat, say, play, expect, remember, suspect</em>.</li>
					<li>Those transitive verbs that can take two objects.&nbsp; These 
					are verbs which are <strong>ditransitive</strong>.&nbsp; For 
					example, we can say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <strong>bought</strong> the drinks<br />
					</em>and that's 
					a verb with a single object (<em>the drinks</em>) but we can 
					also say<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <strong>bought</strong> us the drinks<br />
					</em>and here we have 
					two objects, <em>the drinks</em> (the <strong>direct object</strong>) 
					and <em>us</em> (the <strong>indirect object</strong>).<br />
					Another example is<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <strong>sold</strong> me the car<br />
					</em>which has a 
					direct object (<em>the car</em>) and an indirect object (<em>me</em>).<br />
					We can also change the order and put the 
					indirect object at the end but then we have to insert a 
					preposition:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bought the drinks <strong>for</strong> us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
					sold the car <strong>to</strong> me<br />
					</em>Other examples of verbs which can or even must be 
					ditransitive include<br /><em>allow, appoint, ask, 
					assure, award, bake, bet, bring, buy, call, cause, charge, 
					cook, cost, cut, deal, do, draw, feed, find, get, give, 
					hand, lend, make, offer, order, owe, pass, pay, promise, 
					read, save, sell, send, show, teach, tell, throw, wish, 
					write<br />
					</em>A fuller list with examples, is available as a PDF 
					document via the link at the end in the list of related 
					guides.<br />
					In English, the indirect object comes before the direct 
					object but that is not always the case in other languages.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Verbs which can be both transitive and intransitive</strong><br />
				These verbs, and there are lots of them, can be both.<br />
				For example, we can say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <strong>eats</strong> </em>(intransitive)<br />
				and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <strong>eats</strong> fish (</em>transitive).<br />
				Other 
				examples in this category include<br /><em>drink, explain, help, 
				decide, fly, smoke, swim, play, continue.</em></li>

			<h3>Transitive-intransitive pairings</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are a few verbs in English which derive from the same root 
			but have transitive and intransitive variants.&nbsp; For example, 
			both <em>rise</em> and <em>raise</em> derive from the same source 
			(the Old English <em>ræran</em>, <em>rear</em>) but the first is 
			intransitive and the second transitive.&nbsp; The others are <em>lie 
			/ lay</em> and <em>sit / set</em> so we get, for example:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>He rose early</em> (intransitive)<br />
				and<br /><em>He raised the question
				</em>(transitive)</li>
				<li><em>They are lying on the beach </em>(intransitive)<br />
				and<br /><em>They are 
			laying the foundations </em>(transitive)</li>
				<li><em>He sat near the table </em>(intransitive)<br />and<br /><em>He set it near the 
			table </em>(transitive)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other pairs of verbs which are unrelated in terms of origin also 
			form intransitive-transitive couples.&nbsp; In English, for example:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>fall</em> is intransitive but <em>drop</em> is 
				usually transitive:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ball fell<br />
				</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She dropped the ball</em></li>
				<li><em>speak</em> is usually intransitive but <em>tell</em> is 
				transitive (often ditransitive):<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke at the meeting<br />
				</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me the truth</em></li>
				<li><em>die</em> is intransitive but <em>kill</em> is transitive<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He died in 1940<br />
				</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She killed him in 1940</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some other verbs take on slightly (or radically) different meaning when used 
			transitively or intransitively.&nbsp; For example</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>He ran across the garden</em> (intransitive)<br />
				and<br />
				<em>He ran a 
			good business</em> (transitive)</li>
				<li><em>I can manage alone</em> (intransitive)<br />
				and<br /><em>He managed the 
			school</em> (transitive)</li>
				<li><em>The plane flew </em>(intransitive)<br />
				vs.<br /><em>He flew the 
				plane </em>(transitive)</li>
				<li><em>She called at 6</em> (intransitive)<br />
				and<br /><em>She called her 
			friends </em>(monotransitive)<br />
				or<br /><em>She called me an idiot </em>(ditransitive)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Finite and non-finite verb use</h2>

			</table>
			<p>You may well have heard of the term infinitive to describe the
			<span class="style_black"><strong>highlighted</strong></span> verbs 
			in these sentences:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want <span class="style_black"><strong>to 
			help</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She must not <span class="style_black"><strong>go</strong></span></em></p>
			<p>They are called, respectively the <em>to-</em>infinitive and the 
			bare infinitive (or infinitive without <em>to</em>, somewhat 
			clumsily).&nbsp; The reason is that they are not finite.&nbsp; In 
			other words, they have no mark on them for tense or person.<br />
			Non-finite verb forms are not marked for time (tense) or for the 
			nature of the subject (person).&nbsp; There are three main sorts of 
			non-finite verb forms:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>gerunds (i.e., verbs which behave grammatically in a 
				noun-like way).&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy <span class="style_black">
				<strong>walking</strong></span><br />
				</em>They are not actually just simple nouns in most cases 
				because they cannot take plurals and are treated as singular 
				forms.&nbsp; Some are really very noun-like however as in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The </em><span class="style_black">
				<strong><em>furnishings</em></strong></span><em> were lovely<br />
				</em>(and we refer to these as verbal nouns).</li>
				<li>infinitives of two sorts:<ol class="auto-style56">
					<li>bare infinitives as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let her <span class="style_black">
					<strong>come</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She might <span class="style_black"><strong>object</strong></span></em></li>
					<li><em>to-</em>infinitives as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want <span class="style_black">
					<strong>to help</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She used <span class="style_black"><strong>to be</strong></span> 
					so happy</em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>participles of two sorts;<ol class="auto-style56">
					<li>present participles as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On <span class="style_black"><strong>
					arriving</strong></span>, I saw the party had nearly 
					finished<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>Smiling</strong></span>, 
					she welcomed him in</em></li>
					<li>past participles as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><strong>
					Broken</strong></span>, the hammer was no use<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aria was beautifully <span class="style_black"><strong>
					sung</strong></span></em></li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Finite verb forms, on the other hand, are marked for tense and 
			person so we get, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary left early</em><br />
			where we can tell from the form of the verb that it is past tense<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter enjoys opera</em><br />
			where we can tell from the form of the verb that it is third-person 
			singular (the <em>-s</em> inflexion at the end of the verb).</p>
			<p>There are, however, two problems:</p>

			<p>English is a language which has very few inflexions compared with 
			heavily inflected languages like German, French, Spanish and Greek.&nbsp; 
			So, for example, we have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You left</em><br />
			etc. and the form of the verb, while marked for tense, remains 
			unchanged for person.<br />
			Some verbs do not even do that so the past forms of, e.g., <em>put, 
			set, burst, cost, cut </em>etc. look exactly the same as the present 
			tense and the base forms.</p>
			<p>We also have:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I like opera<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You like opera<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He likes opera<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We like opera<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They like opera</em><br />
			in which only the third person singular form is marked for person 
			and all the other verb forms look the same.</p>
			<p>We get around this problem by suggesting that there 
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>is</strong></span> marking 
			for tense and person but in many cases it is zero marking and we 
			represent it like this: &Oslash;-marked.</p>

			<p>Finite and non-finite forms can combine to make finite forms in 
			English.<br />
			Because the language relies heavily on auxiliary verbs, this is a 
			very frequent occurrence in English.&nbsp; All the following are 
			finite forms but they contain non-finite forms.&nbsp; The non-finite 
			forms are <strong><span class="style_black">highlighted 
			in black</span></strong> and the finite forms 
			<span class="style_red"><strong>in red</strong></span>.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She </em><span class="style_red"><strong><em>has</em></strong></span>
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>left</em></strong></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They </em><span class="style_red"><strong><em>are</em></strong></span>
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>leaving</em></strong></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We </em><span class="style_red"><strong><em>have</em></strong></span>
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>left</em></strong></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She </em><span class="style_red"><strong><em>had</em></strong></span>
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>left</em></strong></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She </em><span class="style_red"><strong><em>will</em></strong></span>
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>leave</em></strong></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They </em><span class="style_red"><strong><em>are</em></strong></span>
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>going</em></strong></span>
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>to leave</em></strong></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary </em><span class="style_red"><strong><em>ought</em></strong></span>
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>to leave</em></strong></span><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary </em><span class="style_red"><strong><em>can</em></strong></span>
			<span class="style_black"><strong><em>leave</em></strong></span></p>
			<p>It is important, therefore to distinguish between a finite verb
			<span class="style_underline"><strong>phrase</strong></span> (all of 
			the above) and a finite verb <span class="style_underline"><strong>
			form</strong></span> (only the parts in red).&nbsp;</p>

			While the 
			essential distinction between transitive and intransitive verb use 
			is common across languages, the actual verbs in question will vary.&nbsp; 
			A verb that is intransitive in English may well be transitive in another 
			language and <em>vice versa</em>.<br />In English, the verbs <em>wash</em> and <em>meet</em> can be used 
			intransitively as well as transitively:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li><em>They washed the car </em>(transitive)<br />
				vs.<br />
				<em>They 
				washed and then went out </em>(intransitive)</li>
				<li><em>We met the manager </em>(transitive)<br />
				vs.<br /><em>We met on 
				Thursday </em>(intransitive)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In other languages, these two verbs can only be transitive so the 
			reflexive pronoun is inserted giving a translation like<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
			washed themselves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We met us<br />
			</em>This can, of course, lead 
			to error.</p>
			<p>Some languages, such as Japanese, have large sets of pairs of verbs 
			with slightly different forms, the one transitive, the other 
			intransitive.<br />
			It is, therefore, very 
			important that we teach the verb's grammar along with its meaning.&nbsp; If we don't, we 
			invite error such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She died him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He killed in 1940<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I 
			laughed the film<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She smiled him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I assured<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He explained me it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			*I complained the manager<br />
			</em>etc. and all of these are possible in some languages.</p>

			</table>
			<p>Auxiliary verbs cannot stand alone and retain their meaning 
			unless the lexical or main verb they refer to is understood.&nbsp; For 
			example<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might<br />
			</em>means nothing on its own but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might 
			go<br />
			</em>carries real meaning.&nbsp; The auxiliary verb <em>might</em> 
			expresses the speaker's sense of likelihood.&nbsp; It is possible to 
			say<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might<br />
			</em>in response to<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you going to the 
			meeting?<br />
			</em>but here the lexical or main verb <em>go</em> is 
			understood by both speaker and hearer.</p>
			<p>There are, fundamentally, two sorts of auxiliary verb.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Primary auxiliary verbs</strong><br />
				These form tenses, voice or aspects with lexical or main verbs.&nbsp; 
				Traditionally, they are restricted to the three verbs <em>
				<strong>be, have </strong></em>and <em><strong>do</strong></em> 
				but many (including this site) add <em><strong>get</strong></em> 
				to the list.<br />
				For example<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>We can alter the tense (and sense) of <em>I work</em> by 
					using the auxiliary <em>have</em> in, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have 
					worked hard</em>.</li>
					<li>We can change how the speaker wants to communicate his 
					or her view of an event by changing the aspect of <em>I work</em> 
					by using the auxiliary <em>be</em> in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am working.</em></li>
					<li>We can change the emphasis of what we say also by using 
					the auxiliary <em>be</em>, changing, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I broke the 
					window<br />
					</em>to<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window was broken by me</em>.</li>
					<li>We can change the sense of who did what by using the 
					auxiliary <em>get</em> in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got John to repair the car.<br />
					</em>or the auxiliary <em>have</em> as in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the car repaired at the garage</em></li>
					<li>We can form negatives and questions by using the verb
					<em>do</em> as in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want to come?<br />
					</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
					don't see the problem</em>.</li>
				</ul>
				There is a guide 
			to primary auxiliaries on this site, linked below, and you should consult that 
			for more information.<br />
			There is also an essential guide to voice which explains the 
			passive-active distinction.<li><strong>Modal auxiliary verbs<br />
				</strong>These alter the hearer's perception of how the speaker 
				understands the situation.<br />
				For example<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>We can express <strong>obligation</strong> by using the 
					modal auxiliary <em>have to</em>, changing<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think<br />
					</em>to<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black">have to</span> think<br />
					</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I left<br />
					</em>to<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
					<span class="style_black">had 
					to </span>leave</em>.</li>
					<li>We can express our view of <strong>likelihood</strong> 
					by inserting a modal auxiliary into<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrive<br />
					</em>and 
					making<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_black">might / should / must</span> arrive soon</em>.</li>
					<li>We can give or withhold <strong>permission</strong> by 
					using a range of modal auxiliary verbs by changing<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You go<br />
					</em>to<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					You <span class="style_black">may</span> go<br />
					</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You 
					<span class="style_black">can't</span> go</em>.</li>
				</ul>
				</ol>
			<p class="auto-style6">The most common list of modal auxiliary verbs is: <em>
			can, may, shall, will, could, might, should, would, must, ought to, 
			used, need </em>and <em>dare</em>.</p>
			<p class="auto-style6">Modal auxiliary verbs are traditionally divided into 
			pure or central modal auxiliary verbs, semi-modal auxiliary verbs and marginal modal 
			auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; Central modal 
			auxiliary verbs 
			include <em>can, must, will </em>etc., semi-modal auxiliary verbs include <em>need 
			to, dare to and used to</em> and marginal modal auxiliary verbs are forms 
			such as <em>going to, be about to, tend to, be likely to</em> etc.</p>
			<p class="auto-style6">The central modal auxiliary verbs are sometimes 
			described as defective because they don't exhibit the full range of 
			forms in the way that lexical or main verbs do.&nbsp; For example, <em>must</em> 
			has no past tense (we can't say <em>*musted</em>), we don't form 
			questions with <em>do</em> (so we can't say <em>*Do you can?</em>) 
			and we don't add an <em>-s</em> in the third person (so we don't get
			<em>*She mights</em>).</p>
			<p class="auto-style6">Modal auxiliary verbs perform a large range 
			of functions in English.&nbsp; If you want to know more, a good 
			place to start is the essential guide to modality, linked below.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>These verbs serve to link the subject of a sentence directly to 
			its function or its characteristics.&nbsp; There is a list in
			the guide to copular verbs on this 
			site, linked below.&nbsp; Briefly, however, copular verbs perform two functions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>They link a subject to another noun or noun phrase and tell us that they refer 
				to the same thing.<br />
				For example: in<br /><em>Mary <span class="style_black">is</span> a 
				teacher<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary <span class="style_black">became</span> 
				a teacher<br />
				</em>or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary <span class="style_black">looks like</span> a teacher<br />
				</em>we know 
				that <em>Mary</em> and <em>a teacher</em> refer to the same 
				person.</li>
				<li>They link the subject to its characteristic.<br />
				For example: in<br /><em>Mary <span class="style_black">appears</span> 
				angry<br />
				Mary <span class="style_black">became</span> angry<br />
				</em>and<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary <span class="style_black">is</span> angry<br />
				</em>we 
				know that we are dealing with an angry Mary.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Verbs like <em>be, become</em> and <em>end up</em> often 
			function in both categories:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_black">became</span> angry<br />
			</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
			<span class="style_black">became</span> a teacher<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She 
			<span class="style_black">was</span> unhappy<br />
			</em>vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She 
			<span class="style_black">was</span> an engineer</em>.</p>
			<p>Verbs of perception usually only function in the second category 
			and are followed by an adjective:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It <span class="style_black">looks</span> awful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
			<span class="style_black">smells</span> 
			sweet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It <span class="style_black">sounds</span> horrible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
			<span class="style_black">appeared</span> drunk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She 
			<span class="style_black">seemed</span> unwell<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<p>Many copular verbs also function as lexical or main verbs in other 
			circumstances:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_black">appears</span> 
			happy</em> (copula use)<br />
			vs.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She appeared at the door</em> 
			(intransitive lexical use with a prepositional phrase).<br />
			A copular verb can, 
			therefore, only be defined by what it does, not what it looks like.</p>
