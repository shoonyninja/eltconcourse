			<p><a name="back"></a>If you have never studied the grammar of English, you may like to try 
			some other guides on this site which are linked in the list at the 
			end.&nbsp; <a href="#menu">Click here</a> if you would like to go 
			there now and then click <span class="style_red">-</span><span class="auto-style95"><span style="color:#ff3300">back</span></span><span class="style_red">-</span> 
			to return.<br />
			The guides are to a simple Grammar of English which is designed for learners of 
			English, a 10-unit language analysis course which will lead you through the 
			basics of phonology, morphology, lexis, tenses, aspect, phrases, clauses, sentences 
			and text structures and a short grammar guide intended for people taking or preparing to 
			take an initial teaching qualification such as CELTA.</p>
			<p>This guide is concerned with the sentence which, sooner or later, 
			forms the basis of most classroom analysis.</p>
			<p>The term <strong>grammar</strong> describes the whole system of a language and 
			includes two important areas: <strong>syntax</strong> and 
			<strong>morphology</strong>.&nbsp; In some analyses, it also 
			includes pronunciation but that deserves a section to itself.<br />
			We'll take them one at a time but before we do that, we need to 
			pause to answer a deceptively simple question:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>What are the elements that make u<span class="auto-style79">p
			</span>a sentence?</strong></p>
			<p>and we'll do that first.</p>
			<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="words" height="166" src="../../images/words250.jpg" width="250" /></td>

		</table>
		
			<p>You may have decided that you already know the answer to our 
			question:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>Words make up sentences.</strong></p>
			<p>and you'd be right, of course, but before we can make a 
			well-formed sentence, we need to define what we mean by 'words' and 
			then classify them somehow.&nbsp; It is, in fact, quite difficult to 
			say what a word actually is, but for our purposes, we'll just say 
			that it is a group of characters, normally written with a space at 
			each end which we can find in a dictionary and to which we can 
			ascribe a meaning.&nbsp; That's actually a rather poor definition 
			but it'll do for our purposes here.&nbsp; There is a separate guide 
			on this site to word class to which you should refer for a bit more 
			detail.&nbsp; That's linked in the list of guides at the end.&nbsp; 
			For now, we'll assume that you know the names of some of the main 
			word classes.<br />
			There are, by some estimates, around 170, 000 words in English so we need some way to make 
			sense of all that information.<br />
			There are three ways we can do our classification:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Meaning<br />
					<img alt="maen" height="133" src="../../images/meaning_woman_a200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				We can look at meaning and say, for example:<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li>Nouns are labels for things</li>
					<li>Verbs refer to actions</li>
					<li>Adjectives refer to the property of a thing or person</li>
					<li>Adverbs tell us where, when, how often and how actions 
					are done</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and those definitions all refer to what a word means.&nbsp; This 
			sort of classification will work well in many cases and we can put 
			the following into word classes from the rules we have given:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apple, sugar, go, away, 
			yellow, dig, flower, frequently, speak, happily, big, unbelievable<br />
			</strong></em></span>Do that now and/or click
			<img alt="eye" class="auto-style80" height="16" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'firsttable',0,'style.visibility','visible')" src="../../../gfx/eyeopen.gif" width="16" /> 
			to reveal an answer.</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tablebrownborder" id="firsttable" style="position: relative; visibility: hidden">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style92"><span class="auto-style79">Nouns</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style93"><strong><em>apple, sugar, flower</em></strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style88">Verbs</td>
					<td class="auto-style87"><strong><em>go, dig, speak</em></strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style88">Adjectives</td>
					<td class="auto-style87"><strong><em>yellow, big, 
					unbelievable</em></strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style90">Adverbs</td>
					<td class="auto-style91"><strong><em>away, frequently, 
					happily</em></strong></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>If you had trouble doing that, you really should refer to the 
			guide to word class linked below because the following will be hard 
			to understand otherwise.<br />
			This focus on meaning works well until we come across, for example:</p>
			<ul class="smallgreybullet">
				<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>happiness</strong></em></span> 
				is a noun but not a label for a thing</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong><em>like</em></strong></span> 
				is a verb but does not refer to an action</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong><em>unhappiness</em></strong></span> 
				describes a property of a person but is not an adjective</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong><em>yesterday </em></strong></span>describes when an action took place but is not an adverb</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The other problem with relying on meaning to identify word class 
			is that some words have no apparent meaning.&nbsp; For example, it 
			is difficult to define the words:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on, by, 
			and, if, this, the, an, it, they </strong></em></span>etc.<br />
			without referring to what they do because, standing alone, they mean 
			nothing.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Form<br />
					<img alt="form" height="133" src="../../images/form_forge200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				We can look at the shape of a word and classify it by that so we 
				get, for example:<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li>Nouns take a plural in <em>-s</em></li>
					<li>Verbs take a past tense in <em>-ed</em> or -<em>d</em> 
					or by changing the vowel and take an <em>-s</em> ending when 
					they are used with <em>he, she</em> or <em>it</em></li>
					<li>Adjectives can be made comparative or superlative by 
					adding <em>-er</em> or <em>-est</em> to the end or by using 
					the words <em>more</em> and <em>most </em>before them</li>
					<li>Adverbs end in <em>-ly</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and from those rules, we can classify the following words:<span class="style_black"><em><strong><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			bucket, come, decide, greatly, sad, window, table, rarely, pretty, 
			throw, marvellous, uncomfortably<br />
			</strong></em></span>Do that now or click
			<img alt="eye" class="auto-style80" height="16" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'firsttable0',0,'style.visibility','visible')" src="../../../gfx/eyeopen.gif" width="16" /> 
			to reveal an answer.</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="tablebrownborder" id="firsttable0" style="position: relative; visibility: hidden">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style92"><span class="auto-style79">Nouns</span></td>
					<td class="auto-style93"><strong><em>bucket (s), window (s), 
					table (s)</em></strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style88">Verbs</td>
					<td class="auto-style87"><strong><em>come (came), decide 
					(decided), throw (threw)</em></strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style88">Adjectives</td>
					<td class="auto-style87"><strong><em>sad (sadder, saddest), 
					pretty (prettier, prettiest),</em></strong> <strong><em>
					marvellous (more marvellous, most marvellous)</em></strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style90">Adverbs</td>
					<td class="auto-style91"><em><strong>greatly, rarely,
					</strong></em><strong><em>uncomfortably</em></strong></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>so the system works well until we encounter, for example:</p>
			<ul class="smallgreybullet">
				<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>sheep</strong></em></span> 
				which is a noun which takes no plural (but has one) and
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>information</strong></em></span> 
				is a noun which has no plural</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>must</strong></em></span> 
				is a verb which cannot change for the past tense and does not 
				take an <em>-s</em> for the third person and so is
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>going</em></strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>likely</strong></em></span> 
				is an adjective which ends in <em>-ly</em> and
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>absent</strong></em></span> 
				is an adjective which does not make comparative and superlative 
				forms at all</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong><em>often</em></strong></span> 
				is an adverb which does not end in <em>-ly</em> and so are
				<span class="style_black"><strong><em>seldom</em> </strong></span>
				<span class="style_blue">and<strong> </strong></span><strong>
				<span class="style_black"><em>out</em></span></strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The same problem also occurs with the effort to identify the 
			class of a word by its form that we encountered with meaning above.&nbsp; 
			We noted there that words like:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on, by, 
			and, if, this, the, an, it, they </strong></em></span>etc.<br />
			do not have any identifiable meaning as such and it is also the case 
			that no elements of the forms of these words allow us to identify 
			their word class.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Grammatical function<br />
				<img alt="cogs" height="133" src="../../images/cogs_machinery200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This is the key idea.&nbsp; We can classify words not by what 
				they mean or by what they look like (their form) but by what 
				they do.&nbsp; This gives us:<ul class="smallredbullet">
					<li>Nouns operate as the subject or object of verbs so they 
					fill the gap in sentences such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The __________ broke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John broke the __________</em></li>
					<li>Verbs fill the gaps in sentences such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John __________ to Mary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car __________ down on the motorway</em></li>
					<li>Adjectives fill the gaps in sentences such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very __________ girl in the 
					corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She seemed a little __________</em></li>
					<li>Adverbs fill the gaps in sentences such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came very __________<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How __________ do you see your brother?</em></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>and, if you look at all the examples we have given above, you 
			will find that we can classify them all this way, regardless of what 
			they mean and regardless of their form.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, above, we recognised that meaning and form are 
			unhelpful in identifying the word class of items such as:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on, by, 
			and, if, this, the, an, it, they </strong></em></span>etc.<br />
			without referring to what they do.<br />
			Naturally enough, however, a focus on grammatical function does 
			allow us to classify these items accurately because we can employ 
			the same gap-filling technique.&nbsp; So, for example, we know:</p>
			<ul class="smallredbullet">
				<li>There is a group of words which can fill the gap in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary came late __________ her train was 
				delayed</em><br />
				and these we call conjunctions which function to connect clauses 
				and other items as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Mary __________ her brother arrived</em></li>
				<li>Another group, determiners, will fill the gaps in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please pass me __________ hammer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like __________ tea?</em><br />
				etc. and function to identify or limit the noun.</li>
				<li>A further group, prepositions will serve to link ideas and 
				fill the gaps in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked __________ the bridge and 
				__________ the park</em></li>
				<li>A final group will stand in for nouns (which we have already 
				identified and serve to fill the gaps in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary and her brother came to the party 
				but __________ left early and __________ stayed till the end</em><br />
				although we do not know, of course whether we should put <em>he</em> 
				or <em>she</em> into each gap.&nbsp; That doesn't matter because 
				we are interested in word class, not the meaning of the whole 
				sentence.</li>

			<p>What we have done here is refer to syntax as a way of classifying

			<p>The answer is that, as you can see for the purposes of 
			understanding sentences, a group or words or a single word are 
			performing exactly the same functions in the syntax of the sentence 
			so we could express that sentence as:</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong>Mother found photographs.</strong></p>
			<p>which retains the meaning and has the same structure.<br />
			Whether a grammatical function is performed by a single word or a 
			group of words, we refer to them in the same way and call them noun, 
			verb, adjective and adverb <strong>phrases</strong>.</p>
			<p>Now we can get on and analyse sentences in English.&nbsp; In what 
			follows we will refer to some different word classes but that really 
			doesn't matter because we have already identified the four main 
			meaning-carrying word classes in this section: nouns, verbs, 
			adjectives and adverbs.</p>

			<p>We can break this sentence down into its three main parts and look at each 
				one separately.&nbsp; Each of those parts can also be broken 
				down, like this:<br />
			<img alt="parse" height="218" src="../../imagesgraphics/this_man_wants_some_coffee.png" width="620" /></p>
			<p>This is called <span class="style_red">parsing</span> a 
				sentence.&nbsp; Later in this guide, you'll learn how to do 
				it for yourself.&nbsp; For now, we'll just explain a little:<br />
			The three main parts are:</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>This man</em></span>:<br />
				this is 
				the <strong>subject</strong> of the sentence and its <strong>
				theme</strong> (what it concerns).&nbsp; It is a noun phrase 
				made up of two parts, <span class="style_black"><em>man</em></span> 
				(a common noun) and <span class="style_black"><em>this</em></span> 
				(a demonstrative determiner which tells us which man and limits the noun).</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>wants</em></span>:<br />
				this is the
				<strong>verb</strong> which tells us what the subject is 
				doing.&nbsp; In this case, it's a single word but can be a 
				phrase such as <em>would like.&nbsp; </em>The verb type is 
				mentioned, transitive, so we know that it takes an object.&nbsp; The ending on 
				the verb, -<em>s</em>, tells us that it is singular and that the 
				subject is the third person (<em>he, she, it</em>).</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>some coffee</em></span>:<br />
				this 
				is the object of the verb <span class="style_black"><em>wants</em></span> 
				and tells us what the verb refers to.&nbsp; It is a noun phrase 
				made up of two parts, <span class="style_black"><em>coffee</em></span> 
				(a common mass noun) and <span class="style_black"><em>some</em></span> 
				(a quantifying determiner which tells us how much and limits the noun).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each main part can be broken into two smaller parts (in this 
			example):</p>
			<ul class="greenbullet">
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>This</em></span>:<br />
				is a 
				<span class="style_red">determiner </span>and tells us something about the 
				man (in this case that it is a particular, single man near to the 
				speaker).&nbsp; It could be a range of other determiners such as 
				<em>her</em> (showing a relationship), <em>that</em> (showing that he is further 
				away from the speaker), <em>the</em> (showing that it is a man both the 
				speaker and listener are aware of) and so on.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>man</em></span>:<br />
				is a common singular 
				count <span class="style_red">noun </span>(with an
				<span class="style_red">irregular </span>plural, 
				<em>men</em>).&nbsp; Because both speaker and hearer are operating in 
				English, the meaning is clear &ndash; an adult male human.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>want</em></span>:<br />
				is the 
				base form of the <span class="style_red">verb</span>.&nbsp; This 
				verb always takes an object (is transitive) because if we say:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want</em><br />
				no meaning is extractable unless I say what it is I want.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>-s</em>:<br />
				</span>comes at the 
				end because in English, this is how we change, or inflect, the 
				verb to show a singular third-person form.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>some</em></span>:<br />
				is 
				another determiner, called a <span class="style_red">quantifier
				</span>and tells us how much.&nbsp; 
				It could be a range of other quantifiers such as <em>two</em> 
				(but we'll change the noun to a plural form), <em>lots of, a cup 
				of</em> and so on.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>coffee</em></span>:<br />
				is a 
				mass noun which usually has no plural but can in this case because it 
				is used to stand for <em>a cup of coffee</em>.&nbsp; Usually, we 
				don't say <em>coffees</em> in the same way that we don't say <em>
				furnitures</em> or <em>informations</em> and so on because the 
				noun is considered uncountable in English.</li>

				<p>The subject comes first in both sentences so we know that is the doer of

		sense.</p>

		<p>Usually, of course, we can understand what is the subject and what is 
		the object of a verb by the meaning of the sentence:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="3"><em><span class="style_black">Peter</span> drank
			<span class="style_red">the water</span></em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Cannot (sensibly) be changed to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="4"><em><span class="style_black">The water</span> drank
			<span class="style_red">Peter</span></em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>However, in English, there are many times when the word order alone 
		gives the sense of what or who is the subject and what or whom is the 
		object.&nbsp; For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5"><em><span class="style_black">The delay</span> 
				caused the problem</em></li>
				<li><em>The problem caused <span class="style_red">the delay</span></em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In some languages, the words in the noun phrase will have a 
			change of form depending on whether they are part of the subject or 
			the object so it matters a lot less what the ordering is.&nbsp; In 
			others, the verb itself may change depending on which word is the 
			subject and which the object.&nbsp; So, for example, sentences 5. 
			and 6. translate this way:</p>
			<p>In Greek (with different forms of the article):</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5"><em>Η καθυστέρηση προκάλεσε το πρόβλημα (I 
				kathystérisi prokálese to próvlima)</em></li>
				<li><em>Το πρόβλημα προκάλεσε την καθυστέρηση (To próvlima 
				prokálese tin kathystérisi)</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In Czech (with different forms of the verb):</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5"><em>Zpoždění způsobilo problém</em></li>
				<li><em>Problém způsobil zpoždění</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In Basque (with many alterations to determiners and verbs):</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5"><em>Atzerapenak eragin du arazoa</em></li>
				<li><em>Arazoak atzerapena eragin zuen</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In Russian (with changes to the endings on the nouns):</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5"><em>Задержка вызвала проблему (Zaderzhka vyzvala 
				problemu)</em></li>
				<li><em>Проблема вызвала задержку (Problema vyzvala zaderzhku)</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>That 
			won't work in English so getting word ordering right is very 
			important.</p>

				</ol>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
		In the example above, the subjects, verbs and objects are quite simple 
		but they can be more complicated.<br />
		For example, in this sentence:<br />
		<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old fisherman with the blue hat </em>
		</span><em>slowly rowed </em><span class="style_red"><em>his ancient 
		wooden boat which he cared for carefully </em></span><em>into the middle 
		of the river.</em></p>
			<p>
			we still have:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="style_black">the subject noun phrase:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old fisherman with the blue hat</em></li>
				<li>the verb phrase:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slowly rowed<br />
				</em>Strictly speaking, verb phrases contain only verbs and this 
				is a verb phrase plus a modifying adverb.</li>
				<li class="style_red">the object noun phrase:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his ancient wooden boat which he cared for carefully</em></li>
				<li >the prepositional phrase<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into the middle of the river</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Because the elements of the sentence are groups of words rather 
			than individual items, it makes sense to refer to them as phrases:
			<span class="style_black">the subject noun phrase</span>, the verb 
			phrase, <span class="style_red">the object noun phrase</span> and the prepositional phrase.</p>
			<p>In this analysis and in what follows we are taking a small liberty 
			by calling <em>slowly rowed</em> the verb phrase.&nbsp; It is, in 
			fact, an adverb and the modified verb.&nbsp; A verb phrase proper 
			contains only verbs such as <em>rowed, has rowed, will row, may have 
			been rowing</em> etc.</p>
			<p>
		In grammar books, you will often see the term <strong>nominative 
		(case)</strong> to refer to the subject and <strong>accusative (case)
		</strong>to refer to the object.&nbsp; Most learners of English don't 
		need to understand these terms (but you do).<br />
		We have now identified two of the three <strong>cases</strong> in 
		English (the third is the possessive or genitive which does not concern 
		us here).</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>Now that we can identify the subject, the verb and the object, we 
			can look at the final bits of the sentences we have used so far.&nbsp; 
			These are the adverbials or complements and they come in different guises.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Complements</strong></dt>
				<dd>The term complement is rather slippery because it is defined 
				in many ways depending on the nature of the grammar you are 
				reading.&nbsp; In this guide, we will use the term in a narrow 
				sense and distinguish it from the subject or object of a verb.&nbsp; 
				It is the part of the sentence which allows us to make sense of 
				the subject and the verb.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is the boss</em><br />
				it is clear that we need to have<em> the boss</em> to make sense 
				of the sentence at all but it is not the object of the verb.&nbsp; 
				It is, in fact another way of saying the subject: <em>she</em> 
				and <em>the boss</em> refer to the same person.<br />
				In:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary seems unhappy</em><br />
				we have a different type of complement (called an attribute) 
				which tells us about the subject of the verb but which is still 
				not acting as the object of it: it's an adjective complement.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Adverbials</strong></dt>
				<dd>Adverbials do not tell us about the subject of the verb, 
				they add information to the verb itself and they come in a 
				variety of forms.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrived immediately</em><br />
				we have a simple adverb, <em>immediately</em>, acting as the 
				adverbial and telling us about how he arrived.&nbsp; And in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrived yesterday</em><br />
				we have a noun, <em>yesterday</em>, acting as an adverbial, 
				telling us when he arrived.&nbsp; In:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrived by bus</em><br />
				we have a prepositional phrase, <em>by bus</em>, acting as an 
				adverbial, telling us how he travelled.<br />
				Any item which modifies how we see the verb phrase is an 
				adverbial.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Here are some more examples with the adverbial or complement<span class="style_black"> 
			<strong>in black</strong></span>:</p>
			<ul class="redbullet">
				<li><em>He rowed<span class="style_black"><strong> into the middle of the lake</strong></span></em><br />
				is a prepositional phrase adverbial because it tells us <strong>
				where</strong> he rowed</li>
				<li><em>The boat was <span class="style_black"><strong>very expensive</strong></span></em><br />
				is an adjective phrase complement because it tells us <strong>
				about a noun</strong> or pronoun, in this case it tells us about 
				the subject</li>
				<li><em>The hot weather made me <span class="style_black">
				<strong>tired</strong></span><br />
				</em>is an adjective phrase complement which refers to the object of the verb (<em>me</em>).</li>
				<li><em>He was walking <span class="style_black">alone</span></em><br />
				is an adverbial phrase (and an adverb) because it tells us <strong>
				how</strong> he walked</li>
				<li><em>He walked <span class="style_black"><strong>back</strong></span><br />
				</em>the is an adverbial phrase (and another adverb) telling us <strong>in 
				which direction</strong> he walked (and prepositional phrases 
				such as <em>towards the house </em>can do that too)</li>
				<li><em>He was walking <span class="style_black"><strong>in the country</strong></span></em><br />
				is another prepositional phrase adverbial because it tells us
				<strong>where</strong> he walked</li>
				<li><em>He was walking <span class="style_black"><strong>last week</strong></span></em><br />
				is another adverbial noun phrase because it tells us
				<strong>when</strong> he walked (and prepositional phrases such 
				as <em>in the morning </em>can 
				do that too)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As we noted above, here we have a narrow definition of the term 
			complement.&nbsp; In some grammars everything except the verb phrase 
			itself may be referred to as a complement.&nbsp; In others, all 
			adverbials are classified as complements and in 
			yet others everything except the subject and the verb is analysed as a complement.</p>

		</table>
		
			<p>We make two kinds of changes to words in English:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We change words to make different forms of the same idea.&nbsp; 
				For example:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>we can derive the word <span class="style_black"><em>unwell</em></span> 
					from the word <span class="style_black"><em>well</em></span> 
				(reversing its meaning) by adding <span class="style_black"><em>un-</em></span> to the beginning.</li>
					<li>we can derive the word <span class="style_black"><em>hopeful</em></span> 
				from the noun <span class="style_black"><em>hope</em></span>, 
				making it an adjective by adding <span class="style_black"><em>-ful</em></span> to the end.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>We change words to conform with the grammar of what we mean.&nbsp; 
				This is called <span class="style_red">inflecting </span>and the 
				parts we add or change are called <span class="style_red">
				inflexions</span> (or inflections).&nbsp; For example:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>In the sentence, <span class="style_black"><em>This man want<span class="style_underline">s</span> some coffee</em></span>, we add an 				
					<span class="style_black"><em>-s</em></span> to the 
					<span class="style_red">verb </span>because 
				singular <span class="style_red">subjects </span>require that change to the verb in English.</li>
					<li>We can add <span class="style_black"><em>-ed</em></span> to the verb and then we 
				have a past tense: <span class="style_black"><em>This man want<span class="style_underline">ed</span> 
				some coffee</em></span>.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If we have more than one man and more than one thing as an
				<span class="style_red">object</span>, as in, e.g., <em>
			<span class="style_black">These men want some biscuits</span>,

			<ol class="bluebullet">
				<li><em><span class="style_black">this</span> </em>changes to<em>

				<li><em><span class="style_black">man</span> </em>changes to<em>
				<span class="style_black">m<span class="style_underline">e</span>n</span>, 
					</em>an 
				<span class="style_red">irregular plural</span>.&nbsp; Usually in English, we make plurals by 
				adding <span class="style_black"><em>-s</em></span> or 
					<span class="style_black"><em>-es</em></span> to the noun as we 
				do with <span class="style_black"><em>biscuit<span class="style_underline">s</span></em></span>.</li>
				<li><em><span class="style_black">want</span> </em>takes no<em>
				<span class="style_black">-s</span> </em>because plural 
					<span class="style_red">nouns </span>do 
				not demand a change to the base form of the verb (as they do in 
				most languages, by the way).&nbsp; This is called a zero

				<li>the determiner<em> <span class="style_black">some</span>

				be used for nouns we count and those we don't.&nbsp; Other 
				quantifiers are not so versatile so we can say 
					<span class="style_black"><em>a few biscuits</em></span> but 
				not <span class="style_black"><em>*a little biscuits</em></span>.&nbsp; (The '*' is the conventional way in 
				analysing language to show that an example is not well formed or

			<p>So quite a lot.&nbsp; Three important things, in fact:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In order to be able to make grammatically correct sentences 
				in any language, it is important to recognise how they are 
				constructed.&nbsp; To be able to help people to do 
				that, you need to know how to describe and explain the language.&nbsp; 
				Now, for simple sentences at least, you can.</li>
				<li>To construct any sentence you have to know where things go.&nbsp; 
				In English we usually put the subject first, then the verb and 
				then the object.&nbsp; We also put the adverb before the verb in 
				many (not all) cases (<span class="style_black"><em>kindly delivered</em></span>, 
				not <span class="style_black"><em>delivered kindly</em></span>).&nbsp; 
				We also say <span class="style_black"><em>a beautiful house</em></span>, 
				not <span class="style_black"><em>a house beautiful</em></span> 
				and <span class="style_black"><em>three cars</em></span> not
				<span class="style_black"><em>cars three</em></span>.&nbsp; Different languages handle this sort of thing 
				differently.</li>
				<li>The other thing you need to know is how words in the 
				language change or inflect:<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>To make present tenses (so we can distinguish between
					<span class="style_black"><em>they make</em></span> and
					<span class="style_black"><em>he makes</em></span>, and 
					between <span class="style_black"><em>we are going</em></span> 
					and <span class="style_black"><em>I am going</em></span>)</li>
					<li>To make past tenses so we can distinguish between
					<span class="style_black"><em>I come</em></span> and
					<span class="style_black"><em>I came</em></span>,
					<span class="style_black"><em>she smokes</em></span> and
					<span class="style_black"><em>she was smoking</em></span>)</li>
					<li>To make future reference (so we can say things like
					<span class="style_black"><em>I will go, I am going to go</em></span> 
					and <span class="style_black"><em>I am leaving tomorrow</em></span>)</li>
					<li>To make plurals (so we can produce
					<span class="style_black"><em>the match-the matches, the 
					car-the cars, the mouse-the mice</em></span> and so on)</li>
					<li>To make other words so we can form
					<span class="style_black"><em>kindly</em></span> from
					<span class="style_black"><em>kind</em></span></li>
					<li>To insert the right determiner (so we can distinguish 
					between <span class="style_black"><em>a car, the car, my car</em></span> 
					and <span class="style_black"><em>some cars</em></span>)</li>
					<li>To use prepositions (so we can distinguish between
					<span class="style_black"><em>to my house, on my house, from 
					my house, next 
					to my house</em></span>) etc.</li>

			<p>It does not matter much whether your analyses of all the

			<h3>Some notes</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>He bought some fresh apples in 
				the market</em></span><br />
				This is very like the second example in this page.&nbsp; We have 
				a typical Subject - Verb - Object pattern (most sentences in 
				English follow that).<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li><em>some</em> is a determiner which we can put before a plural 
					noun or 
				a noun which describes a mass (like, <em>sugar, information</em> 
				etc.)</li>
					<li><em>fresh</em> is an <span class="style_red">adjective</span> in 
				the usual place (before the noun it modifies)</li>
					<li><em>in the market</em> is a simple 
					<span class="style_red">prepositional phrase</span>.&nbsp; 
					<span class="style_red">Preposition</span>s are often followed by noun 
					phrases.&nbsp; In 
				fact they serve to link the noun phrase to the verb phrase.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em><span class="style_black">They were going to open the 
				parcel and look inside<br />
				</span></em>This is an unusual
				<span class="style_red">tense form</span>.&nbsp; 
				It's called the future in the past.&nbsp; <em>They are going to
				</em>is the present intention for the future but<em> They <strong>were</strong> 
				going to </em>refers 
				to a past intention (that didn't happen, usually).<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li><em>going to </em>is usually used to talk about intentions and it's 
				followed by the simplest form of the verb, the 
					<span class="style_red">infinitive</span></li>
					<li><em>look </em>is a verb here and it is followed by an adverb 
					(<em>inside</em>) telling 
				us where.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>I had a spare hour so I 
				read the newspaper</em></span><br />
				This is called a compound sentence because it consists of two 
				potentially independent clauses.<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>There are two parts:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a spare hour</em> (the first
				<span class="style_red">clause</span>)<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so I read the newspaper</em> (the second clause)</li>
					<li>The two clauses are said to be coordinated by the conjunction 
					<em>so.</em>&nbsp; 
				Often, we can reverse the clauses and retain the meaning.&nbsp; 
				In this case, we can't however, because <em>so</em> is used to 
				link cause and effect logically.<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *So I had a spare hour, I read 
					the newspaper<br />
					</em>is nonsense.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>She wants to come to the movie 
				with you</em></span> and<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>I hate making mistakes</em></span><ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>Both of these sentences contain two verbs: <em>want</em> and 
					<em>come</em> and <em>hate</em> and <em>make</em>.</li>
					<li>The difference is that some verbs in English are followed by the 
				verb with <em>-ing</em> (often called a <span class="style_red">gerund</span>) 
				and some by the verb with <em>to</em> before it (called the <em>
					to-</em>infinitive).<br />
					Verb forms ending in -<em>ing</em> or formed with <em>to</em> 
					plus the verb are called non-finite because they do not show 
					tense or person.&nbsp; They are unchanging.</li>
					<li>In the first sentence we have analysed the whole clause
					<em>to come to the movie with you</em> as the object of the 
					verb.&nbsp; What we have is a clause acting as a noun phrase 
					and we refer to it as a nominalised clause.&nbsp; We could 
					also analyse the second example with <em>making mistakes</em> 
					in the same way and refer to the clause as nominalised.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>They must go now</em></span><br />
				<em>must</em> is an example of a special kind of verb called a
				<span class="style_red">modal auxiliary verb</span>.&nbsp; Modal 
				auxiliary verbs are
				<span class="style_red">auxiliaries</span> and do not usually 
				stand alone.&nbsp; For example,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can<br />
				</em>means very little 
				unless we know the context but<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can swim<br />
				</em>carries meaning even with no context.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>When I came, he left</em></span><br />
				This is not a simpler version of 3. above.&nbsp; It is an 
				example of subordination, not coordination.<br />
				We have two 
				clauses:<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>The main clause:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he left</em></li>
					<li>The <span class="style_red">subordinate</span> clause:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when I came</em><br />The first clause 
					(b.) tells us about his leaving and cannot stand 
				alone and retain its full meaning.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>The window was broken by the 
				children</em></span><br />
				This is called a <span class="style_red">passive</span> because 
				we can leave out <em>by the children </em>and it still makes 
				sense.&nbsp; We are focused on the object of the verb <em>break</em> 
				and we may not know (or care) who broke it.&nbsp; Technically,
				<em>the window</em> is the patient (i.e., the thing the event 
				happened to) and <em>the children</em> is the agent (i.e., the 
				thing or person who did the action).</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>Grammatical accuracy is often 
				useful</em></span><br />
				This is an example of one way English makes subjects of verbs 
				bigger and more complete.&nbsp; We simply add an adjective 
				before the noun.&nbsp; In this case, it is a special form of 
				adjective called a classifier: it tells what sort of thing, 
				rather than describing it.&nbsp; There are other ways to
				<span class="style_red">modify</span> nouns.<br />
				In this sentence we also have special kind of verb which does 
				not take an object, it links the subject to the attribute, in 
				this case, linking the noun phrase <em>grammatical accuracy</em> 
				to the adjective, <em>useful</em>.<br />
				It is called a copular verb and other verbs such as <em>appear, 
				become, grow </em>and many more work in the same way.</li>

			There are lots of good grammar books and, if you are at all serious 
			about teaching, you'll need one or two.<br />
			There are two sorts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>grammar books intended for learners<br />
				These will be easier for you to access and will be enough at the 
				beginning.&nbsp; Good examples are:<br />
				Foley, M &amp; Hall, D, 1988<em>, Longman advanced learners' grammar</em>, 
				Harlow: Longman<br />
				Swan, M, 2005, <em>
				Practical English Usage (3rd Ed.)</em>, Oxford:
				Oxford University Press</li>
				<li>books intended for more serious study and for use by 
				teachers<br />
				These are the places to go for the inside story but they are 
				more difficult.&nbsp; Good examples are:<br />
				Leech, G and Svartvik J, 3rd 
				edition, 2003, <em>A Communicative Grammar of English</em>, 
				Harlow: Longman<br />Lock, G,  
				1996, <em>Functional English Grammar</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge 
				University Press<br />Parrott, M, 2010, <em>Grammar for English Language Teachers (2nd Ed.),
				</em>Cambridge: Cambridge University Press<br />Thornbury, S, 2004, <em> Natural Grammar</em>, 
				Oxford: Oxford 
				University Press</li>

			<p>You have already found a good one.<br />
			There are lots of websites intended to help people understand 
			aspects of English grammar.&nbsp; Many are wrong, many just lists of 
			interesting (or otherwise) facts and some are plain confusing.&nbsp; 
			Beware sites that prescribe by saying <em>That's wrong!, This is 
			right!</em> and so on.&nbsp; They are often written by people who 
			have an axe to grind and are rarely reliable.<br />
			Make sure you have a decent grammar book as well so you can 
			cross-check for accuracy.</p>
			<p>There are a number of grammar exercises and lessons for learners 
			on this site.&nbsp;
