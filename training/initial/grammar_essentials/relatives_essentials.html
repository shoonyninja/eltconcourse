		<p>
		Relative clauses are a way to define or add information to a noun in a 
		sentence.<br />
		So, for example, in<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog which howled all night and kept me awake<br />
		</em>The noun, <em>dog</em>, is rendered <strong>unique</strong> among millions of dogs 
		because only this one howled and caused me a sleepless night.&nbsp; The 
		pronoun <em>which</em> refers back to the noun <em>dog</em> and <em>dog</em> 
		is the subject of the verb <em>howl</em> (<em>the dog howled</em>).&nbsp; 
		We can make the same idea in English with two sentences like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>The dog howled all night</em></li>
			<li><em>The dog kept me awake</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>but it is easier and clearer to use a relative pronoun to link the 
		ideas.</p>
			<p>Sometimes you will see relative pronoun clauses described as
			<strong>adjective clauses</strong> and that is a defensible point of 
			view because they modify and describe the noun in some way.&nbsp; We 
			will remain here with the usual terminology for these things.</p>
		<p>Here is another example of a slightly different sort of relative clause:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The White House, that stands on Pennsylvania 
		Avenue, is a huge building<br />
		</em>Here, too, we can make two sentences:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>The White House stands on Pennsylvania Avenue</em></li>
			<li><em>The White House is a huge building</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>The situation is slightly different because we already know that <em>The 
		White House</em> is unique (it's the name of a particular building) so the fact that it 
		stands on Pennsylvania Avenue is 
		just extra information.&nbsp; The fact that it stands there does 
		not define the building, it just adds data.<br />
		Look where the commas appear 
		and you will see that the clause is divided from the rest of the 
		sentence.<br />
		That's important, as we shall see.</p>

				<h2>Forming a simple relative clause sentence</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
			<p>There are rules for forming relative clauses in English and some 
			are quite complicated.&nbsp; The simplest way is like this.</p>
			<p>Start with two simple sentences:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lucky children came to the party</em><br />
			and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The children enjoyed themselves</em><br />
			Now identify the subjects of the sentences.<br />
			In the first sentence, the subject is<em> the lucky children</em>.<br />In the second sentence, it is just<em> the children</em>.</p>
			<p>
			Do the following conversion:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Place the second clause after the first noun phrase in the 
				first sentence.<br />
				That gives us:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> The lucky children the children came to the party 
				enjoyed themselves</em></li>
				<li>Now delete the second noun phrase:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lucky children <strong><span class="auto-style86">the 
				children</span> </strong>came to the party enjoyed themselves</li>
				<li>Now replace it with the appropriate relative pronoun, in 
				this case <em>who</em> because the reference is to people.<br />
				That then gives us:<br />
				&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The lucky children <span class="style_red"><strong>who
				</strong></span>came to the party enjoyed themselves</em></li>
			</ol>

			<p>It is easy but this will not work for all relative pronoun 
			clauses.&nbsp; It is, however, a good place to start when teaching 
			the area because many learners' first languages either work very 
			differently or have no relative clause structures at all.</p>

			<p>In speech, of course, we do not have punctuation to help our 
			understanding.&nbsp; However, we still make a difference between 
			defining and non-defining relative clauses in the way we phrase a 
			sentence.&nbsp; It works like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A defining relative clause has the subject <strong>plus</strong> 
				the relative clause as the subject of the verb so we say it like 
				this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The children who came with me </em>|| <em>had lunch</em><br />
				and that means <strong>only</strong> the children who came with 
				me had lunch (and some, by implication, did not).</li>
				<li>A non-defining relative clause just adds information (and 
				the clause could be put in brackets) so we break up the sentence 
				differently, like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The children </em>|| <em>who came with me</em> || <em>had 
				lunch</em><br />
				and that means all the children came with me and they all had 
				lunch.</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />

				<td class="auto-style11" valign="middle">

			</tr>
		</table>
		
			<p>It's important to know whether the relative pronoun is acting as the 
			subject or the object of the verb.<br />
			The subject of a verb is the person or thing that does the action.<br />
			The object of the verb is the person or thing that receives the 
			action.<br />
			Like this:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0" class="tablebrownborder">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style69" style="width: 33%">Subject</td>
					<td class="auto-style68" style="width: 33%">Verb</td>

				its pre-modifying adverb (<em>hopefully</em>) <br />We can  rephrase  the first part of the sentence as <em> <br />

				<p>A simple rule to tell students is:</p>
				<ol class="auto-style90">
					<li><strong>If the relative pronoun is followed <em>directly</em> by a verb phrase 
				with or without a modifying adverbial, it’s the 
				subject.<br /></strong>So, in <em>The man who just bought the car</em>, the 
				relative pronoun, <em>who</em>, is followed directly by the 
				pre-modified verb 
				phrase,<em> bought</em>.&nbsp; This means that the relative 
				pronoun stands for the subject of the verb.</li>
					<li><strong>If the pronoun is not followed by a verb phrase (but by a noun 
				phrase or pronoun) it is the object.<br /></strong>So, in <em>The book which she bought was a first 
				edition</em>, the relative pronoun, <em>which</em>, is followed 
				by a pronoun, <em>she</em>, so it cannot be the subject of the 
				verb.&nbsp; The relative pronoun stands for the object of the 
				verb.</li>
