			<h1>Primary Auxiliary verbs</h1>
			<h2>
			<img height="207" src="../../images/four_colours310.jpg" width="310" alt="4" /></h2>
			<h2>Definition</h2>
			<p>
			<img alt="definition" src="../../images/dictionary_idea250.jpg" /></p>
			<p>An auxiliary verb is one which cannot usually stand alone and 
			retain a clear meaning.&nbsp; Compare, for example,</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>He can</em></li>
				<li><em>He went</em></li>
				<li><em>They are</em></li>
				<li><em>She smokes</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>It's clear that the meanings of sentences 1. and 3. are obscure 
			unless we have some more information.&nbsp; We need to know what <em>
			He can <strong>do</strong></em> and <em><strong>What</strong> they are </em>or<em> are <strong>doing</strong></em>.<br />
			Sentences 2. and 4., however, are complete in themselves and need no 
			further elaboration.<br />
			The verbs <em>can</em> and <em>are</em> in these examples are
			<span class="style_black"><strong>auxiliary verbs</strong></span> 
			and the verbs <em>went</em> and <em>smokes</em> are main or
			<span class="style_black"><strong>lexical</strong></span>
			<span class="style_black"><strong>verbs</strong></span>.&nbsp; This 
			is a crucial distinction.</p>
			<p>In addition to issues of meaning seen above, there are 
			grammatical characteristics of auxiliary verbs which can be used to 
			identify them.&nbsp; A list of 10 tests to identify central modal 
			auxiliary verbs (such as <em>can, could, may, might, should </em>
			etc.) is set out in the guide to them, linked below.&nbsp; Primary 
			auxiliary verbs are, by contrast, rather easier to identify because 
			they perform three essential functions in the language:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style2">
				<li>They form tenses of verbs as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary <span class="styleredbold">has
				</span>arrived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="styleredbold">is </span>running the business<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The money <span class="styleredbold">will </span>run out soon</em></li>
				<li>They change the voice of a clause, from active to passive or 
				from active to causative, as in, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The garden <span class="styleredbold">was
				</span>tidied (vs. Someone tidied the garden)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car <span class="styleredbold">got </span>damaged by a 
				falling tree (vs. A falling tree damaged the car)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="styleredbold">had </span>her hair cut (vs. 
				Someone cut her hair)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="styleredbold">got </span>her money stolen 
				(vs. Someone stole her money)</em></li>
				<li>They form questions, negatives and emphatic statements as 
				in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleredbold">Do </span>you 
				want to come with us?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="styleredbold">did</span>n't see the 
				reasoning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="styleredbold">do </span>like her</em><br />
				Only the auxiliary verb <em>do</em> performs this function.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This guide considers five primary auxiliary verbs: <em>be, have, 
			get, do</em> and <em>will</em>.</p>
			<p>Before we start, however, we need to consider three complicating 
			factors.</p>

					<h3>Complication 1</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are two kinds of auxiliary verbs in English: <strong>Primary 
			Auxiliaries</strong> and <strong>Modal Auxiliaries</strong>.<br />
			Modal Auxiliary verbs include, for example, <em>can, may, might, should, 
			ought to</em> etc.&nbsp; These verbs express notions such as 
			possibility, permission, obligation, likelihood and so on.&nbsp; There are guides to these elsewhere on the site.&nbsp; 
			The place to start is the 
			guide to modality, linked in the list of related guides at the end.<br />
			The ones in focus here are the primary auxiliaries.</p>

					<td class="auto-style4">
					<h3><a name="1"></a>Complication 2</h3>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Some primary auxiliary verbs can function in both ways.&nbsp; They can be 
			auxiliaries and they can also be lexical or main verbs.&nbsp; For example, 
			in these sentences the verbs <em>get, do, will, be </em>and<em> have </em>are 
			functioning in both ways.&nbsp; Can you identify which is which?<br />

				<li><em>They <span class="styleredbold">got </span>home late:<br />
				</em>Here the verb means 
				something like <em>arrived</em> and is lexical because it 
				carries a simple meaning.</li>
				<li><em>We <span class="styleredbold">got </span>the work done:<br />
				</em>Here the verb refers to fact that the speakers / writers 
				did not do the work themselves.&nbsp; The verb functions 
				grammatically to make what is called a causative structure.<em>&nbsp; </em>
				It's a primary auxiliary verb.</li>
				<li><em>He <span class="styleredbold">did </span>the crossword puzzle in three minutes<br />
				</em>Here the verb is lexical and means something like <em>
				finished</em> or <em>accomplished</em>.&nbsp; It is not acting 
				as a primary auxiliary verb.</li>
				<li><em><span class="styleredbold">Did </span>she arrive?<br />
				</em>Here the verb is functioning to form a question but it does 
				not affect the meaning of the main verb, <em>arrive</em>.&nbsp; 
				It is a primary auxiliary verb.</li>
				<li><em>Mary <span class="styleredbold">willed </span>the rain to stop<br />
				</em>Here the verb refers to the act of wishing hard for 
				something and carries meaning.&nbsp; It is a main or lexical 
				verb.</li>
				<li><em>Mary <span class="styleredbold">will </span>be 21 on Thursday<br />
				</em>Here, the verb acts to make a future form in English and is 
				a primary auxiliary verb.</li>
				<li><em>She <span class="styleredbold"><strong>is</strong></span> 
				a teacher:<br />
				</em>Here the verb is lexical, telling you the 
				relationship between <em>she </em>and<em> teacher.</em>&nbsp; 
				Technically, it is called a copular verb because it links two 
				things together.&nbsp; You may also hear it called a linking 
				verb for that reason.</li>
				<li><em>She <span class="styleredbold"><strong>is</strong></span> 
				arriving now:<br />
				</em>Here the verb is an auxiliary and tells us 
				how the verb <em>arriving </em>should be viewed, as an ongoing 
				current action.&nbsp; (That's 
				called aspect, by the way.)</li>
				<li><em>She <span class="styleredbold"><strong>has</strong></span> 
				the papers:<br />
				</em>Here the verb is lexical and means something 
				like <em>owns </em>or<em> possesses </em>or<em> carries.</em></li>
				<li><em>She <span class="styleredbold"><strong>has</strong></span> 
				been to the USA:<br />
				</em>Here the verb is a primary auxiliary and tells us 
				how the verb <em>been </em>should be viewed, as an event in the 
				past which is embedded in and changes the present.&nbsp; (It's another 
				example of aspect.)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here, we are only concerned with verbs acting as auxiliaries.</p>

			<p>Some auxiliaries (notable <em>will</em>) are usually called modal 
			but often act to give grammatical information by forming a tense 
			with a main verb.&nbsp; For this reason, some people will classify
			<em>will</em> and <em>would</em> as Primary Auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; That 
			is a sensible approach because both verbs can act in both ways.&nbsp; 
			The classification is then split so when they act as primary modal 
			auxiliaries, that is what they should be called and, likewise, when 
			they act as modal auxiliary verbs.<br />
			We are going to include the verb <em>will</em> , its alternative <em>
			shall </em>and its past 
			form <em>would</em> in this guide because it sometimes acts as a 
			primary auxiliary verb.&nbsp; That it also acts as a modal auxiliary 
			verb is a source of a good deal of confusion for 
			learners and, alas, many teachers and even some coursebook writers.<br />
			If you want to learn more 
			about the functions of <em>will</em> and <em>would</em>, go to
			the guide to modality.&nbsp; See also below.</p>

			<p>Auxiliary verbs in general are sometimes called 'helping verbs' 
			and, although that is rather babyish, there is a kernel of truth in 
			it.&nbsp; Primary Auxiliaries help in the sense that they provide 
			grammatical information and tell us how to view the lexical or main verb 
			which follows.<br />
			We'll take them one by one.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<img alt="do" height="104" src="../../imagesgraphics/do150l.png" width="150" /><p>The first thing to note about this verb is that it is very 
			frequently seen as a lexical or main verb in things such as:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He
			<span class="style_black"><strong>did</strong></span> the work 
			carefully<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is <span class="style_black"><strong>doing</strong></span> 
			her homework<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_black"><strong>do</strong></span> 
			that a lot<br />
			</em>etc. 
			and in these cases, the verb carries the meaning of perform an 
			action.&nbsp; As a lexical verb, <em>do</em> can carry other 
			meanings but the lexical verb does not concern us 
			here.</p>
			<p>The second thing to note is that this verb only functions as a 
			Primary Auxiliary verb in present simple and past simple tenses.&nbsp; 
			Nowhere else.&nbsp; For this reason, it is often referred to as an 
			operator because it can operate on a main verb in, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He does enjoy music</em><br />
			in which the verb takes on the ending (<em>es</em>) which would 
			normally occur on the lexical or main verb (<em>enjoy<span class="style_underline">s</span></em>).<br />
			In this case, it simply serves to emphasise the verb <em>enjoy</em>.&nbsp; 
			That is only one of its functions.</p>
			<h3><em><a name="2"></a>do</em> as a Primary Auxiliary verb</h3>
			<p>What function is the verb <em>do</em> performing in these 
			examples?</p>
			<ol class="auto-style2">
				<li><strong><em>Did</em></strong><em> you see the film?</em></li>
				<li><em>I </em><strong><em>do</em></strong><em>n't understand</em></li>
				<li><em>I </em><strong><em>do</em></strong><em> demand it</em></li>
				<li><em><strong>Do</strong>n't talk to me</em></li>
			</ol>

			<ol id="list2" style="position: relative;  visibility: hidden"class="auto-style2">
				<li><strong><em>Did</em></strong><em> you see the film?<br />
				</em><span class="style_brown">Here the verb signifies that what follows is a question.&nbsp; Very few 
				languages have a dedicated auxiliary verb for this function and 
				the form and use is difficult for learners at lower levels.<br />
				A common alternative way to use the auxiliary to make a question 
				is by using it as a substitute for a main or lexical verb in a 
				tag question as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em class="style_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You saw the film, 
				<strong>did</strong>n't you?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She works hard, <strong>does</strong>n't she</em><em>?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				We can, of course, also have negative questions as in, e.g.:<br />
				</span><span class="style_blue">&nbsp;</span><em><span class="style_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<strong>Did</strong>n't she enjoy the film?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Do</strong>n't you like it?</span></em></li>
				<li><em>I </em><strong><em>do</em></strong><em>n't understand<br />
				</em><span class="style_brown">Here the verb signifies that what follows is a negative.&nbsp; Again, very 
				few languages have a dedicated auxiliary verb for this function 
				and the form and use is difficult for learners at lower levels.<br />
				Most languages simply use a single negator (usually translated 
				as <em>no</em> or <em>not</em>) to perform this grammatical

				</em><span class="style_brown">Here the verb signifies that the speaker wants to emphasise the following 
				verb.&nbsp; The word will often be spoken more loudly and with a 
				higher pitch in this case.</span></li>
				<li><em><strong>Do</strong>n't talk to me<br />
				</em><span class="style_brown">Here the verb is used to make the 
				negative of an imperative or order.<br />
				Sometimes the verb also emphasises a positive imperative as in, 
				e.g.:<br />
				</span><span class="style_blue"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Do</strong> be 
				quiet!</em></span></li>
			</ol>
			<h3>The summary of <em>do</em>:</h3>
			<p>
			<img alt="do" height="373" src="../../imagesgraphics/do.png" width="620" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In questions, imperatives and negatives, the verb is not usually stressed.&nbsp; 
			The stress in these cases is on the lexical or main verb because that is 
			carrying the meaning.&nbsp; In emphasising uses, however, the 
			verb is stressed.</p>
			<hr />
			<img alt="have" height="104" src="../../imagesgraphics/have150.png" width="150" /><p>
			Again, <em>have</em> can function as a 
			lexical or main verb and frequently does.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_black"><strong>have</strong></span> a shower every evening</em> (meaning, roughly,
				<em>take</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I <span class="style_black"><strong>have</strong></span> his address</em> (meaning, roughly, <em>possess</em>)</p>
			<p>When it is a lexical or main verb, we 
			can:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>Use it with the <em>do </em>auxiliary (as above) to make 
				questions or negatives in, 
				e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't 
				<span class="styleblackbold">have</span> a shower every evening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you 
				<span class="styleblackbold">have</span> sugar 
				in tea?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you <span class="styleblackbold">have</span> my address? </em>etc.</li>
				<li>Make negatives and questions (especially in British English) 
				without the <em>do</em> auxiliary but <strong>only if the 
				meaning is something like </strong><em><strong>possess </strong>
				</em><strong>or</strong><em><strong> own </strong></em>as in, 
				e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="styleblackbold">have</span>n't (got) your address<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="styleblackbold">Have </span>you (got) the 
				money?<br />
				</em>etc.<br /><strong>But not:</strong><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
				<span class="styleblackbold">have</span>n't (got) a shower every day<br />
				</em>because the meaning is <em>take</em> rather than <em>
				possess
				</em>or<em> own.<br />
				</em>The use of <em>got </em>in these cases is almost obligatory 
				in British English and leaving it out sounds very formal.<br />
				American English almost always prefers the <em>do </em>auxiliary 
				in these cases and there is evidence that British English is 
				tending that way.&nbsp; It is certainly easier to teach it that 
				way.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The third thing to note is that when the verb is a Primary 
			Auxiliary, we never use the <em>do</em> auxiliary with it.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; 
			It is not possible to say something like<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Do you have met him?<br />
			</em>and that is a cause for error at lower levels especially.</p>
			<p>The fourth complication is that <em>have</em> when it is followed 
			by <em>to </em>+ an infinitive is a modal auxiliary verb akin to <em>must</em> 
			as in, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
			<span class="styleblackbold">have </span>to leave now<br />
			</em>and in this case it does not qualify as a primary auxiliary 
			verb but is a modal auxiliary verb.</p>

				</em><span class="style_brown">In sentences
				a., c. and d., the 
				verb <em>have </em>is acting to make what is called a tense in 
				the perfect aspect.&nbsp; This usually implies an unfinished 
				action, reference to our lives before now or a recent event 
				which has implications for the present.&nbsp; 
				It is a way in English of embedding the past in the present and 
				showing that a past event or state changed the present in some 
				way.&nbsp; That's why it is called the <strong>present</strong> 
				perfect.<br />
				For more see
				the 
				guide to the present perfect, linked below.<br />
				In the case of sentence b. we have another perfect tense form 
				but this is the future perfect which serves to embed one future 
				event in another and show how one will change the other.&nbsp; 
				Another example of this form is:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll have finished in an hour and then I'll go home.<br />
				</em>which signals that the speaker is putting the viewpoint 
				into the future and looking back on a past event from there.</span></li>

				</em><span class="style_brown">Making a negative and then a

				In both these cases, e. and f., the verb is

				refers to an event before a past event.&nbsp; It is the way 
				English has of embedding one past event or state inside another 
				and showing how the first event or state changed the second on.<br />
				For more, see
				the 
				guide to the past perfect, also linked below.</span></li>
				<li><em>I <strong>had</strong> my tooth taken out</em></li>
				<li><em>I'll <strong>have</strong> the window repaired<br />
				</em><span class="style_brown">In both these cases, g. and h., 
				the verb is used to form what is called the causative.&nbsp; This 
				usually refers to an event which is either unwelcome (g.) or 
				something one arranges for someone else to do (h.).<br />
				It is, in English, a form of passive voice because it 
				emphasises what happened, rather than who performed the 
				action.<br />

			</ol>
			<p>In these cases it is known as a copular verb and joins two things

			As a lexical verb it has a <span class="style_underline">very</span>

			different meanings of the verb ranging from <em>achieve, reach,

				</em><span class="style_brown">In both these cases the verb is 
				being used in the same way as the auxiliary <em>have</em> was 
				used (see above) to make a causative sentence.&nbsp; The 
				meanings are the same: either to arrange something or to suffer 
				an unpleasant event.&nbsp; Generally, causatives with <em>get</em> 
				are considered less formal than those with <em>have</em>.</span></li>
				<li><em>The window <strong>got</strong> damaged</em></li>
				<li><em>They will <strong>get</strong> arrested for it<br />
				</em><span class="style_brown">In both these cases the verb is 
				followed by the past participle of a lexical or main verb and used to 
				form the passive voice in the same way that <em>be</em> is used 
				(see above).&nbsp; Generally, passives with <em>get</em> are 
				also considered less formal than those with <em>be</em>.<br />
				In English, the verb <em>get</em> can only apply to what is called a 
				dynamic passive &ndash; referring to an action rather than a 
				state.&nbsp; The verb <em>be</em>, on the other hand, can refer 
				to both states (stative passives) and actions.&nbsp; Examples 
				will help:<br />
				<em class="style_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl got injured 
				during the game</em><br />
				is a less formal way of saying<br />
				<em class="style_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl was injured 
				during the game</em><br />
				and both are dynamic uses referring to an action.<br />
				However,<br />
				<em class="style_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window got broken</em><br />
				and<br />
				</span><span class="style_blue"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
				window was broken</em></span><span class="style_brown"><br />
				may refer to an action but only the second of these can also 
				refer to the state of the window.&nbsp; Only in the second case, 
				in other words, is a stative interpretation possible.<br />
				Many languages, e.g., German, reserve different verbs for stative 
				and dynamic uses.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>So, in sentences a. and b., we can replace <em>get </em>with<em> 
			have</em> and in sentences c. and d., we can replace it with <em>be</em>.<br />
			In both cases <em>get</em> is usually less formal.</p>

			<img alt="will" height="104" src="../../imagesgraphics/will150.png" width="150" /><p>
			We noted at the beginning that not all analyses consider this verb 
			to be a primary auxiliary verb.&nbsp; We do in this guide, however, 
			because in one of its functions, it acts as a primary auxiliary 
			verb.</p>
			<p>
			The verb has a number of meanings considered at length elsewhere on 
			this site (see the guide to <em>will</em> and <em>would</em> linked below, 
			for example).<br />
			The 
			three main meanings it carries are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>As a lexical verb.<br />
				When <em>will</em> is used in this way it is a regular verb with 
				two meanings:<ol class="auto-style2">
					<li><em>bequeath</em> as in <em>pass down</em> to the next 
					generation as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He willed his entire fortune to his 
					dog</em></li>
					<li>exercise mental power (usually pointlessly) as in, e.g.:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He willed the rain to stop</em></li>
				</ol>These meanings of the verb do not concern us here.</li>
				<li>As a modal auxiliary verb indicating willingness or 
				volition.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'<strong>ll </strong>take you to the station if you like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary says she'<strong>ll</strong> help with the work</em><br />
				In this meaning, the past tense is formed as <em>would</em> so 
				we can also get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I promised I <strong>would</strong> take you to the 
				station<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary said she <strong>would</strong> help</em><br />
				&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; John <strong>would</strong> always help his children with 
				their homework</em><br />
				The verb when it acts in this way indicates what is known as 
				dynamic or personal modality because it concerns the speaker's 
				willingness to do something.<br />
				The last example above, concerning homework is often analysed as 
				the verb signalling habitual activity in the past and it does do 
				that.&nbsp; Here, however, it also implies a past willingness to 
				do something and is acting as a modal auxiliary verb expressing 
				dynamic modality.<br />
				It can also act to express how likely something is in the 
				speaker's view so we also get, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That <strong>will</strong> be the postman the dog is 
				barking at<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect John <strong>will</strong> be working now</em><br />
				with both signifying that the speaker is fairly (not 100%) sure 
				of the truth of what is said.<br />
				Neither of these uses of the verb concern us here because they 
				are modal meanings concerning the speaker's willingness or 
				belief.</li>
				<li>As a primary auxiliary verb forming part of a future tense 
				form.<br />
				This is the use that does concern us here because the main 
				function of primary auxiliary verbs is grammatical and in this 
				case the way that English forms a tense referring to pure 
				futurity is to use <em>will</em> or <em>shall</em> as a primary 
				auxiliary verb.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <strong>will</strong> be 35 tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <strong>shall</strong> not be in London before 6<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'<strong>ll</strong> expect an answer</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It <strong>will</strong> be cold in Alaska at this time of 
				year</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary <strong>will</strong> be chairing 
				the meeting</em><br />
				and so on all refer to the future and make no statement at all 
				about the willingness of the people.&nbsp; In the example about 
				Alaska, 
				of course, willingness or otherwise is not even in consideration 
				because the weather cannot show volition.<br />
				In the last example, we have a slightly different future tense 
				form which implies that something will happen <em>as a matter of 
				course</em>.</li>

			<p>
			You can see from that little exercise that it is not easy to 
			disentangle the meanings in all cases.&nbsp; However, if we do not 
			try with learners to make sure that the meanings of <em>will / shall 
			/ would</em> acting as a modal auxiliary verb or acting as a primary 
			auxiliary verb are clear, we are asking for trouble.<br />
			Many languages, including Romance languages such as Italian, French, 
			Spanish and more and most Slavic languages, have a special tense 
			form for the future which English does not have.<br />
			Other languages (such as Dutch and German, Danish, Swedish and 
			Norwegian) work a little like English in using an auxiliary verb but 
			these languages do not all have the added complication of using the same 
			verb to signal both willingness and futurity.<br />
			Some languages, including Chinese languages, some south-east Asian 
			languages and Greek use a particle to denote a future time reference 
			rather as English uses <em>will</em>.</p>

			<p>If we are including the verb <em>would</em> in its sense of 
			signalling a discontinued habit, as in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would often take a trip to the market<br />
			</em>as forming a past tense with a habitual aspect, then it is a 
			logical extension to classify. e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We often used to take a trip to the market<br />
			</em>as equally an example of the verb <em>used</em>, followed in 
			this case with the <em>to-</em>infinitive as performing a primary 
			rather than modal function.<br />
			That is to say, that the verb forms a tense rather than expressing 
			the usual modal meanings of obligation, likelihood, doubt, certainty 
			and so on.<br />
			However, most authorities persist in classifying the structure <em>
			used</em> + <em>to-</em>infinitive as a semi-modal verb and that is 
			what is done in the guide to those verbs on this site (link below).</p>
