				<li>These are all examples of <strong>balanced tags</strong>.&nbsp; 
				A negative sentence takes a positive tag and <em>vice versa</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't understand, does she?</em> (negative + positive)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary can come too, can't she?</em> (positive + negative)<br />
				Not all tag forms are balanced as we shall see.</li>
				<li><strong>With main or lexical verbs </strong>such as <em>like, 
				hate, enjoy, do, arrive</em> etc., we use the auxiliary verb<em> do</em> 
				in the tag, providing the verb is in the present simple or past 
				simple tense:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He didn't go, did he?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She smokes too much, doesn't she?</em></li>
				<li><strong>With modal auxiliary verbs</strong> like <em>can, must, could</em> etc., we 
				simply invert the verb and the subject to make a tag:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They couldn't see her, could they?</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The play should be popular, shouldn't it?</em></li>
				<li><strong>With the verb </strong><em><strong>to be</strong></em>, 
				whether it is an auxiliary or a main verb, we simply invert the 
				order of subject and verb to make the tag:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are John, aren't you?</em> (as a main identifying verb)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You aren't alone, are you?</em> (as a main verb with an 
				adjective complement)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are working too hard, aren't you?</em> (as an auxiliary 
				forming the progressive)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was arrested, wasn't she?</em> (as an auxiliary forming 
				a passive voice sentence)</li>
				<li><strong>With the verb </strong><em><strong>to have</strong></em> 
				the situation is slightly more complicated:<br />
				When it is an auxiliary forming a tense, we treat it like <em>to 
				be</em>, inverting the subject and the verb:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has arrived, hasn't she?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She had left already, hadn't she?</em><br />
				When it functions as a main verb, meaning something like <em>
				possess</em>, both forms are possible:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have a lot of money, don't they?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They have a lot of money, haven't they?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They don't have much money, do they?</em><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They haven't much money, have they?</em><br />
				But, when we insert <em>got</em> after the verb, only the 
				inverted form is possible:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We haven't got a lot of time, have we?</em><strong><br />
				not</strong><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *We haven't got a lot of time, do we?<br />
				</em>American and British usage differs in some respects here 
				because AmE uses <em>got</em> less frequently in this sense.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>That is actually rather a long list of rules and some are not 
			simple.&nbsp; It's an area to treat carefully and piecemeal in the 
			classroom.</p>

					<h2>Other languages differ</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>A few languages work like English with tags following grammatical 
			rules for forming questions and negatives but many do not.&nbsp; For 
			example:</p>
			<p>Many languages, including Polish, German, Greek and others 
			can use a phrase or a single word meaning, roughly, <em>True?</em> or
			<em>Not 
			true?</em>&nbsp; So, e.g.:<br />
			German: <em>nicht wahr?</em> [<em>not true?</em>], Spanish: <em>¿verdad?</em> [<em>true?</em>], 
			Polish: <em>prawda?</em> [<em>true?</em>] or <em>nieprawdaż?</em> [<em>not true?</em>], Greek:
			<em>δεν είναι ετσι;</em> (<em>then eenay etsi?</em>) [<em>is it not 
			so?</em>] and so on.<br />
			Some languages have a small range of words or phrases to ask for 
			agreement such as French: <em>n'est ce pas?</em> [<em>isn't it</em>] 
			or <em>d'accord?</em> [<em>agree?</em>].<br />
			In many languages there exists a small word used only for tag 
			questions such as Mandarin (<em>ma?</em>), German dialects (<em>gell?</em>) 
			Portuguese: <em>né?</em> and so on.</p>
			<p>In most languages, the forms have become fossilised and do not 
			vary in the complicated ways that the tags vary in English.&nbsp; 
			This presents obvious problems for learners.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="meaning" height="166" src="../../images/meaning_woman250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3">
					<h2>Meaning</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<h3>intonation</h3>
			<p>Meaning is closely tied to intonation.<br />
			In many cases, the tone of voice falls on the tag, like this:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="tag example" height="63" src="../../imagesgraphics/tageg2.png" width="200" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="tag example" height="68" src="../../imagesgraphics/tageg1.png" width="179" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>When the voice falls like this, the tag functions to mean 
			something like:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Please say you agree with me</em>.<br />
			In 
			other words, it asks for confirmation that the speaker is correct 
			rather than signalling a true question.&nbsp; 
			Notice that the words <em>lovely</em> and <em>late</em> are also 
			stressed here.</p>
			<p>When the tone rises, like this:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="tag example" height="65" src="../../imagesgraphics/tageg4.png" width="200" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="tag example" height="63" src="../../imagesgraphics/tageg3.png" width="180" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Then the sentences function as true interrogatives.&nbsp; Notice 
			that now we stress the verb because that is the focus of our 
			attention.</p>
			<h3>intention</h3>
			<p>The communicative function of the sentence is drawn from the 
			first clause.&nbsp; Compare, e.g.:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You want a drink, don't you?<br />
			</em>where the speaker is probably sure the answer will be 'yes' 
			with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't want a drink, do you?<br />
			</em>where a falling tone would imply the speaker expects a negative 
			response but a rising tone would indicate surprise.<br />
			The same thing happens with modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; Compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You couldn't do it for me, could you?<br />
			</em>where a rising tone indicates a request, with:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You could do it for me, couldn't you?<br />
			</em>where a rising tone indicates a request but a falling tone 
			indicates almost a command.</p>
			<hr />
			
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="unbalanced" height="166" src="../../images/overbalance250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>Unbalanced tags</h2>
					<h3>So ...</h3></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Unbalanced tags have a different, but very common, structure.&nbsp; 
			They involve positive + positive or negative + negative and have 
			number of uses:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Inference:<br /><em>So, the car's over the road, is it?<br />
				</em>i.e., I have figured this out from where we are walking</li>
				<li>Sarcasm, suspicion or irony:<br /><em>So you think you know me, 
				do you?<br />
				</em>i.e., you are presuming too much or<br />
				<em>So, you 
				don't believe me, don't you?<br />
				</em>i.e., it's not your place to make judgements</li>
				<li>Threat:<br /><em>You'd take my money, would you?</em></li>
				<li>Conclusion:<br /><em>So, he likes the book, does he?<br />
				So, he 
				hasn't had the time, hasn't he?<br />
				</em>The sense of reaching a conclusion is also signalled by the 
				word <em>then.&nbsp;
				</em><em>&nbsp;</em>Technically speaking the word is a conjunct, 
				linking what has been said before and implying that the hearer 
				has inferred something from what has been said.&nbsp; In this 
				case, the intonation patterns strongly suggest that the word is 
				being used instead of a tag question.&nbsp; For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll give you a lift tonight if you like, then?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, you are coming to the party, then?</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In all of these the tone usually rises on the tag.</p>
			<p>The use of an introductory <em>So ...</em> in these sorts of 
			utterances is extremely common.&nbsp; <strong>Don't try to teach the 
			area without making that clear.</strong></p>

			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>

					<img alt="irregular" height="166" src="../../images/difference_shoes250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>Irregularities and complications</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There are a few irregular forms to be wary of.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Negating the verb <em>be</em> is irregular so the tags used 
				with it are also irregular.<br />
				If the first statement starts with <em>I</em>, the tag is 
				formed with <em>aren't</em>:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm here, aren't I?</em><br />
				This does <strong>not</strong> work the other way round:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not invited, am I?</em><br />
				not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'm not invited, are I?</em><br />
				(<em>amn't I?</em> exists in some dialects.)<br />
				When the negative tag is used with the first person, only the 
				contracted form is allowable so we get:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm playing, aren't I?</em><br />
				but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'm playing, are not I?<br />
				</em>This causes trouble when trying to use formal unabbreviated 
				language and the only alternative is:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm playing, am I not?<br />
				</em>which sounds far too formal for many people.<br />
				When the first clause is negative, no issues arise and we allow:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not playing, am I?<br />
				</em>but learners may carry over the negative tag form, 
				logically, and produce:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I'm not playing, are I?</em></li>
				<li>Some consider a tag formed with <em>may</em> to be unusual 
				or stilted:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joan may come, mayn't she?<br />
				</em>The preference here is often to exchange <em>may </em>for<em> 
				could/might, </em>when talking about possibility:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could/might be here early, couldn't/mightn't she?</em><br />
				and <em>can</em> for <em>may</em> when talking about permission:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				M<span class="auto-style39">ary </span>can come, can't she?</em></li>
				<li>Imperative forms<ol class="auto-style34">
					<li>Positive imperative forms (commands) take <em>will</em> 
					in the tag:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Be quite, will you?<br />
					</em>which can be softened with <em>would:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Be quiet, would you?</em></li>
					<li>Positive imperative forms also take <strong>both</strong> 
					positive and negative tags with a slight change of emphasis:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Be quiet, won't you?
					</em>(pleading)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be, quiet, will you
					</em>(command imperative)<br />but this is not allowed with <em>would:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*Be quiet, wouldn't you?</em></li>
					<li>Negative commands (i.e., prohibitions) take <strong>no</strong> tag so we 
					can't say:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					*Don't touch it, will you?<br />
					</em>(Although <em>You won't touch it, will you? </em>is 
					fine.)</li>
					<li>Real imperatives are used with a rising tone and both 
					positive and negative tags but a falling tone with a 
					negative tag denotes concern.&nbsp; Compare:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Drive carefully, will you? </em>(rising tone indicates 
					irritation and is an imperative)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sit still, won't you? </em>(rising tone indicates 
					irritation and is an imperative)<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drive carefully, won't you?</em> (falling tone indicates 
					concern rather than an imperative)</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Complex tenses<br />
				When we make a tag question with a complex tense (i.e., one that 
				has more than one auxiliary verb), it is the first auxiliary 
				which is used in the tag:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <strong>has</strong>n't been working too hard again, 
				<strong>has</strong> he?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He <strong>wo</strong>n't have arrived yet, <strong>will</strong> he?</em></li>
				<li>Pronunciation<br />
				It is rare for weak forms of vowels to occur in tags.&nbsp; The 
				verb <em>can</em> is usually contracted to/kən/ in connected 
				speech but in the tag, it retains its full pronunciation as /kæn/.&nbsp; 
				E.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can come, can't I? </em>is usually transcribed as /ˈaɪ kən 
				kʌm ˈkɑːnt aɪ/ but<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't come, can I?</em> is usually /ˈaɪ kɑːnt kʌm ˈkæn aɪ 
				/</li>

			<p>Tag questions are almost solely used in informal spoken language 
			or written language which resembles spoken language (such as informal emails).<br />
			As we saw above, under meaning, they can be simple statements 
			requiring only confirmation, real questions or expressions of 
			inference, 
			sarcasm, threat, reprimand or conclusion.<br />

			<p>Very often, tags questions are used to initiate or maintain a 
			conversation and are very helpful to learners who sometimes struggle 
			to achieve this.<br />
			They are, however, quite complicated so should be approached in a 
			piecemeal fashion.&nbsp; One lesson will not be enough.</p>

				<li><strong>Formality</strong><br />
				As was noted under use, above, tags are a feature of informal, 
				spoken language so that is the setting in which they should be 
				presented or practised.&nbsp; Written exercises can be a way of 
				focusing learners carefully on form but it is not a natural way 
				to practise question tags.<br />
				Dialogues such as:<table class="auto-style2" cellpadding="3">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style29" colspan="2">
						<img alt="sheep" height="166" src="../../images/animals_sheep_bustop250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style25">A</td>
						<td class="auto-style26"><em>It's cold, isn't it?</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style27">B</td>
						<td class="auto-style28"><em>Yes, isn't it?</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style27">A</td>
						<td class="auto-style28"><em>The 51 should be here by 
						now, shouldn't it?</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style27">B</td>
						<td class="auto-style28"><em>Well, it's Sunday.&nbsp; 
						It's a reduced timetable, isn't it?</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style23">A</td>
						<td class="auto-style24"><em>You'd think they'd run a 
						proper service, though, wouldn't you?</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				and so on, are helpful to set scenes and emphasise both that 
				tags are used as ice-breakers in conversation and are informal.</li>
				<li><strong>Function</strong><br />
				What is in the mind of the speaker is very important.&nbsp; You 
				can't teach question tags without making the speaker's 
				intentions clear.<br />
				Remember that intonation plays a vital role in getting meaning 
				across.<br />
				In the little dialogue above, the opening comment almost 
				certainly has a falling tone on the tag because it's an 
				ice-breaker.&nbsp; Thereafter, it all depends on the amount of 
				knowledge a speaker has:<br />
				If speaker A knows the timetable and is just making 
				conversation, <em>shouldn't it? </em>will have a 
				falling tone.&nbsp; If the speaker is truly asking for 
				information, the tone will rise.<br />
				If speaker B knows about Sunday timetables, the tone on the tag 
				will fall, but if she/he is uncertain, the tone will rise.<br />
				An awareness raising task might be something like:<br />
				<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style2" style="width: 804px">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style32">Look at the tone of voice.&nbsp; 
						Are the speakers sure or not?</td>
						<td class="auto-style26"></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style33">
						<img alt="q tags dialogue" height="195" src="../../imagesgraphics/qtagdialogue1.png" width="400" /></td>
						<td class="auto-style28">
						<img alt="q tag dialogue" height="195" src="../../imagesgraphics/qtagdialogue2.png" width="400" /></td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="style_black">
						<td class="auto-style33">In this dialogue the speakers 
						are just making conversation.&nbsp; Neither speaker asks 
						a real question &ndash; they both just want the other 
						person to say they are right.&nbsp; They both know the 
						timetable and they are both unhappy with the poor 
						service.</td>
						<td class="auto-style28">In this dialogue, apart from 
						the first comment, the speakers are asking real 
						questions or saying they are surprised at how cold it 
						is.&nbsp; They do not know the timetable and they are 
						complaining about the service.</td>
					</tr>

				Of course, you can vary the way the arrows point and make all 
				sorts of other meanings.&nbsp; If you have an interactive 
				whiteboard, that's a useful tool but this can be done with 
				cut-out arrows placed on a handout or stuck to a whiteboard.<br />
				If you can record the dialogue naturally in a few ways and get 
				learners to place the arrows pointing the way they hear and then 
				get them to adjust them and test each other's intonation and 
				understanding of speaker intention, that's even better.<br />
				Notice that these two dialogues only focus on balanced tags with 
				the verb <em>be</em> and two modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; You can adapt it 
				to include complex tenses and unbalanced tags but only at higher 
				levels.</li>
				<li><strong>Form</strong><br />
				The form of question tags, especially for learners whose 
				languages are very different in this area is actually quite hard 
				to learn and produce naturally.&nbsp; Learners need lots of 
				focused practice and some drilling, possibly.<br />
				It's easy to provide this with gap-fill, completion exercises 
				and so on but be careful not to overload learners, especially at 
				lower levels, with too many rules and forms.&nbsp; For a couple 
				of ideas in this area, look at
				<a href="../../../learners/exercises/indexpages/grammara1a2.html" target="_blank">
				the grammar exercises for learners at A1/A2 level</a> or at
				<a href="../../../learners/exercises/mats/grammar/b1b2grammar/b1b2tags_modals.htm" target="_blank">
				a mixed tag exercise for slightly higher-level learners</a>.<br />
				Check the five rules at the start of this guide and focus on 
				them one by one initially.&nbsp; Later, you can mix them up but 
				until the learners are confidently producing accurate tags in 
				each area, that is perilous.<br />
				Here's a suggested way to focus:<ul class="greybullet">
					<li>Start with balanced tags.&nbsp; Negative + Positive and 
					Positive + Negative.</li>
					<li>Focus on to the use of <em>be</em> and <em>have</em>:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's cold, isn't it?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					You aren't wearing a coat, are you?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					You haven't got a spare one, have you?</em></li>
					<li>Focus on modal auxiliary verbs:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't borrow hers, can I?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					You could go inside, couldn't you?</em></li>
					<li>Focus on main verbs and <em>do, does, did</em>:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You didn't bring a hat, did you?</em><br />
					etc.</li>
					<li>Only when the above have been mastered should you focus 
					at more advanced levels on functions such as inference, 
					conclusion, sarcasm or threat.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
