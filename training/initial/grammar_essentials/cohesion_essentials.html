		<h2>What is cohesion?</h2>
		<table style="width: 100%">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="cohesion" height="207" src="../../images/jigsaw_push_together310.jpg" width="310" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style2">
				<h3 class="style_black"><em><strong>Cohesion</strong></em> <em>refers to the way ideas are linked together to make 
		meaning and applies to both written and spoken language.</em></h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>For example, look at the sentence and focus on the words in
		<span class="style_red">red</span> and <span class="style_black">
		black</span>.</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style49">
				<tr>
					<td><span class="style_black">John</span> came into 
		<span class="style_black">the house</span>, walked through <span class="style_red"><em>
		it</em></span> <span class="style_red"><em>and</em></span> went into 
		<span class="style_black">the garden</span> <span class="style_red"><em>where</em></span>
		<span class="style_red"><em>he</em></span> picked two red 
		<span class="style_black">rose</span>s and a 
		yellow <span class="style_red"><em>one</em></span>.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>The words in red are examples of cohesion in English and they link to 
		the words in black.&nbsp;
		<span class="style_red"><em>it</em></span> refers to 
		<span class="style_black"><em>the house</em></span>,
		<span class="style_red"><em>and</em></span> links the two actions,
		<span class="style_red"><em>where</em></span> links the garden to the 
		action, <span class="style_red"><em>one</em></span> at the end tells 
		us it's also a rose so we don't need to repeat the noun.&nbsp; We don't repeat <em>John</em> in <em>walked through it</em>  
		because we know who did that so we can leave out the word (that's called
		<span class="style_black">ellipsis</span>).</p>
			<p>We could, of course, not use any of these clever devices to link 
			things together and we often don't use them so much when we are 
			speaking off the cuff and don't have time to think so we could 
			rephrase the whole paragraph as:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style49">
				<tr>
					<td><span class="style_black">John came into 
		the house.&nbsp; John walked through house.&nbsp; John went into 
		the garden.&nbsp; John picked two red roses in the garden.&nbsp; John 
					picked a yellow rose in the garden.</span></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>but you will probably agree that without any cohesion, the paragraph 
		is clumsy and childish.&nbsp; Children do, in fact, often talk and write 
		like this because they have yet to learn more sophisticated ways to 
		string ideas together.</p>
			<p>A small technical note:<br />
			What we are talking about here is called reference (one thing 
			referring to another).&nbsp; The thing referred to is called the 
			referent so in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John talked to me</em><br />
			the referent of the word <em>me</em> is the speaker of this sentence.<br />
			In the example above, the word <span class="style_red"><em>it</em></span> 
			is a reference to <span class="style_black"><em>the house</em></span> 
			and the referent is <span class="style_black"><em>the house</em></span>.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="two directions" height="166" src="../../images/sign_left_right250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Back and forth</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>You can see in the example sentence about John and the garden 
			that the first pronoun, <em>it</em>, refers back to something we have already 
			mentioned and leaving out John in the sentence is possible after the 
			first time we mention him because we know that the subject is not 
			changing.&nbsp; This is the usual way that referencing, i.e., one 
			way of making a text cohesive, works.</p>
			<p>We can refer back in a text like this:<br />
		<img alt="referencing" height="102" src="../../imagesgraphics/anaphoric.png" width="465" /><br />
		This is called <span class="style_black">anaphoric referencing</span>.</p>
			<p>We have:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>it</em><br />
				referring back to <em>the house</em><br />
				This is pronoun referencing.</li>
				<li><em>where</em><br />
				referring to <em>in the garden</em><br />
				This is relative adverb referencing.</li>
				<li><em>he</em><br />
				referring to <em>John</em><br />
				This is also pronoun referencing.</li>
				<li><em>one</em><br />
				referring to <em>roses</em><br />
				This is also pronoun referencing.</li>
			</ol>
		<p>It's also possible to refer forward in a text but that is rarer and 
		gives a different, literary, feel sometimes.</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="referencing" src="../../imagesgraphics/cataphoric.png" /><br />
		This is called <span class="style_black">cataphoric referencing</span>.</p>
			<p>
			Here, we have:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>he</em><br />
				referring forward to <em>John</em></li>
				<li><em>it</em><br />
				referring forward to <em>the garden</em></li>
			</ol>

		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Reference</strong>:</dt>
	<dd>Often this is achieved through the use of pronouns such as
	<span class="style_red"><em>he</em></span> in the sentence about 
	<span class="style_black">John</span> 
	above.<br />
	For a list of pronouns which can function to hold texts together (i.e., all 
	of them), see the link to a PDF file at the end.<br />
	The pronoun refers either back or forward to the noun in 
	sentences such as<em><span class="style_black"><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	John</span> didn't tell me where </em>
	<span class="style_red"><em>he</em></span><em> is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
	<span class="style_red">she</span> came in, I saw that 
	<span class="style_black">Mary</span> was very upset<br />
	</em>Sometimes referencing is to a whole statement in examples such 
			as<em><span class="style_red"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			As I mentioned earlier</span> ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_red">That </span>is why ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_red">This</span> is what I said: ...<br />
	</em>etc.<em><br />
	</em>The use of referencing is the most common way to make texts 
			hang together and it is widely used in both spoken and written 
			language.<br />Here are some more examples:<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			A: Where's <span class="style_black">the car</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			B: I lent <span class="style_red">it</span> to Mary?<br />
	<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bus broke down</span> and
			<span class="style_red">that'</span>s why I'm late<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I finally got round to reading 
	<span class="style_red">them</span>, 
			I thought <span class="style_black">the books</span> were really 
			good</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Ellipsis</strong>:</dt>
			<dd>This means leaving out (<strong>ellipting</strong> is the 
			technical term) a word because the reader / 
			listener knows what the reference is.&nbsp; In the <span lang="x-none">
			</span>example above, 
			we don't repeat <em>John</em> for the second verb.&nbsp; In spoken 
			English, we very often get exchanges like<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			A: What'<span class="style_black">s for lunch</span>?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			B: Cauliflower cheese </em>(leaving out the clause, <em>is for lunch</em>)<br />
			Here are two more examples:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Who <span class="style_black">arrived</span>?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			B: John</em> (ellipting the verb, <em>arrived</em>)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't like the red <span class="style_black">shoes</span> but 
			I love the <span class="style_red">blue</span></em> (ellipting the 
			noun, <em>shoes</em>)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He speaks good French and German</em> 
			(ellipting the verb <em>speaks</em> and the adjective <em>good</em> 
			because we assume they both apply to French and German)<br />
			For more, go to
			the guide to substitution and ellipsis linked in the list of related guides at the end.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Substitution</strong>:</dt>
			<dd>In this, we don't leave out the word but change it for something 
			more general.&nbsp; For example, above, the use of 
			<span class="style_red"> <em>one</em></span> to 
			mean<span class="style_black"> <em>a rose</em></span> or in something like<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What <span class="style_black">wines</span> do you want?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I'll take the French </em><span class="style_red"><em>stuff</em></span><br />
			We can also substitute other types of words, like this:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary doesn't <span class="style_black">want 
			to go</span> but I <span class="style_red">do</span></em><br />
			in which <em>do</em> stands for <em>want to go</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thought <span class="style_black">it was 
			boring</span> but I didn't think <span class="style_red">so</span></em><br />
			where <em>so</em> stands for <em>it was boring</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The food <span class="style_black">was 
			wonderful </span>and the wine, <span class="style_red">too</span></em><br />
			where <em>too</em> stands for <em>was wonderful</em><br />
			</dd>
			<dt><strong>Conjunction</strong>:</dt>
			<dd>We use conjunction to join ideas 
			(see the section on
			conjunctions in the guide to word class, linked in the list at the 
			end) in both spoken and written English.&nbsp; For 
			example, <span class="style_red"><em>and</em></span><em> went into the garden</em>, above, or in exchanges like<br />
			<em>
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why</span> did you open the cage?<span class="style_red"><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Because</span> 
			I wanted to change the water<br />
			</em>A special kind of conjunction, called a conjunct, is also 
			something very commonly used in writing to link ideas together.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She came late to the meeting.&nbsp;
			<span class="style_red">Consequently</span>, she missed the 
			important introduction.</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Lexical cohesion</strong>:</dt>
			<dd>This refers to the fact that in any text (written or spoken) 
			there are likely to appear chains of related words.&nbsp; For example, 
			in a text about hospitals it is likely that nouns such as <em>
			medicine, patient, nurse, ward, treatment</em> and <em>doctor</em> 
			will appear along with verbs such as<em> treat, admit, operate, 
			sterilise</em> and <em>care for</em>.<br />
			We also sometimes use a word which means the same or a word which 
			includes another one.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I <span class="style_black">cleaned</span> the house,
			<span class="style_black">washed</span> the car and did some other
			<span class="style_red">chores</span></em><br />
			where the word <em>chores</em> stands as a general term for <em>
			cleaning, washing</em> and so on.&nbsp; The hearer or reader is left 
			to imagine that it might also include things like <em>washing up, 
			sweeping, shopping</em> and so on but knows that it will not include 
			things like <em>going to work</em> or <em>planning a holiday </em>
			because the meaning of the word <em>chores</em> does not usually 
			include such matters.<br />
			Another example is:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave him his <span class="style_black">
			allowance</span> but he spent the <span class="style_red">money</span></em><br />
			in which <em>money</em> is a general term which includes <em>
			allowance</em> (and <em>cash, coins, notes</em> and so on).<br />
			Sometimes, we can use a synonym (a word which means more or less the same thing) 
			to get the same linking, cohesive effect as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;He tried to find the right <span class="style_black">
			volume</span> but the <span class="style_red">book</span> wasn't 
			there</em><br />
			in which <em>volume</em> and <em>book</em> are synonyms.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Grammatical cohesion</strong>:</dt>
			<dd>This refers to the fact that we employ similar grammar in texts 
			to keep the theme, especially the tense, consistent.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He </em><span class="style_red"><em>went</em></span><em> into 
			the bar, </em><span class="style_red"><em>walked</em></span><em> up 
			to the counter and </em><span class="style_red"><em>ordered</em></span><em> 
			three beers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <span class="style_red">will go</span> to London and
			<span class="style_red">will see</span> if I can meet him<br />
			</em>Another very common form of grammatical referencing involves 
			using words like <em>who, which, where, when</em> etc. to refer to 
			something already mentioned.&nbsp; Here are some examples:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's <span class="style_black">the boy</span>
			<span class="style_red">who</span> stole my bicycle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is <span class="style_black">the restaurant</span>
			<span class="style_red">where</span> we met<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's <span class="style_black">the car</span>
			<span class="style_red">which</span> hit the lamppost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was <span class="style_black">early in the morning</span>
			<span class="style_red">when</span> I went out<br />
			</em>These are relative pronouns (the first and third examples) or 
			relative adverbs (the second and fourth examples).</dd>
</dl>
		<p>Here's an example of grammatical 
			and lexical cohesion working together:</p>
		<p class="auto-style48" style="width: 600px"><em>While we <span class="auto-style7">were</span> on
			<span class="auto-style8">holiday</span> in a
			<span class="auto-style8">Spanish resort</span> we
			<span class="auto-style7">used to go</span> to the
			<span class="auto-style8">beach</span> every morning and then
			<span class="auto-style7">we'd have</span> <span class="style_red">
			lunch</span> in a little <span class="style_red">restaurant</span> 
			in town where the <span class="auto-style8">tourists</span>
			<span class="auto-style7">didn't go</span> very much.&nbsp; The
			<span class="style_red">food</span> <span class="auto-style7">was</span> 
			fantastic and very cheap and the <span class="style_red">fish 
			dishes</span> in particular <span class="auto-style7">were</span> 
			wonderful.</em></p>
		<p>The tenses are consistently in the past (<span class="auto-style7">underlined</span>), the nouns related to food and restaurants are also present (in
			<span class="style_red">red</span>) and there's a second lexical 
			string concerning holidays (in <span class="auto-style8">green</span>).&nbsp; 
			The text also contains examples of other forms of cohesion.&nbsp; 
			Spot them.</p>
