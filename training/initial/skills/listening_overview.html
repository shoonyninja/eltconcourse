	<h1>Understanding listening</h1>
		<p>
		<img height="207" src="../../images/listen_children310.jpg" width="310" alt="listen" /></p>
		<p>There is a saying that for many people the opposite of speaking isn't 
		listening, it's waiting.&nbsp; However, for the purposes of this guide 
		we shall be considering listening as one of the four essential language 
		skills our students need to acquire.</p>
		<p>You acquired your first language(s) by listening.&nbsp; The ability 
		to hear and understand is fundamental to the ability to communicate and 
		learn in a foreign language, too.</p>
		<p>Some of what follows will be easier to understand if you have 
		followed the guide to reading.</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

		</table>
		<p>Traditionally, listening has been used in the language classroom as a 
		vehicle for other kinds of learning and teaching.&nbsp; A listening text 
		can be used this way to introduce new items of vocabulary or to focus on 
		a particular structure.&nbsp; If it is used this way a lesson involving 
		a listening text would normally follow a predictable pattern.&nbsp; 
		(Note, by the way, the use of the term 'text' here.&nbsp; Texts are not 
		only written.)<br />
		Like 
		this:<br />
		<img alt="listening1" height="130" src="../../imagesgraphics/listening1.png" width="620" /><br />
		<span class="auto-style15">(Adapted from Field 1998:110)</span></p>
		<p>Starting from the left:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The teacher checks the text carefully to identify words the 
			learners would be unlikely to know and without which they will not 
			understand the text sufficiently.&nbsp; In the trade, these are 
			known as potential blocking items.<br />
			These words are then 
			introduced and practised before the listening part of the lesson 
			begins.&nbsp; At this point, too, the scene is usually set: e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are going to listen to a telephone conversation between a 
			man and a woman.</em></li>
			<li>After or, better, before first listening to the whole piece, learners are 
			set 
			'gist' questions to see if they have a global understanding of the 
			text:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's it about? How many people are speaking?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are 
			they?<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>Then comes the listening proper and at this stage the text is 
			usually interrupted to allow the learners time to note answers to a 
			set of questions designed to test their detailed understanding such 
			as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who does the caller want to talk to?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that person at home?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does the man offer to do?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does the woman respond?<br />
			</em>etc.&nbsp; 
			These sorts of questions might also focus on the attitudes of the 
			speakers, e.g.,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the man happy or disappointed?</em></li>
			<li>When that phase is satisfactorily completed, attention turns to 
			the language content of the text to focus on things like new 
			lexis, intonation patterns, politeness strategies, question 
			intonation and so on.&nbsp; Any language item at all can be 
			introduced this way.</li>
			<li>Finally, the listening text is revisited to ensure full understanding and 
			recall.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It is not being argued here that using a listening text in this way 
		is somehow 'wrong' or misguided.&nbsp; However, it has long been 
		realised that such procedures do not <span class="style_underline">teach</span> people how to 
		become better 
		listeners in a foreign language, they test how good they 
		already are.</p>

		<p>Now think about <em>how</em>  we listen to these things.&nbsp; Do we, for 
		example</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Try to hear and understand every word?</li>
				<li>Concentrate 
		hard or does our mind wander a little?</li>
				<li>Have the opportunity to interrupt 
		the speaker for clarification or repetition?</li>
				<li>Switch off at 
		times and monitor what we are hearing for something that interests us?</li>
			</ul>

			<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'reading1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">click for some comments</a>.</p>
		
		<div id="reading1" style="visibility: hidden">
		<ol class="auto-style14">
			<li>When we are dealing with some listening texts, for example, a 
			travel announcement, a set of instructions or a waiter explaining 
			what's in a dish, it's important that we understand 
			nearly everything.&nbsp; If we miss something important we may get the 
			wrong meal or the wrong platform.</li>
			<li>Some settings allow us to interrupt and ask for clarification or 
			repetition, e.g., the work instructions or the waiter's explanation.&nbsp; 
			Some don't so we have to be even more careful.</li>
			<li>With other texts, we can be a bit more careless.&nbsp; 
			Typically, in a news programme, people will listen quite casually 
			until a key word or two alerts them to an item of interest.&nbsp; 
			Then they switch listening mode and apply more attention.&nbsp; Travel 
			announcements are often dealt with this way.&nbsp; If we recognise 
			that the announcement does not concern our journey, we just switch 
			off until the next one comes along.</li>
			<li>Other texts require different approaches.&nbsp; 
			A TV soap opera or an anecdote might require our full attention but 
			as long as we get the gist of what's going on, it isn't usually 
			necessary (or possible) to catch every word and every nuance.&nbsp; 
			Typically, an anecdote is told face-to-face or over the phone so in 
			this case we also need occasionally to show interest and 
			comprehension.&nbsp; We do that through what's called back 
			channelling (grunts, exclamations, nods etc.)&nbsp; There's more on 
			that in the guide to speaking, linked below.</li>
			<li>Finally, some texts require our full attention, even to the 
			point of making notes to help us recall important information.&nbsp; 
			Here, we need particularly to pay attention to the speaker's 
			signals.&nbsp; For example, something beginning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Here's the key 
			point: ...<br />
			</em>is likely to be important but something beginning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>By the way, ...<br />
			</em>can probably be safely ignored.</li>
			<li>Finally, some texts we don't even bother to listen to.&nbsp; We 
			may already know the lyrics of a song and we mostly know what an 
			answering service message is going to say so we switch off and wait 
			to hear the beep.&nbsp; Here, the opposite of speaking really is 
			waiting.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It's clear, then, that we deploy different skills depending on:</p>

	<dt><em><strong>Listening for information</strong></em></dt>
	<dd>This comes in three modes:<br />
	First, we can be listening to try to understand as much of the text as we 
	can.&nbsp; This will apply to a lecture or the waiter's explanation, for 
	example.<br />
	Second, we may be listening for key words to trigger more intensive 
	concentration.&nbsp; This occurs when we listen to a string of announcements 
	waiting for our flight or destination to be mentioned.<br />
	Third, we may be listening in a monitoring mode, getting the gist of 
	what we hear only, e.g., this news item is about sport, this one's about an 
	accident etc.&nbsp; We may do this until we hear something that catches our 
	attention and then we switch to a more intensive mode.</dd>
			<dt><strong><em>Listening for discourse clues</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>This kind of listening involves paying conscious attention to 
			what is being signalled by the speaker.&nbsp; There are examples 
			above about how this might happen in a lecture but it will also 
			happen in other kinds of texts.&nbsp; Anecdotes, for example, are 
			littered with time expressions to guide the hearer through the 
			sequence of events and may be punctuated by appeals for response of 
			confirmation such as <em>Don't you see? </em>or <em>You'll never 
			guess who it was ... .</em>&nbsp; Listening out for such things 
			makes the task of listening and understanding easier.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Intensive listening</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>In this mode we need to deploy our knowledge of the meaning and 
			pronunciation of the lexis as well as the way in which structures 
			such as tenses and their aspects inform us of the relationship between events and 
			things.</dd>
</dl><p>It isn't easy and it's made more complex by the need to switch between 
		listening modes when, for example, a key word triggers the anticipation 
		that something important or interesting will follow.</p>

			the possibilities, too, and make guessing meaning easier.</li>
			<li>In this case, the learner is deploying knowledge of how 
			announcements are organised (top-down) and then using a 
			bottom-up strategy to identify the word 'Malaga' and the flight 
			number / time / gate number etc. that he/she knows will follow it.</li>
			<li>The listener is using a top-down strategy reliant on knowing the 
			structure of anecdotes (they follow a familiar pattern) and is 
			waiting for what's known as the coda (the final bit where tellers of 
			stories usually state their own feelings).&nbsp; That's the bit we 
			need to respond to; the rest can pass us by.</li>
			<li>This is mostly a bottom-up process.&nbsp; The listener is 
			working hard to understand every word if possible but will also be 
			using other skills to listen for names and departments, times and 
			deadlines etc.&nbsp; The use of strategies such as asking for 
			repetition / clarification is also a skill worth having, of course, 
			especially in situations like this.</li>
			<li>The listener is hardly listening to most of the song and may 
			just be monitoring for adjectives to describe feelings.&nbsp; That's 
			a bottom-up strategy concerned with recognising word class.&nbsp; 
			There's more on how we do this in 
			<a href="reading_overview.html" target="_blank">the guide 
			to reading skills</a>.</li>
			<li>This is bottom-up monitoring for particular words or 
			expressions.&nbsp; Top-down knowledge is telling the listener to 
			look out for images (flags, building etc.) to help the process.</li>
			<li>The listener has used what's known as generic knowledge (part of 
			top-down processing) to be aware that sports reports come at the end 
			of news reports, usually.&nbsp; If it's a TV programme, the listener 
			may also be looking out for sporting images.</li>
			<li>Listening to a lecture and monitoring for particular signals is 
			a bottom-up process and the sorts of things to listen for can be 
			taught.</li>
			<li>The listener is using top-down processing to deploy his/her 
			knowledge of the world of health services so is already alert to 
			what sorts of lexis to expect (<em>doctor, patient, ward, ambulance, 
			treat, care for</em> etc.) which will ease the strain of bottom-up 
			processing of the text.</li>

			<p>From here on the discussion of listening skills becomes slightly 
			more technical.&nbsp; If you are reading this guide because you are 
			taking or have just taken an initial training programme, you 
			probably do not need much more than we have already covered.&nbsp; 
			However, if you are going on to further training or are simply 
			interested in learning more, read on.</p>
			<p>Before going on to thinking about how to teach listening skills, 
			it is worth pausing to consider what knowledge learners need to 
			bring to the process of understanding what they hear.&nbsp; In other 
			words, we need to look for some kind of syllabus for listening 
			skills which goes a little beyond simple descriptions of top-down 
			and bottom-up processing, important though they probably are.<br />
			Listening is not a passive process.<br />
			Here's a diagram with some notes.&nbsp; The diagram is divided by 
			colour into three parts.</p>
			<p>Think a little about the meanings and implications for teaching 
			in each of the areas on the diagram and then read on for some notes.</p>
			<p>

			<ol>
				<li>Schematic knowledge is sometimes referred to as part of 
				top-down knowledge although that is an inaccurate or at best a 
				partial way to understand the area.<ol class="auto-style13">
					<li>Knowledge of generic structure involves a number of 
					issues which are covered in more detail in the guides to 
					genre (linked below).&nbsp; Briefly, however, we need to 
					consider:<ol class="greenbullet">
						<li>Text staging:<br />
						Genres have culturally conventional 
						stages for information to occur.&nbsp; For example, a 
						narrative (such as an anecdote) will begin with 
						orientation which will provide information about the 
						who, the when and the where of the story.&nbsp; The second 
						stage will usually involve the identification of a 
						complication or problem, the third stage will relate how 
						the problem is solved or what resolution is found to the 
						complication and the final stage (the coda) will usually 
						concern the speaker's personal response to the story.<br />
						A procedural text, for example, will have a very 
						different structure because it is designed for a 
						different cultural purpose (to explain how something is 
						done) and this will usually start with the goal of the 
						process (why you are doing it) and then go on to tell 
						you about the materials and resources you will need 
						before setting out, step-by-step, how the process is 
						managed.<br />
						Knowing how these sorts of texts, whether written or 
						spoken, are structured in terms of where the information 
						comes is very helpful to listeners because they will 
						be alert to listen for each stage separately rather than 
						being faced with a mass of data.</li>
						<li>Elements of the language:<br />
						All genres will use 
						language elements of different sorts to help them 
						fulfil their purposes.<br />
						Taking our first example again, a narrative will contain 
						circumstances of time and location (<em>last year, in 
						the morning, the next day, at the hotel, in the water, 
						out to sea </em>etc.) and a good deal of subordination 
						when revealing the problems and issues (<em>although, 
						then, when, because, however</em> etc.).&nbsp; The 
						resolutions of the problems will usually contain linking 
						devices (called conjuncts) such as <em>in the end, the 
						upshot was, finally</em> etc.&nbsp; The text will 
						normally revolve around what are called behavioural or 
						material process verbs such as <em>do, go, become, 
						collapse, sink, swim</em> and so on.&nbsp; The personal 
						response will usually be couched in terms of emotional 
						reaction (<em>relieved, disappointed, delighted</em> 
						etc.) and will use first-person verb forms.<br />
						If the listener is primed to focus on circumstances and 
						verbs of this sort, comprehending a text becomes a good 
						deal easier.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Knowledge of the world goes beyond the text.&nbsp; We 
					rarely come to a text knowing nothing of its content or 
					topic in advance.&nbsp; If we know, for example, that 
					someone wants to explain how to do something, we will 
					already have activated what we know of the topic before we 
					hear a word spoken.&nbsp; Equally, if what someone says in 
					response to a question such as:<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have a large family?</em><br />
					we will be alert to the sorts of information we are likely 
					to hear (relationships, types of people, personalities and 
					so on).<br />
					Visual clues are important, too, especially if we are trying 
					to understand a television programme or a presentation of 
					some sort.<br />
					If the learners' knowledge of the world concerning the topic 
					of the text is activated early on in the process, it becomes 
					a good deal easier for people to understand what they hear.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Knowledge of the setting also comes in two distinct parts, 
				one requiring top-down processing and one requiring more formal 
				bottom-up knowledge.<ol class="auto-style13">
					<li>The social context is critical, of course because our 
					knowledge of it allows us to predict the purposes for which 
					someone is speaking.&nbsp; The assumption we all start from 
					is that people speak to communicate something and knowing 
					the speakers' intentions in a situation helps very 
					considerably with understanding what they say.&nbsp; 
					Encounters with strangers, for example, will usually be 
					concerned with some kind of transactional functions such as 
					getting information or directions, obtaining goods and 
					services and so on.&nbsp; We need not trouble ourselves with 
					language used for maintaining social relationships because 
					we only need to figure out what it is that the speaker 
					wants.&nbsp; The social setting will very often give us that 
					information before a word is spoken.</li>
					<li>In addition to contextual clues, more sophisticated 
					listeners also rely on co-text data.&nbsp; For example, 
					knowing that <em>Can you tell me</em> will preface a request 
					for information, and <em>I wonder if you could</em> will 
					preface a request for action is very helpful when faced with 
					an unexpected encounter with a stranger.<br />
					Knowing, too, about discourse features and being alerted to 
					their importance is also helpful.&nbsp; Here, the functions 
					of conjunctions, pronoun referencing and so on will play a 
					part.&nbsp; For example, when listening to an anecdote (see 
					above) it is helpful to be aware of the need to keep track 
					of people by focusing on pronoun references and to follow 
					cause and effect connections through being alert to the use 
					of <em>and then, because, so, this led to</em> etc.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Finally, we come to the purely bottom-up processing skills 
				on the right of the diagram and these all focus on understanding 
				the formal nature of the language.<ol class="auto-style13">
					<li>Structural knowledge is important because, for example, 
					it allows us to set events in time by focusing on tense and 
					aspect, to see how people's responses vary through the 
					modality they use and to understand that a word followed by
					<em>which was</em> is likely to be a noun or a whole 
					statement but one followed by <em>who was</em> is almost 
					certainly a person or function.<br />
					This structural knowledge is often underestimated by those 
					who feel that top-down processing is the new normal.</li>
					<li>Phonological features do not just concern the 
					pronunciation (and hence recognition) of words.&nbsp; 
					Learners need to be trained to appreciate how connected 
					speech patterns alter the sounds they might expect to hear 
					(see the link below for more).<br />
					It also concerns recognising the speaker's emotional state 
					of communicative intention by recognising how intonation may 
					signal these things in English.</li>
					<li>Lexis or semantic knowledge is, naturally, vital for 
					listening comprehension.&nbsp; Some unknown words my be 
					safely ignored (especially if, for example, a word is 
					identifiable by its co-text as an adjective or adverb) but 
					too many unknown items will effectively block comprehension.&nbsp; 
					Hence the need to train listeners in the art of ignoring 
					some words and inferring the meanings of others from 
					co-text.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>That's quite a lot, isn't it, so listening skills cannot be 
			approached in a haphazard manner.&nbsp; All these areas of knowledge 
			need to be in place and they all need to work together to make 
			listening comprehension function at all.</p>
