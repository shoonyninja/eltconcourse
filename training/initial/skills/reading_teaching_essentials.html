		<img height="207" src="../../images/glasses_book310.jpg" width="310" alt="glasses" /></p>
		<p>
		Almost all lessons require the learners to read at 
		some point.&nbsp; Often, this reading is used to introduce some lexis, 
		to kick-start a discussion or focus on a grammar point.&nbsp; However, 
		reading skills in themselves should also be a central focus for a lesson 
		or series of lessons.<br />
		Much of what follows assumes you have followed 
		<a href="reading_overview.html">
		the guide to what reading actually is</a>.</p>

				<h2>Using reading texts: TALO vs. TAVI</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
		TALO and TAVI are terms coined by Johns and Davies (1983) and mean:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>TALO: Text as a Linguistic Object</strong></dt>
			<dd>In this approach a reading text is used purely for language 
			input.&nbsp; It may contain, for example, grammatical items which 
			form the target of this part of the teaching programme or lexis in a 
			particular field of interest to the learners.<br />
			The approach involves mining the text for these language items (with 
			most of the hard digging done by the teacher, usually) and 
			then focusing on them for further clarification and practice.&nbsp; 
			Examples of tasks using texts for this purpose will include 
			activities such as:<br />
			<span class="style_black"><em>Find and underline all the words in 
			the text to do with crime and divide them into three lists: person 
			who does the crime, the crime and the verb<br />
			Find all the ways in the text where the writer is recommending what 
			should happen next.&nbsp; Make a list from strongest to weakest 
			suggestions.</em></span><br />
			This is <strong>not</strong> using the text to develop reading skills, of course, 
			except incidentally.</dd>
			<dt><strong>TAVI: Text as a Vehicle for Information</strong></dt>
			<dd>In this approach, the text <strong>is</strong> being used to develop the 
			strategies that learners need to deploy to unlock the writer's 
			meanings and attitudes.&nbsp; The theory is that this approach will 
			lead to the development of cognitive strategies which learners can 
			then use independently to access the meaning of any text they 
			encounter.<br />
			It is a TAVI approach that is considered here because we are 
			concerned with language skills rather than language systems 
			development.</dd>

				<li class="style_brown">and with adequate understanding</li>
			</ul>
		<p>That's the eventual aim.&nbsp; Here are some ideas for getting there.</p>
		</div><p>All of the following can be done with paper-based materials 
		and internet sites.&nbsp; In fact, scanning is a key skill when 
		accessing internet sites because it is here that people are most often 
		looking for explicit information.<br />
		Wikipedia articles are very useful for these exercises if chosen with 
		care and sensitivity to the interests and levels of your learners.</p>

				<h2>Skimming</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The aim of these skimming exercises is to train students to follow 
		simple skimming steps.&nbsp; These are:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>Read the title.&nbsp; It's often a short summary of what's in 
			the text.</li>
			<li>Read the first paragraph.&nbsp; It often sets out what questions 
			are to be answered in the text.</li>
			<li>Read the first line of each following paragraph only.</li>
			<li>Read the last paragraph completely.&nbsp; It often summarises 
			the whole text.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can't just tell people to do this; we have to train students 
		and give them the skills they need to succeed.<br />
		All these exercises and tasks should be done with a clear time limit set 
		for their completion.&nbsp; If you don't do this, learners will often 
		fall back on trying to read and understand every word.&nbsp; The intent 
		is to force them to skim the text for essential information.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Matching exercises:</strong><br />
			On the board / projector put 4 headlines or titles, three of which 
			would be suitable for a set of three texts.<br />
			Set a short time limit to match the headlines / titles to the texts.<br />
			Hand out texts to everyone in the class.</li>
			<li><strong>Multiple choice exercises:</strong><br />
			Use a longer reading text of at least 5 paragraphs.<br />
			Prepare 4 alternative summary sentences for each paragraph 
			containing the paragraph's main idea.<br />
			Set a time limit to match the correct summary sentences to the 
			paragraphs.</li>
			<li><strong>Topic sentences:</strong><br />
			Prepare a text by removing the first sentence of each paragraph
			<strong>except</strong> the first and last paragraph.<br />
			Hand out the text and the topic sentences separately and get students 
			to match topic sentence to paragraph.</li>
			<li><strong>Raising awareness of text structure</strong> and where 
			to look for information:<br />
			Find a text (or write one) which has a clear structure with 
			signposts such as <em>Firstly, Secondly, In summary </em>etc. and 
			also has a clear first line which addresses the content of the text.<br />
			Chop the text up into paragraphs and get the students to work 
			together (with the usual time limit) to put the paragraphs in the 
			right order.</li>

				<h2>Scanning</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The aim of these exercises is to give the learners the skills they 
		need to follow these scanning steps:</p>
		<ul class="greybullet">
			<li>Having a question or questions to answer firmly in mind before 
			starting to read.</li>
			<li>Think about what the information is that you need.&nbsp; Is it a 
			name, a number, a place? etc.</li>
			<li>Skim the text to get an idea of its structure.&nbsp; If there 
			are subheadings in the text, read them carefully.</li>
			<li>Run your eyes along the text looking ONLY for the kind of data 
			you need.</li>
			<li>When you find a candidate sentence, read it intensively to 
			extract the information.</li>
		</ul>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Descriptive texts:</strong><br />
			Find a text which describes a person or a location and contains data 
			such as names, numbers, places and dates.<br />
			Hand out the text face down to the students.<br />
			On the board / projector put up questions <strong>one at a time</strong> 
			such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where was he born?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When did he die?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was his wife's 
			name?<br />
			</em>etc. and get the learners in a race to turn over the text 
			after each question to find the answers.&nbsp; You can also read 
			out the questions, of course, but it's useful to have them written 
			down because it focuses the learners.</li>
			<li><strong>Narrative texts:</strong><br />
			Short stories or diary entries are useful for this exercise.<br />
			Proceed as above but this time the questions refer to the sequence 
			of events in the story such as<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened after he left the 
			army?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did she go when she left her husband?<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li><strong>Information texts:</strong><br />
			Hand out something like a TV guide magazine, a local information 
			newspaper, a holiday brochure etc.<br />
			Set questions as above but this time focusing on the sorts of 
			information your students might realistically need: times of TV 
			shows, prices, venues etc., such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What time is the news on?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which film is showing at the Multiplex?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How far is the hotel from the airport?</em><br />

		<p>Intensive reading is done for full understanding of (usually) a short 
		text.&nbsp; It is what we do when, e.g., we have scanned a text and 
		found the section with the information we need so the following can be 
		combined with scanning (above).<br />
		The skills involved in being able to infer the meaning of unknown words 
		are crucial in this area so if you haven't already been there, look at 
		the ideas in 
		<a href="../teaching/vocabulary_teaching.html" target="_blank">the guide to teaching vocabulary</a> 
		(new tab).</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Synonym matching:</strong><br />
			Select some key vocabulary from a reading text and invent synonyms.&nbsp; 
			Be careful to keep the word class consistent and make the synonyms 
			easier than the items in the text.&nbsp; For example, if the words 
			in the text are <em>incandescent with rage</em> make sure that your 
			synonym is a) an adjective and b) easier to understand.&nbsp; 
			Choose, therefore, something like <em>extremely angry </em>rather 
			than<em> burning with ire</em>.<br />
			Learners need to scan the text to find items which match the word 
			class they are looking for and then read intensively to locate the 
			precise meaning they are looking for.<br />
			For a little more on the perils of synonym tasks, see
			<a href="../../inservice/lexicogrammar/synonymy.html" target="_blank">the guide to 
			synonymy</a> (new tab).</li>
			<li><strong>Multiple-choice exercises:</strong><br />
			These are frequently used in examination of reading skills.<br />
			Select questions which force the learners to focus on key parts of 
			the text to read intensively.&nbsp; Don't try to test everything.<br />
			Make sure only one answer is correct but ensure that the 'wrong' 
			answers are not daft.&nbsp; If the learners can dismiss any of the 
			alternatives because they make no logical sense, you aren't 
			developing intensive reading skills.</li>
			<li><strong>Spot the error:</strong><br />
			Focus on particular word classes for this task.<br />
			Remove, say, 10 adjectives from a text and replace them with 
			adjectives that make no sense.&nbsp; So, e.g., if the original text 
			had<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was absolutely delighted with the beautifully cooked meal<br />
			</em>replace it with something like<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was absolutely horrified by 
			the beautifully cooked meal.<br />
			</em>The task, obviously, is for students to read the text 
			intensively and spot the <em>non-sequitur</em> expressions, 
			replacing them with something more logical.&nbsp; At the end, they 
			can compare their suggestions with the original text.<br />
			This kind of task can also be used to focus on grammatical 
			non-sequitur items by replacing, e.g.<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when he was on 
			holiday last year he would check his work email every morning<br />
			</em>with<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was on holiday last your he may check his work 
			email every morning.</em></li>

		<p>Reading extensively for pleasure is a great learning aid so the more we can encourage it, 
		the better.<br />
		The issue here is often one of level.&nbsp; Many learners (and their 
		teachers, regrettably) assume that lower level learners are unable to 
		read extensively in English but there are actually a number of resources 
		that they can access, not least the large number of commercially 
		published graded readers.&nbsp; Here's a list of some frequently used 
		resources:</p>

		<p>Many learners may be reluctant to read extensively so a little 
		encouragement is needed.&nbsp; Reasons for reluctance might include:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Past experience of encountering demotivatingly difficult texts<ol>
				<li class="greenbullet">so make sure you select texts at the 
				right level</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Difficulties accessing Latin-script texts<ol>
				<li class="greenbullet">so ensure that the texts you present do 
				not use quirky or unusual fonts and are in large enough type</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Lack of experience in the first language of reading more than 
			the label on a tin or a text message<ol>
				<li class="greenbullet">so select texts (or get the learners to 
				select texts) which appeal to their particular interests</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>No discernible purpose or outcome<ol>
				<li class="greenbullet">so make sure that you start something 
				like a reading circle so the learners do something (discuss, 
				summarise, recommend, review etc.) with the texts they have read</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Not knowing where to start and what to read<ol>
				<li class="greenbullet">so set up a small class library with a
