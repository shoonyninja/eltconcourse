	<h1>Teaching writing: the essentials</h1>

		<img height="207" src="../../images/write_hand310.jpg" width="310" alt="write" /></p>
		<p>The following is premised on the understanding that you have already 
		followed <a href="writing_overview.html">the first part of the guide to writing 
		skills</a>.&nbsp; It'll be harder and make less sense if you haven't.</p>

				<h3>Approach 1: product</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>This is a traditional text-based approach which relies on the 
		presentation of a model and its imitation or adaptation.&nbsp; As the 
		name suggests, it is focused on the outcomes of writing, not how the 
		outcomes are achieved.<br />
		The approach seeks to synthesise the components of the writing skill by 
		focusing on each in isolation first.&nbsp; So we move, e.g., from the 
		mechanics of the alphabet and punctuation systems, through a focus on 
		syntax and lexis including considerations of cohesion and style until we 
		have trained our learners to combine their knowledge of each to be able 
		to produce a coherent, effective and accurate text.&nbsp; It can be 
		visualised as an incremental system:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="product approach" height="319" src="../../imagesgraphics/product_approach.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Typically, a writing lesson following this approach will start with 
		the analysis of a model (not always a complete text), looking at how an 
		expert writer handles, e.g., lexical chains to create cohesion in a text 
		and then move to the creation of a parallel text by the learners in 
		which they attempt to apply the same skill to produce their own finished 
		text.&nbsp; Typically, a series of lessons will be undertaken focusing 
		on the elements of the system above in the same kind of way.</p>
		<p>Naturally, the approach has been criticised for being atomistic and 
		focusing too narrowly on systems at the expense of the focus on skills 
		and subskills.&nbsp; It remains, however, a common approach in many 
		coursebooks and classrooms because it allows for the content to be 
		focused on separately from the form and structure.&nbsp; In other words, 
		it breaks down a complex skill into teachable and learnable sections, 
		recognising that learners need to deploy a range of language knowledge 
		to achieve the final text.</p>
		<hr /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				
				<img alt="2" height="69" src="../../../gfx/2blue.png" width="100" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style19">
				<h3>Approach 2: process</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Again, as the name suggests, this approach focuses the subskills of 
		writing such as planning, drafting and polishing and is cyclical in 
		nature.<br />
		Based on research into how good writers construct texts, it breaks down 
		the writing process into a series of repeatable stages.&nbsp; First, for 
		example, expert writers generate ideas in a random way and then evaluate 
		each on the basis of relevance and importance.&nbsp; Then, the writer 
		will plan, draft and re-evaluate before producing a final text.&nbsp; 
		Often the process, or parts of it, is repeated until the writer is 
		finally satisfied with the product.&nbsp; It can be visualised as a 
		process rather than an incremental system:</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="process" height="383" src="../../imagesgraphics/process.png" width="465" />&nbsp;</p>
		<p>As the diagram is intended to show, the draft-evaluate-re-write part 
		of the cycle may be frequently repeated.&nbsp; Later re-writing is 
		reduced to polishing.</p>
		<p>Typically, a single lesson in this approach will not include all the 
		phases.&nbsp; Learners may work on a text over a series of lessons 
		starting with the idea-generation phase and culminating in the finished 
		article at a (much) later date.</p>
		<hr /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

				<img alt="3" height="65" src="../../../gfx/3blue.png" width="100" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style19">
				<h3>Approach 3: genre</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>This approach draws on the work of genre analysis and, like the 
		product approach, frequently uses model texts as the subject of 
		analysis, imitation and modification.&nbsp; There, however, the 
		similarity ends.<br />
		This approach focuses on three fundamental aspects of all texts:<br />
		<img alt="FTM" height="231" src="../../imagesgraphics/ftm.png" width="449" /><br />
		A genre approach will typically start by getting the learners to 
		analyse a text in these terms before going on to see how the types of 
		language used contribute to the nature of the text (or are, rather, a 
		product of it).<br />
		There is more on this in 
		the guide to genre on this site.&nbsp; Here, it will be enough to 
		present one example.<br />
		In a text intended to tell an anecdote in writing to a friend (a 
		Recount), we will 
		find that the text is organised in four steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Orientation</strong>: in which the writer sets up the 
			topic (establishes the Field)<br />
			<span class="auto-style8"><em>There's a 
			guy, John, I know at work who always tries a bit too hard.</em></span></li>
			<li><strong>Record of events</strong>: in which the writer says what 
			happened<span class="auto-style8"><br />
			<em>Yesterday he got too pushy and 
			managed to upset a really important client.&nbsp; We nearly lost the 
			contract but the boss stepped in just in time and calmed everyone 
			down.</em></span></li>
			<li><strong>Reorientation</strong>: rounding up<span class="auto-style8"><br />
			<em>The client eventually saw that nothing 
			bad was meant and said he was happy to go on using us.</em></span></li>
			<li><strong>Coda</strong>: personal evaluation<span class="auto-style8"><br />
			<em>I hope John's learned his lesson and will 
			be a bit more diplomatic in future or we'll all be out of a job!</em></span></li>
		</ol>
		<p>This is how this might happen in the classroom (over a series of 
		lessons, of course).</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The learners and teacher together read and analyse 
			a model text like the one above and:<ol class="auto-style20">
				<li>identify the staging as well as 
			the structure and the language used</li>
				<li>look at the form of the language and see if the 
		text is particularly formal (note the use of, e.g., <em>out of a job
				</em>rather than<em> redundant </em>and the use of '!')</li>
				<li>look at the sort of verbs that are used.&nbsp; 
		In this case, most of the verbs are material and behavioural processes
				<em>(tries, got pushy, upset, lost, stepped in </em>etc.)</li>
				<li>analyse other elements of the language (e.g., 
		the use of circumstances such as <em>in future, eventually, yesterday, 
		just in time</em> etc.) and so on.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>The teacher and learners work together to produce a new text, 
			referring back to the model as they go along.</li>
			<li>The learners write their own text based on the model and the 
			jointly constructed text.</li>
			<li>The learner(s) and the teacher discuss the text's effectiveness 
			and redraft it.</li>
			<li>Finally, the learners re-draft and polish their texts.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>There's a bit more on this (applicable to both speaking and writing 
		and concerned particularly with recounts and narratives) in
		<a href="../../inservice/functions/relating_experience.html" target="_blank">
		the guide to the function of relating experiences</a>.</p>
		<p>Graphically, the teaching-learning cycle looks a bit like this 
		(adapted from Burns, 2001, after Hammond, 1990)<br />
		<img alt="genre approach teaching cycle" height="456" src="../../imagesgraphics/genre_approach.png" width="620" /><br />
		The strength of the approach, it is claimed, is that all texts 
		in the same genre follow the same staging and all will exhibit the same sorts of verbal 
		processes and circumstances etc.&nbsp; Once this is learned, then, the 
		student can go on to construct, for example, conventional recounts in a variety of 
		styles based on any set of material facts.<br />
		Other genres, such as discussions, narratives, expositions, instructions, 
		explanations, information reports etc., which will have their own 
		characteristics, can be tackled in the same way.&nbsp; Discussions, for 
		example, will need learners to focus carefully on modality (<em>it may 
		be the case</em> etc.) and on hedging (<em>it is arguable that, many 
		would conclude</em> etc.) as well as on the conventional staging of such 
		texts.<br />
		There is a guide to teaching for 
		and against discussion texts on this site, linked below.<br />
		For more on genre, see the link below.</p>

				<h3>Combining approaches</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>It can readily be seen that these approaches are not mutually 
		exclusive.&nbsp; Elements of the product approach, such as the focus on 
		structural aspects of language can form part of the process approach 
		when students evaluate what they have written as a first draft and such 
		a focus is legitimately part of a genre approach when the language is 
		being analysed.<br />
		A genre approach can also be usefully combined with a process approach 
		or a product approach.<br />
		There is also a lesson for B1/B2-level learners about how to write a 
		paragraph, linked below.</p>
