			<p>Tense refers to the way a verb may change to show its setting in 
			time.</p>
			<p>For example:<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She <span class="style_black"><strong>travels</strong></span> to London<br />
			</em>shows that we are talking about a repeated habit of hers.&nbsp; 
			The -<em>s</em> ending on the verb tells us that this is a present 
			simple tense.<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John <span class="style_black"><strong>escaped</strong></span><br />
			</em>shows that we are talking about the past and that is signalled 
			by the -<em>d</em> ending on the verb.&nbsp; It is a past simple 
			tense.<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train <span class="style_black"><strong>will arrive
			</strong></span>at 6.09<br />
			</em>refers to the future but the verb itself does not, in English, 
			change so some will say it is not a proper tense at all.&nbsp; What 
			English does is to insert the auxiliary verb, <em>will</em>, before the main 
			verb to signal the future.&nbsp; Many languages will change the verb 
			itself.</p>

			<p>Aspect, by contrast, does not show us the time of an event but 
			shows us how we see the event or how we see the event is related to other events.<br />
			There are two main types of aspect in English that you need to know 
			about now (although there are a number of others which you will need 
			to learn about later).</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>The Perfect Aspect</strong><em><br />
				</em>Relates two times to each other.<br />
				For example:<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has travelled to London<br />
				</em>shows that we are talking about a past which has immediate 
				reference for the present.&nbsp; The assumption is that she is 
				in London now or that her experience of travelling there is 
				relevant to now.&nbsp; It is called the present perfect because 
				we see the event has significant for the present.&nbsp; To do 
				that, in English, we insert the auxiliary verb, <em>has.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John 
				had escaped<br />
				</em>shows that we are talking about the past but that we are 
				relating it to something later in the past (such as <em>... but 
				was caught at the station</em>)<em> </em>and this is signalled 
				by the use of the auxiliary verb, <em>had</em>.&nbsp; It is 
				called a past perfect tense in English because it relates 
				together two events in the past.<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
				train will have arrived by 6.09<br />
				</em>refers to the future but the the insertion of the auxiliary 
				verb, <em>have</em>, shows that we are relating the arrival of 
				the train with another future event that comes before it.</li>
				<li>The Progressive Aspect<br />
				Indicates how the speaker / writer sees the event in terms of 
				duration.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is learning French</em><br />
				does not necessarily mean that she is in a classroom or studying 
				a dictionary now.&nbsp; It shows that the learning is 
				progressive in the background of all else that is happening.<br />
				However,<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was reading when I came in</em><br />
				shows that the action of reading started before I came in and 
				(possibly) continued afterwards.&nbsp; (I may have interrupted 
				her or she may have continued reading and ignored me.)<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will be having dinner in Margate</em><br />
				refers to the fact that I imagine they will take some time to 
				eat (so it's a progressive event) and that it is possible that 
				they will be interrupted during the event.</li>

			<p>What follows applies to English.&nbsp; Because tense forms and 
			their meanings vary very considerably across languages, it is not 
			always possible to translate the names of tenses accurately.&nbsp; 
			The examples of the tense form are in <span class="style_black">
			<strong>black bold type</strong></span>.</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li>Simple tenses<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li>Present simple, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I </em>
					<span class="style_black"><strong><em>like</em></strong></span><em> chocolate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
					</em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>feel</em></strong></span><em> 
				ill</em><br />These forms look the same and have the same name but the 
				reference is either to something that is always true (therefore 
				a timeless event or state) as in the first example or to 
				something that is only true right now as in the second example.</li>
					<li>Past simple, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I </em>
					<span class="style_black"><strong><em>arrived</em></strong></span><em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary 
					</em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>cried</em></strong></span><br />This tense refers usually to completed actions or states 
				occurring before the time of speaking.</li>
					<li>Future simple (also called the <em>will</em> future):<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I </em><span class="style_black">
					<strong><em>will arrive</em></strong></span><em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
					</em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>will rain</em></strong></span><em>, 
				I think</em><br />which refer to the future after the time of speaking</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Perfect aspects with these tenses:<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li>Present prefect, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
					</em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>have finished</em></strong></span><em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We 
					</em><span class="style_black"><strong><em>have spoken</em></strong></span><br />These forms relate a past state or event to the present.</li>
					<li>Past perfect, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I </em>
					<span class="style_black"><strong><em>had finished</em></strong></span><em> before the clock 
				struck ten<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We </em>
					<span class="style_black"><strong><em>had spoken</em></strong></span><em> 
				so I knew what she thought</em><br />These forms relate two past events to each other and indicate 
				which one came first.</li>
					<li>Future perfect, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I </em>
					<span class="style_black"><strong><em>will have finished</em></strong></span><em> the work before 
				6<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They </em><span class="style_black">
					<strong><em>will have 
				left</em></strong></span><em> London before you arrive</em><br />These forms relate two future events or states.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Progressive aspects with these tenses (sometimes called 
				continuous aspects although there is a technical difference):<ul class="bluebuttonlist">
					<li>Present progressive, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>am 
				sitting</strong></span> on the train<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>are studying</strong></span> 
				Biology</em><br />These forms refer either to what is happening now or what is 
				happening in the background and may not be happening right this 
				minute.</li>
					<li>Past progressive, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>was 
				sitting </strong></span>on the train<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>were studying</strong></span> 
				Biology</em><br />These forms do the same but in the past showing what was 
				happening then or in the background to then.</li>
					<li>Future progressive, e.g.:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>will 
				be sitting</strong></span> on the train<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
					<span class="style_black"><strong>will be studying</strong></span> 
				Biology</em><br />These forms do the same for the future showing what will be 
				happening then or in the background to then.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is possible to combine aspects so we allow, in English, for 
			example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span class="style_black"><strong>had 
			been studying</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They <span class="style_black"><strong>will have been 
			studying</strong></span></em><br />
			and so on.&nbsp; The names of these tenses are logical.&nbsp; The 
			first is the past perfect progressive and the second is the future 
			perfect progressive.</p>
			<p>Here is a chart of all the tenses in English.&nbsp; You can click 
			on the chart for a link to a guide to that form.&nbsp; You do not 
			need to know all about all the tenses before you start your CELTA 
			course but it will help a lot if you are familiar with the names of 
			the forms.<br />
			If you need to teach a particular tense form, this is a good place 
			to begin a little research.</p>

			<p>English tense structures are quite complicated, often more so 
			than the structures in your learners' first languages, so it is very 
			important that you know what you are talking about before you try to 
			teach tense forms and patterns.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Know your subject.</strong><br />
				Before daring to teach a tense form, make sure you do some 
				research.&nbsp; This site is a good place to start and you can 
				use the table above to locate the forms that concern you.</li>
				<li><strong>Be aware of differences between languages.<br />
				</strong>Many languages do not chop time up or view it in any way 
				similarly to the way English speakers view time.&nbsp; Some, for 
				example, do not have any way of distinguishing aspect from tense 
				so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrived</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have arrived</em><br />
				are functionally identical.<br />
				The English concept of a relational aspect is hard for learners 
				with these language backgrounds to grasp.<br />
				Other languages do not have anything like an equivalent of 
				progressive forms so there is no obvious difference in these 
				languages between a translation of<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was speaking</em><br />
				and<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke</em><br />
				and, again, the concepts will be hard for some learners to 
				understand.</li>
				<li><strong>Use time lines to make things clear.</strong><br />
				There is a guide to using time lines on this site, linked below, 
				which will help you understand what they are and how to 
				construct them.&nbsp; A visual image of the relationships that 
				perfect and progressive aspects imply is particularly helpful.<br />
				Here's an example which is intended to make a difference 
				between:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was cycling to work when she had the 
				idea</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was cycling to work when she had the 
				accident</em><br />
				<img alt="time line 1" height="92" src="../../../imagesgraphics/pasttimeline5a.png" width="400" /><br />
				<img alt="time line 2" height="93" src="../../../imagesgraphics/pasttimeline6a.png" width="400" /><br />
				In the first line the cycling continues (the yellow line) and 
				having the idea occurs in the middle of that (the red cross).<br />
				In the second line, the red cross denotes the accident and the 
				cycling clearly did not continue.</li>
				<li><strong>Present tense forms in context.</strong><br />
				If you present a tense or aspect form, you need to be very clear 
				about the concept it represents.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen the film</em><br />
				in English, implies that the film is part of my present 
				understanding of the world and I am prepared to talk about it.<br />
				In other languages, however, such as German, French or Dutch, 
				the form may simply refer to a past event which is finished and 
				has no present reference.&nbsp; A better translation from those 
				languages may often be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw the film</em><br />
				By the same token, the meaning of something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have finished</em><br />
				is not possible to see unless the event is set in the context of 
				other future events (such as in a narrative).</li>
				<li><strong>Do not assume that accuracy is the same as 
				understanding.</strong><br />
				If a learner produces something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is being difficult</em><br />
				it may only be evidence that he or she can form the tense 
				properly.&nbsp; The learner may mean either:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is difficult</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He persists in being difficult</em><br />
				and you don't know if the context is not clear.</li>
			</ol>
