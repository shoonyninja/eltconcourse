				<li>In the Second Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary there 
				are entries for 171,476 words.<br />
				The 
				object of classifying words and phrases by class is to look at 
				what function parts of the language perform.&nbsp; It's a basic 
				way of making sense of the huge amount of data that a language 
				contains.&nbsp; (Word class used to be called <em>parts of speech</em> 
				and that may be how you first encountered the topic at school.)</li>
				<li>There is some good evidence that all languages divide words 
				and phrases in similar ways.&nbsp; It is hard to think of how 
				one could construct a language which did not have items to 
				represent things, attributes, actions, directions, people and so 
				on.</li>
				<li>There is also some evidence that people think in terms of 
				word and phrase class.&nbsp; That is to say, we divide reality 
				into chunks that are represented in linguistic terms.&nbsp; If 
				this is true, learners of the language need to know where to 
				'file' a language item when they encounter it.</li>

			<p>On the left, there is a just a pile of undifferentiated material.&nbsp; 
			You may be able, eventually, to find the book you are looking for 
			but your life will be made considerably easier if the librarians 
			have taken the trouble to organise things a bit better so you know 
			where to look for type of book, author, subject and so on.<br />
			Equally, a teacher may present a new word or phrase to you and you 
			may be able to remember what it means but, unless you know the 
			class of information it embodies, you life will be made much more 
			difficult when it comes to using the item accurately in your own

			<p>This guide is mostly about word class but it is important to 
			pause for a moment and consider the ways in which phrases also 
			perform functions in sentences which are the same as or very similar 
			to the way that words function.<br />
			For example, consider these two sentences:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Cars halted outside</em></li>
				<li><em>Three old cars suddenly halted right outside</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the first sentence we only have three words and they perform 
			these functions in the grammar:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style37">
				<li><em>Cars</em> is a noun meaning a type of motor vehicle and 
				the only thing we can say about it is that it is plural (because 
				there is an -<em>s</em> ending).&nbsp; It acts as the subject of 
				the verb.</li>
				<li><em>halted</em> is the verb and, because it has a -<em>ed</em> 
				ending, we know that it is in the past tense.</li>
				<li><em>outside</em> is an adverb telling us where the action 
				happened.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the second sentence, the structure is very similar but the 
			information is a little richer:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style37">
				<li><em>Three old cars</em> is a noun phrase and it is made up, 
				you now know, of a determiner, <em>three</em>, and adjective,
				<em>old</em>, and the noun <em>cars</em>.&nbsp; Grammatically, 
				it still acts as the subject of the sentence.&nbsp; It performs 
				the same function as the simple noun in sentence 1.</li>
				<li>s<em>uddenly halted</em> is a verb phrase and is made up of 
				the verb plus an adverb, <em>suddenly</em>, telling us the 
				manner in which the cars halted.</li>
				<li><em>right outside</em> is an adverb phrase which carries 
				more meaning than just the word <em>outside</em> but it still 
				acts to tell us where the action happened.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In sentence 2. all the items are phrases rather than single words 
			but the grammatical functions remain the same.&nbsp; That is what is 
			meant by phrase class as opposed to word class.&nbsp; There is a 
			little more on this in the guide to syntax (next).</p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				new verbs (such as <em>google, text, binge-watch, troll, 
			message</em> and so on) to describe new activities or behaviours<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				new nouns (such as <em>bling, spam, web-cloud, omnishambles</em> 
				and so on) to describe new devices, concepts or phenomena<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				new adjectives and adverbs formed from them (such as <em>spritzily, 
				skunked</em> etc.) to describe the previously indescribable<br />
				We can also coin what are known as nonce words to suit our 
				circumstances.&nbsp; For example, you will not find <em>blandify</em> 
				or <em>blandification</em> in any dictionary but native speakers 
				will have little difficulty recognising that it is a verb formed 
				from the adjective <em>bland</em> and a noun formed from that 
				verb.&nbsp; The verb means <em>make bland</em> and the noun 
				means <em>the action of making bland</em>.<br />
				Interjections, too, are often made up on the spot to express our 
				feelings.</li>
				<li><strong>Closed-class words</strong><br />
				Other word and phrase classes are not so easily handled.&nbsp; 
			We do not normally invent new determiners, prepositions, pronouns, 
			and conjunctions.<br />
				Some words may fall out of fashion, such as <em>thou, athwart</em> 
				or <em>yonder</em> but new additions are very rare indeed.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is a good reason for this distinction:</p>
			<p>Open-class words and phrases are <strong>lexical</strong> and 
			that means that they represent real ideas when they stand alone.&nbsp; 
			We can say, for example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Go!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ice?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy now?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ouch!</em><br />
			etc. and, even when the word or phrase is the only item in the 
			sentence, it still carries real meaning.<br />
			Closed-class words and phrases are <strong>functional</strong> and 
			serve to make the grammar of the language work.&nbsp; When they 
			stand alone, they are meaningless so we are unlikely to say:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; In<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These</em><br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; In front of</em><br />
			etc. unless the hearer can reconstruct the meaning from something 
			already said.</p>

			<p>It was said at the outset that there is evidence that word and 
			phrase class is a universal of languages and most will show the same 
			or very similar distinctions.&nbsp; It is very important, therefore 
			that you:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Focus learners on word / phrase class.</strong><br />
				When you introduce a new item, you make it very clear what 
				sort of item it is.&nbsp; Do not expect your students to guess.<br />
				Use, on the board and on handouts, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>n.</em> to mark nouns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;v. </em>to mark verbs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>adj</em>. to mark adjectives<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>adv</em>. to mark adverbs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>pron</em>. to mark pronouns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>prep</em>. to mark prepositions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>conj</em>. to mark conjunctions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>det</em>. to mark determiners<br />
				That's the way most dictionaries do it.</li>
				<li><strong>Consider function before form.<br />
				</strong>Think about what the word is doing, not what it looks like.&nbsp; 
				For example, in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a friendly person</em><br />
				the word <em>friendly</em> is an adjective even though it ends in -<em>ly</em> 
				in the way thousands of adverbs end (such as slowly, helpfully 
				and so on).<br />
				And in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put it outside</em><br />
				the word <em>outside</em> is an adverb, but in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He put it outside the door<br />
				</em>the word <em>outside</em> is a preposition linking the 
				verb, <em>put</em>, with the noun phrase <em>the door</em>.<br />
				And in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Do you have much money?</em><br />
				the word <em>much</em> is a determiners but in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Do you want much?</em><br />
				the word <em>much</em> is a pronoun.<br />
				And in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She banks over there</em><br />
				the word <em>banks</em> is a verb, but in:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The banks are overflowing</em><br />
				the word <em>banks</em> is a noun with a very different and 
				unconnected meaning.<br />
				</li>
				<li><strong>Link word classes logically</strong>.<br />
				If you introduce a new noun, think about what adjectives can 
				describe it and <em>vice versa</em>.&nbsp; If, e.g., you introduce the 
				adjective <em>doable</em>, make sure it's clear to your learners 
				that it can be applied to <em>a job, a task, an arrangement, a 
				journey </em>and so on but that you cannot apply it to <em>a 
				book, a computer </em>or <em>a picture</em>.<br />
				If you introduce a noun such as <em>downpour</em>, be aware that 
				you can describe it as <em>heavy, torrential, sudden </em>and so 
				on but not as <em>light, drizzly, slow</em> or <em>pleasant</em>.<br />
				If you introduce a new verb, think about what can do it: people, 
				places, buildings etc.&nbsp; Some verbs, such as <em>construct</em> 
				and <em>clarify</em> can only be done by animate subjects, 
				others, such as <em>spark</em> or <em>foam</em> can only be done 
				by certain types of inanimate subjects.<br />
				And so on.</li>
				<li><strong>Present new items in context.</strong><br />
				You may successfully tell a students, for example, that <em>a text</em> is 
				a short written message sent on a 'phone but that will only work 
				in one setting such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sent me a text telling me where to 
				meet</em><br />
				It will, however, not work for a context such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sent me the text of her presentation</em><br />
				because that is a different, albeit connected, sense of the 
				noun.<br />
				Fully to understand a word or phrase requires encountering it 
				multiple times in clear contexts so that the meaning is made 
				transparent.</li>
