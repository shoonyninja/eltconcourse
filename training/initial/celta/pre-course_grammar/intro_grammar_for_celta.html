			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="study" height="206" src="../../../images/girl_study_panic310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>This section of the CELTA area on the site is for anyone who is 
			about to embark on a CELTA course but for whom the grammar of 
			English is something of a mystery.&nbsp; That will normally include 
			anyone educated in an English-speaking setting because the grammar 
			of the language is rarely taught (or, if it is taught, rarely taught 
			well).<br />
			If you have learned English by picking it up, rather than being 
			formally taught the language, this section is also for you.</p>
			<p>Although this is in the part of the site dedicated to CELTA (the 
			Cambridge University qualification), what follows will serve just as 
			well if you are taking the only other proper initial course, that 
			administered by Trinity College, the Trinity CertTESOL.<br />
			If you are taking another sort of unrecognised course, it may help 
			but you are ill advised to take such a course.</p>
			<p>Incidentally, you may find similar 'courses' to this one provided 
			by people who want to take your money for them.&nbsp; Some of them 
			may even be accurate, but why bother?</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>CELTA index</dt>
				<dd>This will take you to the main index for all the guides 
				specifically concerned with preparing for and following a CELTA 
				course or any other initial-training programme in English 
				Language Teaching.</dd>
				<dt>Grammar for CELTA</dt>
				<dd>This will return you to this page.</dd>
				<dt>Language analysis</dt>
				<dd>This will take you to the index page for a course in 
				Language Analysis covering pronunciation, words, phrases, 
				clauses and sentences and discourse.&nbsp; It is much more 
				thorough than this and probably best 
				left until after your course unless you have time hanging 
				heavily on your hands.</dd>
				<dt>A simple grammar</dt>
				<dd>This is written with learners of English in mind and is, 
				therefore, quite straightforward.&nbsp; It covers more than this 
				short introduction and is available as a PDF document to keep by 
				your side.&nbsp; It may be helpful if you find yourself needing 
				to explain grammar points simply and clearly to learners.</dd>
				<dt>A basic ELT course</dt>
				<dd>This is written for people who have had no formal training 
				at all in teaching languages.&nbsp; It is not a replacement for 
				a CELTA course, not least because you won't get a certificate at 
				the end, but it will give you some language basics and a set of 
				tools for working in the classroom.</dd>
				<dt>Teacher training index</dt>
				<dd>This is the overview page with links to all the guides on 
				the site including CELTA, Delta and much more.&nbsp; During or 
				after the course, you may like to start with the Initial plus 
				guides which are designed for people just like you.</dd>
				<dt>Courses on this site</dt>
				<dd>This site contains short courses in a variety of areas for 
				both learners and teachers.&nbsp; In particular, there is a 
				short course in how to transcribe (i.e., write down) the sounds 
				of English.&nbsp; Sooner or later, you will have to learn how to 
				do this.&nbsp; If you have the time, gaining at least a passive, 
				reading knowledge of the phonemes of English will pay dividends 
				on your course.<br />
				After your course, you may find some of the other 
				mini-courses useful.</dd>
				<dt>Worksheet task</dt>
				<dd>This is a test that you can take at the end of doing these 
				three sections.&nbsp; It comes with a key and will act as a 
				reminder, some revision and a check that you have understood.&nbsp; 
				The link opens in a new window and you can make a note of your 
				answers or print it out and work without a computer.</dd>
				<dt>A-Z training index</dt>
				<dd>This is a long index where you can search for any areas that 
				interest you.&nbsp; If, for example, you encounter an area of 
				English Language Teaching on your course that you want to know 
				more about or don't understand, use this index to see if there 
				is a guide on this site.&nbsp; You can also search the whole 
				site using the link at the foot of all pages.</dd>

					<h2>Why do this first?</h2>
					<p>You may think that you will learn about English grammar 
					during the course and don't need to prepare yourself 
					because, after all, you are paying someone else to teach you 
					about grammar and much else that you will need to start your 
					English language teaching career.</p>
					<p>There are three things wrong with that view:</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Initial training courses are usually very intensive with, typically, 
				only about 120 hours of tuition (and often less).<br />
				There simply isn't time to cover all the grammar points you will 
				need to know about on such courses so any language analysis work 
				will be very selective.&nbsp; Often the selection is made with 
				the demands of teaching practice in mind so the only grammar you 
				may be taught will be limited and very partial.</li>
				<li>Many tutors on initial training courses are, regrettably, not particularly well 
				informed about the grammar of the language.<br />
				Often, this is because they do not feel that mastery of more 
				than the basics of grammar is necessary or because they are not 
				themselves confident of their knowledge of the subject.&nbsp; 
				Such tutors are probably excellent sources of good classroom 
				practices but less useful as a source of information about the 
				language itself.</li>
				<li>You are going to be very busy during a course and anything 
				you can do now to take the load off your shoulders in terms of 
				researching and reading about a complicated area will pay 
				dividends later.<br />
				Getting to grips with grammatical systems and terminology now 
				will mean you have more time and more confidence to focus on 
				teaching rather than personal learning.</li>

					<h2>Why should I learn about grammar?</h2>
					<p>There are a number of reasons:</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Your students will expect you to know about the grammar of 
				the language they are learning.<br />
				It is true that the focus in classrooms today is often less on 
				the grammar of the language and more firmly on learning how to 
				do things with the language (what is called a functional rather 
				than a structural approach to teaching and learning).<br />
				However, it has long been recognised that formal, structural 
				language knowledge is <span class="style_underline">part</span> 
				of the ability to communicate effectively in any language.&nbsp; 
				You may be an effective user of English and have little overt 
				knowledge of the grammar of the language (which is why you are 
				reading this), but when you come to teaching the language, you 
				will need, in almost every lesson, to tell people something 
				appropriate and reliable about the structures of English.</li>
				<li>You will need to select and present language in a learnable 
				way.<br />
				If you don't know about the grammar of English, you will be 
				unable to do this properly and probably end up confusing your 
				learners and making their lives even more difficult than they 
				already are.&nbsp; That's not really forgivable.</li>
				<li>It's part of your job.<br />
				Teaching is a practical skill but a skill based on nothing more 
				than an intuition about language is liable to break down when 
				you are confronted by the need to explain, develop and practise 
				a specific language structure.&nbsp; If you don't know your 
				tense from your aspect or your adverb from your preposition, 
				life will we hard and uncomfortable and your students will soon 
				lose confidence in you as a teacher.</li>
				<li>Learners make mistakes.<br />
				That's obvious, of course, 
				and, some say, an inevitable and useful part of the learning 
				process.<br />
				Dealing with error in the classroom places immediate demands on 
				you and responses such as<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's not 
				really English<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's wrong and should be ...</em></span><br />
				and so on are rarely enough.<br />
				You need to be able to recognise what's wrong, correct it 
				appropriately, or lead the learner to the correct answer, say 
				why it's wrong and explain the system in terms that the learner 
				can comprehend.&nbsp; To do that, you need to have a grasp of 
				the grammar of the language and be able to select what the 
				learner can handle at this stage as well as being confident in 
				your ability to analyse the language.</li>
