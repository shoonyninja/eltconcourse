			<img alt="lessons" height="166" src="../../../images/teaching_seminar250.jpg" width="250" /></p>
			<h2>The purpose of the assignment</h2>
			<p>The CELTA handbook explains that this assignment allows you to 
			demonstrate that you can:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">note your own teaching strengths and 
				weaknesses in different situations in light of feedback from 
				learners, teachers and teacher educators</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">identify which ELT areas of knowledge 
				and skills you need further development in</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">describe in a specific way how you 
				might develop your ELT knowledge and skills beyond the course</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">use written language that is clear, 
				accurate and appropriate to the task</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Your centre will probably give you a set of instructions for your 
			assignments.&nbsp; You'd be foolish to ignore these.<br />
			What follows is generic advice.<br />
			In this assignment, you are pretty much on your own in terms of 
			content but the structure is predictable from its purposes (above).<br />
			This assignment has two main 
			parts.&nbsp; You do not need an introduction because it is clear 
			what it is about.</p>

					<h2>Identifying the strengths and weaknesses</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">The first thing to do is to look back 
				over your feedback from tutors, students and fellow 
				participants.&nbsp; From that you need to identify strengths and 
				weaknesses and categorise them in some way.&nbsp; Here are some 
				suggestions:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li class="greybulletlist">Planning and preparation.&nbsp; 
					Think about:<br />
					Did you choose suitable material?<br />
					Was your planned timing accurate?<br />
					Was the lesson structure coherent and appropriate?</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Presenting language and skills:<br />
					Were you clear?<br />
					Did you do the analysis before the lesson?<br />
					Did you explain clearly and accurately?<br />
					Did you focus on pronunciation adequately?</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Providing practice:<br />
					Was there enough of it?<br />
					Did it work?<br />
					Did the learners get to use language relevant to them?<br />
					Was the level of challenge right?<br />
					How are your drilling skills?</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Classroom management:<br />
					Were your instructions clear?<br />
					Did you organise the room appropriately?<br />
					Did you group learners well and re-group them unfussily?</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Handling error:<br />
					Did you intervene at the right times?<br />
					Did you explain why something was wrong?<br />
					Did you give the learners the opportunity to correct 
					themselves and each other?</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Developing skills:<br />
					Did you teach skills as well as practising them?<br />
					Do you understand the nature of skills work in all 4 areas?<br />
					Can you list three subskills in each of the four areas?</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">Developing language systems 
					knowledge:<br />
					Do you have a firm enough grasp of the grammar of English?<br />
					Can you explain grammatical points clearly and simply?<br />
					Can you define words unambiguously?<br />
					Can you transcribe phonemically?<br />
					Do you understand discourse?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you would like to have that list as a form 
			for you to fill out,
			<a href="../../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_celta_self_evaluation.pdf" target="_blank">
			it's available here</a>.&nbsp; The form has extra spaces for you to 
			add areas of concern.<br />
			The form also has 4 numbers at the end for you to list the 
			priorities for action.&nbsp; After you've filled in the form, look through 
			it to identify what they should be.&nbsp; Anything with a tick in the
			<strong>Not usually</strong> and <strong>Never</strong> columns is 
			a suitable candidate.</p>

			<p>Notice that</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first column states the problem</li>
				<li>The second column explains what effect on learning the 
				weakness has (i.e., why it is important)</li>
				<li>The third column says what you will <strong>do</strong></li>
				<li>The fourth column explains how you will <strong>measure</strong> 
			the outcomes and see any improvement.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is an important distinction between columns three and four.&nbsp; 
			There is little point in taking action if you have no way of 
			measuring whether it is effective.</p>
