			<h3>Referencing</h3>
			<p>You will need to make sure that the in-text referencing and the 
			bibliography follow a standard convention.<br />
			For details, go to a website for advice.&nbsp; There’s a good guide 
			to the Harvard referencing system 
			produced for Anglia Ruskin University that you can access
			<a href="https://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm" target="_blank">
			by clicking here</a>.<br />
			Briefly, however:</p>
			<h4 class="auto-style10">For in-text references</h4>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong><em>Books and articles</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>At every point in the text where there is a particular 
				reference, include the author’s surname and the year of 
				publication with page numbers if you are quoting specific words 
				– for example:<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>In his survey of the social habits of 
				CELTA tutors, Bloggs (1998) 
			refuted that ...</em></span><br />
			or<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>In his survey of the social habits of 
				CELTA tutors, Bloggs (1998: 19) states that, "I can assert without fear of successful 
			contradiction that …"</em></span><br />
				Make sure that it is 100% clear where your writing stops and a 
				quotation begins, either by using inverted commas or indenting 
				the citation etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong><em>Websites</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>You may not know the author’s name or date (but give them as above 
			if you do) so this is acceptable:<br />
				<span class="style_brown"><em>It has been suggested (Wikipedia (2013)) that …</em></span></dd>
				<dt><strong>For the bibliography</strong></dt>
				<dd>For ease of access, you may like to divide your bibliography into 
			Books and Articles, Teaching Materials and Electronic resources.</dd>
				<dt class="auto-style5"><strong><em>Books</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>List references in alphabetical order by the surname of the 
				first author.&nbsp; If the author is unknown you should use 
				“Anon”<br />
				For up to three authors include all names; if there are more 
				than three, give the first author’s surname and initials 
				followed by <em>et al</em>.<br />
				Provide, in this order and format:
			Author surname/s and initial/s + ed. or eds. (if editor/s), Year of 
			publication, <em>Title in italics</em>, Edition (if not the first edition) as 
			ordinal number + ed., Place of publication: Publisher<br />
			For example:<br /><span class="auto-style4">Jones, D, ed., 1995, 
				<em>My Teaching and Other Fiascos</em>, 5th ed., London: 
				Concourse publications</span></dd>
				<dt class="auto-style5"><strong><em>Articles</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>Include also: full journal title, volume number (issue number) and 
			page numbers, for example,<br /><span class="auto-style4">Bloggs, T, 1997, 
				<em>Developing fluency through ferret keeping</em>, English 
			Language Teaching Journal, 41, 3 pp. 18-83</span></dd>
				<dt class="auto-style5"><strong><em>Electronic resources</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>E-journals – include full URL and date of access, for example:<br />
				<span class="auto-style4">Bloggs TA, Brown G.C., 2012, <em>Spoken English in 
				Weston super Mare</em>, in 
			The Wandering Linguist [online], p. 105. Available from: http://www.wanderling.com/1111 [Accessed 23/08/2004]</span></dd>
				<dt class="auto-style5"><strong><em>Websites</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>Supply author/s or corporate body, date of publication / 
				last update or copyright date, available from: URL [Accessed 
				date], for example:<span class="auto-style4"><br />
				eltconcourse.com, 
				<em>How to write a CELTA assignment,</em> available from: 
			http://eltconcourse.com/this page [accessed 02/11/2014]</span><br />

			<p>Plagiarism is a form of fraud.&nbsp; It can be defined as 
			presenting someone else's work, thoughts or words as if they were 
			yours.&nbsp; Downloading and using unacknowledged material from the 
			internet is included, of course.</p>
			<ol class="auto-style6">
				<li>Never be afraid to show that you have accessed a 
			range of other people’s work – nobody is expecting you to originate 
			all the ideas and information in your work.</li>
				<li>Read your assignments and check whether everything that is not in your 
			own words or from your own resources has been acknowledged.</li>
				<li>Make sure that you include in your bibliography anything you 
			refer to in the text and exclude any reading to which you do not 
			make explicit reference.&nbsp; This includes materials that you put in 
			appendices and use in lessons and plans, by the way.</li>
				<li>Don’t be tempted to think that if you have changed a few words 
			from a source you have read that you don’t need to acknowledge it – 
			you do.</li>
				<li>If in any doubt – reference it.</li>

			<p>Using the following is conventional but unimpressive if used 
			wrongly.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em>i.e.</em></dt>
				<dd>means <em>that is</em>, being the English abbreviation of the 
				Latin <em>id 
			est.</em>&nbsp; It should not be confused with <em>e.g</em>.</dd>
				<dt><em>e.g.</em></dt>
				<dd>means <em>for example</em>, and is the abbreviation of the 
				Latin <em>exempli gratia.</em></dd>
				<dt><em>cf.</em></dt>
				<dd>means <em>compare with</em> or <em>consult</em>, being short 
				for <em>conferre.&nbsp; </em>In Latin it was an invitation to 
				the reader to consult an alternative source to compare with what 
				is being said.&nbsp; In English, it usually simply means <em>
				compare</em>.</dd>
				<dt><em>et al.</em></dt>
				<dd>means <em>and others</em> and comes from the Latin <em>et alia oret alii</em>.&nbsp; 
				Use it when there are more than three authors.</dd>
				<dt><em>et seq.</em></dt>
				<dd>This is the Latin abbreviation for <em>et sequens</em> and 
				it means <em>and what follows</em>.&nbsp; It is used to direct 
				the reader to a page or paragraph in a text and note that this 
				is where the relevant section starts.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>See Smith, 1992:350 et seq.</em></dd>
				<dt><em>sic</em></dt>
				<dd>This is the Latin for <em>so</em> or <em>thus</em>.&nbsp; If 
				you want to quote something that is incorrect or oddly phrased, 
				use this in brackets after the words or phrase to show that this 
				is how it appears in the original text.&nbsp; That way, the 
				reader will not think it is your mistake.&nbsp; Do not correct 
				anything that you are citing directly.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The student told me that "this class are 
				too difficile for me (sic)".</em></dd>
				<dt><em>viz.</em></dt>
				<dd>is the usual abbreviation for<em> videlicet</em> which means
				<em>namely</em> or <em>that is to say</em>.&nbsp; It should not 
				be confused with i.e.</dd>
				<dt><em>q.v.</em></dt>
				<dd>stands for <em>quod vide</em>, which means <em>which see</em> 
				and refers to a term that should be looked up elsewhere in a 
				document.&nbsp; It is often used for cross referencing.</dd>
				<dt><em>ibid</em>.</dt>
				<dd>stands for <em>ibidem</em>, <em>in the same place</em> and is used in citations 
			to refer to the immediately preceding citation.</dd>
				<dt><em>op. cit.</em></dt>
				<dd>stands for <em>opere citato</em>, 
			<em>in the work cited</em>.&nbsp; It is used to refer to any 
				previously cited work, not just the last one.</dd>
				<dt><em>pace</em></dt>
				<dd>means something like <em>With all due respect</em> <em>to</em> 
				and is used by authors to show respect for the holder of a view 
				with which they disagree (often disrespectfully).</dd>
				<dt><em>passim</em></dt>
				<dd>means very approximately <em>throughout</em> or <em>
				frequently</em> and refers to an idea or concept that occurs in 
				many places in a cited work so a particular page reference is 
				inappropriate.</dd>

			<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
				<li>Avoid non-standard abbreviations, contractions and so on.</li>
				<li>Do not use slang or overly colloquial language.</li>
				<li>Avoid the use of meaningless adjectives such as <em>nice, lovely</em>

			<p>Each CELTA centre sets its own assignments so there's no attempt 
			here to tell you what to write (sorry) but only how to set it out 
			and make it clear and coherent.</p>
			<p>Your assignment should be between 750 and 1000 words long.</p>
			<h4>Part1: Introduction</h4>
			<p>The introduction needs to set out exactly what the title means to you.<br />
			Keep it short and to the point.</p>
			<h4>Part 2: The facts</h4>
			<p>This means what it says so it takes the form of an information 
			report and follows this 
			structure:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><em><strong>Make a general statement </strong></em><strong>
				<em>identifying the topic</em></strong></dt>
				<dd>Focus on the learner: <em class="style_brown">This class is 
				at B1 level and hoping to take an IELTS examination</em><br />
				Focus on systems: <em class="style_brown">English uses a range 
				of forms to talk about the future.&nbsp; Here I focus only on 
				...</em><br />
				Focus on skills: <em class="style_brown">Listening is a 
				receptive skill, like reading, but requires specific subskills.</em><br />
				Focus on lessons from the classroom: <em class="style_brown">I 
				have identified four areas of my practice to focus on in this 
				assignment.</em></dd>
				<dt><em><strong>Description</strong></em></dt>
				<dd>Make sure in this section that you use proper subheadings 
				and paragraphs or the assignment will be hard to follow.<br />
				Focus on the learner: Describe the learner(s) area by area<br />
				Focus on systems: Describe the form, meaning and use of the 
				language structure<br />
				Focus on skills: Describe what people have to be able to do to 
				read, listen, write or speak in the topic area<br />
				Focus on lessons from the classroom: Describe (honestly) where 
				your teaching is strong and weak and what you intend to do about 
				the weaknesses</dd>
			</dl>
			<h4>Part 3: Conclusion</h4>
			<p>If you need a conclusion, keep it short and to the point.&nbsp; Do not 
			repeat what you have said – sum it up.</p>
			<hr />

			<p>Your assignment should be free from slips and errors.&nbsp; The syntax 
			should be clear and the reader should be guided with subheadings.&nbsp; Make sure the subheadings actually reflect 
			the content of what follows.<br />
			If spelling isn't your strong suit, there's
			<a href="../../lexis/spelling.html">a guide on this site</a>.</p>
			<p>Here's a diagrammatic way of seeing the structure of a good CELTA 
			assignment with sections overlapping so it stays on topic.&nbsp; You could print a copy to have in front of you as you
