			<h1><span class="auto-style3">CELTA</span> written assignment: focus 
			on the learner(s)</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="focus" height="166" src="../../../images/eye_dark_background250.jpg" width="250" /></p>
			<h2>The purpose of the assignment</h2>
			<p>The CELTA handbook (5th edition) explains that this assignment allows you to 
			demonstrate that you can:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">show awareness of how a 
				learner’s/learners’ background(s), previous learning experience 
				and learning preferences affect learning</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">identify the learner’s/learners’ 
				language and/or skills needs</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">correctly use terminology relating to 
				the description of language systems and/or language skills</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">select appropriate material and/or 
				resources to aid the learner’s/learners’ language and/or skills 
				development</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">provide a rationale for using specific 
				activities with a learner/learners</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">find, select and reference information 
				from one or more sources</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">use written language that is clear, 
				accurate and appropriate to the task</li>
			</ul>
			<p>That's a lot to cover in 1000 words so you need to be concise and 
			stay focused.&nbsp; This is not the place to discuss general 
			approaches to teaching.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style4">

			<img alt="structure" height="133" src="../../../images/structure_leaf200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style5">
					<h2>The structure of the assignment</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Most centres choose one of two ways to set this assignment:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You may be asked to focus on a specific learner from one of 
				the teaching practice classes or</li>
				<li>You may be asked to focus on the whole of a teaching 
				practice class.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You may even be given a choice.</p>
			<p>Whichever assignment you are set, the considerations are the same 
			but, obviously, more depth will be required in 1. than in 2.</p>
			<p>This is in the genre of an Information Report and it has three 
			parts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">A brief introduction stating the basic 
				information about the learner or the class.&nbsp; Say what you 
				are doing and who the subject of the investigation is.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">An area-by-area report giving the data 
				you have gathered, noting strengths, weaknesses and needs as you 
				go along.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">A set of suggestions identifying:<ul>
					<li class="greybulletlist">sources for language and/or 
					skills development and, if it's needed, personal support</li>
					<li class="greybulletlist">ideas 
					for language and/or skill focused activities<br />
					Link this section carefully to the data you have gathered, 
					explaining <strong>why</strong> you think the ideas 
					will help.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can combine the second and third areas if that makes sense to 
			you so two structures are possible:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style4">
				<tr>
					<td>Either ...</td>
					<td>... or ...</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="structure 1" height="236" src="../images/focusonlearnerstructure1.png" width="350" /></td>
					<td>
					<img alt="structure 2" height="231" src="../images/focusonlearnerstructure2.png" width="350" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<h4>Choose one structure or the other.&nbsp; Do

			<ol>
				<li><strong>
				<img alt="individual" class="auto-style10" height="133" src="../../../images/alone_beach200.jpg" width="200" />For an individual student </strong>you will probably 
				need:<ol class="auto-style8">
					<li>An example of the learner's writing.&nbsp; The neatest 
					way to get this is to write a short note to the learner 
					saying who you are, giving a bit of background (age, 
					background, personal details etc.) and asking the learner to 
					respond in like manner.&nbsp; That way, you get the personal 
					stuff you need and an example of how well they can handle 
					the simple language needed to give some personal data (name, 
					age, occupation etc.).</li>
					<li>The extra data you need to collect are:<ul class="greybulletlist">
						<li>reasons for learning English</li>
						<li>language learning background</li>
						<li>student’s opinion of their strengths and weaknesses 
						in English</li>
						<li>preferred class and activity types</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>All of this information can be collected by using a 
					simple form and interviewing the student.&nbsp; Make 
					yourself a grid or table to fill in as you talk to the 
					learner.&nbsp; Then take it away and work on it, inserting 
					your comments in the third column.&nbsp; Something like 
					this:<br />
					<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style6">

					</table>
					</li>
					<li>You can, of course, gather some of this data by 
					designing a questionnaire.&nbsp; See
					<a href="../../../inservice/teaching/needsanalyses.html" target="_blank">
					the guide to needs analysis</a> to get some ideas.&nbsp; 
					There is
					<a href="../../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_Example_basic_needs_analysis.pdf" target="_blank">
					an example of a basic needs analysis form</a> here.</li>
					<li>Do one of two things:<ul class="greybulletlist">
						<li>Record the interview and listen to it again, making 
						notes of consistent errors and the learner's 
						communicative effectiveness.&nbsp; You can provide a 
						tapescript of some important parts of the interview to 
						exemplify the areas you think need work in the 
						assignment.&nbsp; You will need the person's permission 
						to do this, of course.</li>
						<li>If recording is not an option, make as many notes as 
						you can on the learner's use of English as you go along.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Learning style.&nbsp; The new edition of the handbook 
					(the 5th) has removed any explicit reference to learning 
					styles because the theories that underlie such things have 
					been comprehensibly debunked.&nbsp; The syllabus now 
					contains reference to learning preferences.&nbsp; However, for reasons which are slightly 
					obscure, some CELTA centres and tutors are wedded to the 
					idea of learning styles.&nbsp; Many will let you have a copy 
					of something called a VARK questionnaire to give to the 
					subject.&nbsp; There is, of course,
					<a href="../../../inservice/background/learningstyles.html" target="_blank">a guide to learning styles</a> on this site but you should 
					treat the area with great scepticism.&nbsp; See also
					<a href="../../../../articles/articles1/ELT_Concourse_The_myth_of_the_learning_style.pdf" target="_blank">the article attempting to debunk the whole concept</a>.<br />
					<br />
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>
				<img alt="group" class="auto-style10" height="133" src="../../../images/people_group_a200.jpg" width="200" />For a group of learners</strong> you'll need 
				slightly different information-gathering techniques but the 
				structure is <span class="style_underline">
				exactly</span> the same.<ol class="auto-style8">
					<li>You need to set out some information about the people in 
					the class: ages, occupations, reasons for learning etc.&nbsp; 
					See the table above.&nbsp; The only sensible way to do this 
					with a group of people is via a questionnaire needs 
					analysis.&nbsp; See
					<a href="../../../inservice/teaching/needsanalyses.html" target="_blank">
					the guide to needs analysis</a> to get some ideas.&nbsp; 
					There is
					<a href="../../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_Example_basic_needs_analysis.pdf" target="_blank">
					an example of a basic needs analysis form</a> here.</li>
					<li>You can investigate learning preferences but will have to 
					identify from the data any commonalities in the class rather 
					than details of each learner.&nbsp; See point f., above.</li>
					<li>For the final section of the assignment where you make 
					suggestions, you'll need to be a bit more generalised and 
					identify common aims and needs rather than individual ones.<br />
					One approach is to identify the two weakest and the two 
					strongest students and identify appropriate activities, 
					resources and aims for them.&nbsp; That should also cover 
					everyone in between.<br />
					<br />
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>
				<img alt="aim" class="auto-style10" height="133" src="../../../images/aim_gun200.jpg" width="200" />Describing 
				learning aims</strong> can be professionally done if you apply 
				some terminology.<br />
				Needs can overlap so some will fall into one or more categories.&nbsp; 
				Here's a brief outline:<ol class="auto-style8">
					<li>The student is studying English for no obvious purpose 
					at the moment.&nbsp; He or she may need the language in the 
					future for some purpose but at the moment that is not clear.&nbsp; 
					The student may also need the language as part of a general 
					education, for access to English-language websites and for 
					travel and tourism.<br />
					This student needs General English (a GE learner).</li>
					<li>This student need English to settle and integrate in an 
					English-speaking culture for an indefinite time.<br />
					This student needs English as a Second or Other Language (an 
					ESOL learner)</li>
					<li>This student needs English for business and commercial 
					purposes either because his/her professional setting demands 
					it or because he/she is intending to study Business and/or 
					Management.<br />
					This student needs Business English (a BE learner).</li>
					<li>This student intends to study in an English-medium 
					institution such as a university or college.<br />
					This student needs English for Academic Purposes (an EAP 
					learner).</li>
					<li>This student needs English for a narrow area of concern 
					such as access to written scientific texts, to work in a 
					particular occupation such as the hospitality industry, air 
					traffic control, the merchant marine, the transport industry 
					etc.<br />
					This student needs English for a Specific Purpose (an ESP 
					learner).</li>
					<li>All of the above can be subdivided into a bewildering 
					range of acronyms including, e.g., EGOP (English for General 
					Occupational Purposes), EGPP (English for General 
					Professional Purposes), ELF (English as a Lingua-Franca, for 
					communication between non-native speakers of English 
					worldwide), English in the Workplace (EiW), English for Professional 
					Purposes (EPP) and so on.<br />
					<br />
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>
				<img alt="effort" class="auto-style10" height="133" src="../../../images/effort_stone200.jpg" width="200" />Describing 
				motivation</strong> can also be better done if you use a bit of 
				technical terminology.<br />
				Be aware that these categories overlap and few learners fall 
				neatly into one type.&nbsp; Most will fall into two or more with 
				various mixes.<ol class="auto-style8">
					<li><span class="style_black"><em>"I want to learn English to fit into an English-speaking 
					culture and work and socialise."</em></span><br />
					This student has Integrative Motivation (to integrate into a 
					cultural milieu).</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em>"I want to learn English to use the language in business 
					meetings / to study a subject at university."</em></span><br />
					This student has Instrumental Motivation (using the language 
					as a tool to do other things).</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em>"I love the language and enjoy learning it and speaking 
					it."</em></span><br />
					This student has Intrinsic Motivation (the pressure to learn 
					comes from within).</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em>"I have been told to learn English by my employer / 
					parents / sponsor."</em></span><br />
					This student has Extrinsic Motivation (the pressure to learn 
					comes from outside).</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Be careful not to be too dogmatic here.&nbsp; People are 
			complicated and their motivations are often obscure, even to 
			themselves, so try to avoid statements such as<br />
			<em><span class="style_brown">This learner is extrinsically 
			motivated.</span><br />
			</em>Prefer, instead, something a bit more careful such as:<br />
			<span class="style_brown"><em>From the data supplied in the short 
			questionnaire, it seems that this learners is aware of the need to 
			learn enough English to be able to function in the workplace but is 
			also keen to access English-speaking websites and understand 
			something of the cultures of English-speaking societies.&nbsp; She 
			has, therefore, a mix of instrumental and integrative motivation and 
			needs English as a tool as well as for cultural access.</em></span></p>
			<p>There is <a href="../../../inservice/background/motivation.html">
			a guide to motivation</a> on this site but you do not need all the 
			detail now.&nbsp; If you would like a simpler guide to motivation 
			which still gives more data than here, there is
			<a href="../../../tkt/tktmodule1/tktm1motivation.html" target="_blank">
			one in the TKT course materials</a> (new tab).</p>

					<td class="auto-style5">
					<h2>Making your suggestions</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Obviously, the suggestions you make will be determined by what 
			you have discovered about the learner(s).</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Make sure everything you say here has a rationale:<ol class="auto-style8">
					<li>Why do you suggest it?</li>
					<li>What's its target?</li>

				<li>Include both ideas for activities and ideas for materials to 
				use and topics to focus on.</li>
				<li>Identify both language structure and skills needs. <br />
				For example,<br />
				<em class="style_brown">From the data summarised in point xxx 
				above, I would argue that a priority for this learner / these 
				learners is to enhance his / her / their reading skills because they / he / 
				she identify it as a weakness and this is supported by my 
				observations.&nbsp; Good reading skills are needed for study in 
				the UK and the majority of these EAP students / this EAP student will be 
				going on to university in the next few months.&nbsp; Therefore, 
				I suggest using xxxx in class and starting a reading club using 
				xxxx books and resources.&nbsp; The student(s) will also benefit 
				from a specific focus on both reading for gist and reading 
				intensively so I suggest the following activities will be 
				helpful...</em><br />or<br /><span class="style_brown"><em>Another area of weakness I have 
				identified in point yyyy above is the student's(s') lack of 
				vocabulary . Therefore, I suggest a specific focus on general 
				academic vocabulary including using yyyy as a resource and 
				spending at least one lesson per day focusing on common academic 
				collocations (such as </em>reasonable to argue, arising from the 
				data, developing the point further<em> etc.)<br />The class / student will also benefit from work on cohesive 
				devices such as </em>therefore, firstly, finally, because, 
				furthermore<em> etc. as his / her / their writing shows that 
				they avoid or misuse these structures in general (see appendix 
				2, and the comments in point z).</em></span></li>
