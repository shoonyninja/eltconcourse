			<p>This is a where we pull together guides in various areas of this

			in English Language Teaching.<br />
			There are plenty of online pre-CELTA and pre-Trinity Certificate in 
			TESOL courses out here on the web but this is, as far as can be 
			ascertained, the only one that's completely free.<br />
			Why not take advantage of it?</p>

			<p class="nomarginbottom">You don't.</p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">We should make it clear now that both the 
			Trinity College Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other 
			Languages (CertTESOL) and the Cambridge Assessment English 
			Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults (CELTA) are
			<strong>initial</strong> training courses which assume no prior 
			knowledge of the profession so nobody is obliged to take a 
			preparatory course at all.</p>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">Cambridge Assessment English describe the 
			CELTA this way:</p>
			<p class="auto-style8">The Certificate in Teaching English to 
			Speakers of Other Languages (CELTA) is an introductory course for 
			candidates who have little or no previous English language teaching 
			experience.<br />
			<span class="auto-style7">Cambridge Assessment English, <em>
			Certificate in Teaching English Speakers of Other Languages, 
			Syllabus and assessment guidelines</em>, July 2021 edition.</span></p>
			<p class="noparaspace">and Trinity College describe their initial 
			teaching qualification in similar terms:</p>
			<p class="auto-style8">The Trinity CertTESOL is a pre-service 
			teacher training course ... designed for those who have little or no 
			experience of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages ...<br />
			<span class="auto-style7">Trinity College London, <em>Certificate in 
			Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (CertTESOL), 
			Syllabus — from January 2016</em>, Second impression, April 2016.</span></p>
			<p>Do not let anyone tell you differently.</p>
			<p>We have focused on these two initial qualifications because they 
			are the only ones accredited at Level 5 (i.e., one step below a 
			first university degree) by Ofqual (The Office of Qualifications and 
			Examinations Regulation which regulates qualifications, examinations 
			and assessments in England).<br />
			Only the first of these (CELTA) has a part of this site dedicated to 
			it but the syllabuses of both courses are, perforce, very similar so 
			there is no reason that the information here will not be equally 
			relevant regardless of which course you are taking.</p>
			<p>There are other courses, delivered online or face to face which 
			purport to be recognised teaching qualifications at the same level 
			which are no such thing, of course.&nbsp; You are advised to steer 
			clear of them.</p>
			<p>However, all that said, many people like to hit the ground 
			running so a little time preparing yourself in terms of background 
			understanding of some key terminology and concepts and a bit more 
			time spent thinking about how to approach teaching the English 
			language will often pay dividends for these reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Even some familiarity with terminology will allow you to 
				think about what you are being told on a course without having 
				to worry too much about the terms in which it is expressed.</li>
				<li>A little time spent now thinking and learning about how 
				teaching may be designed, planned and delivered on your course 
				will allow you more time to think about getting attractive and 
				useful materials together and planning a lesson logically and 
				with the right level of slowly rising challenge.</li>
				<li>Getting to grips with the basics of English grammar now will 
				mean you spend less time doing so on the course and can devote 
				more to the important areas.&nbsp; This is probably more 
				important for native speakers of English or those who have 
				acquired the language informally than it is for people who have 
				learned the language formally and are already acquainted with 
				most of its central grammar.</li>

			<p>Those who design packaged courses and sell them on the web seem

			capable of a little introspection and able to identify areas in 
			which you know lots, those in which you know almost nothing and 
			those of which you have some knowledge.&nbsp; We will not presume to 
			argue with you but we will set you some short tasks here to help you

							<li>The present perfect.&nbsp; This is the tense we use 
							to embed a past event in the present which it has 
							changed in some way so it would usually be followed 
							by something like<em> ... so now we can start the 
							meeting</em>.</li>
							<li>Past simple.&nbsp; This is how we refer to 
							finished past events.&nbsp; The verb form is 
							irregular in this case (as <em>had</em>, not <em>
							haved</em>).</li>
							<li>The past perfect.&nbsp; This is how we refer to 
							past events embedded in other past events and would 
							usually be followed by something like: ... <em>so he
