				<dt><strong>What is / are the objective(s)?</strong></dt>
				<dd>This may already be given to you but the key idea is to 
				decide what the learners will be able to do at the end of the

				terms such as: <span class="style_black"><em>By the end of this,

				<span class="style_brown">It was raining when I arrived</span>.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				... the learners will be able to recognise that the topic of a 
				paragraph is usually stated in the first sentence and know to 
				read it with the most attention.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				... the learners will be able to talk about a range of hobbies

				<dt><strong>For a systems lesson</strong></dt>
				<dd>In a lesson of this sort, you will probably be looking at a 
				grammar point and/or lexis.&nbsp; In the example we have used 
				above, the lexis will include items referring to pastimes and 
				hobbies such as <em>cinema, film, chess, crosswords, bird 
				watching, reading, judo, sport </em>etc. and the grammar will 
				focus on, e.g., the present simple tense followed by the -<em>ing</em> 
				form (here a gerund, arguably) in sentences such as <em>I like 
				going fishing, I enjoy windsurfing, I love playing tennis, I'm 
				really fond of reading history </em>etc.<br />
				Grammar and structure: Make sure, if you are given a section of 
				a coursebook to teach, that you have looked carefully at what 
				it says in the teacher's book and have consulted a grammar book, 
				or this site, for an understanding of the language form.<br />
				Lexis: Consider how you will explain the lexis, its word class 
				and its pronunciation.&nbsp; Look, too, at collocation (words 
				which routinely occur together) and make sure you focus on, 
				e.g., <em>go</em> + <em>fishing, do </em>+ <em>judo, play </em>+
				<em>chess</em> etc.<br />

				<a href="../../../searchthesite.html">the search facility</a> 
				on this site.</dd>
				<dt><strong>For a skills lesson</strong></dt>
				<dd>You need to understand the basics of the skill you are 
				teaching in general as well as knowing what the subskill is.&nbsp;

					How you get from the materials to the objectives is, 
					therefore, mostly up to you.</p>

			<dl>

				is probably the preferred option, particularly for your first teaching slot.&nbsp; 
				It looks like this:<br />
				<img alt="ppp" height="335" src="images/ppp.png" width="500" /></dd>
				<dt><strong>Route 2: Test, Teach, Test</strong></dt>

			<p>There are two guides on this site that are particularly helpful

			lesson.&nbsp; Both guides will open in a new tab:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="../teaching/activity_types.html" target="_blank">The 
				guide to activity types</a>.&nbsp; This guide covers the 
				concepts of three kinds of activity:<ul class="greybulletlist">
					<li>awareness-raising activities</li>
					<li>skills-getting activities</li>
					<li>skills-using activities</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><a href="../teaching/task_types.html" target="_blank">The 
				guide to task types</a> focuses on specific task types and

					<li>information and information-gap tasks</li>
				</ul>
				</li>

			<p>Following those two guides carefully at the start of a CELTA 
			course will pay dividends because they help you to understand what 
			classroom tasks are for and how to select and design them to meet 
			objectives.</p>

			for.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Boards</strong> (black, white or even green)<br />
				<img alt="board" height="133" src="../../images/teacher_explain200.jpg" width="200" /><ol class="auto-style22">
					<li>are good for:<ol class="smallgreybulletlist">
						<li>emphasis and focus.&nbsp; Most learners will write 
						whatever you write on the board so make sure what you 
						write is relevant and important.</li>
						<li>short texts: anything longer than a sentence or two 
						should be projected or on a handout.</li>
						<li>organising learning and data: try to keep separate 
						parts of a board for separate ideas and use a consistent 
						colour-coding system so people know where to look for 
						what.</li>
						<li>building up ideas step by step: boards are useful 
						for leading people through a process because they can 
						hear and see how things slowly develop.</li>
						<li>learner input: because of their familiarity and 
						low-tech nature, boards are easy for nearly all learners 
						to use and that gives them some control and input in the 
						lesson.</li>

					</li>
					<li>are not good for:<ol class="smallgreybulletlist">

						Don't present texts this way.</li>

						is looking at the same thing at the same time.&nbsp; 
						Unlike paper-based materials which people can use as 
						they please and focus where they like, projected texts 
						and images oblige everyone to be looking at the same 
						thing as everyone else.</li>
						<li>presenting images: you can show people hand-held 
						images by walking around or giving everyone a copy but a 
						projected image is far more efficient and time 
						economical (and saves paper, time and ink).</li>
						<li>prepared materials: you can prepare your materials

						way, you reduce the load on yourself and can focus

					<p>Keep these three points in mind as you plan and teach.</p>
			
			<p>Whichever structure you have settled on for your lesson, the 
			following will apply.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Don't be a stranger!</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="smile" height="133" src="../../images/man_smile200.jpg" width="200" /><br />Smile, be approachable and start with something about yourself.&nbsp; 
				Make sure the learners know your name, where you come from and 
				something personally relevant to the lesson.&nbsp; What are
				<strong>your</strong> favourite hobbies and pastimes?</dd>
				<dt><strong>Be clear!</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="clear" height="133" src="../../images/clear_blue200.jpg" width="200" /><br />Make sure you use language which is comprehensible for these 
				learners as well as being concise and clear when you explain and 
				give instructions.&nbsp; Check that you have been understood.<br />Do not be tempted to think that pidgin English is easier to 
				understand than natural (though suitably slower) production.&nbsp; 
				It isn't:<br /><span class="style_black"><em>What do you enjoy doing at the 
				weekends?</em></span><br />is clearer and provides a better model than:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>What you like ... weekends ... 
				what you do?</em></span><br />Give clear, polite instructions 
				and do not be tempted to say something like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>Now what I would like you to do 
				is look at this text and see if you can find the verbs that the 
				speaker used on the video.</em></span><br />
				or<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now would you 
				like to see if you can find the verbs in this text that the 
				speaker used on the video?<br />
				</em></span>but prefer:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>Right, now look at this text, 
				please.&nbsp; Find the words the speaker used in the video.</em></span><br />
				For more, see
				the 
				guide to being clear (linked below).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Be orderly!</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="orderly" height="133" src="../../images/orderly200.jpg" width="200" /><br />All lessons need some form of introduction so that the learners 
				are aware of the topic and what they will achieve.&nbsp; An 
				introduction serves two purposes:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				a) it allows the students to engage with what will follow and 
				use their own resources to help in achieving the objectives.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				b) it does something called <strong>activating a <em>schema</em></strong> 
				(plural <em>schemata</em>) which means that the learners are 
				able to draw on their knowledge of the world to understand the 
				language.&nbsp; In our example, all the learners will be aware 
				of what things like <em>chess, judo, windsurfing</em> etc. are (but they may 
				not know how to say them in English) and all the learners will 
				be familiar with the idea of expressing to others what they like 
				and don't like.<br />You planned carefully bearing in mind the need to be logical and 
				purposeful in what you do.&nbsp; Don't suddenly depart from the 
				plan and bring in confusing and unnecessary stages.&nbsp; Each 
				stage should build on what came before.<br />Equally, if something is taking longer because the learners need 
				a bit more time to get it right, do not be afraid to allow that 
				time.&nbsp; If it's important, then the next stage will depend 
				on it.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Keep your eye on the clock!</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="clock" height="133" src="../../images/clock200.jpg" width="200" /><br />Nobody expects your timing to be perfect at this stage of the 
				course (or, probably, ever) but don't allow the time to slip by 
				when you should be getting on to the next stage.<br />Be firm, loud and assertive about stopping people or time limiting 
				tasks by saying, e.g.:<br /><span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK!&nbsp; That's fine.&nbsp; 
				Please stop now.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Right!&nbsp; Stop and we'll move on now.</em></span></dd>
				<dt><strong>Group learners appropriately</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="group" height="133" src="../../images/people_group_a200.jpg" width="200" /></dd>
				<dd>There is a guide to how 
				to do that on this site (linked below).&nbsp; Never be afraid to take the 
				time to make sure that the way people are sitting or standing 
				helps rather than hinders them.&nbsp; Sitting three or four in a 
				row, for example, does not allow people to discuss anything or 
				work together on a task.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Know where you should be and what you should be 
				doing</strong></dt>
				<dd>This sounds obvious enough but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are giving whole-class instructions, be where everyone 
				can see you and on your feet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you aren't needed, sit out and be still.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to discuss things and get your learners' 
				feedback, sit down and listen.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Handling error appropriately</strong></dt>
				<dd>You need to know now how you will react to the mistakes that 
				the learners will inevitably make.&nbsp; The behaviour to avoid 
				is simply saying something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No that's wrong and it should be ...<br />
				</em>There are many more useful and imaginative ways to handle 
				error in the classroom.&nbsp; If you would like to learn about 
				them, follow the link to correcting learners in the table of 
				related guides at the end.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Treat your learners with respect</strong></dt>
				<dd><strong>
				<img alt="respect" height="133" src="../../images/man_dog_bench200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				</strong>Obviously, but there are some messages you can send 
				unintentionally which may affect how learners feel and how they 
				think you feel about them.<br />
				Here are some things to avoid:<ul class="greybulletlist">
						<li><strong>not telling people what's going on</strong><br />
						at the beginning of your teaching slot, tell people what 
						they will be learning and why.&nbsp; If you don't do 
						this you disempower them and make them feel that they 
						are being led by the nose.&nbsp; Keep it simple and 
						clear, along the lines of:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>In this lesson you are going to 
						learn some important nouns and verbs to do with booking 
						a trip</em></span><br />
						If you are using a reading or listening text, tell 
						people what's it's about before you start.<br />
						See above on introducing lessons.</li>
						<li><strong>standing over people</strong><br />
						When you are talking one-to-one or to a small group of 
						learners, try not to stand if they are sitting.&nbsp; 
						Looking down on people diminishes them.&nbsp; Get a 
						chair and sit with them or squat or kneel by them.</li>
						<li><strong>distracting people</strong><br />
						If your role is purely monitoring and not getting 
						involved get behind people rather than standing in their 
						eye lines.<br />
						If you have set a time limit for an activity, don't 
						count down.&nbsp; Warning people once only that they 
						have, say, a minute left is fine.&nbsp; Anything else 
						distracts and frustrates.<br />
						If you want the class to read silently, watch a video 
						clip or listen to a recoding, sit still and be quiet.<br />
						Don't stand between people and what you want them to 
						look at.</li>
						<li><strong>relying on the stronger students</strong><br />
						It's tempting to use stronger or more outspoken learners 
						to do some of the work for you because they will usually 
						be able to answer your questions and provide instant 
						feedback.&nbsp; Doing this means you aren't giving all 
						the learners equal opportunities.&nbsp; Be patient and 
						encouraging with quieter and weaker students.&nbsp; It's 
						only fair.</li>
						<li><strong>pointing at people</strong><br />
						is aggressive and appears that way, whatever your 
						intention.&nbsp; Use names whenever you want to 
						nominate.&nbsp; If you can't remember or don't know a 
						learner's name, use an open-hand gesture which invites a 
						contribution rather than 
						pointing:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
							<tr>
								<td class="auto-style21"><strong>this:</strong></td>
								<td class="auto-style19"><strong>not this:</strong></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="auto-style20">
								<img alt="hand" height="83" src="../../images/hand_open125.jpg" width="125" /></td>
								<td>
								<img alt="point" height="83" src="../../images/finger_identify125.jpg" width="125" /></td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						</li>
						<li><strong>failing to value students' ideas</strong><br />
						No matter how short and activity or task has been, take 
						a moment to thank people for doing it and get some 
						feedback from it.&nbsp; The feedback you get may not be 
						important pedagogically but getting it values what 
						people have done.</li>
						<li><strong>using weasel words</strong><br />
						Learners value politeness and consideration but they 
						also want straight answers to straight questions.&nbsp; 
						Don't correct errors or answer questions with something 
						like:<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, that's not quite right 
						and I wouldn't say it that way</em></span><br />
						and prefer:<br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, 
						that's wrong.&nbsp; You need to say ...</em></span><br />
						You can do this politely and sensitively.&nbsp; One sign of 
						sensitivity and respect is telling people the truth.</li>
						<li><strong>rushing people</strong><br />
						People usually need time to think and this is especially 
						the case when working in a foreign language.&nbsp; Yes, 
						you know the answer but don't jump in with it.&nbsp; 
						It's called wait time and you should use it.<br />
						Do not give unnecessary or unrealistic time limits.<br />
						Ask before you clean things off the whiteboard.&nbsp; 
						People may still be trying to write it down.</li>
						<li><strong>asking the unanswerable</strong><br />
						Avoid asking questions such as:<br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do we call the thing we use to 
						close the door?</em></span><br />
						because, although you may be looking for the word <em>
						key</em>, your learner may be struggling to find the 
						word <em>bolt, handle </em>or<em> knob</em> in English.<br />
						Avoid, too:<br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does 
						</em>machine<em> mean?</em></span><br />
						because that's simple unanswerable for most learners 
						(and most speakers of the language).<br />
						If you show a picture of something to elicit some 
						vocabulary, make sure it's possible to do this from the 
						prompt.&nbsp; For example, showing this:<br />
						<img alt="village" height="166" src="../../images/street_village250.jpg" width="250" /><br />
						and asking:<br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's 
						this?</em></span><br />
						will elicit anything from:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A street<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A village<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some houses<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like my friend Maria</em><br />
						to a good deal more.&nbsp; Doing this simply increases 
						your learners' sense of helplessness because they cannot 
						know what it is you want.<br />
						However, showing, e.g.:<br />
						<img alt="chair" height="166" src="../../images/chair_road250.jpg" width="250" /><br />
						and asking:<br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's 
						this?</em></span><br />
						is unlikely to elicit anything but <em>chair</em>.<br />
						And asking:<br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's 
						strange about this?</em></span><br />
						is also likely to get only one sort of answer.</li>
						<li><strong>expecting too much</strong><br />
						If you are focused on grammar, try not to ask a question 
						like:<br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you put the verb conceal in a sentence?</em></span><br />
						because that involves too many thought processes (it may 
						be called cognitive overload).<br />
						Firstly, the learner needs to feel sure of the meaning 
						of the verb.<br />
						Secondly, the learner has to know a good deal about the 
						verb (whether it takes and object, whether it's regular 
						and so on).<br />
						Thirdly, the learner needs to produce a suitable subject 
						for the verb.<br />
						Fourthly, the learner has to invent a plausible sentence 
						using the verb.<br />
						If you do this kind of thing, do not be too surprised if 
						a learner suggests:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog concealed from the cat.</em><br />
						(especially if you have been unwise enough to suggest 
						that <em>conceal</em> is a synonym for <em>hide</em>).</li>
						<li><strong>guessing when you don't know</strong><br />
						You are not an experienced teacher.&nbsp; You know this, 
						your tutors know this and, importantly, the learners 
						know this.<br />
						If you are asked a question such as:<br />
						<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the difference between
						</em><span class="style_black">I used to go</span> <em>
						and </em><span class="style_black">I would go</span><em>?</em><br />
						do not be afraid to say<br />
						<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not 
						sure.&nbsp; I'll check it and get back to you</em></span><br />
						because that's better than telling someone something 
						that isn't true.</li>
					</ul>
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Use instruction- and concept-checking questions</strong></dt>
				<dd>You are going to hear a lot about these on a CELTA course 
				and many people struggle to get the hang of them.<br />
				Instruction-checking questions are essential to make sure that 
				people understand what they have to do and how they have to do 
				it.<br />
				Concept-checking questions are essential to making sure people 
				have grasped the essence of what you are teaching before you 
				dare move on.<br />
				There is a dedicated guide on this site to what they are, how to 
				write them and how to use them, linked below.&nbsp; It will 
				repay half an hour of your time.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Forget the notes</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="no notes" src="../../images/talk_man_bw200.jpg" /><br />There is a temptation for all teachers when they are being 
				observed to rely on a blow-by-blow lesson plan to which they can 
				refer as the lesson goes on.<br />Most people will have a set of brief notes (not the full plan) 
			available as a reassurance.&nbsp; Try not to need it.<br />There are five good reasons for avoiding this:<ol>
					<li>It distracts you.</li>
					<li>It encumbers you with a piece of paper in your 
				hand or it means you have to keep returning to your desk / table 
				to check the notes.</li>
					<li>It gives the impression that you are reading from a script 
				and that reduces your learners' confidence.&nbsp; Learners 
				expect their teachers to be knowledgeable and constantly 
				referring to notes creates a credibility gap.</li>
					<li>It implies that you haven't properly prepared and thought 
				through the plan.</li>
					<li>While you are checking your lesson plan notes, you lose 
				contact with the class and you can't see what's happening.</li>
				</ol>
				You need to learn to think of your lesson as a narrative and be 
				able to remember exactly what to do and when to do it.<br />Here's how to do that by visualising the lesson:<br />
				<img alt="visualise" height="133" src="../../images/woman_visualise200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				<ol>
					<li>Sit down with your plan and read through the procedure.&nbsp; 
				Then put it out of sight and see if you can recite the stages of 
				the lesson and what happens at each stage.&nbsp; Think of it as a 
				narrative rather than a set of stages and it'll be easier to 
				recall the sequence of events.<br />If you can't, read and re-read the procedure until you can do 
			this easily.</li>
					<li>Now, shut your eyes and imagine what you will say.&nbsp; 
					Think about:<ul class="smallgreybulletlist">
						<li>how you will begin</li>
						<li>how you will set the scene</li>
						<li>how you will present your target</li>
						<li>what examples you will give</li>
						<li>how you will start the first activity</li>
						<li>how you will stop the activity</li>
						<li>how you will get and give feedback</li>
						<li>how you will signal that activities are finished and 
						you are moving on</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Now, find somewhere comfortable to sit or lie and, with 
					your eyes closed, visualise the whole lesson from start to 
					finish.&nbsp; In particular focus on:<ol class="smallgreybulletlist">
						<li>what you will say</li>
						<li>where you will be in the room</li>
						<li>what you will be doing</li>
						<li>what the learners will be doing</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>

				a 
				fuller version of this little activity (link below) in the 
				Delta section of this site.&nbsp; Whether you are doing CELTA, 
				Delta or no course at all the principles are the same.<br />There is also
