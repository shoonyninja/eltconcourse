		&nbsp;<p>The University of Cambridge sets out the requirements for what 
		is in a CELTA lesson plan in the syllabus document (section 4.2 on page 
		10).<br />
		The sections are:</p>
		<ul class="bluebullet">
							<li>a statement of aims</li>
							<li>a class profile</li>
							<li>anticipation of difficulties and suggested 
							solutions</li>
							<li>description of teacher and learner interactions</li>
							<li>details of resources to be used</li>
							<li>staged description of procedures including 
							anticipated timings</li>
						</ul>
						<p>We will follow that and suggest what should go into 
						each section although this guide considers the class 
						profile first because that is where planning should 
						begin &ndash; with the learners.&nbsp; You cannot 
						sensibly set aims without considering the needs and 
						level of the learners.</p>

				<img alt="learners" height="133" src="../../images/learners_group_a200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style22">
				<h2>The learners</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>All plans start with a consideration of the learners, their needs, 
		their learning preferences and their interests.<br />
		The key question to ask is</p>
		<p><span class="style_black"><em><strong>What do I need to tell the observer to make 
		it clear that I am considering the learners from the outset of my 
		planning?</strong></em></span></p>
		<p>On most CELTA courses classes are shared and all the trainees will 
		teach the same classes.<br />
		Do not, however, rely on other people's perceptions (but draw on them).&nbsp; 
		It is <strong>your</strong> 
		view and <strong>your</strong> response to the group that is most 
		important.<br />
		It is here that you demonstrate your familiarity with the group and the 
		fact that there are some commonalities to bear in mind when planning for 
		them.&nbsp; Here's how to do that.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Nationalities and first languages: make a list and highlight any 
			learners who are the only representatives of a nationality or first 
			language group in the class.</li>
			<li>Level: note here who are the weakest and strongest members of 
			the group.&nbsp; No classes are completely homogenous.</li>
			<li>Why are they learning English?&nbsp; For work, for leisure, for 
			study etc.?<br />
			If you know what the learners need to do with their English, you are 
			well placed to target skills and language they need (and know they 
			need) and that will help the learners to engage with your teaching 
			aims.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Here's an example:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style45" style="width: 90%">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 110px">The learners:</td>
				<td class="auto-style44">There are usually between 8 and 12 
				learners in this group and most of them are speakers of French, 
				German and Italian as a first language.&nbsp; They come from 
				Ivory Coast, France, Austria and Switzerland.<br />
				There is one learner, Abdullah, who is the only Arabic speaker 
				(from Jordan) in the group and he struggles to read and write in 
				English but has good oral /aural skills.<br />
				Jean-Paul has a slight hearing impairment so I will make sure 
				that I am close to him and face him when I am giving key 
				instructions and explanations.<br />
				The strongest learners are Marie, Franz and Jean-Paul; the 
				weakest overall are Claudia, Lara and Abdullah (but see above).<br />
				All the learners are living in the UK and need language skills 
				for work and socialising.<br />
				This lesson on making arrangements will be relevant to them all, 
				therefore.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>That's enough.&nbsp; There is no need, unless the group is very unusual, 
		to say more here.<br />
		There may be an unusual item worth adding to the 
		list.&nbsp; For example, if the group is particularly heterogeneous, has 
		split aims and so on.&nbsp; Before you write something about this, ask 
		yourself if it's really relevant to your lesson.&nbsp; If it isn't, 
		leave it out.</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="aims" height="133" src="../../images/aim_archer200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style22">
				<h2>Aims and objectives</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Depending on the centre at which you are taking CELTA, you may be 
		asked to distinguish between Aims and Learning Objectives.<br />
		Usually the difference is explained as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>An Aim</strong> is what you hope to teach but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>An Objective</strong> is what the learners will be 
		able to do at the end that they couldn't do at the beginning.</p>
		<p>There are two important things to bear in mind:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Aims and Objectives should be clear.<ol class="auto-style46">
				<li>Don't say:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>I hope the learners will be 
				better at grammar</em></span></li>
				<li>Do say:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black"><em>By the end of the lesson the 
				learners will be better able to use the present progressive form 
				to talk about arrangement that exist in the present but apply to 
				the future.</em></span></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Aims and Objectives should be achievable<ol class="auto-style46">
				<li>At the beginning of a course, in particular, you will only 
				be teaching for short periods so tailor your aims to what you 
				and the learners can achieve in the time available.</li>
				<li>Bear the level in mind.<br />
				If, for example, you want to focus on a form such as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I have been running around all day and am exhausted</em><br />
				ask yourself if the learners can deal with the forms of the verb
				<em>have</em> and the past participle of <em>be</em> as well as 
				forming the -<em>ing</em> form of the verb correctly.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>There 
		is a critical difference between an Aim and a Procedure.<br />
		The following are Aims and Objectives:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>At the end of the lesson, the learners will be better able to 
			pronounce the following items: hairdresser, confectioner, library, 
			sports centre, cinema, multi-storey car park and stress the words 
			correctly. </li>
			<li>The learners will be able to understand, use appropriately and 
			pronounce the following 10 lexemes ...</li>
			<li>Students will have gained a better understanding of the nature 
			of verbs followed by gerunds and infinitives and be able to use them 
			confidently</li>
		</ol>
		<p>These, however, are Procedures and refer to what you and the learners 
		will do, not what will be achieved:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Students will exchange ideas about sports and pastimes</li>
			<li>The class will practise making question forms with conditional 
			sentences</li>
			<li>The students will mingle to find someone who has selected the 
			same three adjectives to describe their families</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Try not to mix them up!</p>
		<p>Here an example of this part of the plan:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style45" style="width: 90%">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 110px">Aims and 
				Objectives:</td>
				<td class="auto-style44">
				<ol>
					<li>Grammar: by the end of the lesson, the learners will be 
					confident in forming the present progressive and time 
					adverbials such as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm having lunch with my mother then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'll be working at home on Sunday</em><br />
					with the associated contractions.</li>
					<li>Pronunciation: by the end of the lesson, the learners 
					will be better able to pronounce the verbs including:<br />
					<em>working</em> (/ˈwɜːk.ɪŋ/), <em>having</em> (/ˈhæv.ɪŋ/),
					<em>visiting</em> (/ˈvɪ.zɪt.ɪŋ/), <em>shopping</em> (/ˈʃɒp.ɪŋ/),
					<em>watching</em> (/ˈwɒtʃ.ɪŋ/), <em>travelling</em> (/ˈtræ.vəl.ɪŋ/)<br />
					(You do not have to use the transcriptions but it will 
					impress your tutors if you can!)</li>
					<li>Meaning: by the end of the lesson the learners will have 
					grasped the concept of a present progressive form being used 
					to talk about current arrangement for the future.</li>
				</ol>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br />
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="problem and solution" height="133" src="../../images/problem_xword200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style22">
				<h2>Difficulties and solutions</h2>
				<p class="auto-style47"><em>Life is what happens while you are

				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>In this part of the plan you need to think about what problems might 
		arise and how you will deal with them.<br />
		<strong>Problems</strong> can be of three main sorts and you should 
		think about all of them:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Problems with the language or skill you are teaching.<br />
			Some language items and some subskills are intrinsically difficult 
			to learn and use.&nbsp; For example, pronouncing a word like <em>
			hairdresser </em>is difficult because of the sound at the beginning, 
			the silence of the final 'r' and remembering to get the stress on 
			the first syllable (/ˈheə.dre.sə/).<br />
			Some structures, such as <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He should have been more careful</em><br />
			are hard to form because of the two auxiliary verbs (<em>should</em> 
			and <em>have</em>).<br />
			Some meanings are difficult to grasp such as the future reference of 
			a past form as in, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>If you asked him, he might help</em></li>
			<li>Problems with equipment and materials:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What, for example, can go wrong with your laptop or the data 
			projector?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will you do if you have handouts for 12 learners but 14 
			turn up?</li>
			<li>Problems with topics or activities.&nbsp; (These are generally 
			referred to as <strong>affective</strong> issues.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anything in the topic that might embarrass or offend 
			some learners?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which students are very shy and don't like taking part in 
			speaking activities?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will you do if the students simply find a task too 
			difficult or too easy?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Solutions need to be precise not generalised so for example<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I will explain</em><br />
		or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I will deal with it</em><br />
		or<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will provide more practice</em><br />
		are not solutions at all but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I will spend a little longer on the drilling phases so 
		the learners gain confidence and skill stressing the words correctly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also mark the stress clearly on the board like this:
		</em><strong><em>HAIR</em></strong><em>dresser</em><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have back-up paper copies of the task<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learners can share the handout and I'll make copies for those 
		who need them at the end</em><br />
		are all proper solutions.</p>
		<p>Here's an example of this part of a plan:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style45" style="width: 90%">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style44" style="width: 110px" rowspan="4">Problems and solutions:</td>

				the weaker students</td>

					<h2>The planning paradox</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>While there are many good reasons to have a plan, there are 
			also ways in which a plan can actually get in the way of responding 
			to your learners.&nbsp; This calls for a little flexibility.</p>
		<p>A map is not the territory.&nbsp; Do not confuse the model (your 
		plan) with the reality (your lesson).</p>
		<p>While both focus and variety can be planned, flexibility, by 
		definition, cannot.&nbsp; What the teacher does when things do not go 
		according to plan is just as important as knowing what to put in the 
		plan in the first place.<br />
		However good the plan, and however carefully you have thought about your 
		learners, their needs and their preferences, something will arise in 
		almost all lessons which was not predicted in your plan.</p>
			<p>It may, for example, turn out that the learners' mastery of a 
			language item which you had assumed is not as secure as it needs to be.&nbsp; This may 
			require quite a serious diversion from your plan if the lesson 
			depends on their knowing how to handle the language in question.<br />
			It may also be the case, on the other hand, that the learners are 
			already aware of and can handle some of the targets of the lesson.&nbsp; 
			If that occurs, you would be very unwise to continue with the 
			teaching procedures you had planned for these targets.</p>
			<p>The moral of all this is: <strong>Teach the learners, not the 
			plan</strong>.</p>
