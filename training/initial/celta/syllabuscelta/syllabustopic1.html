			<p class="masterheader">Culture can be defined as:</p>
			<p class="auto-style8">the ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a 
			particular people or society</p>
			<p>The first obvious problem is to define what is meant by 'people' 
			and 'society', of course, but most will equate these in some way 
			with nationality for the purposes of English language teaching.&nbsp; 
			The term is still, however, rather slippery because we talk of the 
			culture of nations and also of parts of nations: <em>German culture, 
			American culture, the culture in the north of England, European 
			culture </em>and so on.</p>
			<p>The second obvious problem is that we need to be careful to avoid 
			national stereotyping.&nbsp; Talk of someone being
			<em>typically French, typically Chinese, typically Asian</em> and so 
			on is easy but all of these sorts of stereotypes are fraught 
			with danger:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Very few people actually consider 
				themselves to be typical of their own culture.&nbsp; Do you?</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">China is a nation of more than 1.3 
				billion people speaking at least 12 distinct languages and 
				including a huge amount of cultural variety.&nbsp; There can be 
				no talk of <em>Chinese culture, </em>therefore.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Asia is even more of a uselessly loose term.&nbsp; 
				That means everyone from Siberia to Sri Lanka, Turkey to Taiwan 
				and Japan to Jakarta  â€“ over 50 countries and 4 billion people.&nbsp; 
				To speak of <em>Asian culture</em> is plain silly.</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Talk of cultural stereotypes can lead 
				quickly to value judgements which have no place in our 
				profession.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We need, therefore, to identify what parts of which cultures we 
			need to consider in the English-language learning setting.</p>

				<dt><strong>Educational culture</strong></dt>
				<dd>Schools operate very differently in different cultures.<br />
				In some, discipline is harsh, independent thought is not 
				encouraged and rote learning of facts is the norm.<br />
				In others, discipline is lax, the relationships between teachers 
				and students are informal and facts are less important than the 
				acquisition of thinking and learning skills.<br />
				Even were it possible, this is no place to try to list which 
				cultures embody which characteristics but it is important to be 
				aware of what sorts of educational backgrounds your learners 
				have.<br />
				It is also important to recognise that:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) educational norms exist on a cline from lax to harsh, 
				informal to formal and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) that even within cultures schools and teachers vary 
				widely.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Power relationships, risk taking and fear of losing 
				face</strong></dt>
				<dd>In some cultures, such as Scandinavian countries, Britain 
				and the USA, power relationships are narrow and people will be 
				unafraid to criticise teachers, question them and demand 
				answers.&nbsp; In these cultures, too, risk taking is more 
				prevalent so learners will be more likely to have a stab at 
				language and be less afraid of making errors.<br />
				In other cultures, notably, Pacific rim nations, Greece and 
				South America power distances are larger and risk taking is less 
				common so people from those cultures are less likely to 
				criticise others or ask questions and more likely to avoid just 
				having a go at language until they are sure they have it right.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Collectivism vs. Individualism</strong></dt>
				<dd>In so-called collectivist societies, people define 
				themselves by their social roles: <em>I'm a father, the youngest 
				daughter, a doctor </em>etc.<br />
				In individualistic societies, people are more likely to define 
				themselves by reference to their personalities: <em>I'm a 
				patient, tolerant person, I'm a hard-working, perfectionist </em>
				etc.<br />
				There are some implications including:<br />
				Those from highly individualistic cultures will<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; often be happy to express their views openly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; often be happy to accept newcomers in a group and judge them 
				on their merits<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; view task completion as important<br />
				Those from highly collectivist cultures will<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be less happy to express an opinion and prefer to wait until 
				a consensus is reached<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be less happy to welcome newcomers and will judge them on 
				their backgrounds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prefer to focus on reaching a consensus together and focus on 
				their relations within their groups.</dd>
				<dt>There are two short articles on this site looking at 
				cultural types:</dt>
				<dd>
					<a href="../../../../articles/articles1/ELT_Concourse_Crossing_Cultures_1.pdf" target="_blank">
				Power Distance and Uncertainty Avoidance</a> and
					<a href="../../../../articles/articles1/ELT_Concourse_Crossing_Cultures_2.pdf" target="_blank">
				Collectivism vs. Individualism</a></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>It bears repeating that:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist">People as individuals often behave 
				outside their cultural norms</li>
				<li class="redbulletlist">Even defining what constitutes <em>
				culture</em> is perilous</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Linguistic backgrounds</h3>
			<p>As a rough estimate, some 35% to 50% of all errors made by adult 
			learners are traceable to the influences of their first language(s).</p>

				<dt><strong>Grammar</strong></dt>
				<dd>If an adult doesn't know how a particular structure works in 
				English he or she is likely to assume that it will be the same 
				as in the first language.&nbsp; Here are some examples of the 
				kinds of error one might encounter based on the learners' first 
				languages (the use of the '*' is the conventional way to 
				identify something wrong, by the way):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*I have arrived yesterday</em> (speakers of almost all 
				other European languages and many beyond Europe)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*Because it was raining so I took an umbrella</em> 
				(speakers of most Chinese languages)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*I looked up it in the dictionary</em> (speakers of 
				Romance languages like Italian, French and Spanish)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*It is wonderfuller</em> (speakers of Germanic languages 
				such as German, Dutch and some Scandinavian languages)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*Tourist industry is important my country</em> (speakers 
				of languages such as Turkish or Japanese which have very 
				different [or no] article and preposition systems)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Lexis</strong></dt>
				<dd>Learners are less likely to transfer a word from 
				their first language into English because we all know that it 
				doesn't usually work.&nbsp; However, if a word <strong>looks 
				like</strong> the same word in both languages, learners will be 
				tempted to think that it <strong>means</strong> the same in both 
				languages [it's called a false friend].&nbsp; Examples include:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*Don't get upset.&nbsp; You are too sensible </em>(in 
				many languages, the meanings of <em>sensible</em> and <em>
				sensitive</em> are reversed)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*I had a cup of coffee at a snack</em> (Japanese 
				speakers [<em>snack = snack bar</em>])<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*Write it in your note</em> (Korean speakers [<em>note</em> 
				= <em>notebook</em>]<em>)<br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*He may eventually come</em> (in 
				many languages, <em>eventually</em> means <em>possibly</em>)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Pronunciation</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is the most obvious area.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				Pronouncing <em>ship</em> as <em>sheep</em> is common to many 
				speakers of languages which don't have a short 'i' sound such as 
				Greek and Italian<br />
				Pronouncing 'th' as 's', 'z' or 'f' is common to a range of 
				learners</dd>

				<dt><strong>For pleasure and leisure</strong></dt>
				<dd>Believe it or not, some people actually enjoy learning 
				another language and get a buzz from speaking it.&nbsp; They may 
				also feel they need it because it is the No 1 international 
				means of communication around the world.&nbsp; Most people will 
				have trouble travelling widely without at least some competence 
				in English.</dd>
				<dt><strong>For study</strong></dt>
				<dd>Many learners aspire to study in an English-speaking college 
				or university.<br />
				There are also many higher education institutions outside 
				English-speaking countries that nevertheless use English as the 
				medium of instruction. These learners are said to be studying 
				for English for Academic Purposes (or EAP).</dd>
				<dt><strong>For work</strong></dt>
				<dd>A basic or even quite advanced knowledge of English is often 
				a requirement for work in many countries.&nbsp; People in this 
				category are often described as learning English for Special 
				Purposes (ESP).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Because it is necessary in our world</strong></dt>
				<dd>The British Council reckons that:<br />
				English is the main language of books, newspapers, airports and 
				air-traffic control, international business and academic 
				conferences, science, technology, diplomacy, sport, 
				international competitions, pop music and advertising<br />
				over two-thirds of the world's scientists read in English<br />
				three quarters of the world's mail is written in English<br />
				eighty per cent of the world's electronically stored information 
				is in English<br />
				of the estimated 200 million users of the Internet, some 
				thirty-six per cent communicate in English</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>There are four basic forms of motivation:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Intrinsic</strong></dt>
				<dd>I.e., that which comes from inside the learner.&nbsp; People 
				who enjoy learning and speaking English for its own sake fall 
				into this category.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Extrinsic</strong></dt>
				<dd>I.e., that which comes from outside the learner.&nbsp; 
				People who need English for work will fall into this category.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Instrumental</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is often considered a form of extrinsic motivation and 
				refers to people learning the language to do something else, 
				e.g., a person learning English to read books or fit in with a 
				culture.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Integrative</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is also often classed as a form of extrinsic motivation 
				(and sometimes not) and refers to the need to learn a language 
				to integrate into a society.<br />
				It applies to immigrants (who are sometimes referred to as ESOL 
				students (English as a Second or Other Language)) but also to 
				people living, studying or working in a country for a short 
				time.<br />
				It may also refer to people who want to integrate into 
				businesses and large multi-national corporations who use English 
				as the internal language, whatever countries they operate in.&nbsp; 
				There are lots of those.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Rather obviously, the more you know about your learners' reasons 
			for learning, the better able you are to plan accordingly.&nbsp; The 
			CELTA course will assess your ability to do this.</p>
			<p>There is a lot more technical stuff on this site about this area

			<p>The argument here is that people have unique mixes of learning 
			styles and that teachers should match their approaches and the tasks 
			they set to take advantage of (or at least accommodate) the various 
			styles and preferences of their students.&nbsp; There are those who 
			doubt the validity of all this so tread carefully.</p>
			<p>There is
			<a href="../../../inservice/background/learning_styles_culture.html" target="_blank">
			a guide to learning styles</a> on this site and also
			<a href="../../../../articles/articles1/ELT_Concourse_The_myth_of_the_learning_style.pdf" target="_blank">
			an article attempting to debunk the area</a>.<br />
			From 2018, the CELTA syllabus has been revised in the light of 
			criticisms of learning-style theories and the word <em>styles</em> 
			has been expunged from the CELTA syllabus to be replaced by <em>
			learning preferences</em>.</p>
			<p>If your tutors are in the learning styles camp (as Cambridge 
			English seemed to be until quite recently), you may be well advised to go along with them, 
			whatever your personal view and make it clear in lesson plans and 
			elsewhere (particularly the written assignment focusing on the 
			learner) that you are aware of the learning styles of the people you 
			are teaching and, incidentally, of your own style.</p>
			<p>There is little doubt that learners do have preferences for how 
			they are taught and much of that may stem from their educational 
			backgrounds and experiences (see above).&nbsp; You'd be foolish not 
			to take preferences into account, of course.</p>

			of English</a> on this site.</p>
			<p>Additionally, there is
			<a href="../../../common/spelling.html" target="_blank">a 
			guide to English spelling</a> which covers some of the main 
			differences between British English (BrE, conventionally) and 
			American English (AmE, conventionally).<br />
			There is also 
			<a href="../../../../questions/answers/ELT_Concourse_BrE_AmE.pdf" target="_blank">
			an answer to a question concerning differences in grammar between 
			British and American English</a>.<br />
			If you follow those guides, you will know all you need to know for 
			the purposes of CELTA.</p>
			<p>Then you need to make sure that you consider which variety of 
			English you should be using in your teaching.</p>
			<p>There's no suggestion here that one variety is somehow 'better' 
			than another and, in fact, the amendments to the CELTA for April 
			2018 make it clear that the focus is on
			<span class="style_underline">varieties</span> rather than the 
			old-fashioned standard vs. non-standard variation.<br />
			It is a matter of appropriacy and an 
			understanding of where and with whom your learners will use English.&nbsp; 
			If, for example, your learners are only going to use English to 
			communicate with people from India then teaching Indian Standard 
			forms and pronunciation is entirely appropriate but in other 
			circumstances, for example, if your learners need English as an 
			international language, teaching regionally-specific forms, words 
			and pronunciation will be harmful to them.</p>
			<p>Finally, you need to think about your dialect (yes, everyone has 
			a dialect) and decide whether using dialect forms in the 
			classroom is acceptable in your setting.<br />
			As the conclusion to the guide to varieties of English points out, 
			there are implications for us as classroom practitioners:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>We should avoid (or at least be careful about) teaching 
			regionally specific language.</li>
			<li>We should know what our learners need English for.&nbsp; 
			Occupational and topic registers are important here.</li>
			<li>We should use language in the classroom which is not heavily 
			influenced by our own dialect and accent.&nbsp; If that means 
			learning to speak without such influences, so be it.</li>
			<li>We should avoid teaching language which is confined to specific 
			class- or topic-influenced settings.&nbsp; If that means cautioning 
			students not to use non-standard grammar such as <em>gonna</em> or
			<em>ain't</em>, so be it.</li>
			<li>We should expose our students to the main Englishes they are 
			likely to encounter outside our classrooms.</li>
			<li>We should be careful about the kinds of materials we use in 
			class.&nbsp; If a song or other authentic text contains instances of 
			non-standard or regionally-influenced grammar or lexis we should 
			consider whether we <strong>should</strong> be using it and if need 
			be warn the learners not to use it as a model.</li>

			</table>
			<p>You may be surprised to learn that monolingualism (the ability 
			only to speak one language) is actually rather unusual.&nbsp; The 
			majority of people and the majority of countries speak more than one 
			language.&nbsp; For a full list of languages spoken in most of the 
			world's countries, try
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilingual_countries_and_regions" target="_blank">
			the Wikipedia article</a>.<br />
			Britain is slightly unusual, in fact, in not having an official 
			language at all and is home to speakers of hundreds of other 
			languages as well as the indigenous ones.<br />
			Most of Africa is multilingual and the same can be said of Asia 
			(with certain exceptions, such as Japan).</p>
			<p>When it comes to the role first languages play in learning 
			English, something has been said above but there are two concepts 
			that are helpful in talking about this area:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>First language interference</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to the way in which a learner's first language(s) can 
				negatively affect the learning and use of English, e.g., by 
				leading to grammatical, lexical or phonological errors.</dd>
				<dt><strong>First language facilitation</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to the way in which a learner's first language can 
				actually help in learning English because of parallels in 
				structure or vocabulary.<br />
				For example, there are many more words in German and English 
				which both look similar and mean the same things than there are 
				false friends and the same applies to many Romance languages such 
				as French and Spanish.&nbsp; Clearly, the less closely related 
				languages are, the less facilitation there can be.<br />
				Equally, e.g., if a learner from Japan already speaks another European 
				language then she will find it easier to acquire English and <em>
				vice versa</em>.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Many of the language analysis guides on this site make reference 
			to the learners' first language(s).&nbsp; In particular, a good 
			example is in the consideration of word order.<br />
			Word order is an area in which the influence of people's first 
			language(s) can be most striking and leads to errors such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>*The vase most beautiful</em> (by 
				a speaker whose first language routinely puts the adjective 
				after the noun, e.g., French)</li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>*She walked the road along</em> 
				(by a speaker whose first language routinely uses postpositions 
				rather than prepositions, e.g., Turkish)</li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>*This is the house of Mary</em> 
				(by a speaker whose first language routinely places possessive 
				structures after the noun, e.g., Spanish)</li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>*She walks often to the shop</em> 
				(by a speaker whose first language routinely places adverbs of 
				frequency after the main verb, e.g., German)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.</p>

			<a href="../../../inservice/phrases_clauses_sentences/word_order.html" target="_blank">
			the guide to word order</a> or guides in
			<a href="../../../inservice/inserviceindex.html" target="_blank">the 
			in-service section</a> of the site which more consistently consider 
			questions of other language structures (<a href="../../../inservice/teaching/articles_teaching.html" target="_blank">the
