			<p>Most of the areas in this topic are covered in practice rather 
			than theory by people more experienced than you watching your 
			teaching and giving you helpful criticism, advice and training.&nbsp; 
			That can't satisfactorily be done on line and is one of the reasons 
			<strong>no fully 
			on-line courses are proper teaching qualifications</strong>, of course.<br />
			Sooner or later, somebody has to see you teach.</p>
			<p>The following assumes that you are about to start a CELTA course 
			or are following one right now (in which case, it is slightly 
			surprising you have time to read this).<br />
			It also assumes that you are not an experienced teacher of 
			languages.&nbsp; You may have experience of teaching other subjects 
			but that doesn't really count.</p>
			<p>This is a crucial area and a long guide.&nbsp; If you are actually doing a CELTA 
			course, you'll need to be selective.&nbsp; If you are preparing for 
			one, take it a bit at a time.<br />
			Use it in two ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Before you start a CELTA course.&nbsp; This will prepare you 
				well and may even help you avoid common pitfalls (or at least 
				recognise which one you've dropped into).</li>
				<li>On a CELTA course.&nbsp; If you have been criticised for 
				failing to meet one or more criteria, this is a good place to 
				come to see what went wrong and put it right now.&nbsp; For 
				that, pick your area.</li>
			</ol>

			</table>
			<p>If you are taking a CELTA course, you will normally be teaching 
			students who have volunteered for free lessons (or pay very little 
			for them).&nbsp; They will, almost by definition, be adults and be 
			motivated and cooperative.&nbsp; Discipline and control will not 
			usually be an issue although you may have one or two difficult 
			people to deal with from time to time, usually the silent and 
			reticent or the enthusiastic and dominant.&nbsp; The advice above 
			will help you deal with them.</p>
			<p>In the real world after the CELTA course, you may well find 
			yourself teaching children or the dreaded teenagers and that will 
			present other challenges.<br />
			The mistake lots of novice teachers make, especially when they 
			are teaching children or young adults, is to veer too much to one 
			end or the other of the cline from chum to dictator.&nbsp; There are 
			three issues:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You need to keep some professional distance 
				but still engender a trusting and open relationship.</li>
				<li>The atmosphere should be serious but not earnest.</li>
				<li>The classroom should be a place where learners are 
				comfortable taking risks.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>How can you try to ensure that these three things happen?<br />
					Think for a little while, make a few notes in each area and 
					then
					<a href="#3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'list1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">click here</a>.</p>
			<ol id="list1" style="visibility:hidden" class="style_brown">
				<li><strong>Keeping your distance but remaining approachable</strong>:<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>Wear clothes which are appropriate in the culture in 
					which you are operating.</li>
					<li>Use and require appropriate forms of address.<br />
					In most classes for adults first-name addresses are 
					invariably used.<br />
					Children do not usually respond well to the use of first 
					names (it confuses them) and teenagers get bewildered if 
					their teachers vary too much.<br />
					If your younger learners use your surname and you use their 
					first names, you have already established a measure of 
					control.</li>
					<li>Set some rules.<br />
					In classes for adults, interruption and contribution is 
					generally acceptable because adults (most of them) have 
					learned when it is appropriate to interrupt and ask for 
					clarification or information and when it isn't.<br />
					Many children and teenagers have a shaky grasp of the rules 
					so you need to set them out.<br />
					An effective way to do this is to devote a lesson at the 
					beginning to writing out a kind of classroom conduct 
					contract covering issues like listening, interrupting, being 
					respectful, using mobile phones, eating, drinking and so on.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Getting the atmosphere right</strong>:<ol class="auto-style4">
					<li>Your demeanour will often set the tone.&nbsp; If you 
					remain serious, well organised and friendly, that will help 
					a lot.</li>
					<li>Don't be boring.&nbsp; Make sure you inject a little 
					humour into what you say and present.&nbsp; There is no 
					reason why a text has to be earnest or a presentation dull.&nbsp; 
					Getting a joke in a foreign language is very satisfying, by 
					the way.</li>
					<li>Value people's contributions by thanking them or 
					following them up.</li>
					<li>Respond to <strong>what</strong> your learners say as 
					well as <strong>how</strong> they say it.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Taking risks willingly</strong>:<ol class="auto-style4">

					This is the overview:<br />

					Some schools and institutions will use the lettering codes 
					and some will use the words.&nbsp; The same applies to

					<a name="4"></a>In the trade, this is known as

					different levels of ability.&nbsp; Most of the volunteer 
					groups of students you will be teaching on a CELTA course 
					will be heterogeneous in some respect (in fact, of course, 
					nearly <strong>all</strong> groups of learners are).<br />
					After a little while on the course, you will be able to 
					identify the strongest and weakest students in the class and 
					be able to plan tasks accordingly.&nbsp; How you group 
					learners is something you should consider carefully.<br />
					There are two ways to group learners in this respect:<ol>
						<li>Make groups of strong learners and groups of weak 
						learners separately</li>
						<li>Mix strong and weak learners in the same groups</li>
					</ol>
