			<p>It's not hard to figure out that most learners need to be able to 
			read, write, understand and speak English.<br />
			Different learners, however, have differing priorities.<br />
			If you are learning a language primarily to fit into the society in 
			which it is spoken then all four skills will be important: you need 
			to understand what you read and hear as well as respond to it either 
			orally or in writing.<br />
			However, if you have other reasons for learning the language, the 
			mix may be different.</p>

			<p>It's not a simple as that, of course, because we rarely speak 
			without listening (although some of us do) and we often respond to 
			what we read in writing.&nbsp; Most of the time, then, skills are 
			combined and operate together.<br />
			There are, however, times when we only use one skill at a time: 
			reading a book, writing a website, listening to the radio or TV, 
			speaking to an answering machine or giving a presentation.</p>

			<p>A listener or reader may not seem to be doing much but that

			<p>There are, however, some clear differences between listening and 
			reading.</p>

			<p>If you are unclear about what is meant by some terms, don't worry 
			now.&nbsp; The individual guides to the skills will make things 
			clear.</p>
			<h4>Two key terms:</h4>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>gist listening or reading</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to getting the main message.&nbsp; That may be enough 
				in a lot of cases.</dd>
				<dt><strong>intensive listening or reading</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to getting the details clear. That may be essential 
				if you are listening to a train announcement or reading 
				instructions for operating a chain saw.</dd>
			</dl>
			<h4>Receptive strategies</h4>
			<p>When we listen or read, two processes happen simultaneously.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first of these is what is called <strong>bottom-up 
				processing</strong><br />
				We try to decode what we see or hear using our knowledge of the 
				grammar, lexis and phonology of English.<br />
				When reading we decode the letter or chunks of letters and 
				words, match them to the vocabulary store we have (our lexicon) 
				and then figure out what the grammar is telling us about the 
				meaning.<br />
				When listening, we do much the same thing but here we are trying 
				to divide the stream of noise into recognisable sections (words 
				and phrases) and then matching these with our lexicon.&nbsp; At 
				the same time, we are listening to how things are said so we can 
				get an idea of the speaker's attitude.<br />
				<strong>Redundancy</strong><br />This is another key concept.<br />We can't usually understand everything we hear or read and we 
				don't need to.&nbsp; Our eyes can skip sections of text and we 
				can miss large amounts of what a speaker says and still follow 
				the message.<br />For example, it isn't difficult to understand these:<br />
				<br />
				<img alt="half" height="17" src="../images/halftheletters.png" width="400" /><br />
				<br />
				<img alt="half" height="42" src="../images/halfyouhear.png" width="400" /><br />and in a sentence like<br />
				<em>John is going to London early tomorrow morning</em><br />there are bits of grammatical and lexical redundancy, too.<br />We don't need the '<em>is</em>' because we have said '<em>John</em>' 
				and that's enough to tell us that it's the third person.&nbsp; 
				We don't need the '-<em>ing</em>' ending on the verb (especially 
				if we already know that we are talking about a current 
				arrangement concerning the future) and we 
				don't need the word <em>'morning'</em> either, because we have 
				already said '<em>early</em>' and so on.<br />Redundancy in language is 
				<strong>not</strong> a problem for 
				learners; it's a positive aid because it means we can miss or 
				skip large sections of what we hear and read without losing our 
				way.</li>
				<li>The second thing we bring to reading or listening is our 
				knowledge of the world and the cultural setting.<br />
				Using this kind of knowledge is called <strong>top-down 
				processing</strong>.<br />
				If, for example, if I already know the subject of a 
				conversation, it makes understanding what is said much easier.&nbsp; 
				Equally, if I know how a newspaper is set out in terms of 
				pictures, headlines and so on as well as the subject of an 
				article, it is much easier for me to predict what I am going to 
				encounter and that makes understanding easier.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It's important to realise that top-down and bottom-up processing 
			happen at the same time.&nbsp; We can practise the skills separately 
			(and we often need to) but we apply them together.<br />
			If you want to know much more about top-down and bottom-up 
			processing and how we use them to infer meaning in the language we 
			hear or see, go to
			<a href="../../../inservice/skills/inferencing.html">the guide 
			to inferencing</a>.</p>

				<em>-ness</em>.</li>

			</table>
			<p>Here, too, there are commonalities and differences.&nbsp;
			Both skills require us to be comprehensible.<br />In writing, that means picking the right words and grammar to 
			communicate our meaning.<br />We need to do that when we are speaking, too, but as we saw above, 
			accurate grammar is not always required and we can also use simpler 
			words (and even replacements for words we don't know like <em>stuff</em> or 
			<em>thing</em> or even <em>whatsitsname</em> and <em>thingummyjig</em>) to get our message across.&nbsp; We do, 
			however, need to form the sounds of the language accurately enough 
			and be aware of intonation and that's something the writer can 
			ignore.</p>
			<p>Speaking and writing differ in a number of ways.</p>
