			<h1>Unpacking and explaining the <span class="celtabluegreen">CELTA</span> syllabus and assessment criteria</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="unpack" height="207" src="../../../images/variety_hats310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>The CELTA syllabus was last updated in 2018 but has not become 
			any clearer.&nbsp; It is written by the initiated for the initiated.<br />
			What follows is an attempt to translate Cambridge 
			Assessment English-speak into language comprehensible to normal 
			people.</p>
			<p>The Cambridge specifications have been re-arranged to link the 
			syllabus to the assessment criteria.&nbsp; Then they have been 
			translated and linked to other guides on this site (mostly in the 
			initial-plus training section) to help you meet the criteria.<br />
			The following is based on the most recent edition of the Cambridge 
			Syllabus and Assessment Guidelines, published in May 2021 and 
			effective from July 2021.&nbsp; Unfortunately, on the Cambridge 
			website at https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/teaching-english/teaching-qualifications/celta/about-the-celta-course/ 
			has not yet managed to link to the new version.&nbsp; What it links 
			to is an amended syllabus with what were temporary changes caused by 
			the recent Covid19 outbreak but changes are not fundamental to the 
			syllabus.<br />
			It has now been decreed by Cambridge Assessment English that, in 
			their words, "<span class="style_black"><em>to build on the success 
			of CELTA online delivery</em></span>", CELTA courses may now be 
			delivered wholly online.<br />
			Cambridge have clarified the situation as follows:</p>
			<p class="indentpara">... it will be possible for candidates to 
			complete their teaching practice elements of the qualification using 
			an online form of delivery, rather than the traditional face-to-face 
			format. ... The CELTA assessment construct is maintained, as the 
			course is intended to be developmental and that evidence of trainees 
			meeting criteria is built incrementally and iteratively reviewed. 
			...<br />
			CELTA courses will be externally moderated by a Cambridge English 
			approved assessor, ensuring criteria are applied appropriately. 
			There are no changes to the assessment criteria. The classroom 
			referred to in some criteria will be the virtual classroom rather 
			than a physical one.<br />
			In accordance with the above, candidates may do all six hours of 
			their observations of experienced teachers using recorded materials.<br />

			<p>The syllabus comes in five parts and there is a guide to each on 
			this site accessible from 
			<a href="../celta_index.html" target="_blank">the CELTA 
			index</a>.&nbsp; We will take them one at a time, looking at what 
			they say, what they mean and how your performance is assessed in 
			each section.&nbsp; We will also consider how to meet the 
			criteria to get the best possible grade.<br />
			(The sections of the syllabus are variously called 'Areas' and 
			'Topics'.&nbsp; Don't worry; they mean the same.)<br />
			If you have ambitions to get an A-grade on CELTA, this is a good 
			place to start.</p>
			<p>You can click on this diagram to go to the area that interests 
			you or work your way down the guide area by area.<br />
			At any stage, clicking on the
			<img alt="arrow" class="auto-style19" height="15" src="../images/leftarrow.png" width="27" /> will return you to this

					<p>This means being aware of three 
					major things about learners:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>First languages:<br />
						Do not confuse this with nationality.<br />
						There are something in the order of 6500 languages 
						spoken on this planet and you need to know a little 
						about the languages your learners speak.&nbsp; You do 
						not have to speak the language(s), although it helps 
						considerably if you can, but you should know something 
						about them and their major characteristics.</li>
						<li>Cultures:<br />
						Cultures are more closely tied to nationality and there 
						are two major differences that you need to consider:<ol class="auto-style8">
							<li>Power relationships:<br />
							In some cultures there are distinct and wide 
							variations in power relationships.&nbsp; Other 
							cultures have narrower gaps.&nbsp; Learners from the 
							first sort of culture will expect teachers to be 
							authoritative and in charge, others may expect a 
							more equal relationship.</li>
							<li>Tolerance of risk:<br />
							In some cultures people are averse to taking risks, 
							especially in public, and will be reluctant to guess 
							or say something they are not sure about.&nbsp; 
							Learners from other backgrounds will be happy to 
							experiment and unfazed by getting things wrong in 
							public.</li>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Educational backgrounds:<br />
						This is allied to cultural differences.&nbsp; Adult 
						learners will bring with them expectations of how best 
						to learn and be taught and their views will often be 
						based on how they were taught at school and elsewhere.<br />
						It is foolish, and probably counter-productive to ignore 
						or disparage their experiences.</li>

			<p>One of the reasons for doing a course which leads to a proper 
			certificate that is recognised worldwide is that there are 
			assessment criteria in place which are reliable, fair and 
			trustworthy.&nbsp; It works like this:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Each and every criterion in the long lists above is judged 
				and assessed as your course progresses.<br />
				The centre and its tutors will be keeping a record of how you 
				are meeting or have met the criteria for any of the sections of 
				the syllabus.&nbsp; At any time, you have the right, usually, to 
				see how you are doing.</li>
				<li>Tutors at good centres will undertake regular 
				standardisation exercises to make sure that they are all 
				applying the criteria in the same way and at the same level of 
				stringency.</li>
				<li>Every course is visited by an external assessor appointed by 
				Cambridge Assessment English to make sure that standards are 
				being kept.&nbsp; The external assessor will see some of the 
				teaching practice and will review the written assignments and 
				their marking, agreeing final grades with the tutors.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All the criteria are assessed on a three-point scale:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>NS: Not to Standard</strong></dt>
				<dd>means that you have not met the criterion.&nbsp; Many of the 
				criteria are assessed more than once so this is not necessarily 
				a fatal issue.&nbsp; It is, however, a grade to avoid.</dd>
				<dt><strong>S: at Standard</strong></dt>
				<dd>means you have met the criterion adequately.&nbsp; This is 
				the minimum you need to pass the CELTA.</dd>
				<dt><strong>S+: above Standard</strong></dt>
				<dd>means that you have met the criterion very well and are 
				heading, in this respect, for an A-grade result.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>You need to aim consistently for S or S+ grades, naturally.</p>

			<p>According to Cambridge, a Fail grade means that your "performance 
			does not match all of the Pass descriptors" and "Some CELTA 
			assessment criteria are not achieved and/or requirements for written 
			work are not met."<br />
			That's actually quite a rare outcome.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, the words which serve to distinguish the grades 
			are open to some interpretation.&nbsp; They are: s<em>ome, minimal, 
			well, thoroughly, generally, good, very good, consistently, 
			satisfactory, excellent </em>and all of those are routinely 
			interpreted differently.<br />
			For example, what is <em>good</em> to one tutor may be considered
			<em>very good</em> by another and the term <em>consistently</em> may 
			be interpreted as <em>usually</em> by one tutor and<em> almost 
			always</em> by another.<br />
			It may be worth your time, when the opportunity arises during 
			feedback sessions, to get some idea from your tutors of how they 
			understand and apply these modifiers.</p>
