			</table>
			<p class="nomarginbottom">Culture can be defined as:</p>
			<p class="auto-style8">the ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a 
			particular people or society</p>
			<p>The first obvious problem is to define what is meant by 'people' 
			and 'society', of course, but most will equate these in some way 
			with nationality for the purposes of English language teaching.&nbsp; 
			The term is still, however, rather slippery because we talk of the 
			culture of nations and also of parts of nations: <em>German culture, 
			American culture, the culture in the north of England, European 
			culture </em>and so on.</p>
			<p>The second obvious problem is that we need to be careful to avoid 
			national stereotyping.&nbsp; Talk of someone being
			<em>typically French, typically Chinese, typically Asian</em> and so 
			on is easy but all of these sorts of stereotypes are fraught 
			with danger:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Very few people actually consider 
				themselves to be typical of their own culture.&nbsp; Do you?</li>
				<li>China is a nation of more than 1.3 
				billion people speaking at least 12 distinct languages and 
				including a huge amount of cultural variety.&nbsp; There can be 
				no talk of <em>Chinese culture, </em>therefore.</li>
				<li>Asia is even more of a uselessly loose term.&nbsp; 
				That means everyone from Siberia to Sri Lanka, Turkey to Taiwan 
				and Japan to Jakarta  – over 50 countries and 4 billion people.&nbsp; 
				To speak of <em>Asian culture</em> is plain silly.</li>
				<li>Talk of cultural stereotypes can lead 
				quickly to value judgements which have no place in our 
				profession.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We need, therefore, to identify what parts of which cultures we 
			need to consider in the English-language learning setting.</p>

				<dt><strong>Educational culture<br />
				<img alt="school" height="133" src="../../../images/teaching_jungle200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>Schools operate very differently in different cultures.<br />
				In some, discipline is harsh, independent thought is not 
				encouraged and rote learning of facts is the norm.<br />
				In others, discipline is lax, the relationships between teachers 
				and students are informal and facts are less important than the 
				acquisition of thinking and learning skills.<br />
				Even were it possible, this is no place to try to list which 
				cultures embody which characteristics but it is important to be 
				aware of what sorts of educational backgrounds your learners 
				have.<br />
				It is also important to recognise that:<ol class="auto-style22">
					<li>educational norms exist on a cline from lax to harsh, 
					informal to formal and</li>
					<li>even within cultures schools and teachers vary 
					widely.</li>
				</ol>
				People's educational backgrounds will often determine how they 
				feel about you and your teaching.<ol class="auto-style22">
					<li>Learners who come from an educational culture in which 
					the teacher is always an authority figure whose views are 
					automatically accepted may be disoriented and confused if 
					you ask them for their opinions about what to learn and how 
					to learn it.&nbsp; Some will, however, find a more relaxed 
					approach refreshing and novel.</li>
					<li>Others will be comfortable with a much more equal 
					relationship and be frustrated and lose motivation to learn 
					if they feel that their views are not being given adequate 
					weight and consideration.</li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Power relationships, risk taking and fear of losing 
				face<br />
				<img alt="power" height="133" src="../../../images/tools_hammer_egg200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></dt>
				<dd>In some cultures, such as Scandinavian countries, Britain 
				and the USA, power relationships are narrow and people will be 
				unafraid to criticise teachers, question them and demand 
				answers.&nbsp; In these cultures, too, risk taking is more 
				prevalent so learners will be more likely to have a stab at 
				language and be less afraid of making errors.<br />
				In other cultures, notably Pacific rim nations, Greece and 
				South America, power distances are larger and risk taking is less 
				common so people from those cultures are less likely to 
				criticise others or ask questions and more likely to avoid just 
				having a go at language until they are sure they have it right.<br />
				There are consequences for the classroom, of course:<ol class="auto-style22">
					<li>Learners whose cultures have narrow power relationships 
					will be happy to interrupt others (including you) and 
					suggest their own ideas.<br />
					Others, from cultures with wide power relationships may well 
					feel uncomfortable asking for clarification and may be 
					reluctant to ask questions at all, even when they are 
					confused and unsure.</li>
					<li>Learners whose cultures tolerate risk will be prepared 
					to 'have a go' at producing language in the classroom, even 
					when they aren't sure it's well formed.&nbsp; They will 
					respond well to free communicative activities in which the 
					emphasis is on communicative success not accuracy.&nbsp; 
					They will be less afraid of losing face and even being the 
					butt of some ridicule.<br />
					Others, whose cultural backgrounds are risk avoiding in 
					general may be very reluctant to say anything until they are 
					sure that it is correct and well formed for fear of losing 
					public face and being seen to have made a mistake.&nbsp; 
					They will often respond well to controlled exercises in 
					which they know that there is only one correct answer and 
					they can display the fact that they know what it is.</li>
				</ol>
				If, naturally, you are teaching a group in which there is a 
				mixture of these types of cultural characteristics, you need to 
				plan for it and include activities which will appeal to everyone 
				at some time in the lesson.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Collectivism vs. Individualism<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="collective" height="133" src="../../../images/birds_gulls_exclude200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>In so-called collectivist societies, people define 
				themselves by their social roles:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a father<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I<span class="auto-style23">'m the </span>youngest 
				daughter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I<span class="auto-style23">'m </span>a doctor<br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				In individualistic societies, people are more likely to define 
				themselves by reference to their personalities:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a 
				patient, tolerant person<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a hard-working, perfectionist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm generous but often too tolerant</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				There are some implications including:<ol class="auto-style22">
					<li>Those from highly individualistic cultures will<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>often be happy to express their views openly</li>
						<li>often be happy to accept newcomers in a group and judge them 
					on their merits</li>
						<li>view task completion as important</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Those from highly collectivist cultures will<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>be less happy to express an opinion and prefer to wait until 
					a consensus is reached</li>
						<li>be less happy to welcome newcomers and will judge them on 
					their backgrounds</li>
						<li>prefer to focus on reaching a consensus together and focus 
					on their relations within their groups.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>It bears repeating that:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>People as individuals often behave 
				outside their cultural norms</li>
				<li>Even defining what constitutes <em>
				culture</em> is perilous</li>

				<dt><strong>Grammar</strong></dt>
				<dd>If an adult doesn't know how a particular structure works in 
				English he or she is likely to assume that it will be the same 
				as in the first language.&nbsp; Here are some examples of the 
				kinds of error one might encounter based on the learners' first 
				languages (the use of the '*' is the conventional way to 
				identify something wrong, by the way):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*I have arrived yesterday</em> (speakers of almost all 
				other European languages and many beyond Europe)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*Because it was raining so I took an umbrella</em> 
				(speakers of most Chinese languages)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*I looked up it in the dictionary</em> (speakers of 
				Romance languages like Italian, French and Spanish)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*It is wonderfuller</em> (speakers of Germanic languages 
				such as German, Dutch and some Scandinavian languages)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*Tourist industry is important my country</em> (speakers 
				of languages such as Turkish or Japanese which have very 
				different [or no] article and preposition systems)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Words and vocabulary (Lexis)</strong></dt>
				<dd>Learners are less likely to transfer a word from 
				their first language into English because we all know that it 
				doesn't usually work.&nbsp; However, if a word <strong>looks 
				like</strong> the same word in both languages, learners will be 
				tempted to think that it <strong>means</strong> the same in both 
				languages [it's called a false friend].&nbsp; Examples include:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*Don't get upset.&nbsp; You are too sensible </em>(in 
				many languages, the meanings of <em>sensible</em> and <em>
				sensitive</em> are reversed)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*I had a cup of coffee at a snack</em> (Japanese 
				speakers [<em>snack = snack bar</em>])<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*Write it in your note</em> (Korean speakers [<em>note</em> 
				= <em>notebook</em>]<em>)<br />
				</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*He may eventually come</em> (in 
				many languages, <em>eventually</em> means <em>possibly</em>)</dd>
				<dt><strong>Pronunciation</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is the most obvious area.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				Pronouncing <em>ship</em> as <em>sheep</em> is common to many 
				speakers of languages which don't have a short 'i' sound such as 
				Greek and Italian<br />
				Pronouncing 'th' as 's', 'z' or 'f' is common to a range of 
				learners</dd>

				<dt><strong>For pleasure and leisure</strong></dt>
				<dd>Believe it or not, some people actually enjoy learning 
				another language and get a buzz from speaking it.&nbsp; They may 
				also feel they need it because it is the No 1 international 
				means of communication around the world.&nbsp; Most people will 
				have trouble travelling widely without at least some competence 
				in English.</dd>
				<dt><strong>For study</strong></dt>
				<dd>Many learners aspire to study in an English-speaking college 
				or university.<br />
				There are also many higher education institutions outside 
				English-speaking countries that nevertheless use English as the 
				medium of instruction. These learners are said to be studying 
				for English for Academic Purposes (or EAP).</dd>
				<dt><strong>For work</strong></dt>
				<dd>A basic or even quite advanced knowledge of English is often 
				a requirement for work in many countries.&nbsp; People in this 
				category are often described as learning English for Special 
				Purposes (ESP).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Because it is necessary in our world</strong></dt>
				<dd>The British Council and others reckon that:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>English is the main language of books, newspapers, airports and 
				air-traffic control, international business and academic 
				conferences, science, technology, diplomacy, sport, 
				international competitions, pop music and advertising</li>
					<li>over two-thirds of the world's scientists read in English</li>
					<li>three quarters of the world's mail is written in English</li>
					<li>eighty per cent of the world's electronically stored information 
				is in English</li>
					<li>of the estimated 4.66 billion users of the Internet, some 
				thirty-six per cent communicate in English</li>
					<li>60.6% of the 1.2 billion or so websites out here are written 
					in English (the next most popular languages are Russian 
					(6.7%), German (5.7%), Japanese and Spanish (5.1% each) and 
					French (4.1%))<br />
					(Figures from https://siteefy.com but the numbers change all 
					the time and are only estimates, anyway.)</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>There are four basic forms of motivation:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Intrinsic</strong></dt>
				<dd>I.e., that which comes from inside the learner.&nbsp; People 
				who enjoy learning and speaking English for its own sake fall 
				into this category.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Extrinsic</strong></dt>
				<dd>I.e., that which comes from outside the learner.&nbsp; 
				People who need English for work will fall into this category as 
				will people who are in compulsory education and those who have 
				been instructed to learn English.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Instrumental</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is often considered a form of extrinsic motivation and 
				refers to people learning the language to do something else, 
				e.g., a person learning English to read books or fit in with a 
				culture.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Integrative</strong></dt>
				<dd>This is also often classed as a form of extrinsic motivation 
				(and sometimes not) and refers to the need to learn a language 
				to integrate into a society.<br />
				It applies to immigrants (who are sometimes referred to as ESOL 
				students (English as a Second or Other Language)) but also to 
				people living, studying or working in a country for a short 
				time.<br />
				It may also refer to people who want to integrate into 
				businesses and large multi-national corporations who use English 
				as the internal language, whatever countries they operate in.&nbsp; 
				There are lots of those.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>People will rarely have only one motivation for learning English 
			so might, for example, have been told to learn it (extrinsic 
			pressure) but find it enjoyable (intrinsic feelings) and so on.</p>
			<p>Rather obviously, the more you know about your learners' reasons 
			for learning, the better able you are to plan accordingly.&nbsp; The 
			CELTA course will assess your ability to do this.</p>

			<p>We need to start with a precautionary note:<br />
			Once upon a time, people in English language teaching were convinced 
			that their learners could be classified according to how they 
			preferred (and, indeed, were able) to learn.<br />
			The argument went, usually, along the lines of having four 
			recognisable learning styles (called VARK for short):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Visual<br />
				describing people who learn well from visual stimuli such as 
				images, diagrams, video clips and so on.</li>
				<li>Auditory<br />
				describing people who take in information through their ears and 
				respond well to lectures, discussion, recorded material and so 
				on.</li>
				<li>Reading-writing<br />
				describing people who will respond well to written exercises and 
				presentations and to procedures which reinforce the language 
				through getting them to read and write.</li>
				<li>Kinaesthetic<br />
				describing people who will respond well to activities and 
				procedures which allow them to manipulate objects (such as 
				plastic rods and cut-ups of texts or physical-object matching 
				exercises such as matching a word to a visual image printed on 
				cards).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There were other theories concerning multiple intelligences and 
			activators, pragmatists, reflectors and theorists and a zoo of other 
			ways to analyse people's personalities and learning styles.<br />
			The argument was that people have unique mixes of learning 
			styles and that teachers should match their approaches and the tasks 
			they set to take advantage of (or at least accommodate) the various 
			styles and preferences of their students.&nbsp; There are those who 
			doubted the validity of all this from the outset, too, and, more 
			recently, the whole area has been vigorously attacked as 
			meaningless, damaging and invalid pseudo-science.&nbsp; Tread carefully.</p>
			<p>If your tutors are in the learning styles camp (as Cambridge 
			English seemed to be until quite recently), you may be well advised to go along with them, 
			whatever your personal view and make it clear in lesson plans and 
			elsewhere (particularly the written assignment focusing on the 
			learner) that you are aware of the learning styles of the people you 
			are teaching and, incidentally, of your own style.<br />
			From 2018, the CELTA syllabus has been revised in the light of 
			criticisms of learning-style theories and the word <em>styles</em> 
			has been expunged from the CELTA syllabus to be replaced by <em>
			learning preferences</em>.&nbsp; That is, you may feel, simply 
			a fudge.</p>
			<p>There is little doubt that learners do have preferences for how 
			they are taught and much of that may stem from their educational 
			backgrounds and experiences (see above).&nbsp; You'd be foolish not 
			to take preferences into account, of course.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt><strong>What resources are available to you to make your

					something else in an English-speaking institution or 
					culture.&nbsp; We call this EAP (English for Academic

					<li>for Business, because they are operate or have ambitions 
					to operate in an English speaking business culture where the 
					ability to interact with customers and suppliers is valued 
					along with the ability to write clearly in English and, 
					perhaps, to give presentations and participate in or chair 
					meetings.&nbsp; This is EfB (English for Business).</li>

			</table>
			<p>Somewhere between 375 and 400 million people around the world 
			speak English as a first language and an additional 750 million or 
			so speak it as a second language.<br />
			It is, therefore, unsurprising that there are quite marked and 
			identifiable varieties of the language.</p>
			<p>There's no suggestion here that one variety is somehow 'better' 
			than another and, in fact, the amendments to the CELTA for April 
			2018 make it clear that the focus is on
			<span class="style_underline">varieties</span> rather than the 
			old-fashioned standard vs. non-standard variation.<br />
			It is a matter of appropriacy and an 
			understanding of where and with whom your learners will use English.&nbsp; 
			If, for example, your learners are only going to use English to 
			communicate with people from India then teaching Indian Standard 
			forms and pronunciation is entirely appropriate but in other 
			circumstances, for example, if your learners need English as an 
			international language, teaching regionally-specific forms, words 
			and pronunciation will be harmful to them.</p>
			<p>Here is a list of the what you should consider in this respect.&nbsp; 
			It is not complete but is all you need to think about for a CELTA 
			course:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>
			You need to make sure that you consider which variety of 
			English you should be using in your teaching.&nbsp; We should avoid (or at least be careful about) teaching 
			regionally specific language.</li>
			<li>We should know what our learners need English for.&nbsp; 
			Occupational and topic registers (i.e., the professional or personal 
			areas in which they will be using the language) are important here.</li>
			<li>We should use language in the classroom which is not heavily 
			influenced by our own dialect and accent.&nbsp; If that means 
			learning to speak without such influences, so be it.</li>
			<li>We should avoid teaching language which is confined to specific 
			class- or topic-influenced settings.&nbsp; If that means cautioning 
			students not to use non-standard grammar such as <em>gonna</em> or
			<em>ain't</em>, so be it.</li>
			<li>We should expose our students to the main Englishes they are 
			likely to encounter outside our classrooms.</li>
			<li>We should be careful about the kinds of materials we use in 
			class.&nbsp; If a song or other authentic text contains instances of 
			non-standard or regionally-influenced grammar or lexis we should 
			consider whether we <strong>should</strong> be using it and, if need 
			be, warn the learners not to use it as a model.</li>
		</ol>
			<p>Finally, you need to think about your dialect (yes, everyone has 
			a dialect) and decide whether using dialect forms in the 
			classroom is acceptable in your setting.</p>

			</table>
			<p>You may be surprised to learn that monolingualism (the ability 
			only to speak one language) is actually rather unusual.&nbsp; The 
			majority of people and the majority of countries speak more than one 
			language.&nbsp; For a full list of languages spoken in most of the 
			world's countries, try
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilingual_countries_and_regions" target="_blank">
			the Wikipedia article</a>.<br />
			Britain 
			and the USA are slightly unusual, in fact, in not having an official 
			language at all and both nations are home to speakers of hundreds of other 
			languages as well as the indigenous ones.&nbsp; Over 40 million 
			Americans speak Spanish at home, for example.<br />
			Most of Africa is multilingual and the same can be said of Asia 
			(with certain exceptions, such as Japan).</p>
			<p>When it comes to the role first languages play in learning 
			English, something has been said above but there are two concepts 
			that are helpful in talking about this area:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>First language interference</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to the way in which a learner's first language(s) can 
				negatively affect the learning and use of English, e.g., by 
				leading to grammatical, lexical or phonological errors.</dd>
				<dt><strong>First language facilitation</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to the way in which a learner's first language can 
				actually help in learning English because of parallels in 
				structure or vocabulary.<br />
				For example, there are many more words in German and English 
				which both look similar and mean the same things than there are 
				false friends and the same applies to many Romance languages such 
				as French and Spanish.&nbsp; Clearly, the less closely related 
				languages are, the less facilitation there can be.<br />
				Equally, e.g., if a learner from Japan already speaks another European 
				language then she will find it easier to acquire English and <em>
				vice versa</em>.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Many of the language analysis guides on this site make reference 
			to the learners' first language(s).&nbsp; In particular, a good 
			example is in the consideration of word order.<br />
			Word order is an area in which the influence of people's first 
			language(s) can be most striking and leads to errors such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>*The vase most beautiful</em> (by 
				a speaker whose first language routinely puts the adjective 
				after the noun, e.g., French)</li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>*She walked the road along</em> 
				(by a speaker whose first language routinely uses postpositions 
				rather than prepositions, e.g., Turkish)</li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>*This is the house of Mary</em> 
				(by a speaker whose first language routinely places possessive 
				structures after the noun, e.g., Spanish)</li>
				<li class="greybullet"><em>*She walks often to the shop</em> 
				(by a speaker whose first language routinely places adverbs of 
				frequency after the main verb, e.g., German)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>and so on.</p>
