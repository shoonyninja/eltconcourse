			<p>Each section of this guide is brief and contains links to guides 
			elsewhere on this site.&nbsp; Following those guides will prepare 
			you well.<br />
			You should look for the areas of language analysis which are 
			particularly important to you (because, e.g., you are teaching them 
			tomorrow).&nbsp; To do that, go to the initial plus training section 
			or search for what you want by using this link:
			<a href="../../../../search_the_site.html" target="_blank">search the whole <span class="orange">
			<strong>ELT</strong></span><strong> 
			<span class="style_blue">Concourse</span>
			</strong>site</a>.&nbsp;
			<a href="../../../../a-z_index.html" target="_blank">The A-Z index 
			of the site</a> is also a good place to begin.<br />
			Searching from there may take you to some of the 
			more advanced language analysis guides.&nbsp; But why not?</p>
			<h3>Native and non-native speakers of English</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>If you are a native speaker of English:</strong><br />
				You actually 'know' 
		all the grammar in one sense, insofar as you can speak the language and 
				have no trouble forming grammatically correct utterances 
				(usually).&nbsp; What you probably don't have is what is 
		called declarative knowledge and that is what prevents you from being 
		able clearly to explain grammar to learners or to plan and teach the 
		grammar input they need.<br />
				In Britain and many other English-speaking countries grammar is 
				not taught thoroughly or even at all in most schools.&nbsp;
		The spin-off from this is that many 
		teachers (and some teacher trainers) know embarrassingly little about 
		the grammar of their own or anyone else's language.</li>
				<li><strong>If you are a non-native speaker of English:</strong><br />
				You have a distinct advantage.&nbsp; You know the grammar pretty 
				thoroughly and probably know lots of terminology to talk about 
				it as well.&nbsp; What you need to be careful not to do is visit 
				on your students the awful things that happened to you.&nbsp; 
				Swan puts it this way:<br />
				<span class="style_black"> <em>Many foreign-language teachers spent a good deal of time when younger 
learning about tense and aspect, the use of articles, relative clauses and the 
like; they naturally feel that these things matter a good deal and must be 
incorporated in their own teaching. In this way, the tendency of an earlier 
generation to overvalue grammar can be perpetuated. (Swan, 2002)</em></span></li>

				<dt><strong>Dealing with error</strong></dt>
				<dd>You can speak the language, of course, and you can 
				immediately spot when an utterance is malformed or grammatically 
				flawed.&nbsp; However, especially if you are a native speaker, 
				you may be at a loss to know what exactly has gone wrong and the 
				best way of explaining what's right.&nbsp; You need to be able 
				to analyse language on the hoof, not just in your study.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Teaching formal structures</strong></dt>
				<dd>There are times when learners of English (most of them) need 
				to learn how a structure works.&nbsp; There are two reasons for 
				this:<br />
				a) As Swan puts it:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>"Knowing how to build and use certain structures makes 
it possible to communicate common types of meaning successfully.&nbsp; Without these 
structures, it is difficult to make comprehensible sentences.&nbsp; We must, 
therefore, try to identify these structures and teach them well.</em></span>"<br />
				That mirrors the view of Widdowson, above.<br />
				b) Swan again:<span class="style_black"><br /><em>"In some social contexts, serious deviance from 
native-speaker norms can hinder integration and excite prejudice – a person who 
speaks ‘badly’ may not be taken seriously, or may be considered uneducated or 
stupid.&nbsp; Students may, therefore, want or need a higher level of grammatical 
correctness than is required for mere comprehensibility.</em></span>"</dd>
				<dt><strong>Learner expectations</strong></dt>
				<dd>Most adult learners are aware that they need grammar to 
				communicate and will neither trust nor respect teachers who 
				can't teach it, correct it and explain it or don't seem to know 
				their own subject thoroughly.</dd>

			<p>The primary distinction to get clear before you can begin to 
			learn about the language (any language, in fact) is that between
			<strong>form</strong> and <strong>function</strong>:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong><a name="gandl"></a>Form<br />
				</strong>
				<img alt="form" height="133" src="../../../images/form_hammer_anvil200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>concerns the structure of the language.&nbsp; For example, 
				if we are faced with a sentence such as:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That 
				man is asking me about the new Lenovo laptop</strong></em></span><br />
				We can analyse the sentence like this:<ol>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>That man</strong></em></span> 
					= the Subject of the sentence (and everything that follows 
					it is called the predicate).&nbsp; It consists of:<br />
					a determiner (<span class="style_black"><strong><em>that</em></strong></span>) 
					and a common noun (<span class="style_black"><em><strong>man</strong></em></span>).&nbsp; 
					The noun tells you what I am talking about and the 
					determiner tells you exactly which one I am talking about.</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>is asking</strong></em></span> 
					= the verb phrase.&nbsp; It consists of:<br />
					a primary auxiliary verb (<span class="style_black"><em><strong>is</strong></em></span>) 
					and a verb in the -<em>ing</em> form (<span class="style_black"><em><strong>asking</strong></em></span>).&nbsp; 
					Together these form the present progressive tense which 
					tells you that this is happening right now.</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><strong><em>me</em></strong></span> 
					= the object of the sentence.&nbsp; It consists of only one 
					word, the pronoun <em>me</em> which tells you whom the 
					asking is directed at.</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>about the new 
					Lenovo laptop</strong></em></span> = a prepositional phrase.&nbsp; 
					It consists of:<br />
					a preposition (<span class="style_black"><em><strong>about</strong></em></span>) 
					which signals a topic and a noun phrase (<span class="style_black"><em><strong>the 
					new Lenovo laptop</strong></em></span>) which in turn 
					consists of a determiner (<span class="style_black"><em><strong>the</strong></em></span>) 
					which suggests you already know the one in question, an 
					adjective (<span class="style_black"><em><strong>new</strong></em></span>) 
					which describes the noun phrase and the noun phrase (<span class="style_black"><em><strong>Lenovo 
					laptop</strong></em></span>) which has two parts:<br />
					<span class="style_black"><em><strong>Lenovo</strong></em></span> 
					which classifies the noun and <span class="style_black"><em>
					<strong>laptop</strong></em></span> which is a simple common 
					noun.</li>
				</ol>
				What we have done here is focus on two aspects of the form:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Word class </strong>which tells us what kind of word 
				or phrase we are dealing with (nouns, verbs, adjectives etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Syntax</strong> which tells us the relationships 
				between the parts of the sentence (Subject, Object, Verb etc.)<br />
				If you follow the very short pre-service grammar course on this 
				site, linked below, you, too, will be able to do this kind of 
				analysis quickly and accurately.&nbsp; It will be required of 
				you on a CELTA course and a decent one will teach you how to do 
				it.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Function</strong><br />
				<img alt="shoe" height="133" src="../../../images/function_horseshoe200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>The other way we can analyse the same sentence is to look at 
				its function in terms of what it communicates.&nbsp; For this, 
				because the sentence is not in a text or conversation, we have to 
				make some assumptions.<ol>
					<li><em><span class="style_black"><strong>The setting</strong></span></em><span class="auto-style38">
					</span>= a shop.&nbsp; This seems a reasonable assumption 
					about where the sentence might be spoken.&nbsp; It's not the 
					only possible one, of course, so we need to keep an open mind 
					here.&nbsp; The setting, whatever it is, will usually tell 
					us something about the meaning of what is said.</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>The participants</strong></em></span> 
					= a salesperson and a colleague.&nbsp; This, too, seems a 
					reasonable assumption, if the first one about the setting is 
					correct, because it's hard to see who else would utter the 
					sentence.</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>The relationship 
					between the participants</strong></em></span> = unequal, 
					knower to non-knower or subordinate to manager.&nbsp; Again, 
					because we have nothing else to work on, we have to assume that 
					this is the case.&nbsp; There seem to be two likely 
					scenarios:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>this is a manager using the sentence to direct a 
						subordinate to go and help the customer</li>
						<li>this is a salesperson who is asking a colleague to 
						help the customer because he knows too little about the 
						laptop to be informative enough.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><strong><em>Meaning</em></strong></span> 
					= the communicative value of the sentence.&nbsp; Again, 
					depending on the roles of the participants, there are two 
					possibilities:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>it is an order dressed up as information</li>
						<li>it is a request for help similarly dressed</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				You can see that we are having to make some assumptions here about 
				who is talking to whom, what their relationship is and where the 
				exchange is taking place.<br />
				This is a very important point because it is impossible to know

			<p>Many people have made long and distinguished careers from the 
			academic study of grammar and continue to do so.<br />
			That is not required of you but you do have to know about the 
			subject you are teaching.&nbsp; If you don't, people will soon 
			notice and you will have a hard time in the classroom.<br />
			Grammar may be defined quite broadly to include the structure of 
			sentences as well as the words we use to make them and the sounds we 
			make when we speak.<br />
			Often, however, grammar is more narrowly defined as to do with 
			structure alone and words (lexis) and sounds (phonology) are given 
			categories of their own.&nbsp; This is the approach taken here.<br />
			Nobody but you knows how much or how little you already know about 
			grammar but you will need to know or learn about at least the 
			following and there is a link below to a CELTA grammar course which 
			covers most of them.</p>
			<ol class="bluebullet">
				<li>sentence structure: subjects, verbs, objects, adverbials, 
				phrases and clauses and how they all fit together.&nbsp; This is 
				usually defined as <strong>syntax</strong>.</li>
				<li>verbs and tenses: lexical or main verbs (which carry real meaning), 
				primary auxiliary verbs (which operate grammatically to make 
				tense forms and more) and modal auxiliary verbs (such as <em>
				may, can, might, would</em> etc.) which signal the speaker's 
				view of the main verb.<br />
				This area will also include knowing the names and the major 
				functions of the 15 main tenses used in English.&nbsp; That's 
				not as difficult as you may think but you will have to get to 
				grips with the difference between tense and aspect because that 
				is fundamental to English forms.</li>
				<li>word and phrase class: adjectives, adverbs, nouns, verbs, 
				prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, determiners and 
				interjections.</li>
				<li>other major structures which include but are not limited to: 
				passive clauses, causatives, quantifiers, coordination and 
				subordination and quite a lot more.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>In addition to word class, usually the concern of grammar (see 
			above), you need to know something about the categories into which 
			words are divided and the relationships between them.<br />
			Lexis is the term used in English language teaching to talk 
				about words and vocabulary.&nbsp; The reason for this is that it 
				is very difficult to define what is meant by the term <em>word</em> 
				because a word (which is a group of letters written with a space 
				at each end) may</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>have no meaning<br />
				</strong></em></span>For example:<br />There is no doubt that 
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>the, in, out, my, between, but, this, some, few</strong></em></span> 
					and many more items are words in the usual sense but it is 
					very difficult to assign a meaning to them or to explain 
					what their significance is.<br />On the other hand, words such as 
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>table, tree, happiness, yellow, ride, 
					extraordinary, sadly, grow, often</strong></em></span> etc. 
					clearly do carry a meaning and can, in fact, be the only 
					item in a sentence and still have some communicative value.<br />What we are talking about here is the distinction between
					<strong>function words</strong>, the ones without much 
					meaning if any at all, and <strong>content words</strong>, 
					the ones which do carry meaning.</li>
				<li><em><span class="style_black"><strong>not be single 
					words<br /></strong></span></em>For example, it is clear that:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Democratic Party</em><br />is a single idea and that it is used to refer to a single 
					entity but it consists of three words.&nbsp; In our 
					profession, it's called a lexeme.&nbsp; Another example is:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cream tea</em><br />which is neither <em>cream</em> nor 
				<em>tea</em> but forms a 
					single concept consisting of two words.&nbsp; It, too, is a 
					lexeme.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong><em>take a variety of 
					forms</em></strong></span><br />For example, 
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>sink, 
					sank, sunk, sunken, sinking</strong></em></span> are all 
					words in the normal sense of the term but they constitute a 
					single lexeme because they are just slightly different 
					grammatical forms of the same idea.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once we have determined that the term lexeme is a better one to 
				work with, we can look at relationships between them.&nbsp; That 
				allows us to talk about, for example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>synonymy<br />
				</strong></em></span>For example:<br />The words 
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>freezing</strong></em></span> 
					and <span class="style_black"><em><strong>icy</strong></em></span> 
					both mean <em>very cold</em> so they are synonyms in terms 
					of meaning.&nbsp; Unfortunately for our learners, there are 
					very few absolute synonyms in any language so while we can 
					have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a freezing wind</em> and 
				<em>an icy 
					wind</em>, we cannot have <em>a freezing road</em> so must 
					select <em>an icy road</em>.</li>
				<li><em><span class="style_black"><strong>collocation</strong></span></em><br />This refers to what we saw in the last example.&nbsp; 
					Collocation describes the fact that many words have 
					preferred partners, so to speak.&nbsp; We can, therefore, 
					say:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a strong wind and heavy snow<br />
				</em>but we cannot have<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a heavy wind and strong snow<br />
				</em>because <em>heavy </em>does not collocate with<em> wind 
				</em>and<em> strong </em>does not collocate with <em>snow.</em></li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong><em>antonymy</em></strong></span><br />For example:<br />The words 
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>big</strong></em></span> and
					<span class="style_black"><em><strong>small</strong></em></span> 
					have opposite meanings so they are considered antonyms.&nbsp; 
					As we saw with synonyms (above) however, collocation plays a 
					part here, too and not all antonym pairs can be used in the 
					same way.&nbsp; We allow:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a thin line and a thick line</em><br />but not<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a thin dog and a thick dog</em></li>
				<li><em><span class="style_black"><strong>hyponymy</strong></span><br />
				</em>For example:<br />The word <em>building</em> includes:<br /><em><span class="style_black"><strong>house, church, school, 
					office block, cottage, palace</strong></span></em> and many 
					more so:<br /><em>building </em>is the hypernym or superordinate and the words 
					for types of buildings are all hyponyms of each other.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are many more relationships between lexemes which can be 
				identified and analysed but the four above are all you need (for 
				now).<br />The final idea in this section is the term <strong>morpheme</strong>.<br />If we look at this word, for example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			<span class="style_black"><em><strong>unprintable</strong></em></span><br />we can see that it is made up of three parts:
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>un</strong></em></span>,
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>print</strong></em></span> 
				and <span class="style_black"><em><strong>able</strong></em></span>, 
				and all three are referred to as morphemes but there are two 
				sorts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>un<br /></strong></em>
				</span>is a unit of meaning but it cannot 
					stand alone and always appears with other morphemes so we 
					call it a <strong>bound morpheme</strong>.<br />Other examples are: 
				<em>ize</em> in <em>computerize</em>,
					<em>dis</em> in <em>disorganised</em> and so on.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong><em>print</em></strong></span><br />is a unit of meaning which forms part of our example but it 
					can also stand alone as a single lexeme so we call it a
					<strong>free morpheme</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There's a good deal more to be said about morphemes, of course, 
				but this is enough for now.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p><br />The revised CELTA syllabus (from July 2021) now distinguishes 
				between style and register instead of just talking about 
				register as if it included style.<br />Briefly:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>Style</strong></em></span><br />refers to a level of formality which is appropriate to the 
					setting and the relationship between speaker and hearer or 
					writer and reader.<br />There are a number of different ways to classify styles and 
					the one used on this site distinguishes between<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>frozen style (used for notices and quotations etc.)</li>
					<li>formal style (used for lectures, speeches, technical 
					presentations etc.)</li>
					<li>consultative style (used for professional interactions 
					such as those between doctors and patients, teachers and 
					students etc.)</li>
					<li>casual style (used between friends and relationships 
					with little concern for formal accuracy and so on)</li>
					<li>intimate style (used between people who are very close 
					and share a lot of information).</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><strong><em>Register</em></strong></span><br />refers to the topic and setting in which the language is 
					used which may require, for example, specialist vocabulary 
					and ways of expressing things.<br />Many of these are to do with professional settings but there 
					are also special registers attached to sports, hobbies and 
					other areas of interest which require the use of some 
					special vocabulary and language use.<br /></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Style and register are different as you see but they are often 
				considered in tandem because certain registers such as business 
				meetings, professional consultations, lectures and so on often 
				require language specific to the topic but also a certain level 
				of stylistic formality.&nbsp; That is not to say that one cannot 
				use an informal style in a lecture in the register of, say, 
				scientific enquiry, or that one cannot use a consultative style 
				between people talking about football (as in a TV interview, for 
				example).</p>

			<p>Phonology is the study of the sounds of a particular language 
			(not all languages; that's phonetics), in our case, English.</p>
			<p>Here, too, there are some basic ideas you need to be clear about 
			and a CELTA course will focus on them.&nbsp; This is a technical 
			area and you are not expected to be able to transcribe the sounds of 
			English accurately or to be able to analyse some of the most 
			difficult areas of connected speech but there are a few terms that 
			you need to be familiar with or you won't be able to talk or read 
			about pronunciation (or teach it) successfully.<br />
			(If you are taking the Trinity CertTESOL course, more will be 
			expected of you in this area because a major difference between the 
			two courses concerns the thoroughness with which pronunciation is 
			dealt with on the Trinity courses.)</p>
			<p>Here are the key terms everyone needs to know:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Phonemes</strong></dt>
				<dd>are the sounds of a language.&nbsp; We make a difference 
				between them and the letters which spell words for the simple 
				reason that English (in common with many languages) does not 
				have a one-to-one relationship between spelling and 
				pronunciation.&nbsp; For example, all these words end with the 
				same sound:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cough, 
				laugh, graph, ruff</strong></em></span><br />
				that sound is written as /f/ between two lines to show that we 
				are representing the sound not the letter.&nbsp; All phonemes 
				are written that way so we get, for example, /t/, /h/, /d/ and 
				so on.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Vowels</strong></dt>
				<dd>you may think that English has five vowels, a, e, i, o and 
				u, and that is what most people believe.&nbsp; However, there 
				are in fact 21 sounds in English which are classified as vowels.&nbsp; 
				They are the sounds underlined in red:<br />
				<em>
				<span class="style_black"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g</strong></span><strong><span class="auto-style44">o</span><span class="style_black">, 
				f</span><span class="auto-style44">i</span><span class="style_black">nd, f</span><span class="auto-style44">a</span><span class="style_black">th</span><span class="auto-style44">er</span><span class="style_black">, 
				ch</span><span class="auto-style44">oo</span><span class="style_black">se, br</span><span class="auto-style44">i</span><span class="style_black">ng, 
				happ</span><span class="auto-style44">y</span><span class="style_black">, h</span><span class="auto-style44">ow</span></strong></em> 
				and many more, of course.<br />
				All lexemes in English contain vowel sounds even if they do not 
				contain vowels in their spellings.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Consonants</strong></dt>
				<dd>There are 24 of these in English and most are represented by 
				familiar letter as phonemes so, for example /t/ is the sound at 
				the beginning of <em>top</em> and /p/ is the sound at the end.<br />
				A few consonants have special symbols such as /ʃ/, /ð/ and /ʒ/ 
				but they are not difficult to learn.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Connected speech and citation forms</strong></dt>
				<dd>If someone asks you to say an isolated word out loud you 
				will usually opt for what is called the citation form so, for 
				example, if you are asked to say <span class="style_black"><em>
				<strong>to, for, been</strong></em></span> out loud, they will 
				sound the same as <span class="style_black"><em><strong>too, 
				two, four, bean</strong></em></span>.<br />
				However, if you say the words in a sentence such as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's <span class="style_black"><strong>
				been to</strong></span> the shops <span class="style_black">
				<strong>for two</strong></span> tins of
				<span class="style_black"><strong>beans</strong></span> and
				<span class="style_black"><strong>four</strong></span> sausages</em><br />
				you can hear that the pronunciations of the words is now altered 
				and they do not sound the same.<br />
				The reason for this is complicated but the result is that we 
				have what are called <strong>weak forms</strong> of <em>to, for</em> 
				and <em>been</em> in the connected speech example.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Stress</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to how loud and long a part of a word or a word is 
				pronounced.&nbsp; So, for example, on a word like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>happiness</em><br />
				the stress falls at the beginning on the 'a' and we can 
				represent that as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>h</em><strong><em>A</em></strong><em>ppiness</em><br />
				but on a word like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>impossible</em><br />
				the stress is on the 'o' and that looks like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>imp</em><strong><em>O</em></strong><em>ssible</em><br />
				That's <strong>word stress</strong>.<br />
				In whole sentences, too, we hear the same sort of patterns so, 
				for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>What have you done?</em><br />
				is stressed on the final word so we can represent it as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What have you </em> <strong><em>DONE</em></strong>?<br />
				and that's <strong>sentence stress</strong>.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Intonation</strong></dt>
				<dd>refers to how your voice tone rises and falls on certain 
				parts of what you say.&nbsp; For example, if you say the word
				<em>Really</em> as the response to something you hear you can 
				sound:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; excited (<em>Really!&uarr;</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bored (<em>Really&rarr;</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sceptical (<em>Re↑ally&darr;</em>)<br />
				and so on.<br />
				When we make a question, too, we often rely on intonation to 
				make the function clear so<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's your car?</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's your car</em><br />
				will have different intonation patterns (rising at the end of 
				the first sentence and falling at the end of the second).</dd>

			about pronunciation but ...</p>

			<p>Many people have made long, honourable careers out of the study 
			of what is known as comparative linguistics.<br />
			You don't need to do that but you should have a basic understanding 
			of how English works and how it is similar to or different from your 
			learners' language(s).</p>
			<p>Languages differ, obviously, in their grammar, pronunciation and 
			lexis in many ways (some bewilderingly so).&nbsp; However, there are 
			also major differences and similarities to be aware of:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Lexis<br />
				The English lexicon is, like those of many languages, drawn from a range 
				of influences which have contributed to it at one time or 
				another.<br />
				For modern English the picture looks like this:<br />
			<img alt="influences" src="../../../imagesgraphics/modern_english_influences.png" /><br />
				(Eponyms and toponyms are words named after people, businesses 
				and places such as <em>hoover, wellington boots </em>and so on.)<br />
				This has consequences for learners of English, obviously:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>Speakers of Germanic languages (Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch, 
				Flemish, German, Danish and more) will have little trouble 
				identifying short, common words such as <em>book, house, land, 
				finger, thing</em> and hundreds more.</li>
					<li>Speakers of Romance languages, based on Latin or akin to 
				French such as Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Romanian and 
				associated ones) will be at home with words (often for abstract 
				nouns) derived from French or Latin such as <em>conversation, 
				argument, atmosphere, entertainment, frequent </em>and so on although 
				not all of them will be similar in all those languages.</li>
					<li>Speakers of Greek will have very little to draw on because 
				most of the lexicon is completely different and speakers of 
				unrelated languages such as the Chinese languages, Korean, Thai 
				and Japanese will have almost nothing to draw on except a few 
					unusual loan words like <em>origami, bonsai, ginseng, lychee, typhoon</em> 
					etc.&nbsp; Speakers of Thai will have nothing at all to 
				draw on.<br />For all these learners, acquiring vocabulary in English is very 
				difficult.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Grammar<br />
				Although English derives some 60% of its words from either 
				French of one kind or another or Latin, the grammar of the 
				language is much more Germanic.<br />
				Speakers of Germanic languages, such as Dutch, Swedish, German, 
				Danish and Norwegian will, therefore, find learning grammatical 
				structures a good deal easier than people whose first languages 
				are in a different group such as Romance languages (e.g., 
				French, Italian, Spanish, Romanian), Greek, Slavic languages 
				(e.g., Polish, Russian, Czech etc.) and so on.<br />
				Of course, people whose first languages are wholly unconnected 
				to English such as speakers of Chinese languages, Korean, 
				Japanese, Thai, Arabic, Turkish and so on will find very little 
				to help them either in the grammar or the lexis of English.</li>
				<li>Word order<br />In English we do the following:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>we order the main parts of a sentence as Subject&ndash;Verb–Object 
				as in<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man | drove | the car</em><br />Other languages do things differently and Japanese, Turkish and 
				Hungarian, for example usually have Subject–Object–Verb as in<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man | the car | drove</em></li>
					<li>we place the adjective almost always before the noun so we 
				have:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the incredible expense</em><br />not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the expense incredible</em><br />but many other languages, including French, 
					Spanish, Thai, Russian, 
				Czech, Polish and others place the adjective after the noun.</li>
					<li>we place the preposition before the noun phrase so we have<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over the bridge</em><br />not<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bridge over</em><br />and that's why they are called prepositions.<br />Other languages, such as Turkish, Japanese and Korean do the 
				reverse and have postpositions as in:<br />&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					I walked the house past</em></li>
					<li>we have two ways to show possession or origin.&nbsp; We can 
				say:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the government's policy</em><br />or<br />
					<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the policy of the government</em><br />and there are complicated rules to decide which one to use.<br />Most other languages settle for one or the other.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Pronunciation<br />
				As we saw above, English has 21 vowel sounds and 24 consonant 
				sounds and many of them such as the way we pronounce <em>th</em> 
				or <em>sh</em> do not exist in other languages.<br />
				Many languages have sounds that do not exist in English, too, or 
				they make distinctions between the ways some sounds (such as /p/ 
				or /t/) are pronounced which English speakers do not recognise.<br />
				On the other hand, many languages have sounds which are very 
				similar to the one which are used in English and with these, 
				nobody will have too much difficulty, although there are 
				subtleties in, for example, the way the letter '<em>r</em>' is 
				pronounced that are part of our being able to recognise a 
				foreign accent in English.</li>
				<li>Morphemes<br />
				We saw above that English can build words from morphemes to make 
				longer and more complex lexemes.&nbsp; Other languages, such as 
				German and Turkish do this much more enthusiastically but some, 
				such as the Chinese languages, hardly do it at all.</li>

			<p>There is some confusion, not least in the CELTA syllabus, 
			concerning what counts as an approach, a strategy and a procedure 
			in teaching methodology.<br />
			The line taken on this site, which may well differ from what your 
			tutors say, is:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Approach</strong><br />
				<img alt="approach" height="133" src="../../../images/approach_plane_landing200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>refers to having two underlying theories:</dd>
				<dd><ol>
					<li><em><span class="style_black"><strong>a theory of what 
					language</strong></span></em><br />
					It can be two things in the main:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>that language is a system of structures which include 
					phonemes, morphemes, words, phrases, clauses and sentences 
					which are built up into meaningful language</li>
						<li>that language is a means of communication and can be 
					analysed in terms of social meanings dependent on the 
					speakers' intentions, roles, settings and so on</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>a theory of how 
					learning happens</strong></em></span><br />
					Here, too, we two opposing (and incompatible) views:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>learning is a process of encountering the language in a 
					meaningful context, thinking about it, trying out hypotheses 
					and eventually acquiring the systems and the communicative 
					skills you need</li>
						<li>learning is a process of being exposed to carefully 
					graded and selected language demonstrating its structures 
					and then, through a process of repetition and drilling 
					acquiring the habit of producing correctly formed utterances</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</dd><dt><strong>Strategy</strong><br />
				<img alt="chess" height="133" src="../../../images/chess200a.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>refers to hypotheses about how 
				the mind works and how people acquire a second language.&nbsp; 
				There are two connected strings:<ol>
					<li><em><span class="style_black"><strong>strategies for 
					learning</strong></span></em><br />
					These can be, for example, learning word lists, using 
					grammar books, speaking as much as possible, listening to 
					native speakers and noticing how they use language, reading 
					widely in English, attending to the grammar and seeing how 
					it differs from the learners' first language(s) and so on.</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>strategies for 
					teaching</strong></em></span><br />
					These can be, for example, presenting language in clear 
					social contexts, using reading and listening texts to 
					highlight lexis and grammar, focusing on skills to attack 
					texts, encouraging learners to be autonomous, making sure 
					concepts are understood, encouraging habitual responses in 
					language and so on.</li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Procedure</strong><br />
				<img alt="procedure" height="133" src="../../../images/process200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
				<dd>Here we are on thin ice because some use the term to refer 
				to how a lesson is structured, which can be in three main ways:<ol>
					<li><em><span class="style_black"><strong>PPP</strong></span></em><br />
					This stands for Presentation–Practice–Production and simply 
					means that we can follow that procedure by presenting a new 
					language item in context, getting learners to practise using 
					it in a controlled way and then allowing them and 
					encouraging them to use the language for a communicative 
					purpose such as saying something personal in the language.</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>TTT</strong></em></span><br />
					This stands for Test–Teach–Test and means that we follow a 
					different procedure, first testing what the learners can do 
					in the language or with a skill, so both they and we are 
					alerted to what needs to be learned, then teaching it 
					(perhaps using a PPP approach) and finally testing again to 
					see and show how much has been learned.</li>
					<li><span class="style_black"><em><strong>TBL</strong></em></span><br />
					This stands for Task-based Learning and involves a rather 
					different procedure.&nbsp; It can be<ul class="smallgreybullet">
						<li>setting a task (with a model if necessary), allowing 
						the learners to carry it out with the language and 
						skills they already master and then filling in the gaps, 
						as it were, with teaching of the language they should 
						have used<br />
						or</li>
						<li>teaching the language learners will need, setting 
						the task and then encouraging the learners to use the 
						language to achieve the outcomes</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Other people, who may include your tutors, use the term procedure 
			much more loosely to refer to classroom techniques such as 
				using dictation, drilling, setting sentence-completion tasks and 
				a host of other ideas which you will learn about on your course.&nbsp; 
			There is nothing wrong with using the term procedure in that way but 
			we should be clear about what we mean when we say something like <em>
			Try this procedure.</em></p>
			<p>There are a number of guides to teaching many areas of the 
			language on this site.<br />
			Go to either the
			<a href="../../../inservice/inservice_index.html" target="_blank">
			in-service</a> or the
			<a href="../../initial_plus_index.html" target="_blank">initial plus</a> 
			training indexes to select what interests you now.&nbsp; The latter 
			has guides to Teaching: background, methodology and techniques and 
			that's an excellent place to start but don't try to do it all at 
			once.&nbsp; Familiarise yourself with what's there and come back later.</p>
