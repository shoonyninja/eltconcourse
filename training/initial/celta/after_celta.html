			<h2>Congratulations on passing!</h2>
			<p>Whether you passed with an A, B or C grade matters a bit at the

			little while.&nbsp; All that will matter then is your commitment, 
			knowledge and skill.<br />
			Once you have recovered from the celebration party, you need to get 
			a bit serious and decide what to do with your shiny new certificate.&nbsp; 
			This is a page of advice from someone who has been training and 
			employing teachers for a long time.<br />
			The intention here is to help you avoid the usual pitfalls.&nbsp; 
			You have a proper teaching certificate now, so can afford to be 
			slightly more demanding of potential employers and avoid the bandits 
			and slave masters.</p>
			<p>(Please don't post a photograph of your certificate online &ndash; 
			that just gives counterfeiters all the information they need to 
			clone it.)</p>

			<p>The choice is really between working in an English-speaking 
			environment (the UK, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada etc.) 
			or a non-English-speaking environment (just about everywhere else).</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>In an English-speaking country<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>Schools and other institutions in countries where 
					English is the first language are more demanding.<br />
					They operate surrounded by native speakers of English so 
					will usually only recruit people with a serious 
					qualification and will also demand experience and even a 
					specialism.</li>
					<li>Getting a first teaching job in this environment is 
					difficult but it is not impossible, especially during the 
					peak summer season when many thousands of students, usually 
					children or teenagers attend summer schools in 
					English-speaking countries.</li>
					<li>Getting a teaching position that is a year-round 
					proposition is more challenging because you are 
					competing with people who have more experience than you, 
					better qualifications and a track record.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In a non-English-speaking country<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>Depending where you are, schools and institutions do not 
					have a huge pool of English speakers to draw on so 
					may be less demanding.</li>
					<li>Teaching in many countries is a combination of 
					in-company work, teaching children or teaching adults on 
					site.<br />
					Be prepared, therefore, to be teaching children 
					and teenagers and having to travel to offices and businesses 
					around town to do your job.</li>
					<li>Many teachers are able to supplement their school 
					teaching with private, one-to-one or one-to-small-group 
					teaching.</li>
					<li>South America, North Africa, Southern Europe, especially 
					Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece, Eastern Europe, 
					especially the Baltic states, Russia and the Ukraine, and 
					Pacific Rim Asian nations all have 
					huge language teaching markets and thousands of private and 
					state institutions.<br />
					There are also opportunities in other European countries 
					although competition for jobs is more severe and a knowledge 
					of the local language often a prerequisite.</li>
					<li>If you want to gain useful experience and can afford not 
					to be paid, volunteering in many countries is a possibility 
					and, as a CELTA holder, you are at a distinct advantage.&nbsp; 
					Be prepared to work in resource-poor environments but the 
					personal rewards are often a compensation.</li>
					<li>Large cities like Paris or Berlin are often home to considerable numbers of 
					ex-patriot English speakers so competition will be fiercer.</li>
					<li>Some countries, such as Japan and Korea, require at 
					least a 1st university degree before you are allowed to 
					teach.&nbsp; If you don't have one, forget it for now.</li>
					<li>Salaries in the Middle East are often competitive 
					so schools and institutions there will often have no need to 
					employ the newly qualified.</li>
					<li>State, rather than private, institutions usually offer 
					better conditions and salaries but, by the same token, have 
					less need to recruit the newly qualified.</li>
					<li>Generally speaking, small or medium-sized towns with 
					only a few language schools present the best opportunities 
					for the newly qualified.&nbsp; That is not a universal rule 
					because large cities, such as Athens or Barcelona, often 
					have concomitantly large numbers of language schools all 
					looking for qualified teachers.</li>

			<p>A brief internet search will discover lots of tales of woe from 
			people who failed to check out what they were being employed to do 
			and where exactly they would be working.&nbsp; Some of these are 
			true horror stories.<br />
			The moral is that you need to check out any institution that offers 
			you work very carefully.&nbsp; There are bandits in ELT just as 
			there are in many other fields.</p>
			<p>If the environment is familiar to you (e.g., if you are a citizen 
			of the country where you want to work), then you will know the 
			pitfalls already and be prepared to look carefully at any contract 
			or statement of conditions, pay, holiday entitlement etc. that you 
			are sent or given.&nbsp; If you are not offered such a document, be 
			very careful and suspicious indeed.<br />
			In an ideal world, you will be able to visit a potential employer in 
			person and talk to other members of the teaching staff.&nbsp; That 
			is, however, often not practical so asking good questions is the 
			next best approach.<br />
			In unfamiliar cultures (to you), you need to be careful to make sure 
			that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the salary will allow you to live reasonably comfortably if 
				not in much luxury</li>
				<li>your hours of work will be set out clearly</li>
				<li>you will be guaranteed a minimum and maximum number of 
				teaching hours per month or week</li>
				<li>the school or institution will have a conventional grievance 
				procedure and equal opportunities policy</li>
				<li>you will get some time off</li>
				<li>the employer will help you find accommodation</li>
				<li>your duties and working environment are clearly set out and 
				acceptable to you</li>
				<li>you will have the support of a properly qualified academic 
				manager and/or colleagues and there may even be an in-house 
				development programme</li>
				<li>the school 
				or institution will be a member of some sort of 
				local professional organisation or association</li>
				<li>the school has a reasonable resource base of books, 
				supplementary materials and equipment</li>
				<li>you are reasonably confident that the culture, language and 
				local conditions will be something you can tolerate if not 
				actively enjoy encountering</li>
				<li>you are prepared to teach the sorts of students the school 
				or institution recruits</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If a potential employer cannot give you the information in 1 to 
			10 
			above, <strong>do not sign a contract</strong>.</p>
			<p>Below there are some selected links to websites where 
			English Language Teaching jobs are advertised.&nbsp; We have not 
			included (or have removed) any sites which seem to be hooks to get people 
			to sign up for unaccredited and useless qualifications from which 
			they will gain nothing of much value.</p>

			<p>There are lots of websites out here which will give you useful 
			advice about how to write a good CV.&nbsp; Use them by all means but 
			keep it personal.&nbsp; Your CV should reflect you rather than just 
			be a standard document.<br />
			The following is based partially on the results of a large survey of 
			employers asking what they prioritise when reading a CV (2011 Orange 
			County Resume Survey).<br />
			That survey found (among much else) that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Nearly 90% of respondents want either a chronological (most 
				recent first) list or a combination of skills and experience by 
				type plus a chronological list.</li>
				<li>Nearly 100% of employers want either a Microsoft Word 
				document or a PDF file.</li>
				<li>90%+ of employers agreed that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_black">
				<em>A resume is a job-seeker's 1st interview</em></span>.</li>
				<li>Almost nobody wanted a CV in an email.&nbsp; Make it an 
				attachment <strong>to</strong> an email.</li>
				<li>Half the employers asked said they read cover letters.&nbsp; 
				A quarter said they ignored them.&nbsp; Keep yours short.</li>
				<li>80% of respondents reported that they spend less than one 
				minute reading a CV.&nbsp; Organisation is everything so people 
				know where to look for the key information.</li>
				<li>Employers are consistently unimpressed by generic CVs.&nbsp; 
				The CV you submit must be specific to English Language Teaching.</li>
				<li>Proofreading, spelling and grammatical errors in CVs were 
				cited frequently as reasons for not inviting people to the next 
				stage.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here's a summary:</p>
			<ul class="greybullet">
				<li>Don't forget to include your personal details (it has been 
				known):<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>name</li>
					<li>address</li>
					<li>phone number</li>
					<li>email (if your email address is something silly, 
					consider setting up a more serious one for this purpose)</li>
					<li>include your age and a photograph</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Put the most recent qualifications first.&nbsp; Divide this 
				under subheadings:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>ELT-relevant 
				qualifications</li>
					<li>Other qualifications</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Then list your work experience.&nbsp; Divide this under 
				subheadings:<ul class="smallgreybullet">
					<li>ELT-relevant experience</li>
					<li>Other experience</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Keep it clear and be direct.&nbsp; The people reading your 
				CV will have limited time available and will read lots of CVs in 
				a day.&nbsp; They do not want to hunt around for the data they 
				need.</li>
				<li>Use bullet points, subheadings and lists rather than dense 
				prose.&nbsp; Any paragraph over about 50 words is likely to be 
				skimmed or skipped.</li>
				<li>Keep the CV short.&nbsp; A CV longer than two pages will 
				contain irrelevance and be irritating to read.</li>
				<li>Avoid the passive voice and use active material process 
				verbs such as <em>organise, learn, develop, gain, use</em> etc.</li>
				<li>If you must include things like hobbies and your leisure 
				activities, put these right at the end so people can ignore them 
				easily.&nbsp; They usually will.</li>
				<li>Include two referees.</li>
				<li>Proofread the document and then proofread it again and then 
				get someone else to proofread it.<br />
				<strong>CVs with typing errors, spelling mistakes and poor grammar will 
				be automatically rejected by most schools.</strong></li>
				<li>Submit the document as a PDF or Microsoft Word file so 
				everyone can read and print it easily.&nbsp; Do not restrict 
				document access with a password.</li>
				<li>Do not name your document <em>CV</em> or <em>Document 1</em>.&nbsp; 
				Give it a name which reflects its content such as <em>
				Joe_Bloggs_CV.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Never, ever, inflate your qualifications or invent 
				one you do not have</strong>.&nbsp; Even suggesting your first 
				degree was a 2.1 not a 2.2 constitutes fraud and may lead to 
				prosecution.</li>

			<p>After you have been working as a full-time English language 
			teacher for a while, you will know if this is the career for you.<br />
			If it is, you need to consider what to do next to build on your 
			initial CELTA teaching qualification and progress to senior teacher 
			or academic manager positions.&nbsp; You may even want to branch out 
			and get into management generally, teacher training, publishing and 
			so on.<br />
			To do that, you will need one of two qualifications, preferably 
			both:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A diploma-level qualification.&nbsp; The two which are 
				recognised as benchmarks worldwide are the Cambridge Assessment 
				English Delta and 
				the Trinity DipTESOL.&nbsp;
				<a href="../../inservice/delta/delta_index.html" target="_blank">A section of 
				this site is devoted to training for the Cambridge Delta</a>.<br />
				Both these qualifications are very practical and require high 
				levels of teaching skills, which are regularly assessed both 
				internally and externally, in addition to a thorough 
				understanding of background theory.</li>
				<li>An MA in TESOL or something similar.&nbsp; Such courses are 
				quite expensive, usually, but there are many with on-line 
				modules and some wholly delivered at a distance.<br />
				These are usually not recognised teaching qualifications <em>per 
				se</em> because they do not contain assessed teaching practice.&nbsp; 
				A Master's degree is, however, a very important qualification if 
				your ambition is to train others or manage teaching teams.</li>
