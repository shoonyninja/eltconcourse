			<p>Nothing can properly replace live teaching of real students 
			observed by an experienced and knowledgeable tutor and these short guides 
			are not intended to do that.<br />
			On your CELTA course, you are going to do a good deal of teaching, 
			possibly, depending on your course programme, starting with mini-lessons and working your way up to longer 
			sessions where a range of skills needs to be demonstrated.<br />
			Over a course, you must be assessed teaching for a minimum of six 
			hours and observe more experienced practitioners for a further six 
			hours.</p>
			<p>These short guides cover the most important things you need to think 
			about when you are planning and preparing to teach and when you are 
			teaching.&nbsp; Each part is quite short a we will try to keep it simple, practical and 
			accessible.<br />
			There are tasks to do as you go along so have a pen and paper handy.<br />
			There are a number of parts to this mini-course because there's a lot to cover so 
			use the menu on the left to select the sections you need now.<br />
			There are other links on the left which take you to the indexes of 
			teaching-related guides in the initial plus section of the site.<br />
			There is also a link, the last one, to the sister course concerned 
			with what you need to know about the grammar of English for an 
			initial training course.&nbsp; It opens in a new tab.</p>
			<p>Before you embark on any of the sections, we need to get two 
			things straight: the difference between telling and showing and the 
			ability to recognise which part of a lesson is serving what 
			function.</p>

			<p>There are, if you look for them, quite a lot of videos of people 
			teaching various aspects of the language on the web.&nbsp; 
			Unfortunately, few are completely free or do not require you to sign 
			up and register before you can view them.&nbsp; Many are commercial 
			undertakings designed to make a little money (yours in this case).&nbsp; 
			Even more unfortunately, some videos (and we will mention no names) 
			are very poor examples of teaching methodology although they may be 
			useful to help you recognise what you should avoid doing.&nbsp; If 
			you compare what you see with the advice below, you'll be able to 
			detect them.</p>
			<p>The other issue to get out of the way here is how learning 
			(yours) on a CELTA course (or most other initial training 
			programmes) happens or is intended to happen.<br />
			Simply put, CELTA-level courses are a form of on-the-job training.&nbsp; 
			Less politely, it is called sitting at Nellie's knee and even less 
			politely monkey-see-monkey-do training.<br />
			You are expected to watch how someone else (usually one of your 
			tutors or someone on a video) does a bit of teaching and then 
			encouraged to emulate what you have seen.&nbsp; Copy it, in other words.&nbsp; 
			This sort of training can be very effective if two conditions are 
			met:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>What you observe is a master practitioner at work, not a 
				novice or a poor teacher.</li>
				<li>You are helped by a good trainer to notice the salient parts 
				of the behaviour you are observing and ignore the peripheral 
				matters.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>On good courses, both these criteria will be met; on others they 
			will probably not.<br />
			You may also hear your tutors talk darkly of something called loop 
			input.&nbsp; Briefly, what this means is that the content of the 
			training you receive is relevant to what you need to know and is 
			presented in a way that you can emulate in the classroom.<br />
			For 
			example, if you are learning how to develop reading skills in the 
			classroom, you may be given a text on reading skills and a set of 
			tasks, the types of which you are encouraged to copy with your 
			learners.&nbsp; In this way, not only is the material relevant but 
			the way the material is used is an exemplar of how to handle reading 
			texts in the classroom.&nbsp; For more, see Woodward (2003).<br />
			Loop input training is frequently used on initial training courses 
			(and its use is even more often claimed, despite appearances) and 
			good trainers can adapt and present things in a way that acts both 
			as a source of information about teaching and an example of how to 
			teach.&nbsp; Not all trainers are actually that good but that is 
			another matter.</p>
			<p>However, this is not the only way to learn and this guide takes 
			the view that you an intelligent and insightful person who can read 
			and understand some simple advice and put it into practice without 
			having to sit at someone else's knee and be shown what to do.<br />
			If that is also how you see yourself, read on.</p>

					<h2>Phases of a lesson</h2>

			</table>
			
			<p>Good lessons are not random collections of activities, they are 
			organised into identifiable phases so the learners know what they 
			should be doing, when they should be doing it and why they are doing 
			it.&nbsp; As an observer, you should be able to identify virtually 
			instantly what phase of the lesson has been reached and what its 
			purposes are.&nbsp; When you are observed, the same criterion 
			applies.<br />
			Although the ordering of phases is not set in stone, with different 
			lessons following different overall outline procedures and ordering 
			phases differently, most of the following will occur in all lessons.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Setting up and focusing:<br />
				<img alt="focus" height="133" src="../../../images/woman_focus200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This phase comes at the beginning of nearly all lessons and has 
				three purposes:<ol class="auto-style46">
					<li>to establish a pleasant and unthreatening learning 
					atmosphere</li>
					<li>to let the learners know what the aims of the lesson are</li>
					<li>to focus the learners on the topic of the lesson or the 
					scene in which the language will be set</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Task setting<br />
				<img alt="task" height="133" src="../../../images/teaching_point_board200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This phase will often be repeated at different times and with 
				different purposes for each task or activity but it will be 
				signalled clearly to learners so they know what the task is and 
				what it's for.&nbsp; The phase will be focused on the need to 
				give the learners a reason for doing anything.</li>
				<li>Monitoring<br />
				<img alt="monitor" height="133" src="../../../images/monitoring200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This phase has two purposes and two procedures to match:<ol class="auto-style46">
					<li>check monitoring to make sure the learners are on task 
					and the instruction has been understood and followed</li>
					<li>support monitoring in which the teacher's role is to 
					supply help where needed, keep people focused and help the 
					process along so that everyone is contributing to the best 
					of their ability</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Feedback<br />
				<img alt="feedback" height="133" src="../../../images/teaching_seminar200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This phase is also of two types:<ol class="auto-style46">
					<li>feedback <strong>to</strong> the learners on what they 
					have done and how they have performed</li>
					<li>feedback <strong>from</strong> the learners to the 
					teacher so it is clear whether it is safe to move on</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Framing or transition signalling<br />
				<img alt="fames" src="../../../images/frames200.jpg" /><br />
				This is a short phase which will occur repeatedly.&nbsp; Its 
				function is to alert the learners to the fact that one phase has 
				finished and another is about to begin.&nbsp; It will also often 
				be combined with a re-focusing phase.</li>
				<li>Re-capping and summarising<br />
				<img alt="light" height="133" src="../../../images/light_pear200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
				This phase, too, may be repeated and usually forms the final 
				phase of a good lesson because it gives the learners the 
				opportunity to see what they have learned and identify the 
				important elements of the lesson.&nbsp; More generalised 
				feedback to and from the learners is often part of this phase.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you can see, lots of different things happen in classrooms and 
			the mass of data you are exposed to if you watch a good teacher at 
			work can sometimes be overwhelming so you need to break things down 
			as we have done here to get the wood out of the way of the trees.</p>

			<p>How did you do?<br />
			The test was not very difficult and this course covers each of the phases 
			you identified and elaborates a little about how you should 
			conduct the various phases of a lesson.<br />
			At the beginning of an initial training course, you will probably not be asked 
			to conduct more than one or two phases but later on, you will have 
			to do all of them.</p>
