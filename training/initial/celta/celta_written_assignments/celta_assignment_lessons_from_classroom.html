			<h2>The purpose of the assignment</h2>
			<p>The CELTA handbook explains that this assignment allows you to 
			demonstrate that you can:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bluebullet">note your own teaching strengths and 
				weaknesses in different situations in light of feedback from 
				learners, teachers and teacher educators</li>
				<li class="bluebullet">identify which ELT areas of knowledge 
				and skills you need further development in</li>
				<li class="bluebullet">describe in a specific way how you 
				might develop your ELT knowledge and skills beyond the course</li>
				<li class="bluebullet">use written language that is clear, 
				accurate and appropriate to the task</li>
			</ul>

			</table>
			<p>Your centre will probably give you a set of instructions for your 
			assignments.&nbsp; You'd be foolish to ignore these.<br />
			What follows is generic advice.<br />
			In this assignment, you are pretty much on your own in terms of 
			content but the structure is predictable from its purposes (above).<br />
			This assignment has two main 
			parts.&nbsp; You do not need an introduction because it is clear 
			what it is about.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="one" height="142" src="../images/one.jpg" width="93" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style5">
					<h2>Identifying the strengths and weaknesses</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The first thing to do is to look back 
				over your feedback from tutors, students and fellow 
				participants.&nbsp; From that you need to identify strengths and 
				weaknesses and categorise them in some way.&nbsp; Here are some 
				suggestions:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>Planning and preparation.&nbsp; 
					Think about:<br /><em>Did you choose suitable material?<br />Was your planned timing accurate?<br />Was the lesson structure coherent and appropriate?</em></li>
				<li>Presenting language and skills:<br /><em>Were you clear?<br />Did you do the analysis before the lesson?<br />Did you explain clearly and accurately?<br />Did you focus on pronunciation adequately?</em></li>
				<li>Providing practice:<br /><em>Was there enough of it?<br />Did it work?<br />Did the learners get to use language relevant to them?<br />Was the level of challenge right?<br />How are your drilling skills?</em></li>
				<li>Classroom management:<br /><em>Were your instructions clear?<br />Did you organise the room appropriately?<br />Did you group learners well and re-group them unfussily?</em></li>
				<li>Handling error:<br /><em>Did you intervene at the right times?<br />Did you explain why something was wrong?<br />Did you give the learners the opportunity to correct 
					themselves and each other?</em></li>
				<li>Developing skills:<br /><em>Did you teach skills as well as practising them?<br />Do you understand the nature of skills work in all 4 areas?<br />Can you list three subskills in each of the four areas?</em></li>
				<li>Developing language systems 
					knowledge:<br /><em>Do you have a firm enough grasp of the grammar of English?<br />Can you explain grammatical points clearly and simply?<br />Can you define words unambiguously?<br />Can you transcribe phonemically?<br />Do you understand discourse?</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you would like to have that list as a form 
			for you to fill out,
			<a href="../../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_celta_self_evaluation.pdf" target="_blank">
			it's available here</a>.&nbsp; The form has extra spaces for you to 
			add areas of concern.<br />
			The form also has 4 numbers at the end of the second page for you to list the 
			priorities for action.&nbsp; After you've filled in the form, look through 
			it to identify what they should be.&nbsp; Anything with a tick in the
			<strong>Not usually</strong> and <strong>Never</strong> columns is 
			a suitable candidate.<br />
			The last page of the form is optional and focuses on the roles you 
			are able to take on the classroom and how good you think you are at 
			them.<br />
			The <a href="../../teaching/teacher_roles.html" target="_blank">
			guide to teacher roles</a> will tell you more about how you should 
			assess your abilities in this area. </p>

			<p>Before you submit your assignment, here's a quick checklist.&nbsp; 
			You can have this as a PDF file by clicking
			<a href="ELT_Concourse_CELTA_lessons_from_classroom_pre-submission_check.pdf" target="_blank">
			here</a> or you can mentally tick things off on the screen.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>I have drawn on:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>my own insight</li>
					<li>the responses of the learners</li>
					<li>my colleagues' feedback</li>
					<li>my tutors' feedback</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>I have discussed strengths and weaknesses in at least:<ol class="bluebullet">
					<li>planning and preparation</li>
					<li>presenting language and skills</li>
					<li>providing practice</li>
					<li>classroom management</li>
					<li>handling error</li>
					<li>developing skills</li>
					<li>developing systems knowledge and ability</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>I have prioritised three areas for development</li>
				<li>I have said why they are priorities</li>
				<li>I have said what actions I shall take</li>
				<li>I have said how I will measure my success in improving in 
				these areas</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now assess yourself against the criteria for the assignment.&nbsp; 
			Here they are again.&nbsp; Have you been able to:</p>
			<ul class="bluebullet">
				<li>note your own teaching strengths and 
				weaknesses in different situations in light of feedback from 
				learners, teachers and teacher educators</li>
				<li>identify which ELT areas of knowledge 
				and skills you need further development in</li>
				<li>describe in a specific way how you 
				might develop your ELT knowledge and skills beyond the course</li>
				<li>use written language that is clear, 
				accurate and appropriate to the task</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Your tutors will maintain a record of the work you have done on 
			the written assignments and will grade each of the criteria as 
			follows: NS (Not to Standard), S (at Standard) or S+ (above 
			Standard).<br />
			You need to aim consistently for S or S+ grades, naturally.</p>
			<p>If you have managed to tick all the items, well done.&nbsp; 
			Submit the assignment and move on.</p>
