	<h1>Understanding listening: the essentials</h1>
		<p>
		<img height="207" src="../../images/listen_children310.jpg" width="310" alt="listen" /></p>
		<p>There is a saying that for many people the opposite of speaking isn't 
		listening, it's waiting.&nbsp; However, for the purposes of this guide 
		we shall be considering listening as one of the four essential language 
		skills our students need to acquire.</p>
		<p>You acquired your first language(s) by listening.&nbsp; The ability 
		to hear and understand is fundamental to the ability to communicate and 
		learn in a foreign language, too.</p>
		<p>Some of what follows will be easier to understand if you have 
		followed the guide to reading.</p>
		<hr />

		</table>
		<p>Traditionally, listening has been used in the language classroom as a 
		vehicle for other kinds of learning and teaching.&nbsp; A listening text 
		can be used this way to introduce new items of vocabulary or to focus on 
		a particular structure.&nbsp; If it is used this way a lesson involving 
		a listening text would normally follow a predictable pattern.&nbsp; 
		(Note, by the way, the use of the term 'text' here.&nbsp; Texts are not 
		only written.)<br />
		Like 
		this:<br />
		<img alt="listening1" height="126" src="../../imagesgraphics/listening1.png" width="600" /><br />
		<span class="auto-style15">(Adapted from Field 1998:110)</span></p>
		<p>Starting from the left:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The teacher checks the text carefully to identify words the 
			learners would be unlikely to know and without which they will not 
			understand the text sufficiently.&nbsp; These words are then 
			introduced and practised before the listening part of the lesson 
			begins.&nbsp; At this point, too, the scene is usually set: e.g.,
			<em>You are going to listen to a telephone conversation between a 
			man and a woman.</em></li>
			<li>After or before first listening to the whole piece, learners are 
			set 
			'gist' questions to see if they have a global understanding of the 
			text: <em>What's it about? How many people are speaking? Where are 
			they?</em> etc.</li>
			<li>Then comes the listening proper and at this stage the text is 
			usually interrupted to allow the learners time to note answers to a 
			set of questions designed to test their detailed understanding such 
			as <em>Who does the caller want to talk to? Is that person at home? 
			What does the man offer to do?</em> <em>How does the woman respond?</em> etc.&nbsp; 
			These sorts of questions might also focus on the attitudes of the 
			speakers, e.g., <em>Is the man happy or disappointed?</em></li>
			<li>When that phase is satisfactorily completed, attention turns to 
			the language content of the text to focus on things like new 
			lexis, intonation patterns, politeness strategies, question 
			intonation and so on.&nbsp; Any language item at all can be 
			introduced this way.</li>
			<li>Finally, the listening text is revisited to ensure full understanding and 
			recall.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It is not being argued here that using a listening text in this way 
		is somehow 'wrong' or misguided.&nbsp; However, it has long been 
		realised that such procedures do not <span class="style_underline">teach</span> people how to 
		become better 
		listeners in a foreign language, they test how good they 
		already are.</p>

		<p>Now think about <em>how</em>  we listen to these things.&nbsp; Do we, for 
		example, try to hear and understand every word?&nbsp; Do we concentrate 
		hard or does our mind wander a little?&nbsp; Do we or can we interrupt 
		the speaker for clarification or repetition?&nbsp; Do we switch off at 
		times and monitor what we are hearing for something that interests us?<br />
		When you have an answer, 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'reading1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">click for some comments</a>.</p>
		
		<div id="reading1" style="visibility: hidden">
		<ol class="auto-style14">
			<li>When we are dealing with some listening texts, for example, a 
			travel announcement, a set of instructions or a waiter explaining 
			what's in a dish, it's important that we understand 
			nearly everything.&nbsp; If miss something important we may get the 
			wrong meal or the wrong platform.</li>
			<li>Some settings allow us to interrupt and ask for clarification or 
			repetition, e.g., the work instructions or the waiter's explanation.&nbsp; 
			Some don't so we have to be even more careful.</li>
			<li>With other texts, we can be a bit more careless.&nbsp; 
			Typically, in a news programme, people will listen quite casually 
			until a key word or two alerts them to an item of interest.&nbsp; 
			Then they switch listening mode and apply more attention.&nbsp; Travel 
			announcements are often dealt with this way.&nbsp; If we recognise 
			that the announcement does not concern our journey, we just switch 
			off until the next one comes along.</li>
			<li>Other texts require different approaches.&nbsp; 
			A TV soap opera or an anecdote might require our full attention but 
			as long as we get the gist of what's going on, it isn't usually 
			necessary (or possible) to catch every word and every nuance.&nbsp; 
			Typically, an anecdote is told face-to-face or over the phone so in 
			this case we also need occasionally to show interest and 
			comprehension.&nbsp; We do that through what's called back 
			channelling (grunts, exclamations, nods etc.)&nbsp; There's more on 
			that in the guide to speaking.</li>
			<li>Finally, some texts require our full attention, even to the 
			point of making notes to help us recall important information.&nbsp; 
			Here, we need particularly to pay attention to the speaker's 
			signals.&nbsp; For example, something beginning <em>Here's the key 
			point: ... </em>is likely to be important but something beginning
			<em>By the way, ... </em>can probably be safely ignored.</li>
			<li>Finally, some texts we don't even bother to listen to.&nbsp; We 
			may already know the lyrics of a song and we mostly know what an 
			answering service message is going to say so we switch off and wait 
			to hear the beep.&nbsp; Here, the opposite of speaking really is 
			waiting.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It's clear, then, that we deploy different skills depending on:</p>

	<dt><em><strong>Listening for information</strong></em></dt>
	<dd>This comes in three modes:<br />
	First, we can be listening to try to understand as much of the text as we 
	can.&nbsp; This will apply to a lecture or the waiter's explanation, for 
	example.<br />
	Second, we may be listening for key words to trigger more intensive 
	concentration.&nbsp; This occurs when we listen to a string of announcements 
	waiting for our flight or destination to be mentioned.<br />
	Third, we may be listening in a monitoring mode, getting the gist of 
	what we hear only, e.g., this news item is about sport, this one's about an 
	accident etc.&nbsp; We may do this until we hear something that catches our 
	attention and then we switch to a more intensive mode.</dd>
			<dt><strong><em>Listening for discourse clues</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>This kind of listening involves paying conscious attention to 
			what is being signalled by the speaker.&nbsp; There are examples 
			above about how this might happen in a lecture but it will also 
			happen in other kinds of texts.&nbsp; Anecdotes, for example, are 
			littered with time expressions to guide the hearer through the 
			sequence of events and may be punctuated by appeals for response of 
			confirmation such as <em>Don't you see? </em>or <em>You'll never 
			guess who it was ... .</em>&nbsp; Listening out for such things 
			makes the task of listening and understanding easier.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Intensive listening</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>In this mode we need to deploy our knowledge of the meaning and 
			pronunciation of the lexis as well as the way in which structures 
			such as tenses and their aspects inform us of the relationship between events and 
			things.</dd>
</dl><p>It isn't easy and it's made more complex by the need to switch between 
		listening modes when, for example, a key word triggers the anticipation 
		that something important or interesting will follow.</p>

		<p><span class="auto-style16">It is certainly not a simple either-or distinction.&nbsp; Most of 
		these strategies contain elements of both top-down and bottom-up 
		processing.&nbsp; In fact, of course, that's what good listeners do &ndash; 
		apply a combination of strategies to match the task.&nbsp; Here are some 
		notes:</span></p>
		<ol class="auto-style16">
			<li>The learner is applying top-down knowledge of the plot and 
			characters in a story so can safely predict that he/she need only 
			listen for the topic of a quarrel, not its existence.&nbsp; Then the 
			learner applies bottom-up processing to understand what the 
			characters are talking about.&nbsp; Knowledge of the plot will limit 
			the possibilities, too, and make guessing meaning easier.</li>
			<li>In this case, the learner is deploying knowledge of how 
			announcements are organised (top-down) and then using a 
			bottom-up strategy to identify the word 'Malaga' and the flight 
			number / time / gate number etc. that he/she knows will follow it.</li>
			<li>The listener is using a top-down strategy reliant on knowing the 
			structure of anecdotes (they follow a familiar pattern) and is 
			waiting for what's known as the coda (the final bit where tellers of 
			stories usually state their own feelings).&nbsp; That's the bit we 
			need to respond to; the rest can pass us by.</li>
			<li>This is mostly a bottom-up process.&nbsp; The listener is 
			working hard to understand every word if possible but will also be 
			using other skills to listen for names and departments, times and 
			deadlines etc.&nbsp; The use of strategies such as asking for 
			repetition / clarification is also a skill worth having, of course, 
			especially in situations like this.</li>
			<li>The listener is hardly listening to most of the song and may 
			just be monitoring for adjectives to describe feelings.&nbsp; That's 
			a bottom-up strategy concerned with recognising word class.&nbsp; 
			There's more on how we do this in <a href="reading_essentials.html">the guide 
			to reading skills</a>.</li>
			<li>This is bottom-up monitoring for particular words or 
			expressions.&nbsp; Top-down knowledge is telling the listener to 
			look out for images (flags, building etc.) to help the process.</li>
			<li>The listener has used what's known as generic knowledge (part of 
			top-down processing) to be aware that sports reports come at the end 
			of news reports, usually.&nbsp; If it's a TV programme, the listener 
			may also be looking out for sporting images.</li>
			<li>Listening to a lecture and monitoring for particular signals is 
			a bottom-up process and the sorts of things to listen for can be 
			taught.</li>
			<li>The listener is using top-down processing to deploy his/her 
			knowledge of the world of health services so is already alert to 
			what sorts of lexis to expect (<em>doctor, patient, ward, ambulance, 
			treat, care for</em> etc.) which will ease the strain of bottom-up 
			processing of the text.</li>
