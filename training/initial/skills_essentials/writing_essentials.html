	<h1>Understanding writing: the essentials</h1>
		<p>
		<img height="207" src="../../images/write_laptop_a310.jpg" width="310" alt="type" /></p>
		<p>This is a very brief overview and a roadmap of the area.&nbsp; There 
		are links at the end to help you understand specific aspects of writing.</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style18">

		</table>
		<p>Writing is not usually speech written down.&nbsp; Try filling in the 
		right-hand column in this table to alert you to the differences between 
		speaking and writing.&nbsp; Click on the table when you have done that.</p>
		<p>
		<img id="img1" alt="speaking vs. writing task" height="358" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,1,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'../../imagesgraphics/speakwritetaskans.png');" src="../../imagesgraphics/speakwritetask.png" width="700" /></p>
		<h3>To explain:</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Static and conservative</strong><br />
			<img alt="static" height="133" src="../../images/fixed_nail200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>Writers do not have anything like the range of paralinguistic 
			signals at their disposal that speakers have: they cannot point at 
			things, use facial expressions to emphasise or down-tone their 
			language or employ a full range of intonation and stress among other 
			devices.&nbsp; Punctuation, skilfully and accurately used, can help 
			but it's a poor substitute for the expression of subtlety and nuance 
			that speakers can express.<br />
			This means that most writing needs to be carefully constructed to 
			avoid ambiguity and ensure clarity of communication.<br />
			For example:<br />
			While a speaker can use stress and intonation patterns to make clear 
			what is meant by:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't speak to the man in the shop</em><br />
			writers have to rephrase the sentences to distinguish between:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the shop she did not speak to the man</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She did not speak to the man who was in the 
			shop<br />
			</em>Writing, for the most part also follows set conventions and the 
			use of vague terms such as
			<em>thingy, whatsitsname </em>or<em> stuff </em>is often not 
			appropriate so writers are obliged to hunt for the exact term, 
			replacing<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stuff went all over the joint<br />
			</em>with<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The material covered the entire area<br />
			</em>Speakers often make up words and this is not appropriate in 
			most kinds of writing so something like<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was really a question of un-bloody-doability<br />
			</em>might have to be re-phrased as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The action could definitely not be undone.</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Context</strong><br />
			<img alt="context" height="133" src="../../images/context200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>Writers do not general know where the reader will be or when 
			they will be reading so references that are common in spoken 
			language such as <em>tomorrow, over there, behind the tree</em> etc. 
			have to be fully worked out in writing.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			Instead of the spoken<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw her yesterday</em><br />
			the written equivalent might be<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw her the previous day</em><br />
			and may have to be even more explicit in stating a day and date.<br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just over there</em><br />
			may have a written equivalent of something like<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The object was nearby and to the left of 
			where she was standing</em><br />
			and even that may not be enough to be fully clear.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Permanence</strong><br />
			<img alt="permanent" height="133" src="../../images/statue_head200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>Writers have to much more careful than speakers to say what they 
			mean because writing, once passed on to others, cannot be retrieved.&nbsp; 
			There is little opportunity in writing to express a though such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, no, that's not what I meant</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have misunderstood me</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			You can't unsay anything in writing as politicians frequently 
			discover.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Interaction and feedback</strong><br />
			<img alt="feedback" height="133" src="../../images/question_girl200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>Speakers can respond instantly and accurately to the feedback 
			they continually get from the listener so are able, for example, to 
			respond to:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I don't follow</em><br />
			with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Well, I mean that ...</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			Writers need to make sure that they have been clear the first time 
			around although skilled writers may often anticipate the readers' 
			need for more clarity by the insertion of chunks such as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; To put this another way, ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, ...</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			or by inserting much more exemplification than would be necessary in 
			a spoken interaction.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Careful construction, linking and lexical density</strong><br />
			<img alt="construction" height="133" src="../../images/work_construction200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>We saw above that writers need to construct sentences which are 
			unambiguous and clear because there is no opportunity for repair and 
			no recourse to words stress and intonation etc.<br />
			This means that language such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, erm, let me see, it was Tuesday, I 
			think ... no, I tell a lie, it was Wednesday morning that ...</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went down to the shops and bought some 
			shoes and then had lunch and then went to see that movie, y'know, 
			and then had something at the Indian on the corner and then took a 
			taxi home and went to bed</em><br />
			is simply not available to the writer who has to construct something 
			much tighter, using a fuller range of subordinating and coordinating 
			conjunctions such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am almost fully sure that it was one 
			Wednesday morning that ...</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went to the shops and bought some shoes.&nbsp; 
			Afterwards, we had lunch and then went to see a movie which was ....&nbsp; 
			After the film, we ate in an Indian restaurant on the corner near 
			where we live.&nbsp; Finally, we took a taxi home and went to bed.</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Stressing and explaining</strong><br />
			<img alt="explain" height="133" src="../../images/present_explain200.jpg" width="200" /></dt>
			<dd>We saw above that writers cannot use the range that speakers are 
			capable of in terms of stress and gesture etc. so they need to make 
			things clear by a number of other devices so, for example instead of 
			the spoken:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <strong>really</strong> <strong>↗↘</strong> liked the hotel 
			most, y'know<br />
			with a fall-rise intonation pattern on the word <em>really</em>, 
			which is also spoken more slowly and more loudly<br />
			writers may have to resort to something like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It was the hotel that I definitely liked the most</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>What I liked most was definitely the hotel</em><br />
			and instead of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I went to London yesterday</em><strong><em> ↗↘</em></strong><br />
			with a rise-fall pattern on yesterday, which is also spoken more 
			slowly and loudly<br />
			the writer may have to resort to:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;The previous day, I went to London</em> (fronting the 
			adverbial for emphasis).<br />
			<span class="style_underline">Underlining</span>, <strong>bold type</strong> 
			and <span class="auto-style26"><strong>other devices</strong></span> 
			can be used, of course, but often not in electronic communication 
			and some devices, such as '<em>!!!!!</em>' are disparaged in formal 
			writing style.<br />
			Writers, too, often have to resort to diagrams and maps in 
			situations in which a speaker might simply use pointing and 
			gesturing.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>Of course, that's not the full picture.&nbsp; Some speaking (in formal 
		situations, for example) is more like writing and some very informal 
		writing (emails to friends, text messages etc.) is more like speaking 
		written down.&nbsp; There's a cline in both, like this:</p>
		
		<table style="width: 60%">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="cline 1" height="166" src="../../imagesgraphics/speakwritecline.png" width="500" /></td>
				<td>
				<img alt="cline 2" height="166" src="../../imagesgraphics/speakwritecline2.png" width="500" /></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br />
		However, the differences are real and need to be taken into account.&nbsp; 
		What follows mostly refers to writing towards (not necessarily at) the 
		right-hand end of the second cline.<br />
		<br />
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style18">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img alt="ideas" src="../../images/ideas_case250.jpg" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style19">
				<h2>What do we need to know?</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Here's another table to complete in your head (or on paper, if you 
		like).&nbsp; Think of what's meant by the words in the left-hand column.</p>
		<p>
		<img id="img2" alt="need to know" height="213" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img2',/*url*/'../../imagesgraphics/writeneedtoknowans.png')" src="../../imagesgraphics/writeneedtoknowtask.png" width="500" /></p>
		<p>All these areas pose some difficulty for learners.&nbsp; The guides 
		mentioned here are all linked from the list of related guides at the 
		end.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>graphology</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>this does not refer to the dubious art of reading of people's characters from their 
			handwriting but to the mechanics of forming the symbols of the 
			language (letters), using punctuation, abbreviations and so on.&nbsp; 
			When it comes to spelling, it is better described as orthography.&nbsp; Obviously, 
			this is more of a challenge for those whose first languages use a 
			non-Latin script but even within Latin-script users, conventions for 
			things like punctuation and capitalisation vary.&nbsp; Only in 
			writing do such things have an effect.&nbsp; See
			the guide to 
			punctuation for much more.&nbsp; For more on writing systems, 
			see the guide to spelling.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>vocabulary</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>writers are expected to use a wider range of lexis for stylistic 
			reasons, to avoid repetition, for example, and to choose lexis 
			stylistically appropriate to their task.&nbsp; Fortunately, the 
			nature of writing makes dictionary use feasible but there are still 
			challenges concerning whether to use, e.g., a multi-word verb or its 
			Latinate equivalent and so on (<em>put off</em> instead of <em>
			cancel</em>, <em>do up </em>instead of <em>fasten</em> etc.).&nbsp; For more, see the 
			guides to 
			teaching lexis on this site.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>style</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>it's fair to say that most spoken language is stylistically 
			quite informal but most writing is formal and the choice of the 
			wrong or inappropriate idiom, while not impeding communication, will 
			have a serious effect on the writer's success.&nbsp; The use of 
			modality is particularly important.&nbsp; See
			the guide to 
			style and register on this site for more.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>topic knowledge</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>is most important for people writing formally in an academic 
			environment.&nbsp; Writers are expected to know the register they 
			are writing in and to use referencing conventionally.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>layout</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>varies conventionally across languages.&nbsp; Even the 
			conventional placing of things like dates and addresses will vary in 
			formal letters.&nbsp; Some languages abjure the use of subheadings 
			in writing, some demand it.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>cohesion</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>speaking can lack cohesion providing it's coherent but writing 
			depends on the use of cohesive devices to lead the reader through 
			the text.&nbsp; The use of conjunction, in particular, is an area in 
			which writing is much more demanding (speakers can often get away 
			with just joining ideas with <em>and</em> or <em>and then</em> 
			etc.).&nbsp; See 
			the guide to cohesion on this site for more.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>coherence and structure</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>can be considered together.&nbsp; There are generic conventions 
			in English concerning how texts of various sorts are staged and how 
			the information is presented.&nbsp; For more, see 			the guide to genre  
			on this site.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>communication</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>writers need always to bear in mind that their readers cannot 
			ask them for clarification (although repetition is simple) and will 
			have expectations about how a text answers the questions they have.&nbsp; 
			All written text can be seen as answering a question of some sort.</dd>

		guides to specific areas (see below for the links) before you go on to see how we can approach the teaching of
