	<h1>Teaching speaking: the essentials</h1>
		<p>
		<img height="207" src="../../images/talk_politician310.jpg" width="310" alt="shout" /></p>
		<p>You should have followed <a href="speaking_essentials.html">the guide to what speaking skills actually 
		are</a> before tackling this.<br />
		Here's a brief recapitulation of the main concerns of that guide.</p>
		<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style12" style="width: 657px">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style11" style="width: 327px" valign="top">
		<p>Speaking is difficult because it is (or should be):</p>
		<ol>
			<li class="auto-style6">context dependent</li>
			<li class="auto-style6">unplanned</li>
			<li class="auto-style6">transient</li>
			<li class="auto-style6">dynamic</li>
			<li class="auto-style6">innovative</li>
			<li class="auto-style6">informal</li>
			<li class="auto-style6">rhetorical</li>
			<li class="auto-style6">inter-personal</li>
		</ol>
				</td>
				<td class="auto-style20" style="width: 328px" valign="top">
		<p>The cumulative effects of this result in 6 pressures:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Time </li>
					<li>Preparation level </li>
					<li>Topic familiarity</li>
					<li>Audience size</li>
					<li>Familiarity with the audience (or lack of it)</li>
					<li>Responding to the roles of the people involved</li>
				</ol>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
				<p>Native speakers have a range of coping strategies to deal 
				with these pressures, including:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>taking account of what knowledge is shared and using 
					short cuts</li>
					<li>referring to things outside the conversation which are 
					known and making reference to the environment</li>
					<li>using lots of prefabricated formulaic expressions</li>
					<li>stringing ideas together as they occur using simple 
					connectors like <em>... and ... and ...</em></li>
					<li>resorting to colloquial and imprecise language and to 
					simplification</li>
					<li>false starting and backtracking</li>
					<li>using notes in formal situations</li>
				</ol>
				<p>They also help the listener by:</p>
				<ol class="auto-style9">
					<li class="auto-style6">substitution</li>
					<li class="auto-style6">repetition</li>
					<li class="auto-style6">reformulation</li>
					<li class="auto-style6">self-correction</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Native speakers are also (usually 
				unconsciously) aware of the five elements of turn taking.</p>
				<p>Finally, in that guide we explained how 
				conversation is structured according to Initiation, Response and 
				Follow-up sequences of moves.&nbsp; At the end of that section, 
				it was optimistically stated that all of this is teachable.</p>
				<p>As you can see, there are a number of quite complicated issues here 
		but, as with all else, we can break things down and give our learners 
		training and practice in the micro-skills they need before plunging them 
		into complex speaking tasks.</p>
		<hr />
		
		<table cellpadding="0" class="auto-style18">

				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The first thing we can do in the classroom is lessen as many of the 
		pressures as we can to give our students confidence and the space they 
		need to think.&nbsp; We have seen what the pressures are.&nbsp; Now it's 
		time to see how to reduce them.&nbsp; In the following, there's a list 
		of the pressures.&nbsp; How would you go about reducing them?&nbsp; The 
		answers are really quite simple.<br />
		Click on the table when you have 
		them.</p>

		<p>That's all pretty straightforward stuff but at the planning stages of 
		a lesson which contains a speaking component, take the time to go 
		through the list and check that you have responded to the predictable 
		difficulties.</p>

				<img alt="ideas" src="../../images/ideas_case250.jpg" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style19">
				<h2>More explicitly</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<ol>
			<li><em><strong>Shared knowledge</strong></em><br />
			<img alt="share" height="133" src="../../images/transferred200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			We need to allow our learners to develop the skill of using shared 
			knowledge to make speaking easier for them but still comprehensible 
			for the listener.&nbsp; Here are some ideas:<ol class="auto-style13">
				<li>Get students to work together on a picture story to plan how 
				to tell it to the rest of the class (or another pair / 
				individual) who does not have access to the pictures.&nbsp; 
				While working together the learners will often take short cuts 
				and refer to 'the man' or whatever but if it is clear to them 
				that they are going to have to tell the story without a visual 
				prompt, they will be encouraged to notice the extra information 
				they'll need to add to make it work.<br />
				Clearly this needs preparation so step 1 is to have a picture on 
				the board (or wherever) and invite your students to describe it.&nbsp; 
				Then hide the graphic and ask them to do it again
				<span class="style_underline">as if you had never seen it</span>.&nbsp; 
				Whenever they start to use shared information, interrupt with 
				questions such as <em>What house? Where is the car?</em> etc. to 
				alert them to what is shared and what isn't and how to explain.<br />
				You can reverse this procedure and ask people to respond to a 
				picture only one of them can see by talking to a you or a 
				partner and then run the same exercise with both people having 
				access to the picture.&nbsp; Get them <em>explicitly</em> to 
				notice differences in language.&nbsp; You can do this in three 
				with two talkers and one noticer.&nbsp; Then swap roles around.</li>
				<li>Get the learners to imagine a location within the school / 
				college / campus where you are teaching and direct a partner to 
				it.<br />
				Now get them to do it with a building only one of them is 
				familiar with.<br />
				Finally, get them explicitly to notice the different kinds of 
				language they used.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><em><strong>Formulaic, prefabricated expressions</strong></em><br />
			<img alt="prefabricated" height="133" src="../../images/prefabricated200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			There are lots of these but they fall into some accessible 
			categories so we should teach them that way.&nbsp; Here's an example 
			or two:<ol class="auto-style13">
				<li>Focus on 6 or so formulaic expressions to introduce personal 
				opinion, e.g.:<br />
				<span class="auto-style6"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as far as I'm concerned<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				to my mind<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				in my view<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				from where I stand<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				as far as I can see<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				it seems to me that</em></span><br />
				Introduce them via a dialogue or a text of an email (which often 
				closely resembles spoken language) and then set up groups of 
				three.&nbsp; Two students discuss a topic about which they 
				disagree, the third notes when all six expressions have been 
				used and calls a halt.&nbsp; Then they change roles.</li>
				<li>You can do the same with other types of formulaic language 
				such as thinking time fillers:<em><span class="auto-style6"><br />
				</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style6">well, let me see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; give me a second to think<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm, that's an 
				interesting question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well, now, what can I say?<br />
				</span> </em>etc.<br />
				With these you can set up situations in which learners spring 
				unexpected questions on each other.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><em><strong>Using parataxis</strong></em><br />
			<img alt="link" height="133" src="../../images/chain_one_link200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			This isn't usually taxing for learners because the structures are so 
			simple.&nbsp; What they need, however, is sensitising to the fact 
			that <em>there's nothing wrong with being simple</em>.&nbsp; To do 
			this an authentic dialogue showing basic parataxis followed by an 
			anecdote-telling session is usually enough.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Using imprecise language, general items and 
			circumlocution<br />
			<img alt="blurred" height="133" src="../../images/blurred_lights_a200.jpg" width="200" /></strong></em><ol class="auto-style13">
				<li>This is often done through presenting the sorts of language 
				we use when we aren't clear what something looks like exactly: 
				things like: <span class="auto-style6"><em>roundish, sort of 
				curved at the top, near-enough flat, square shaped, bluish</em></span> 
				and so on and then using realia with objects the learners do not 
				know the precise name for or whose names they are not allowed to 
				use, getting students to describe the objects to each other 
				until the other person guesses right.</li>
				<li>In the same way, it is possible to use either pictures or 
				real objects and get students to help others guess what it is 
				without using its name.&nbsp; For example, <em>It's a small 
				plasticky sort of rectangular thing you stick in your camera to 
				store images on</em>.</li>
				<li>Learners like acquiring general item terms such as
				<span class="auto-style6"><em>thingy, stuff, whatsit, doobrie</em></span> 
				and any of the 50 or so alternatives and once presented (not all 
				50, please) they are easy to practise in the same way with 
				mystery materials or objects.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><em><strong>False starting and backtracking</strong></em><br />
			<img alt="back track" height="133" src="../../images/road_backtrack200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			These are a bit more challenging to practise because they are 
			responses to error on the part of the speaker.&nbsp; However, one 
			productive way is to allow a learner to start an anecdote and then 
			persistently interrupt with <em>No, it was a ...</em>, forcing them 
			to backtrack and restart.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<span class="auto-style6"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: I was walking down the road ...<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			B: No, it was a path.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			A: Oh, actually it was a path but anyway I met this old man ...<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			B: No, he wasn't old.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			A: Well OK, he wasn't really old but anyway ...</em></span><br />
			etc.<br />
			Note the need to teach the use of <span class="auto-style6"><em>but 
			anyway</em></span> to do this well.<br />
			After a few demonstrations from you, the learners can have an 
			enjoyable go at doing it to each other.<br />
			The most important thing to recognise here is that in informal 
			spontaneous conversation, such tactics are not only permitted, they 
			are expected.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Using notes</strong></em><br />
			<img alt="notes" height="133" src="../../images/write_notetaking200.jpg" width="200" /><br />
			Some learners may never need this skill but giving practice in 
			getting students to present longer stretches of spoken language, 
			using notes to guide them is not difficult to set up or do.&nbsp; 
			The trick (see above) is to make sure they have adequate research 
			and presentation time.<br />
			Getting them to present to small groups rather than the whole class 
			has two advantages:<ol class="auto-style13">
				<li>it allows them to do it again (and again) building up 
				confidence and familiarity and learning from experience</li>
				<li>it reduces the stress involved in speaking to larger groups</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>

			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>It's easy enough to analyse example dialogues showing how the more 
		natural ones involve a speaker responding and initiating in the same 
		turn, more difficult to practise them.&nbsp; Here are a couple of ideas 
		to use <em>after</em> you have laid the groundwork and your students are 
		aware of the need to respond and initiate.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Pairwork in threes<br />
			Two students play the roles of questioner and informant (as in the 
			example in the first section of this guide) or discuss something 
			familiar and simple such as their home town or favourite sports 
			clubs.<br />
			The third student listens for the times that either participant uses 
			a response combined with an initiation and at the end reports back, 
			evaluating how the other two did.&nbsp; Then they swap roles.</li>
			<li>Write and perform<br />
			Using a picture prompt, e.g.,<br />
			<img alt="prompt" height="166" src="../../images/train250.jpg" width="250" /><br />
			learners write a dialogue between two people on a train, taking care 
			to incorporate the idea of responses and initiations occurring in 
			the same move.&nbsp; They can perform (not read aloud) the dialogue 
			to others to see how the conversation is structured</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Spontaneity</h3>
		<p>Speaking is something we occasionally need to do with neither 
		preparation nor thinking time and a good way to practise this is to 
		demand instant responses from learners to projected images.&nbsp; It 
		isn't difficult to find intriguing, cute or emotive images on the web 
		(news pages are a good source) but here are three examples of the kind 
		of thing:<br />
		<img alt="keep right" height="260" src="../../images/sign_keep-right.jpg" width="260" /><img alt="sign " height="260" src="../../images/sign_notinuse.jpg" width="188" /><img alt="jessie" height="260" src="../../images/jessierunning.jpg" width="160" /></p>
		<p>If the instant-response demand is frequently done, learners quickly 
		become adept at and accustomed to thinking quickly and reacting 
		appropriately.&nbsp; That's a confidence booster among other things.</p>

				<td class="auto-style19">
				<h2>Turn-taking</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>Speaking is a two-way process unless we are speaking to an 
			audience we can neither see nor hear.<br />
			A key skill that learners will have to master is the ability to take 
			turns in conversations: to hold on to, give up and take a turn 
			appropriately.<br />
			This is a reasonably technical area but one you may like to 
			investigate.&nbsp; The link to the guide is below.</p>
