				<h2>What makes speaking difficult?</h2>
		<p>Many learners of English, when asked, will state that speaking is the 
		hardest skill to master.&nbsp; It often is, and there are good reasons 
		for this.&nbsp; Think for a moment about what makes speaking difficult.&nbsp; 
		There are two sorts of factors at work: productive and social factors.</p>
		<a name="sp1"></a><table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style3" style="width: 90%">

			</tr>

				<td class="auto-style4" valign="top"><span class="auto-style6">context dependent</span> – 
				what we say and how we say it depends on the context (where we 
				are, what we are doing, who we are addressing etc.)</td>
				<td class="auto-style4" valign="top"><span class="auto-style6">
				innovative</span> – when we speak we often have to extemporise 
				if, e.g., we can't find the right word or need a new concept</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style4" valign="top"><span class="auto-style6">unplanned</span> 
				– unlike writing, we usually have very little time to plan what 
				we are going to say (or no time at all)</td>
				<td class="auto-style4" valign="top"><span class="auto-style6">
				informal</span> – and often expected to be colloquial and 
				idiomatic</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style4" valign="top"><span class="auto-style6">transient</span> 
				– no record is kept (usually) of what we say so we can't 
				backtrack very far to amend and adjust</td>
				<td class="auto-style4" valign="top"><span class="auto-style6">

				logically and in an orderly way)</td>

				on what is said to us.</td>

		<p>In what ways do you think these factors make speaking a difficult

		<dl>
			<dt class="auto-style6"><strong><em>context dependent</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>speakers need to master competences to be able to speak 
			effectively in a range of settings.&nbsp; They need to have<br />
			<em>discourse competence</em> (e.g., know how to respond to an 
			invitation)<br />
			<em>sociolinguistic competence</em> (knowing how to address people 
			etc.)</dd>
			<dd><em>strategic competence</em> (when and what level of formality 
			is needed, when it is and isn't appropriate to say things etc.)<br />
			On top of all this, of course, speakers also need to produce 
			language which is acceptably accurate structurally.&nbsp; They have 
			to have <em>linguistic competence</em>.</dd>
			<dt class="auto-style6"><em><strong>unplanned</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>time pressures mean that the amount of cognitive effort that is 
			required to speak in a foreign language is very great and speakers 
			often become tired and distracted quickly.</dd>
			<dt class="auto-style6"><em><strong>transient</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>although speakers can, and often do, backtrack to correct and 
			repair interactions (with things like, <em>No, that's not what I 
			meant.&nbsp; I meant ...</em> etc.) opportunities to do so are 
			limited.&nbsp; (In written communication, we usually have the 
			opportunity to re-read what we have written and make amendments for 
			the sake of clarity, by contrast.)</dd>
			<dt class="auto-style6"><em><strong>dynamic</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>speakers have also to be listeners so skills are combined and 
			misunderstanding what is said to you is often as fatal as saying the 
			wrong thing altogether.</dd>
			<dt class="auto-style6"><em><strong>innovative</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>native speakers of all languages are adept at finding ways to 
			make up for the speed at which they have to think so, e.g., in 
			English we make adjectives vague (with, e.g., <em>a bit / sort of / 
			hard</em> or <em>coolish</em> etc.) use generalised terms when we 
			mislay a word (<em>thingy, whatshisname</em> etc.) or use 
			circumlocution (e.g., <em>it's the bit you need to make sure the 
			juice doesn't spill over</em> etc.).&nbsp; All of these things are 
			difficult in a foreign language.</dd>
			<dt class="auto-style6"><em><strong>informal</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>learners of a language often sound overly formal and precise 
			because they are trying hard to be accurate and orderly.&nbsp; 
			Native speakers care less about these things because they have more 
			resources and can be more innovative.</dd>
			<dt class="auto-style6"><em><strong>rhetorical</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>spoken language is often, for example, laden with modality (<em>should, 
			must, could, ought to, probably, certainly, if you get a mo' </em>
			etc.) and such forms are difficult to deploy accurately in a foreign 
			language.</dd>
			<dt class="auto-style6"><em><strong>inter-personal</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>picking up on the attitude of the person we are talking to and 
			responding appropriately is something that native speakers do 
			unconsciously, taking clues from body language, intonation, lexical 
			choice and much else.&nbsp; That's hard to learn to do in a second 
			language.</dd>
		</dl>
		</div>
		<p>Add all these factors together and we get three major processing 
		pressures:</p>
		<ol>

			<li>Preparation level</li>
			<li>Topic familiarity</li>
		</ol>
		<p>and three main social pressures:</p>

				this pressure in a number of ways:<ol class="auto-style9">
					<li>they take account of what knowledge is shared so are 
					happy to use short cuts.&nbsp; We can refer to things 
					outside the conversation which are known and we can make 
					extensive reference to the environment.&nbsp; For example,
					<em>I'll meet you in the pub ..., You see that car over 
					there ...</em> etc.</li>
					<li>they also leave things out when they aren't necessary (<em>Not 
					the blue, the yellow, I wouldn't. </em>etc.).&nbsp; That's 
					called ellipsis.</li>
					<li>they use lots of formulaic expressions such as <em>D'you 
					see?, In one way or another, Whether or not that's true, If 
					you say so</em> etc.&nbsp; Native speakers deploy these as 
					if they were single words.</li>
				</ol>
				</td>

				<td class="auto-style8" valign="top">Preparation level</td>
				<td class="auto-style4" valign="top">Native speakers don't plan.&nbsp;

				simple connectors like <em>... and ... and ... </em>or<em> ... 
				and then ... and then ... </em>or<em> ...so... so ... </em>etc.&nbsp; 
				That's called parataxis.<br />
				Speakers will also, more rarely, use what's called hypotaxis (<em>The 
				car over the road, The man I saw in the caf&eacute;</em> etc.<em>&nbsp;
				</em>Listeners don't expect to hear well-formed, planned 
				utterances in most cases.<br />
				In this case, too, native speakers are happy to resort to 
				colloquial and imprecise language and to simplification.&nbsp; 
				One of the hallmarks of spoken language is that it is simpler 
				than written language, both grammatically and lexically.<br />
				False starts (<em>He was with his friends ... Actually not all

		<p>In addition to all this, speakers have a repertoire of ways to keep 
		conversation moving along by signalling opportunities to take turns in 
		speaking.&nbsp; There are five things that speakers have to know about 
		turn taking (from Bygate 1987):</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Knowing how to show that you want to speak.&nbsp; This can 
			involve noises or phrases (<em>Hmm.&nbsp; Yes, but ...</em>), 
			gestures, intakes of breath and a number of other tactics.</li>
			<li>Recognising when to take a turn.&nbsp; Speakers often signal 
			appropriate moments by assuming eye contact, falling voice volume or 
			stopping and looking.</li>
			<li>How to hold one's turn by such techniques as starting with <em>
			Well there are two things here ...</em> or keeping the intonation up 
			to show you haven't finished.</li>
			<li>Recognising other people's desire to take a turn (in other 
			words, noticing the signals in 1., above).</li>
			<li>Knowing how to let them have a turn by gesture, look or phrase 
			such as the use of question tags or straightforward questions.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>There is a separate <a href="../../inservice/discourse/turn-taking.html">
		guide to turn-taking skills</a> &ndash; covering what they are and how to teach them &ndash;

				<h2><a name="irf"></a>The structure of conversation: IRF sequences</h2>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>No analysis of speaking would be complete without some discussion of 
		how conversation is structured.&nbsp; A simple but effective way of 
		analysing this structure is to consider 3 main phases.&nbsp; The 
		following is based on Tsui 1994:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em><strong>Initiation</strong></em>.<br />
			There are four ways to start a conversation:<ol class="auto-style9">
				<li>Elicit (ask if).&nbsp; E.g., <em>Have you eaten?</em></li>
				<li>Request (ask to).&nbsp; E.g., <em>Can I ask you something?</em></li>
				<li>Direct (tell to).&nbsp; E.g., <em>Pay attention to this; 
				it's important</em>.</li>
				<li>Inform (tell that).&nbsp; E.g., <em>I noticed you didn't 
				come to the meeting.</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><em><strong>Response</strong></em><br />
			There are three types of response to an initiation.&nbsp; For 
			example to the Initiation, <em>Can you do me a favour</em>? we can 
			have:<ol class="auto-style9">
				<li>Positive (preferred): <em>Yes, sure, what can I do?</em></li>
				<li>Negative (dispreferred): <em>Sorry, I need to go now.</em></li>
				<li>Temporising (dispreferred): <em>Maybe.&nbsp; Will it take 
				long?</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><em><strong>Follow up</strong></em><br />
			There are also three sorts.&nbsp; Following from the three responses 
			above, we can have:<ol class="auto-style9">
				<li>Endorsement (positive).&nbsp; <em>Great.</em></li>
				<li>Concession (negative outcome).&nbsp; <em>Oh, I see.</em></li>
				<li>Acknowledgement (negative outcome).&nbsp; <em>It's OK, I'll 
				get John to help.</em></li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>So we can have an analysis like this in the three 'moves' in a 
		conversation:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style3" style="width: 60%">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style11" style="height: 21px"><strong>Utterance</strong></td>
				<td class="auto-style11" style="height: 21px"><strong>Move</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style4" valign="top">Where did you buy your

				<td class="auto-style4" valign="top">Thank you.</td>
				<td class="auto-style4" valign="top">Follow-up: positive outcome</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		<p>This is nice and simple but there's a problem.&nbsp; Real people just 
		don't talk like this.&nbsp; Here's a more natural-sounding conversation.&nbsp; 
		Can you do the analysis into I R F moves?&nbsp; Click on the table when 
		you have.</p>

		<p>Whether you got all that right or not doesn't matter too much now.&nbsp; 
		What <span class="style_underline">does</span> matter is that you see 
		why this conversation is more natural than the last one.&nbsp;
		<a href="#sp2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'speakin2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you see it</a>.</p>

		<strong>two</strong> moves in their

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, it's great.&nbsp; 
		Cheap too<br />
		</em>but <span class="style_underline">in the same turn</span> starts a new 
		initiation with<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?<br />
		</em>This is the way many conversations 
		go.<br />
		One of the reasons that learners often say that native 
		speakers won't speak to them or that they find it hard to keep 
		conversations going is that they have failed to see that conversation 
		requires maintenance with new initiations in most response turns.</span></p>
