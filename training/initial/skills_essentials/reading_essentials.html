				<h2>Reading: the mechanics</h2>

		</table>
		<p>For many of us, reading seems such a commonplace skill that we 
		overlook how complex and difficult it is to learn.&nbsp; A much-cited 
		figure is that it takes around 600 hours of instruction to learn to read 
		with any fluency and some people never truly master the art even in 
		their first language.&nbsp; We should not, therefore, treat the area 
		lightly or assume that our learners will simply transfer the skill from 
		first to subsequent languages.<br />
		Being able quickly to read a text and grasp the meaning and 
		organisation requires a reading speed of around 200 words per minute and 
		a native speaker of English will usually achieve something around 300 
		words per minute (Nuttall, 1982: 36).&nbsp; Speeds below 200 words per 
		minute will usually result in non-comprehension because each word is 
		being processed too slowly for the overall meaning to be gathered.<br />
		For speakers of languages which do not have an alphabetic writing system 
		or use a different alphabet, attaining those sorts of speeds is a 
		challenge.<br />
		This is especially true for people whose first languages use logographic 
		or syllabic writing systems and even those which have an alphabetic 
		(i.e., more or less phonemic) system may use a range of alphabets as 
		well as writing right to left or top to bottom.<br />
		For more, see <a href="../lexis/spelling.html">the guide to 
		spelling in English</a>.<br />
		To get a flavour of what it is like to de-code an unfamiliar text, try 
		this:<br />
		<img alt="reading" height="22" src="../../imagesgraphics/writing_reverse.gif" width="310" /><br />
		and that is in English.&nbsp; It's even more difficult in a language you 
		are just beginning to master.</p>

				<h3>Eye movements and word recognition</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>When we read, we do not move our eyes smoothly along a line of text 
		but focus roughly speaking about one third of the way along each word 
		for a matter of about 200 milliseconds.&nbsp; We do this because, so the 
		theory goes, it allows us to focus both on the shape of a word and on 
		its initial two letters which carry so much of the information.&nbsp; We 
		can view 3 or 4 characters to the left of our main focus and around 6 
		spaces to the right.&nbsp; This allows us simultaneously to decode the 
		current word and begin processing the next word.&nbsp; If the next word 
		is short enough, we can jump over it completely and focus on what 
		follows.&nbsp; Then, in something like 30 milliseconds, our eyes jump to 
		the next word.&nbsp; Thus, we work our way along the text in very small 
		and very rapid jumps.&nbsp; The technical term for this fast movement 
		between fixation points is, incidentally, saccade.</p>
		<p>As we fixate on each word, we need, of course, to recognise it very 
		quickly.&nbsp; Native speakers can do this almost instantly with very 
		well known words but are slower when it comes to unusual items.&nbsp; We 
		also tend, quite often, to backtrack and re-read function words which 
		allow us to get the connections between phrases.&nbsp; So, for example, 
		in reading a sentence such as:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me a lift and I'll buy you a pint</em><br />
		we may return to re-read the coordinator <em>and</em> to figure out that 
		it is, in fact, acting as a conditional subordinator in this sentence, 
		not as an additive coordinator which is its usual role.&nbsp; (The 
		sentence could be rephrased as <em>If you give me a lift, I'll buy you a 
		pint</em>.)</p>
		<p>It has been suggested that having an active schema (or set of 
		conceptual associations) allows native speakers to skip large sections 
		of text because we can predict what comes next.&nbsp; However, research 
		(reported in Schmitt, 200: 47) shows that, in fact, most of the text is 
		focused on and processed in the way described here.</p>

		<p>Now think about <em>how</em> we read these things.&nbsp; Do we, for 
		example, read every word?&nbsp; Do we move logically through the text, 
		line by line?&nbsp; Do we read very carefully or just glance about?&nbsp; 
		When you have an answer, 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'reading1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">click for some comments</a>.</p>
		
		<div id="reading1" style="visibility: hidden">
		<ol class="auto-style13">
			<li>When we are dealing with some texts, for example, a recipe or a 
			set of maintenance instructions, it's important that we understand 
			nearly everything.&nbsp; If the book says <em>twist anti-clockwise</em> 
			or <em>do not allow it to boil</em>, it's important that we get it 
			right.</li>
			<li>With other texts, we can be a bit more careless.&nbsp; 
			Typically, on a news website, people will run their eyes across the 
			links looking for a story that interests them and then access the 
			text for a more detailed look at the information.&nbsp; Even when we 
			are quite interested in a story, we still often won't read every 
			word, preferring to skip to the important (for us) bits of the 
			story.</li>
			<li>Other texts, such a bus timetable require different approaches.&nbsp; 
			We can't usually just read from top to bottom, left to right 
			because we don't want the information from most of the text.&nbsp; 
			We only want to know when the next bus goes to where we want to be, 
			usually.&nbsp; If you are looking for a name in a telephone 
			directory, don't start at page one and read till you find it.</li>
			<li>Depending on how much we are engaged, reading a novel requires a 
			different approach, too.&nbsp; We will usually read with some care 
			and even back-track to re-read sections but we can ignore parts of 
			the text and simply follow the story.&nbsp; If we are getting a 
			bit bored, we may even start to glance through the text to find out what 
			happened in the story.</li>
			<li>If we are trying to learn something or prepare for an 
			examination, we will often read and re-read with some care, making 
			sure we understand the text.&nbsp; Is that how you are reading this?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It's clear, then, that we deploy different skills depending on:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style13">
			<li><strong>the sorts of text we are accessing</strong></li>

	<dt><strong>Scanning</strong></dt>
	<dd>This is the bus timetable kind of reading.&nbsp; We scan the text 
	looking for key data such as Destination, Time, Bus number etc.&nbsp; It's 
	also how we might find a telephone number or scan an encyclopaedia entry 
	to locate a specific bit of information such as numbers or lists of events.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Skimming</strong></dt>
			<dd>This is how we might approach a TV schedule if we don't know 
			what we want to watch.&nbsp; We run our eyes quickly across the text 
			to get a general idea of what each programme is about.&nbsp; Once we 
			find something that interests us, we read it for detail and find out 
			when it's on and where.&nbsp; We are interested in the <strong>gist, 
			not the detail</strong> at this stage.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Intensive reading</strong></dt>
			<dd>We deploy this skill when we are concerned to understand as much 
			as we can.&nbsp; Maintenance instructions, recipes, study texts and 
			so on are the typical things we read like this.&nbsp; Often we will 
			read things more than once and we will usually try to understand 
			every word of the text.&nbsp; We almost always use this approach 
			with short texts containing key information.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Extensive reading</strong></dt>
			<dd>We read extensively when we are reading for pleasure and also 
			when we are hoping to get some general information.&nbsp; In this 
			mode, we usually don't read extremely carefully and we can ignore 
			words we don't know.&nbsp; We may backtrack sometimes if we get lost 
			but usually we simply read through the text, following the 
			writer's organisation.&nbsp; Novels, magazines, newspaper articles 
			etc. are all accessed like this.</dd>
