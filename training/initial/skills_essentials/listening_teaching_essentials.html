	<h1>Teaching listening: the essentials</h1>

		<img height="207" src="../../images/talk_listening310.gif" width="310" alt="explain" /></p>
		<p>If you have followed <a href="listening_essentials.html">the first part of this guide</a>, you will be aware 
		of the range of strategies that good listeners deploy in a foreign 
		language to understand what they hear.&nbsp; We use these strategies in 
		our first languages, too, but we need to focus on them <em>explicitly</em> 
		if we are to help our learners be aware of what to do when listening and 
		get the chance to practise each skill in isolation.<br />
		Just as we don't try to teach all the grammar and lexis of the language 
		at once, so we can break up skills in order to focus on what's 
		realistically learnable.&nbsp; We also need to recycle the data because 
		once is not usually enough.</p>

		<p>It's perfectly arguable, of course, that we don't need to teach these

		there is evidence, albeit anecdotal, that these skills are not easily 
		transferred because learners are distracted by the difficulties of

		</table>
		<p>As we have seen, top-down skills are mostly to with activating what 
		the learner already knows but there are different types of top-down 
		knowledge:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><em><strong>Knowledge of the world in general</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>We all have varying amounts of this and the younger and less 
			sophisticated your learners are, the more you may have to teach 
			content as well as language.&nbsp; For example, if learners are told 
			that a listening text is of an interview with a zoo keeper and they 
			know nothing at all about the topic, the information is unlikely to 
			be of much use.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, they know what a zoo 
			keeper does and are acquainted with the topic of zoos, it may be of 
			great use in decoding what they hear.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Knowledge of the structure of texts (generic 
			knowledge)</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>When we are listening to a text, it is very helpful to us to 
			know what the structure and staging of the text is likely to be.<br />
			For example, an anecdote is likely to have Orientation (Where, when 
			and to whom did things happen?), followed by a Complication (What 
			was the issue? What went wrong? etc.), a Resolution (How was the 
			problem resolved?) and a Coda (How does the teller feel about what 
			happened?).<br />
			On the other hand, if we are being given instructions, the normal 
			staging will be Goal &gt; What we need to reach the goal &gt; What the 
			steps are in reaching the goal.<br />
			If the listeners know all this, it is going to be a great help in 
			understanding the content because people will know what to listen 
			for and at what stage.</dd>
			<dt><em><strong>Cultural knowledge</strong></em></dt>
			<dd>Simply knowing, for example, that sports coverage comes at the 
			end of a news broadcast (cultural, generic knowledge) or that in the USA the Foreign Minister is 
			called the Secretary of State and in Britain the Finance Minister is 
			called the Chancellor of the Exchequer is a great help in certain 
			circumstances.&nbsp; Equally, of course, knowing that tea time means 
			4 o'clock (or thereabouts) in Britain may be crucial to 
			understanding a text.</dd>

				We rarely listen to anything entirely 'cold' and without at 
				least knowing the topic of what we are going to hear.&nbsp; In 
				the classroom, we can focus our learners explicitly on this 
				knowledge by, e.g., brainstorming vocabulary they know about the 
				topic, discussing their current views of the topic, exchanging 
				ideas about previous times they have encountered the topic and
