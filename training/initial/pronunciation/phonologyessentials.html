		<p>Many people have established and maintained honourable academic 
		careers in the study of pronunciation.&nbsp; This short guide does not 
		attempt to cover the area in any great detail.&nbsp; If you would like 
		to see some of the terminology and symbols used in practice, see
		<a href="../lexis/lexicalverbforms.html#pron" target="_blank">the section on 
		pronunciation of verb forms</a> on this site.</p>
		<p><span class="style_blue">
		<a href="../../inservice/inserviceindex.html"></a></span>
		<a href="../../inservice/indexes_is/pronunciationindex_is.html">The 
		in-service training pronunciation index</a> has links to particular aspects of 
		phonology: vowels,
		consonants,
		connected 
		speech phenomena, intonation and more.</p>
		<h3>Some essential terminology</h3>
		<dl>
	<dt><strong>Phonetics</strong></dt>
	<dd>is the study of all speech sounds and is applicable to all 
		languages.&nbsp; It is concerned with how humans produce sounds, how they 
		are transmitted physically and how they are perceived and decoded.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Phonology</strong></dt>
			<dd>is to do with the sounds of a specific language rather than all 
			human speech and it is this which concerns us here.</dd>
			<dt><strong>The phoneme</strong></dt>
			<dd>is the basic sound unit of a language.&nbsp; We combine phonemes 
			into morphemes (meaning units) and into words.&nbsp; The phoneme is 
			written with its symbol between two slash marks: /t/ = the 't' sound 
			in <em>la<span class="style_underline">t</span>er</em>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Consonants</strong></dt>
			<dd>when you produce a sound by completely or partially blocking 
			the air flow through the vocal tract, you produce a consonant.&nbsp; For 
			example, if you block and then release air through pressing your 
			lips together, you will produce the sound /p/.&nbsp; If you block 
			the back of your mouth by raising your tongue, you will produce /k/.<br />
			The in-service training section of this site has
			<a href="../../inservice/pronunciation/consonants.html" target="_blank">
			a guide to consonants here</a>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Vowels</strong></dt>
			<dd>if you produce a sound without blocking the air flow you 
			will make a vowel such as the 'a' in <em>cat</em> (/kæt/).&nbsp; The 
			quality of the sound is affected by where your tongue is vertically 
			and horizontally in the mouth and whether your lips are rounded or 
			not.<br />
			The in-service training section of this site has
			<a href="../../inservice/pronunciation/vowels.html" target="_blank">a guide to 
			vowels here</a>.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Semi-vowels</strong></dt>
			<dd>are sounds which are produced like vowels but actually don't 
			function like them.&nbsp; An example is the /j/ sound at the 
			beginning of the word <em>yet</em>.&nbsp; The <em>y</em> letter 
			represents a consonant in this case but at the end of the word <em>
			fly</em>, it is a vowel and transcribed as /flaɪ/.&nbsp; The letter
			<em>w</em> also has this characteristic: at the beginning of <em>was</em> 
			it is close to being a consonant (called a glide, in the trade) but 
			in the centre of <em>cower</em> it is a vowel sound so the 
			transcription of <em>was cowering</em> is /wəz ˈkaʊər.ɪŋ/.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Minimal pairs</strong></dt>
			<dd>are words which differ in meaning because of a change to a 
			single phoneme.&nbsp; In fact, this is part of the definition of a 
			phoneme.<br />
			For example, the words, <em>cat</em> and <em>hat</em> are only 
			distinguished by the first phoneme; /k/ in the first case, /h/ in the 
			second.&nbsp; In English, these are minimal pairs so the sounds are 
			phonemes.&nbsp; Some languages do not recognise the distinction 
			between /h/ and /k/ in this way so in those languages the words are 
			not minimal pairs and the sounds are not phonemes.<br />
			For example, /p/ and /b/ can readily be seen to be phonemes in 
			English by applying the minimal pairs test.&nbsp; We know that <em>
			bat</em> and <em>pat</em> are different words with different 
			meanings so the sounds are phonemes.&nbsp; In some languages (e.g., 
			most varieties of Arabic) changing /b/ to /p/ will have no effect on the meaning of a 
			word so in those languages the sounds are not phonemes.<br />
			To see how minimal pairs may be exploited in the classroom, see
			<a href="../../inservice/pronunciation/troublesome_sounds.html">the 
			guide to teaching troublesome sounds</a>.&nbsp; You will need to be 
			able to read phonemic transcription to get the most from that guide.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Allophone</strong></dt>
			<dd>if you say <em>kid </em>and<em> skid </em>aloud you will have 
			produced two different allophones.&nbsp; In the first, there is a 
			slight aspirant or /h/ sound following the /k/; in the second it is 
			absent.&nbsp; These sounds are different but they are not phonemes.&nbsp; 
			If you add the aspirant to the sound in <em>skid</em> you will not 
			make a different word although it will sound odd.&nbsp; In some 
			languages, the two sounds <em>are</em> phonemes and people will understand a 
			different meaning if the /k/ is aspirated or not.&nbsp; These 
			allophones are written either like this: /k/ or like this: /<span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">kʰ/.</span></dd>
			<dt><strong>Voicing</strong></dt>
			<dd>describes how phonemes may be different depending on whether the 
			vocal cords vibrate or not at the time of pronunciation.&nbsp; For 
			example, the /k/ sound is made without voicing but the /ɡ/ sound is 
			made with the mouth parts in the same place but with voice added.&nbsp; 
			If you put your hand on your throat and say the words <em>sue </em>
			and<em> zoo</em>, you will see what is meant and feel a slight 
			vibration on the second word (/s/ is unvoiced but 
			/z/ is voiced).</dd>
			<dt><strong>Intonation</strong></dt>
			<dd>is the way in which the speaker's pitch (or tone) rises and 
			falls to signal, e.g., a question, surprise, disappointment etc.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Stress</strong></dt>
			<dd>is the term used to describe the emphasis speakers give to 
			certain syllables in a word or certain words in a sentence.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			Word stress: when the stress falls on the first syllable in <em>
			export</em> the word is a noun <em>(<strong>ex</strong>port),</em> 
			when it falls on the second, it's a verb (<em>ex<strong>port</strong></em>).<br />
			(There is an exercise on word stress for teachers and advanced 
			learners on this site.&nbsp;
			<a href="../teaching/identifyingwordstress.html" target="_blank">
			Click here to go there</a>.)<br />
			Sentence stress in English usually falls on the new information 
			being provided and that, for English, generally comes towards the 
			end of the utterance.&nbsp; So for example in the exchange:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: <em>What did you do <strong>yesterday</strong>?</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: <em>I went to see <strong>my mother</strong>.</em><br />
			the first speaker will normally stress <em>yesterday</em> and the 
			second speaker will normally stress <em>my mother</em> because that 
			is the key information in both cases.<br />
			We can, of course, stress other elements in order to emphasise their 
			importance.&nbsp; This is called special stress.&nbsp; For example, try reading these sentences aloud, stressing the 
			word in <strong>bold</strong>:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			a) <em>I went to London with my </em> <strong><em>brother</em></strong> (i.e., not 
			another person)<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			b) <em>I went to </em> <strong><em>London</em></strong><em> with my brother</em> (i.e., not to 
			another place)<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			c) <strong><em>I</em></strong><em> went to London with my brother 
			</em>(i.e., it was 
			not someone else who went with my brother)<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			d) <em>I went to London with </em> <strong><em>my</em></strong><em> brother</em> (i.e., not 
			someone else's brother)</dd>
			<dt><strong>Stress and syllable timing</strong></dt>
			<dd>The following is the theory.<br />
			There are, it is claimed, two fundamental forms of stressing.<br />
			In some languages, such as French, Italian, Spanish, Cantonese and 
			Mandarin, every syllable is <em>perceived</em> as taking up the same 
			amount of time.&nbsp; This is the so-called 'machine gun' sound of 
			these languages.&nbsp; So we get:<em><br />
			<span class="auto-style4">I ... went ... to ... Lon ... don ... with 
			... my ... bro ... ther</span></em><br />
			That's <strong>syllable timing</strong>.<br />
			In other languages, notably English, Dutch, Farsi and Scandinavian 
			languages, some syllables take longer to utter than others and this 
			results in a reduction of the syllables in between.&nbsp; So we get<em><br />
			<span class="auto-style4">Iwentto ... <strong>L o n </strong>d'n ... 
			withmy ... <strong>b r o</strong> the(r)</span><br />
			</em>That's <strong>stress timing</strong>.<em><br />
			</em>For this reason, the preposition <em>to</em> is not pronounced 
			in its full form as /tuː/ (rhyming with 'two' and 'too') but with a 
			weak form of the vowel /tə/.&nbsp; The funny, upside-down 'e' is 
			called a <strong>schwa</strong> and is the commonest <strong>weak 
			form</strong> in English.&nbsp; Additionally, <em>my</em> is often 
			reduced to <em>m'</em> and so on and in most varieties of British 
			English the final /r/ sound on <em>brother</em> is not pronounced.<br />
			Be aware that even if this distinction exists, it is not an 
			either-or one.&nbsp; Languages will vary along a cline from 
			syllable- to stress-timing tendencies.<br />
			(There is, in fact, a third form of timing: Mora timing.&nbsp; In 
			Japanese, e.g., a vowel (V) takes the same time to utter as a consonant 
			(C) plus a vowel so V takes the same time as CV and CVV takes twice as 
			long as CV.)</dd>
			<dt><strong>Weak forms</strong></dt>
			<dd>Because English is a stress-timed language (allegedly), many 
			vowels are reduced in rapid, connected speech so, e.g., <em>for</em> 
			is pronounced /fə/ (not /fɔː/), <em>been </em>is heard as /bɪn/<em>
			</em>(not /biːn/, <em>we</em> is heard as /wɪ/ and so on.<br />

			forms in English,<a href="../../../documents/ELT_Concourse_Weak_forms.pdf" target="_blank">
