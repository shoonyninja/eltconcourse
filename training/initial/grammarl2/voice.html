		<p>Voice refers to a grammatical construction and, in particular, to the 
		relationship between the doer of an action, the <strong>agent</strong> 
		and the recipient, the <strong>patient</strong>.<em>&nbsp; </em> In 
		other words, voice describes the relationship between the verb and what are 
		called its arguments (subject and object).</p>
		<p><a name="1"></a>Compare these two sentences:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>John kicked the ball.</em></li>
			<li><em>The ball was kicked by John.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Sentence 1</strong> is in the Active voice.<strong><br />
		</strong> The agent is the subject, <em>John</em>, the verb is <em>kick 
		+ ed </em>and the patient is the object, <em>the ball</em>.<strong><br />
		Sentence 2</strong> is in the Passive 
		voice.<br />
		The agent is still <em>John</em> but he is no longer the subject of the 
		verb.&nbsp; The verb remains the same but is modified by forming the 
		tense with the verb <em>be</em>.&nbsp; The patient has been raised to 
		the subject position but is still <em>the ball</em>.</p>

		<p>What is the difference <strong>in structure</strong> between active and passive 
		sentences.&nbsp; Think for a minute and <a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'voice1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">then click 
		here</a>.</p>
		<div id="voice1" style="visibility: hidden">In an active sentence 
			6, 
			we have the following order:<br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject 
			(e.g., <em>the dog</em>) + verb (e.g., <em>dropped</em>) + Object 
			(e.g., <em>the bone</em>)</span>
			<p>In a passive sentence 10, we have the following order:<br />
			<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Object (<em>the bone</em>) + tense of the 
			verb to be (<em>was</em>) + past participle (<em>dropped</em>) [+ by 
			+ Subject (<em>the dog</em>)]</span></p>
			<p>In <strong>Sentences 8 and 9</strong>, we don't have the last part [in square 
			brackets].&nbsp; More about why later.<br />
			A simpler and equally correct analysis is that the object of an 
			active sentence has been promoted to the subject.

					<h2>Forming the passive in English</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Traditionally, the passive in English is formed like this, 
			starting with an active sentence.&nbsp; The active sentence for our 
			example is:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary photographed the bird in the garden<br />
			</em>These five steps are how we make the active sentence passive:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Move the object to the front of the sentence (raising it to the 
			subject position and making it what can now be called the patient)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bird ...</em></li>
			<li>Insert the appropriate tense of the verb <em>be</em> (in this 
			case simple past)<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bird was ...</em></li>
			<li>Insert the past participle of the main verb (in this case the 
			regular form):<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bird was photographed ...</em></li>
			<li>Add, if the meaning requires it, the <em>by</em>-phrase to say 
			who the original subject of the verb is, now called the agent:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bird was photographed by Mary</em> ...</li>
			<li>Insert any additional information at the end<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bird was photographed by Mary in the garden<br />
			</em>(The ordering of the <em>by</em>-phrase and extra information 
			can be reversed so we can have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bird was photographed in the garden last 
			Tuesday afternoon, in the rain by Mary</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;The bird was photographed in the garden by Mary last 
			Tuesday afternoon in the rain</em><br />
			and so on.)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Complex tense forms with longer subjects and objects conform to the 
		same rules to convert sentences so we can form the passive from the 
		active:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The garage on the corner should have been servicing my 
		and Mary's new Volvo car this week but the owner is off sick</em><br />
		as<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; My and Mary's new Volvo car should have been being 
		serviced by the garage on the corner this week but the owner is off sick</em></p>

					<h3>Alternative ways to form passives</h3>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In the in-service guide to this area linked in the list of related guides at the end there is much 
			more on this.&nbsp; Briefly, English has two other main ways to form 
			passive sentences:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>With the verb <em>get</em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;The flowers got battered by the rain</em><br />
			vs.<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; The flowers were battered by the rain</em><br />
			The sentence with <em>got</em> focuses on the action of 
			the rain (it's called a <strong>dynamic</strong> passive) but the 
			sentence with <em>were</em> focuses on the state of the flowers 
			after the rain (it's called a <strong>stative</strong> passive).</li>
			<li>With the verbs <em>get</em> and <em>have</em>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I had my car serviced by the garage on the corner</em><br />
			or<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I got my car serviced by the garage on the corner</em><br />
			In both cases, this is called a <strong>causative</strong> 
			construction and, naturally, there's a guide on the site for more on 
			that linked in the list of related guides at the end.</li>
		</ol>

			<p>Languages deal with these things very differently.&nbsp; In some, 
		such as Mandarin, there is arguably no true equivalent.&nbsp; Others, 
		such as Greek, use a special form of the verb and some, such as Spanish, 
		make a construction similar to the way English makes a passive.</p>
		<p>Why can't you make a passive of something like <em>The book fell</em> 
		or <em>John arrived</em>?<br />
		Right &ndash; the verb must be a transitive one (see
		the guide to word class linked in the list of related guides at the end).&nbsp; In other 
		words, there has to <strong>be</strong> an object to move to the front 
		or patient position.</p>

		<p>You could argue that<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They baked the cake<br />
		</em>and<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cake 
		was baked by them<br />
		</em>mean the same thing.&nbsp; In many older 
		coursebooks (and some not-so-old ones) this is strongly implied by 
		exercises requiring learners to transform sentences from one voice to 
		another.</p>
		<p>However, the grammar we use to express our thoughts is not randomly 
		selected.&nbsp; There <strong>is</strong> a difference between <strong>Sentences 
		3 to 6</strong> and <strong>Sentences 7 to 10</strong> above.<br />
		In the passive sentence we have chosen to put the most important element 
		of the sentence at the front (that's why it's called <strong>fronting</strong>).&nbsp; 
		We do this for three main reasons:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Because we are less interested in who did something and more 
			concerned with the receiver of the action.&nbsp; In <strong>Sentence 7</strong>, we 
			are interested in what happened to her but in <strong>Sentence 3</strong>, we are 
			concerned with what the police did.</li>
			<li>Because it's obvious what the subject is so unnecessary to state 
			it.&nbsp; <strong>Sentence 5</strong> actually sounds odd to many and the idea is 
			better expressed by <strong>Sentence 9</strong>.&nbsp; It's obvious that people do 
			the admiring.</li>
			<li>Because we don't know what the subject is.&nbsp; So, in 
			sentences such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window has been broken<br />
			</em>or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My car 
			has been stolen<br />
			</em>we use a passive to avoid a clumsy '<em>someone 
			has</em>' formulation.&nbsp; In any case, it's the <em>window</em> 
			and the <em>car</em> that concern us, not the vandal or the thief.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>There is a fourth use of the passive which, oddly, can be used to 
		emphasise the Subject.&nbsp; This is usually a spoken form because we 
		need to stress the subject of the verb when we speak:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window was broken</em><strong><em> by her</em></strong> (not me)<br />
		or<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was arrested <strong>by </strong> </em><strong><em>the police</em></strong> 
		(not the customs people)</p>
		<p>In informal speech, we often use <em>get</em> instead of the verb <em>
		be</em>.&nbsp; E.g., <em>I don't know how the window got broken</em>.</p>
