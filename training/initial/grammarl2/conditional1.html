		<span class="auto-style4">From "If" by Rudyard Kipling</span></p>
		<p>Conditionals are a special form of sentences with a main and a 
		subordinate clause (see the section on 
		<a href="../lexis/conjunctionsessentials.html">conjunctions</a> in the word class 
		area) which show how one event depends on another.&nbsp; Here are a few 
		examples:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em><a name="3"></a>If you see John, will you ask him?</em></li>
			<li><em>I would not bother with it if I were you.</em></li>
			<li><em>You wouldn't have had an accident if you had looked where you 
			were going.</em></li>
			<li><em>If it rains all night, the road'll be flooded by dawn.</em></li>
			<li><em>He would come if you bothered to invite him.</em></li>
			<li><em>If it hadn't been for the rain, we would have won the match.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>In this list, there are two examples of each of the three basic 
		types.&nbsp; Divide up the list and think about what the sentences mean 
		before you

		</table>
		<p>
		The form is easy 
		enough and most learners get it quickly.&nbsp; It is analogous to lots 
		of other similar forms in English such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will tell him when I see 
		him</em>.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I will ask her to marry me because I love her</em>.<br />
		The concept is slightly more difficult.&nbsp; First conditional forms are 
		concerned with future events and imply that if one condition is met 
		(<em>coming, pushing hard</em>) the other event (<em>seeing, moving</em>) 
		will follow.<em><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If it rains, 
		I'll take an umbrella.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If it doesn't snow again, I'll take the dogs out.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		What will you do if it rains?</em></p>
		<p>
		We can use other modal auxiliary verbs to make the outcome less certain 
		but the consequences of one action being followed by the other are still 
		clear.&nbsp; For example,<em><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If you come, you might see John.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If you come, 
		you should see John.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it stops snowing, I may take the dogs out.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he comes at all, he should be here by six.</em></p><hr />

		<p>
		Again, this is not too 
		complicated but there are two possible concepts here.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Unlikely condition</strong>: the speaker does not believe there 
		is a high likelihood of an event occurring but if it does, the follow-on 
		event is certain:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I won the lottery I'd be happy (but I don't think I'll win it).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If they gave me an extra holiday, I would be really happy (but I don't 
		think they will)</em>.<strong><br /></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What would you do if you won the lottery? (but I don't 
		think you'll win)</em></li>
			<li><strong>Unreal condition:</strong> the speaker does not believe that an event is 
		at all possible logically&nbsp;but is happy to speculate about the outcomes 
		of an unreal event.<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If I were you, I'd buy it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If I had a penny 
		for every time I've said that, I'd be a wealthy woman.</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Both unlikely and unreal conditionals are called hypothetical 
		conditionals in many analyses.<em><br /></em>Again, we can use other (past) modal 
		auxiliary verbs to make the outcome 
		less certain but the consequences of one action being followed by the 
		other are still clear.&nbsp; For example:<em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If you came, you might 
		see her.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If you came, you could see her.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you went to the meeting you would have to explain the 
		problem (so don't go)</em>.</p>

		<p>Now that <strong>is</strong> complicated and learners need lots of practice just to get 
		the form right.<br />
		This form refers only to the past and, therefore, in part to clearly 
		unreal, impossible events.&nbsp; It is used for regrets, criticisms and 
		speculation and a number of other meanings.&nbsp; Here are some 
		examples:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>regret</dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If I'd had the money, I would have 
		bought it<br />
		</em>and I regret the fact that I didn't have the money.</dd>
			<dt>criticism</dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If you had driven more carefully, you wouldn't have dented 
		the car<br />
		</em>and I am suggesting that you <strong>should</strong> have driven 
			more carefully.</dd>
			<dt>speculation</dt>
			<dd><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If Napoleon had won the battle of Waterloo, what would Europe have been 
		like?<br />
		</em>and I'm asking you to speculate about an impossible past situation.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>Again, we can use other modal auxiliary verbs to alter the sense slightly.&nbsp; 
		For example:<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you had driven more carefully, you might not have 
		dented the car<br />
		</em>in which I may simply be speculating about the past rather than 
		criticising<em>.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If I'd had the money, I could have bought it<br />
		</em>in which I am expressing past inability rather than regret.</p>

	<dt><strong>The so-called zero conditional</strong></dt>
	<dd>A form such as<em><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	If you mix black and white you get grey<br />
	</em>with a 
	present tense in both halves and no <em>will</em> is sometime called a zero 
	conditional.&nbsp; There's an argument that it isn't a conditional at all 
	because <em>if</em> can be replaced with <em>whenever</em> or <em>when</em>.&nbsp; 
	It is quite an easy form to learn and paralleled in some languages but some languages reserve a special word for <em>if</em> which is 
	<strong>not</strong> 
	interchangeable with <em>whenever</em> like this.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Speaker / writer perception</strong></dt>
			<dd>In particular when choosing between a 1st conditional and 2nd 
			conditional form, it is the speaker's <strong>perception</strong> which matters most.&nbsp; 
			Compare:<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			If I win the lottery, I'll buy a new house </em>with<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			If I won the lottery, I'd buy a new house<br />
			</em>In the first, 
			the speaker appears more optimistic than in the second.&nbsp; The 
			second is an unreal condition because the speaker does not believe 
			it will happen.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Mixed conditionals</strong></dt>
			<dd>When there is a time change from one half of the conditional to 
			the other, the tenses no longer seem to make sense sometimes.<br />
			There are two important forms of these sorts of mixed conditionals 
			and they both mix second and third conditional structures:
			<ol class="auto-style25">
				<li>a past action with a present consequence.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			If I had brought my car I would give you a lift<br />
				</em>Here, the 
			beginning<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I had brought<br />
				</em>usually implies an end of<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			would have given<br />
				</em>but in this case the fact that I didn't bring 
			the car is in the past but the consequence of not being able to give a lift lies 
			either now or in the future so the tenses shift to allow this.<em><br />
				</em>Another example is:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If she had told me where it was I wouldn't be wasting time 
				looking</em><br />
				in which a past non-event has a present consequence.</li>
				<li>a present fact with a past consequence.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; If I weren't so busy this week, I would have taken the 
				time to visit you</em><br />
				in which the present state of being busy has an implication for 
				an unrealized past act.<br />
				Another example is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I would have finished by now if the boss didn't 
				continually interrupt<br />
				</em>in which the present event affects the past.</li>
			</ol>
			</dd>
			<dt><strong>Modal verbs in conditional sentences</strong></dt>
			<dd>We can use other modal verbs instead of <em>will</em> or <em>
			would</em> to change the sense of a conditional.&nbsp; For example, 
			we can change<em>:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			If I go to the meeting, I will complain about it<br />
			</em>to<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			If I go to the meeting, I might complain about it<br />
			</em>This can happen in all the conditional types so we can get sentences 
			such as:<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			If you had spoken more softly, she might have been more 
			receptive<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			If I won the money I could buy the car<br />
			</em>and 
			so on.</dd><dt><strong>Other varieties of English</strong></dt>
			<dd>In colloquial American English (and other standards) it is common 
			to have a sentence like<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			If I would have known I would have said<br />
			</em>or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would tell you if I would know<br />
			</em>and there's a famous 
			song with the line<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			"<em>If I knew you were coming, I'd have baked a 
			cake</em>".</dd>
			<dt><strong>The meaning of <em>will</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>Compare:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you will give up smoking, I will stop complaining</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you give up smoking, I will stop complaining.</em><br />
			In the first of these (<em>If you will give up smoking</em>), the 
			word <em>will</em> means <em>show willingness</em> and is <strong>
			not</strong> a future form at all so the word appears in both parts 
			of the sentence.&nbsp; It could be re-phrased as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you commit 
			to giving up smoking, I will commit to not complaining.</em><br />
			The second example is the familiar 1st conditional form in which the 
			second event is dependent on the first.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Alternatives to <em>if</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>A number of phrases can take the place of <em>if</em> and they change the 
			style (usually making it more formal) but not the fundamental sense 
			of the sentence.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			S<em>he'll come providing you invite her</em><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'd pay as long as they had the money<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I'll do it on condition that you won't complain later</em></dd>
			<dt><strong><em>unless</em></strong></dt>
			<dd>This word is often understood to mean <em>if not </em>(i.e., 
			it's the negative of <em>if</em>).&nbsp; That's not exactly right 
			because it really means <em>only if ... not</em>.<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless you have a car with you, I'll give you a lift home<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I'll open the box unless you tell me not to</em></dd>
			<dt><strong>Reversing the clauses</strong></dt>
			<dd>We can, of course, have<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you came, you'd be able to talk to her</em><br />
			and<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'd be able to talk to her if you came</em><br />
			They mean fundamentally the same thing but the emphasis is slightly 
			different.&nbsp; Speakers will generally put first what they 
			consider most important.</dd>
