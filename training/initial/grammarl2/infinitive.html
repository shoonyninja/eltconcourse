			<h1>The infinitive</h1>
			
			<img height="206" src="../../images/infinity310.jpg" width="310" alt="infinite" />
			<h2>Why is it called the infinitive?</h2>
			<p>The infinitive in English is known as non-finite.&nbsp; That 
			means that you can't tell by looking at it whether it refers to me, 
			you, lots of people, the past, the present or the future.&nbsp; 
			Compare, for example, the verbs in<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He <span class="style_black">wants</span> to 
			<span class="style_red">make</span> a cake</em>.<br />
			The verb <span class="style_black"> <em>wants</em></span> has an <em>-s</em> ending here and that tells us that 
			it refers to a singular person, it refers to the third person (it 
			can't refer to me or you) and it is present tense.&nbsp; If we 
			change the form of this verb, we change its meaning:<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; He wanted to make a cake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They want to make a cake</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			The verb <span class="style_red"> <em>make</em></span> does not tell us any of these things.&nbsp; 
			It will not change if I replace <em>he </em>with <em>you</em> or <em>
			wants</em> with <em>wanted</em> or <em>want</em>.</p>

					<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>English uses the infinitive in lots of different ways and 
			the important ones are considered here.<br />
			Many languages operate differently and some, such as Greek, do not 
			have an infinitive at all.&nbsp; Learners have some difficulty with 
			the infinitive and we get errors such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>*I went for shopping.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>*I want go.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>*I can to do it.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>*I ought arrive early.</em></li>

			</table>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>the bare infinitive</strong></dt>
				<dd>this form of the infinitive is sometimes called the zero 
				infinitive and occurs in these examples:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What he did was </em><span class="style_red"><em>make</em></span><em> 
				a terrible mess.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I can </em><span class="style_red"><em>see</em></span><em> it.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I saw him </em><span class="style_red"><em>do</em></span><em> 
				it.</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>the </strong><em><strong>to-</strong></em><strong>infinitive</strong></dt>
				<dd>this occurs more frequently.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want <span class="style_red">to go</span> home.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She tried <span class="style_red">to help</span>.<br />
				<span class="style_red">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To go</span> to America has been his 
				dream.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I need a hammer <span class="style_red">to break</span> it open.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				It is vital <span class="style_red">to understand</span> the 
				form.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I had too much work <span class="style_red">to do</span>.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Can you tell me how <span class="style_red">to get</span> to the 
				meeting?</em></dd>

			<h3>after modal verbs</h3>
			<p>The bare infinitive is the most common verb form after modal 
			auxiliary verbs in English.&nbsp; There is <a href="modalityessentials.html">a guide to 
			modal verbs</a> on this site.&nbsp; The modal verbs followed by the 
			bare infinitive with examples are:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style49"><em>can<br />
					could<br />
					had better<br />
					may<br />
					might<br />
					must<br />
					shall<br />
					should<br />
					will<br />

					She couldn't </em> <span class="style_red"><em>help</em></span><em><br />
					I had better </em> <span class="style_red"><em>go</em></span><em><br />
					We may </em> <span class="style_red"><em>arrive</em></span><em> late<br />
					John might </em> <span class="style_red"><em>be</em></span><em> there<br />
					I must </em> <span class="style_red"><em>confess</em></span><em><br />
					We shall not </em> <span class="style_red"><em>do</em></span><em> it<br />
					I should </em> <span class="style_red"><em>think</em></span><em> so<br />
					They will </em> <span class="style_red"><em>come</em></span><em><br />
					I would </em> <span class="style_red"><em>enjoy</em></span><em> that</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table><p>Learners have a good deal of trouble with modal verbs in 
			English, not least because many of them perform more than one 
			function.&nbsp; One central problem is that they have slightly 
			peculiar structures so we get errors such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>*I don't can come</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>*I should to help</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>*I must to see it</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>etc.<br />
			The most important issue here is that these auxiliary modal verbs 
			<strong>cannot be followed by the</strong><em><strong> to-</strong></em><strong>infinitive</strong>.&nbsp; Learners need lots 
			of practice to get it right.</p>
			<h3>after verbs of perception</h3>
			<p>Here are some examples of what's meant here:</p>
			<ul class="redbulletlist">
				<li><em>I heard it <span class="style_red">break</span>.</em></li>
				<li><em>I saw him <span class="style_red">arrive</span>.</em></li>
				<li><em>I felt it <span class="style_red">tremble</span>.</em></li>
				<li><em>I watched him <span class="style_red">work</span>.</em></li>
				<li><em>I listened to her <span class="style_red">play</span>.</em></li>
				<li><em>I sensed it <span class="style_red">vibrate</span>.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We can of course, also use another non-finite verb with these 
			examples such as <em>I saw him arriving, I listened to her playing</em> 
			etc.&nbsp; However, the sense changes slightly to emphasise that an 
			action was in progress rather than completed.</p>
			<p>Learners will frequently be tempted to use the wrong form with 
			these verbs and produce, e.g., <em>*I saw him arrived, *I heard it 
			to break</em> etc.</p>
			<h3>with <em>make</em> and <em>let</em></h3>
			<p>For example,</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I made him <span class="style_red">
				understand</span>.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I let him <span class="style_red">
				leave</span> early.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I didn't make him
				<span class="style_red">do</span> the work.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I can't let him
				<span class="style_red">go</span> yet.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The difficulty for learners with these two verbs is that other 
			verbs which mean pretty much the same thing take the infinitive with
			<em>to</em>.&nbsp; For example, <em>I obliged him to come, I forced 
			him to tell me, I allowed him to go, We were permitted to go in.</em>&nbsp; 
			The result, naturally, is that learners will often produce things 
			like <em>*I made him to come, *She let him to see </em>etc.</p>
			<h3>after <em>why</em></h3>
			<p>The question word <em>why</em> is very often followed by the bare 
			infinitive.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>Why not </em>
				<span class="style_red"><em>go</em></span><em> to the cinema?</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>Why </em><span class="style_red">
				<em>tell</em></span><em> her no?</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>Why </em><span class="style_red">
				<em>behave</em></span><em> so rudely?</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Usually, of course, <em>why</em> is followed by question forms 
			such as in<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you need it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is the door open?<br />
			</em>etc.&nbsp; 
			It can also frequently be used with negative questions as in:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why 
			don't we see it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why can't you come?<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Understandably, this causes problems and learners may produce, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Why not to go?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Why shouldn't he to come?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Why you go now?<br />
			</em>etc. because these sorts of constructions may be the way their 
			languages do things.</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<h3>verbs of expectation, purpose and volition</h3>
			<p>Some verbs, especially those which refer in some way to the 
			future rather than to past experience, are followed by the <em>to-</em>infinitive.&nbsp; Here are some examples:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I expect <span class="style_red">
				to arrive</span> around 6.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I hope <span class="style_red">to see</span> you.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I've decided
				<span class="style_red">to go</span>.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I would love
				<span class="style_red">to come</span>.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I want <span class="style_red">to 
				see</span> you.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I agreed<span class="style_red"> 
				to go</span>.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I intend <span class="style_red">
				to do</span> it soon.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I resolved never
				<span class="style_red">to talk </span>to her.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I offered <span class="style_red">
				to help</span>.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>He reminded me
				<span class="style_red">to post</span> it.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I went <span class="style_red">to 
				get</span> the money.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I came <span class="style_red">to help</span>.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I have nothing
				<span class="style_red">to wear</span>.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I want a garden
				<span class="style_red">to sit</span> in.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>On the other hand, verbs which are based on our experience or 
			refer to past events and situations more commonly take an<em> -ing</em> 
			form verb:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dislike standing in queues<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered meeting 
			her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She loves reading<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John admitted breaking it<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Understandably, and predictably, this is not an easy area for 
			learners (not least because some teachers assume the forms are 
			random) so we get errors such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I want having it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I 
			remembered to meet him the week before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She agreed going<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She 
			agreed go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I expect arriving</em> etc.<br />
			There's <a href="gerund.html" target="_blank">a guide to this area</a> 
			on this site.</p>
			<p>The idea of purpose is sometimes treated separately, even being 
			given its own title of 'the infinitive of purpose', but it falls into this category.<br />
			It is less simple to see that <em>to</em> is sometimes just an 
			abbreviation of <em>in order to</em>.&nbsp; This confuses.&nbsp; 
			Compare for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I agreed <span class="style_red">
				to go</span> to the restaurant </em>(<em>to-</em>infinitive 
				used to refer to a future event)<em>.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I agreed (in order)
				<span class="style_red">to get</span> a bit of peace. 
				</em>(expressing the <strong>purpose</strong> for the agreement).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If there is a possibility of ambiguity, most speakers will use 
			the <em>in order to</em> formulation.</p>
			<p>The verb <em>tell</em> is followed by the <em>to-</em>infinitive:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her to wait<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me to leave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please 
			tell them to hurry.<br />
			</em>Compare <em>make</em> above.&nbsp; 
			In the sense of <em>order / command, tell</em> refers to the future (the 
			telling comes before the action).&nbsp; In the sense of <em>explain</em>, 
			the word follows the pattern of other verbs + question words (see 
			below).&nbsp; Either way, it is followed by the <em>to-</em>infinitive.</p>
			<h3>after adjectives</h3>
			<p>Many adjectives are routinely followed by the <em>to-</em>infinitive.&nbsp; Frequently, these take the form of using a dummy 
			subject (<em>it</em>) to stand for the action or event.&nbsp; They 
			are also very often adjectives which express an opinion about 
			something.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>It's important
				<span class="style_red">to remember</span> that.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>It's interesting
				<span class="style_red">to read</span> that.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>It was wrong of you
				<span class="style_red">to do</span> it so carelessly.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>It's good <span class="style_red">
				to talk</span>.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>She thought she was stupid
				<span class="style_red">to go </span>out in the rain.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>They said I was dumb
				<span class="style_red">to ask</span> too many questions.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>It's surprising
				<span class="style_red">to see </span>him come early.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>It's horrible
				<span class="style_red">to talk</span> about.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Just as we can use most adjectives before or following the noun 
			as in, for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>It's an interesting book. </em>vs.<em> The book is interesting.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>The house over the road was ugly.</em> 
				vs. <em>The ugly house was over the road.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>etc.</p>
			<p>it is also possible, but rarer and usually a little formal, to 
			make the <em>to-</em>infinitive the subject of the sentence as in, e.g.,</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em><span class="style_red">To tell</span> 
				him was silly.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em><span class="style_red">To run</span> 
				around looking is useless.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em><span class="style_red">To do</span> 
				it or not is the question.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>etc.</p>
			<p>As you might expect, learners make errors.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>*It's better remembering that.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>*It's wrong do it.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>*He's silly do that.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>after some modal verbs</h3>
			<p>There's a bit of an argument about whether we should analyse a 
			structure like<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ought to write to my mother<br />
			</em>as containing<em> 
			ought</em> plus the <em>to-</em>infinitive or <em>ought to</em> plus the 
			bare infinitive.&nbsp; Whichever way it is analysed, the following 
			modal and semi-modal verbs come with <em>to</em> or are followed by 
			the <em>to-</em>infinitive:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td class="style_black"><em>be able<br />
					have<br />
					dare<br />
					need<br />
					ought<br />
					used</em></td>
					<td><em>They are able</em><span class="style_red"><em> to help</em></span><em><br />
					I have </em><span class="style_red"><em>to confess</em></span><em><br />
					She didn't dare </em> <span class="style_red"><em>to</em></span>
					<span class="style_red"><em>tell me</em></span><em><br />
					I need </em> <span class="style_red"><em>to go</em></span><em><br />
					We ought </em> <span class="style_red"><em>to arrive</em></span><em> on time<br />
					I used </em> <span class="style_red"><em>to enjoy</em></span><em> tennis</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<h3>with adverbials using <em>too</em> and <em>enough</em></h3>
			<p>These are common constructions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I have more than enough work </em>
				<span class="style_red"><em>to do</em></span><em>, thank you.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>There's too much wrong with it
				</em><span class="style_red"><em>to repair</em></span><em> it.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>We won't have enough money </em>
				<span class="style_red"><em>to spend</em></span><em>.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>There was too much noise </em>
				<span class="style_red"><em>to think</em></span><em> properly.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>It's too early </em>
				<span class="style_red"><em>to tell</em></span><em>.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The confusion between <em>to</em> and <em>too</em> is an obvious 
			issue but learners will also make errors such as<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I had enough 
			spend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She had too much work for leaving early<br />
			</em>etc.</p>
			<h3>with <em>how, where, when, what </em>(but

			<p>With exposure and a bit of practice , most learners have little 
			trouble with this area.&nbsp; There is a temptation to avoid the 
			structures, however, and produce clumsy sentences such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I demonstrated to him the way to 
				work the coffee maker.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I didn't understand the method to 
				do the calculation.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I didn't know the place to put it.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>I asked him what was the time to 
				come.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>or even errors such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>*I described the way coming to my 
				house.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>*I realised what was the problem 
				to doing it.</em></li>
				<li class="redbulletlist"><em>*Please show me how I am working 
				it.</em></li>
			</ul>
