		<h1>Pure modal auxiliary verbs one by one</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="jellyfish" height="207" src="../../images/animals_jellyfish310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p>There is a general <a href="modalityessentials.html">guide to modality 
		and modal auxiliary verbs</a> 
		which you should follow before you access this area.&nbsp; This section 
		focuses only on true, central or pure modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; There is another
		<a href="../../inservice/modality/semimodals.html">guide to 
		semi-modal auxiliary verbs</a> which covers <em>dare, need </em>and<em> used to</em> 
		and marginal modal auxiliary verbs such as <em>seem to, tend to, be about to</em> etc.<br />
		An alternative view is presented in
		<a href="../../inservice/modality/typesofmodality.html">the guide to 
		types of modality</a>.</p>
		<p>What follows is a guide to the main modal auxiliary verbs in English, taken one 
		by one.&nbsp; We will look at the possible 
		functions of each modal and 
		how it is used.<br />
		<span class="auto-style12">Sections in this colour in the notes 
		following each table concern <span class="style_underline">areas which cause specific and predictable 
		problems for learners</span>.&nbsp; It is these in particular that you must be 
		able to analyse and explain in the classroom.</span><br />
		Tests in sections of this page only 
		exist for the more complex verbs but there's a link to a test on all of 
		them at the end.&nbsp; <a href="allmodalshp.htm">Try it now</a> if you 
		like.</p>
		<p><strong>The identification of pure modal auxiliary verbs</strong> is often limited 
		to 9 verbs:<br />
		<em>can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will</em> and <em>would</em>.<br />
		In this analysis, however, two more are included, the verbs <em>had 
		better</em> 
				and<em> ought to, </em>which share structural characteristics 
		with the central nine<em>.<br />
		</em>Elsewhere, you will find verbs included in or excluded from this 
		list.&nbsp; If you have followed the essential guide to this area you 
		may recall the following section.<br />
		Traditionally, in order to be included as a pure or central modal 
		auxiliary the verb needs to conform to some tests:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The verbs cannot co-occur (appear together) so, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I must can do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I will must do it</em><br />
			are impossible because both <em>must</em> and <em>can</em> are pure 
			or central modal auxiliary verbs.&nbsp; However<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may be able to do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have to see him</em><br />
			are possible so <em>be able to </em>and <em>have t</em>o are not, by 
			this test pure modal auxiliary verbs.</li>
			<li>The verbs do not change to show person so in, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has to go but that aren't able to</em><br />
			the verb <em>have</em> changes to <em>has</em> and the verb <em>be</em> 
			changes to <em>are</em> but:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *She musts come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He wills do it</em><br />
			are not possible so <em>must</em> and <em>will</em> are both pure 
			modal auxiliary verbs but <em>have to</em> and <em>be able</em> to are not.</li>
			<li>The verbs are used to form negative and questions by being moved 
			to the beginning of the clause or being followed directly by <em>not</em> 
			so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May she come?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't go</em><br />
			are all possible as are<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't have to go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They didn't need to go</em><br />
			but<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Do I must see him?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *They don't should be here</em><br />
			etc. are not possible so <em>must</em> and <em>should</em> are pure 
			modal auxiliary verbs and the others are not in the same class.</li>

		<p>Notes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><span class="auto-style14">Present possibility</span> and 
			<span class="auto-style14">future possibility</span> are not always easy 
			to distinguish.&nbsp; For teaching purposes, it's rarely important 
			to do so because the forms and functions are the same.</li>
			<li>Most uses of <em>could</em> refer to <span class="auto-style14">possibility</span> or 
			<span class="auto-style14">ability</span>.<span class="auto-style12"><br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could have left her 
			keys with John<br />
			</em>can refer to both </span>
			<span class="auto-style14">possibility</span><span class="auto-style12"> 
			<span class="style_underline">and</span> </span><span class="auto-style14">ability</span><span class="auto-style12">.&nbsp; 
			It means either:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John offered to look after the keys so she was 
			able to leave them with him<br />
			</em>or<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			It is possible that she left 
			her keys with John </em>(and that's why she can't find them now)<span class="style_underline"><br />
			Only</span> the second use of <em>
			could </em>can be replaced with <em>might</em> (<a href="#might">see below</a>).</span></li>
			<li><span class="auto-style12"><em>be able to </em>is only an alternative if the sense 
			expresses </span> <span class="auto-style14">ability</span><span class="auto-style12">.&nbsp;
			<span class="style_underline">General</span> </span>
			<span class="auto-style14">ability in the past</span><span class="auto-style12"> 
			can be expressed either with <em>could</em> or <em>was able to:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could speak French = I was able to speak French</em>.<br />
			However, if we refer to a <span class="style_underline">specific 
			instance of success</span>, only <em>was able to</em> is possible:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to say the word in French<br />
			</em>NOT<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>I could say the 
			word in French</em>.</span></li>
			<li>When used for <span class="auto-style14">permission</span>, the verb is generally confined to 
			formal(ish) questions.</li>
			<li>For the <span class="auto-style14">negative deduction</span> uses of
			<em>could/couldn't have</em>, see under <em><a href="#must">must</a></em> 
			below.</li>
			<li>When used for <span class="auto-style14">complaints</span>, the verb is usually interchangeable 
			with <em>might</em> and always in the perfect tense.</li>
			<li>When used for <span class="auto-style14">future ability</span> or <span class="auto-style14">possibility</span>, the question forms 
			often imply a <span class="auto-style14">request</span> rather than an enquiry about 
			<span class="auto-style14">ability</span> or 
			<span class="auto-style14">possibility</span>.&nbsp; For example:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you open the door?<br />
			</em>is not about <span class="auto-style14">enquiring about future ability</span> but it could be 
			<span class="auto-style14">enquiring about past ability</span> or a 
			<span class="auto-style14">request</span> for some help.</li>

		<p>Notes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Some of these are quite unusual and wouldn't be taught at lower 
			levels.&nbsp; E.g., <em>might </em>for <span class="auto-style14">permission</span> and 
			<span class="auto-style14">suggestions</span>.</li>
			<li><span class="auto-style12"><em>might</em> never refers to </span> <span class="auto-style14">ability 
			so:<br />
			</span><span class="auto-style12"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She might have left her 
			keys with John<br />
			</em>can <span class="style_underline">only</span> 
			refer to </span><span class="auto-style14">possibility</span><span class="auto-style12">: 
			it means<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible that she left her keys with John </em>
			(and that's why she can't find them now)<br />
			This use of <em>
			might</em> can also be replaced with <em>could </em>(<a href="#could">see above</a>).</span></li>
			<li>The negative of the use for <span class="auto-style14">permission </span>is usually expressed with
			<em>mustn't </em>or<em> can't:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We mustn't/can't go</em></li>
			<li><span class="auto-style12">The negative of the use for</span> <span class="auto-style14">past possibility</span><span class="auto-style12">:<br />
			
			<span class="style_underline">when the speaker is quite sure</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He couldn't / can't 
			have got out<br />
			</em><span class="style_underline">when the speaker is unsure</span> 
			we use <em>might</em>:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He might not have tried to telephone me</em></span></li>
			<li><em>might</em> is often seen as adding 'distance' &ndash; making

		<p>Notes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>Would </em>is one of the most common words in English, 
			ranking approximately in 60th place.</li>
			<li>The <span class="auto-style14">conditional uses</span> are extremely common.&nbsp; 
			This is also called the <span class="auto-style14">contingent use</span>.</li>
			<li>When used to describe <span class="auto-style14">past habit</span>, it follows an initial use of
			<em>used to</em> and often expresses nostalgia.</li>
			<li>When followed by <em>rather</em>, with or without <em>... than 
			...</em>, the modal indicates <span class="style_black">preference</span>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<em>I'd rather stay in and watch television (than ...).</em></li>
			<li>There is a slightly unusual use of <em>would</em> to express an

		<p>Notes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The difference between strong <span class="auto-style14">advice</span> and 
			<span class="auto-style14">obligation</span> is often 
			very blurred (if it exists at all).</li>
			<li><span class="auto-style12"><em>must</em> can be replaced by <em>have to</em> in certain 
			circumstances only.</span><br />
			<span class="auto-style14">External vs. internal obligation</span><span class="auto-style12">: 
			it is often asserted that <em>have to </em>implies an external 
			obligation but <em>must</em> refers to an internal one.&nbsp; 
			Compare<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must get this </em>done<br />
			which can mean that this is a self-imposed obligation, with<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to 
			get this done<br />
			</em>which can imply an external obligation.<em><br />
			</em>Too much can be made of this dubious distinction 
			and it's probably not worth teaching it because native speakers use 
			the verbs in free variation in most cases.<br />
			Tenses: <em>must</em> has no future or past forms for </span>
			<span class="auto-style14">obligation</span><span class="auto-style12"> 
			(but it does in the sense of </span><span class="style_black"> 
			deduction</span><span class="auto-style12">, see note 4.) so the use of <em>have to </em>is 
			obligatory in, e.g.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to do it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll have to wait and see<br />
			</em>etc</span><em>.</em></li>
			<li><span class="auto-style12">The negative of <em>must </em>for</span> <span class="auto-style14">obligation</span> 
			<span class="auto-style12">has two forms:</span><em><br />
			</em>1. <span class="auto-style14">No obligation</span>: <em>needn't/don't have to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You needn't/don't have to go</em>)<em><br />
			</em><span class="auto-style12">Only <em>didn't have 
			to/didn't need to</em> express a </span><span class="auto-style14">
			lack of obligation in the past</span><span class="auto-style12">.&nbsp; 
			The expression <em>needn't have </em>suggests something was 
			unnecessarily done.&nbsp; Compare<br />
			<em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't need to do it</em> 
			(so didn't)<br />
			with<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He needn't have done it</em> (but did).</span><em><br />
			</em>2. <span class="auto-style14">Negative obligation</span>: <em>must not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mustn't go</em></li>
			<li>The negative of the use for <span class="auto-style14">deduction</span> 
			in standard British English is formed with <em>could 
			not</em> or <em>cannot:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He can't have done it by 
			himself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It couldn't have been the same man<br />
			</em>However, in 
			some varieties <em>must not</em> is used for a <span class="auto-style14">
			negative logical deduction</span>.<br />
			This sense of 
			the verb <strong>does</strong> have a past form:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He must have 
			escaped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He couldn't have known<br />
			</em>etc.</li>

		<p>Notes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The <span class="auto-style14">permission</span> use is often seen as a more formal version of <em>
			can</em>.&nbsp; Compare <em>might.</em></li>
			<li>The <span class="auto-style14">possibility</span> use often implies less likelihood than <em>
			could</em>.&nbsp; Compare<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can be cold in April<br />
			</em>with<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
			may be cold in April<br />

		<h3><a name="will"></a>will</h3>
		<p>Essentially, <em>will</em> performs the following functions in 
		English (see also <a href="tenses.html" target="_blank">the section on tenses</a> for the use of <em>will</em> to 
		talk about the future):</p>

		<p>Notes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The <span class="auto-style14">insistence</span> use never contracts <em>will </em>to<em> 'll.</em></li>
			<li>The <span class="auto-style14">intention</span> use is almost always only first person 
			unless we are reporting what someone else intended to do:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll come early to help<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
			said he'll write when he can<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said you'll do it<br />
			</em>etc.</li>
			<li>The negative of the use for <span class="auto-style14">deduction</span> is 
			often formed with <em>cannot:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That can't be the 
			postman<br />
			</em>but if the speaker is more certain or is basing the 
			statement on evidence or experience then<em> 
			won't</em> can be used:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That won't be 
			the postman; it's too early</em>.</li>
			<li>The use for ability is somewhat formal and may be replaced by 
			the present simple tense.</li>

		<h3><a name="shall"></a>shall</h3>
		<p>Essentially, <em>shall</em> performs limited modal functions in 
		English (see also <a href="tenses.html" target="_blank">the section on tenses</a> for the use of 
		<em>shall</em> to 
		talk about the future):</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style7">

		<p>Notes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The <span class="auto-style14">suggestion/offer</span> use only 
			occurs as an interrogative.&nbsp; This use is confined to the first

			<li>The <span class="style_black">obligation</span> function expresses great determination and is

		<h3><a name="ought"></a>ought to</h3>

				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 126px">advice</td>
				<td class="auto-style9"><em>You ought to take him to the vet.</em></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Notes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The difference between strong <span class="auto-style14">advice</span> and 
			<span class="auto-style14">obligation</span> is often very blurred 
			(if it exists at all).</li>
			<li>It is often asserted that <em>ought to</em> implies a
			<span class="auto-style14">sense of duty</span> rather than pure
			<span class="auto-style14">obligation</span> 
			or <span class="auto-style14">advice</span>.&nbsp; Compare:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You 
			should write to him<br />
			</em>with<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You ought to write to him<br />
			</em>For most learners of English, this is irrelevant.<br />
			(This 
			distinction may stem from the fact that <em>ought</em> is an old 
			past participle form of the verb <em>owe</em> and we <em>owe a duty</em>.)</li>
			<li>The negative of <em>ought to </em>for <span class="auto-style14">obligation</span> has two forms:<em><br />
			</em>1. <span class="auto-style14">No obligation</span>: <em>needn't/don't have to:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You needn't / don't have to go<br />
			</em>2. <span class="auto-style14">Negative obligation</span>: <em>ought not:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You oughtn't (to) go.<br />
			</em>Omitting the 'to' is rare and formal.</li>
			<li>The negative of the use for <span class="auto-style14">deduction</span> is formed with <em>cannot:<br />
			</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She can't have left already</em></li>
			<li>There is some evidence of the existence of <em>ought</em> as a 
			non modal with forms such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You didn't ought to do that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he ought to ask permission?<br />
			</em>etc.<br />
			Such forms are at best non-standard; many would consider 
			them illiterate.</li>
			<li>In American English in particular (but increasingly evident in 
			other standards) the bare infinitive is quite common in the negative:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You oughtn't do that</em></li>
		</ol>
		<h3><a name="hadbetter"></a>had better</h3>
		<p>This structure is not considered a pure modal in all analyses 
		but it is included here because it acts like a modal in most ways.<br />
		Essentially, <em>had better</em> performs the following functions in English:</p><table cellpadding="3" class="auto-style7">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style8" style="width: 126px"><strong>Function</strong></td>
				<td class="auto-style8"><strong>Example</strong></td>
			</tr>

				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 126px">advice</td>
				<td class="auto-style9"><em>You had better wear something warm on the boat trip.</em></td>

				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 126px">future (desperate) wishes</td>
				<td class="auto-style9"><em>It had better rain soon or the garden will die.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 126px">suggestions</td>
				<td class="auto-style9"><em>Hadn't we better ask for permission?</em></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br />
		Notes:<br />		<ol>
			<li>The <em>had</em> is frequently contracted to <em>'d</em>, causing some to confuse it with 
			<em>would</em>.</li>
			<li>The form is only used for <strong>present or future events</strong>.&nbsp; There is no past 
		form and in reported speech the verb is often replaced:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>He said we 
		shouldn't do it<br />
			</em>or remains unchanged<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told us we had better not be 
		late</em></li>
			<li>The negative form for advice is formed as <em>had better not</em>.</li>
			<li>There is a common negative question form for 
			<span class="style_black">tentative suggestions</span>:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hadn't you better get some sleep?</em></li>
			<li>The <span class="style_black">advice</span> function only refers to 
			<strong>specific</strong> situations or actions.&nbsp; Compare:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had better not listen to him<br />
			</em>with<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *You had better not listen 
		to bad advice<br />
			</em>For <strong>general</strong> situations or actions rather than specific 
		ones, the preferred verb is <em>should</em>:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should not listen 
			to bad advice.</em></li>
			<li>The <span class="style_black">warning / threat </span>function is often implicit in the verb:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had 
		better not be late<br />
			</em>may be responded to with<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or else?<br />
			</em>The verb 
			<em>should</em> 
		does not routinely imply this.</li>
			<li>The functions of <span class="style_black">hopes and warnings</span> usually refer to a near future.&nbsp; 
			Hence the form is often accompanied by time adverbials such as <em>
			soon</em>:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had better finish that soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had better arrive 
			in the next day or so or he'll be too late</em></li>
			<li>The form is often used as an ersatz conditional:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had 
			better do that carefully or you'll get paint on the floor<br />
			</em>equals<br />
			<em>If you don't do that carefully, you'll get paint on the floor</em></li>
			<li>Informally, <em>better</em> may be replaced with <em>best</em>:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'd best tell the truth<br />
			</em>Some consider this 
			colloquial or even illiterate.</li>
			<li>Question forms are formed as for other modal auxiliary verbs but are quite formal 
		and rarer:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had I better talk to him?<br />
			</em>In fact, the negative question form 
		is a lot more common:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hadn't I better talk to him?</em></li>
			<li>The form is not used to talk about preferences (that's the function 
		of <em>would rather</em>, see above under <em>would</em>).</li>
			<li>The form cannot be used for obligation.</li>
			<li>In rapid speech the <em>'d</em> is often not audible and the 
			form sounds like, e.g., <em>you better</em>, leading some to leave 
			the word out deliberately in speech and in writing.</li>
