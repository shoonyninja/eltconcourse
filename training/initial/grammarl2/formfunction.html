		<h1>Form, function, meaning</h1>
	
		<img alt="form and function" height="161" src="../../images/formandfunction.jpg" width="310" /><a name="1"></a><p>To understand a little about this area, it's necessary to distinguish 
		between two basic forms of language analysis:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>formal theories of language</li>
			<li>functional theories of language</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Can you make a stab at 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'form1',0,'style.visibility','visible')">the difference</a>?</p>
		<div id="form1" style="visibility: hidden">
			<ol class="auto-style6">
				<li>Formal theories of language are concerned with defining the 
				different elements of the language (verbs, nouns etc.) in a way 
				that explains how they operate with each other.&nbsp; A good deal of 
				the language analysis in this section takes this approach.</li>
				<li>Functional approaches start from the understanding that 
				language is primarily a tool for getting meaning across and that 
				it is best analysed by looking at the functions bits of the 
				language actually perform.</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="1970" height="166" src="../../images/1970.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>The 1970s</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p >Functional approaches to 
			teaching the language came into vogue in the 1970s and have remained 
			at the fore ever since.&nbsp; More recently, there has been 
			something of a resurgence of interest in combining formal approaches 
			(understanding and learning structure) with communicative approaches 
			(learning to get things done in the language).&nbsp; Here's a 
			quotation from a leading theorist in the field:</p>
			<p class="auto-style5" style="width: 50%"><span class="style_black">&nbsp;... language learning is essentially learning how grammar 
			functions in the achievement of meaning and it is a mistake to 
			suppose otherwise.</span><br />
			&nbsp;<span class="style_black">.... A communicative approach does not involve the rejection of 
			grammar. On the contrary, it involves a recognition of its central 
			mediating role in the use of and learning of language.”<br />
			<span class="auto-style18">Widdowson (1990: 97/8)</span></span></p>
		</div>
		<p>The moral is that our learners need both types of information: 
		formal, <strong>linguistic competence</strong> to make structurally 
		correct language and <strong>communicative competence</strong> to <em>
		use </em>the language appropriately.<br />
		Ideally, lessons should combine both approaches so that learners are 
		confident that they are getting the language right and able to see what 
		communicative ends the language serves.</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="form" height="164" src="../../images/forming.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>One form, many functions</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>If you have done some of the other parts of the Language Analysis and 
		Awareness section, you will be familiar with the idea that one form may 
		have a number of functions.<br />
		Here are some examples.</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="table5x2" style="width: 75%">
			<tr class="auto-style6">
				<td class="auto-style8">This language ...</td>
				<td class="auto-style11">... could mean</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13"><em>He is writing a book</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style12">He is writing a book right this minute<br class="auto-style14" />
				He is writing a book at the present time but may not be actually 
				writing now<br class="auto-style14" />
				He has arranged to write a book in the future</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13"><em>He should be there</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style12">He is obliged to be there<br />
				I deduce that he is there<br />
				He is advised to be there</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13"><em>It's cold in here</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style12">Please shut the window<br />
				Please turn on the heating<br />
				This is the reason I'm getting my coat</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13"><em>The bank is over there</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style12">That's where you can get some money<br />
				That's where you can go fishing</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13"><em>convict</em></td>
				<td class="auto-style12">A noun:<strong> con</strong>vict: a 
				person in prison<br />
				A verb: con<strong>vict</strong>: to find someone guilty)</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p class="auto-style4">You can see from these examples that one form can have more than 
		one meaning.&nbsp;
		The form can be:</p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li>grammatical (a tense such as the 
		present progressive)</li>
			<li>structural (the functions of the modal <em>should</em>)</li>
			<li>pragmatic (the <strong>intended</strong> meaning behind saying
			<em>It's cold in here</em>)</li>
			<li>semantic (the meaning of <em>bank</em>)</li>
			<li>phonemic (the pronunciation of <em>convict</em>)</li>
		</ul>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<span class="auto-style4"><a name="2"></a>
			</span><img alt="understanding" height="165" src="../../images/understanding.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>Understanding</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>If this is true, how on earth do people ever understand each other?  Well, how do they?  Think for a minute and then 
			<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'form2',0,'style.visibility','visible')">see the answer</a>.
			</p>
		<div id="form2" style="visibility: hidden">
			<dl class="auto-style6">
	<dt><strong>Contextual information</strong></dt>
	<dd>If we have just spoken about money or fishing, I know what you mean.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Shared knowledge</strong></dt>
			<dd>If you and I know that the professor is currently lecturing, we 
			both know that you can't mean he is writing a book right now.</dd>
</dl></div>
		
			<h3>How many functions are there?</h3>
		<p>Lots.&nbsp; However, it's quite easy to find lists which include 
		items such as <em>giving / getting permission, asking for and giving 
		factual information, apologising and accepting apologies, expressing 
		hopes and wishes</em> and so on.<br />
		Two key publications are from the Council of Europe and are available on 
		the web:<br />
		<a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Waystage_CUP.pdf" target="_blank">
		Waystage 1990 by Van Ek and Trim</a><br />
		<a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Threshold-Level_CUP.pdf" target="_blank">
		Threshold 1990 by Van Ek and Trim</a><br />
		Waystage contains a long list of functions and notions for lower levels 
		and Threshold does the same for more advanced learners.&nbsp; Warning: 
		these are large files.</p>
		<h3>Adjacency pairs</h3>
		<p>Functions often come in pairs, because one function often requires 
		its counterpart(s).&nbsp; For example, asking for someone's name is a 
		useful function to control but less so if you don't know how to respond 
		by introducing yourself.&nbsp; Here are some more:</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="table5x2">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style16" style="width: 50%">apologising</td>
				<td class="auto-style17">accepting or rejecting apologies</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style16" style="width: 50%">asking for 
				permission</td>
				<td class="auto-style17">granting or denying permission</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style16" style="width: 50%">asking directions</td>
				<td class="auto-style17">giving directions</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style16" style="width: 50%">expressing anger</td>
				<td class="auto-style17">placating</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
			<p>and, of course, it makes sense to teach and practise them 
			together.&nbsp; There's not much point in being able to ask for 
			permission 3 different ways if you are unlikely to understand the response.</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="one and many" height="165" src="../../images/uniform.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style3"><h2>One function, many forms</h2></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>The other side of the coin is that we can use a number of forms to 'realise' 
		the same function.&nbsp; If I want to advise you, I can say, <em>You 
		should, You ought to, Do you think it wouldn't be a good idea to ...
		</em>etc.<br />
		Here's another set of examples.</p>
		<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="table5x2" style="width: 75%">
			<tr class="auto-style6">
				<td class="auto-style8" style="width: 277px">This function ...</td>
				<td class="auto-style11" style="width: 278px">... could be achieved by ...</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 277px">I want to tell you what he is doing 
				sometimes but not now</td>
				<td class="auto-style12" style="width: 278px">He is writing a book<br class="auto-style14" />
				He is 
				engaged in writing a book<br class="auto-style14" />
				He 
				works on his book most mornings</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 277px">I want to tell you what I've deduced</td>
				<td class="auto-style12" style="width: 278px">He should be there<br />
				He must have arrived<br />
				I'm sure he's got there by now</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 277px">I want you to close the window</td>
				<td class="auto-style12" style="width: 278px">Please shut the window<br />
				It's cold in here<br />
				Do you think we could have the window shut?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 277px">I want to direct you to the bank</td>
				<td class="auto-style12" style="width: 278px">The bank is over there<br />
				There's the bank<br />
				It's over the road</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style13" style="width: 277px">He's in prison</td>
				<td class="auto-style12" style="width: 278px">He's a <strong>con</strong>vict<br />
				He was con<strong>vict</strong>ed<br />

			<p>If this is true, how on earth do we choose the right 
		form to realise the function?&nbsp; Well, how do we?&nbsp; Think for a minute

		<a href="#3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'form3',0,'style.visibility','visible')">see the answer</a>.</p>

			<dl class="auto-style6">
	<dt><strong>Intention</strong></dt>
	<dd>Do I want to be polite, rude, deferential, explicit, vague? etc.<br />

				<li><strong>Intention:</strong><br />
				We need to be clear about what certain forms say about the 
				purposes of the user.&nbsp; We can only introduce and practise 
				language successfully if the learners are aware of what they 
				want to <strong>do</strong> with the language and how they want 
				to appear.</li>
				<li><strong>Context and setting:</strong><br />
				You can't learn, use or understand language in a vacuum.&nbsp; 
				Formal grammar exercises and drilling have their place, of 
				course, but when introducing or practising language forms we 
				need to set a clear context and the learners also need to know 
				where and when they are using the target language.</li>
				<li><strong>Relationships and roles:</strong><br />
				In the classroom, relationships between the teacher and the 
				learners and between learners are often informal and equal.&nbsp; 
				Outside, in the real world, that's often not the case so we need 
				to set up scenarios in which learners can practise choosing the 
				appropriate language.</li>
				<li><strong>The medium:</strong><br />
				If we are practising either speaking or writing, we need to have 
				the audience and the speaker / writer's role in mind at all times.</li>
