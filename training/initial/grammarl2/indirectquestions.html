			<h1>Indirect questions</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="indirect" height="207" src="../../images/road_indirect310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Indirect questions are sometimes called embedded questions 
			because the question is, well, embedded in another clause.&nbsp; Like 
			this:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style2" style="width: 407px">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 202px">Direct question</td>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 203px">Indirect / 
					Embedded question</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 202px"><em>Where is 
					the hospital?</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 203px"><em>Can you 
					tell me </em><span class="style_black"><em>where</em></span><em> 
					the hospital is?</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 202px"><em>Will you be 
					coming?</em></td>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 203px"><em>Could you 
					tell me </em><span class="style_black"><em>if</em></span><em> 
					you will be coming?</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Note that the questions word for a <em>wh-</em> question is 
			embedded and for a yes-no question, we insert <em>if</em> into the 
			clause.<br />
			There is a guide to <em>wh</em>- 
			questions and another to 
			negations and questions on this site and both are linked from the 
			list at the end of this guide.</p>

					<td class="auto-style4">
					<h2>Forming indirect questions</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>A reminder: to make direct questions in English, we do one of 
			three main 
			things:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 202px">Form</td>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 203px"><em>Example</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 202px">Inverting 
					subject and auxiliary verb (and <em>be</em> and <em>have</em> 
					when acting as main verbs)</td>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 203px"><em>Can you 
					help?<br />
					Are you going?<br />
					Have you just arrived?<br />
					Have you (got) enough money?</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 202px">Using the <em>
					do</em> operator with main or lexical verbs</td>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 203px"><em>Do you need 
					me?<br />
					Does she remember?<br />
					Did she arrive?</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 202px">Using a <em>wh-</em> 
					word with no word-order changes (although there are 
					complications with <em>how</em> and with subjects and 
					objects)</td>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 203px"><em>Where is 
					the hospital?<br />
					How can he get here?<br />
					What's his name?</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>All of that should be familiar to you.&nbsp; If it isn't, try the 
			guide to 
			negations and questions.</p>
			<p>Indirect questions are formed like this:</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 202px">Form</td>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 203px"><em>Example</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 202px">Embedding the
					<em>if</em> / <em>whether </em>clause in a question</td>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 203px"><em>Can you let 
					me know if you can help?<br />
					Do you know if you are going?<br />
					Can you tell me whether she is coming?</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 202px">Embedding the
					<em>if</em> / <em>whether </em>clause in a request or 
					imperative</td>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 203px"><em>Let me know 
					if you need me<br />
					Tell me if you remember<br />
					Please inform me if she is late</em></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 202px">Embedding a <em>
					wh-</em> word</td>
					<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 203px"><em>Can you 
					tell me where the hospital is?<br />
					Do you know how he can get here?<br />
					May I know what his name is?</em></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<br />
			In this table, the request / imperative forms are included, not 
			because they are questions as such but because they perform the same 
			communicative function and share the same forms as indirect questions.<br />
			Other examples are statements such as:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't understand why he did that = Can you tell me why he did 
			that?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I don't know what your name is = Could you tell me what your name 
			is?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I haven't been told what time he arrives = Can anyone tell me what 
			time he arrives?</em><br />

					<td class="auto-style4">
					<h2>A range of forms</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>As you can see, an indirect question can be introduced in many 
			ways.&nbsp; The most frequently taught is the <em>Can you 
			... / Could you ...</em> form and it is very commonly used.&nbsp; 
			But it is not the only way and we impoverish our learners if we 
			suggest that it is.</p>Other exponents include:<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style5">

				<li>Both direct and indirect questions are reported in the same

				<li>The forms of reported and indirect questions are parallel.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For example:</p>

					<td class="auto-style6">Reported

			</table>
			<p>The most obvious reason we use indirect question forms in English 
			is for politeness' sake.<br />
			For example, can you arrange these in order of politeness from 
			direct to indirect?<br />

			<div id="polite" style="visibility: hidden" class="style_brown">
			<p>The first difficulty is that all these are written.&nbsp; The 
			intonation that speakers use will have a profound effect on how 
			polite or deferential they sound.<br />
			Generally speaking, a rising tone along the length of the utterance 
			will signal greater tentativeness and be more polite.<br />
			There are some things to note:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The general rule is that the longer and more grammatically 
			complicated a question is, the more polite it sounds.&nbsp; Compare 
					4 and 10.</li>
					<li>The use of a past tense to distance the speaker adds 
					politeness.&nbsp; Compare 6 and 11.</li>
					<li>The use of an imperative can sound rude unless tempered with
					<em>please</em>.&nbsp; Compare 1 and 5.</li>
					<li>Statements are often more polite than indirect questions 
					proper.&nbsp; Compare 3 and 6.</li>
					<li>Adding an explanation makes the speaker sound 
					exceptionally deferential.&nbsp; See 10 (which could be 
					followed by a very direct <em>Do you?</em> because the 
					politeness groundwork has been done).</li>
					<li>The insertion of adverbials such as <em>by any chance, 
					perhaps, possibly</em> etc. adds to the tentativeness of the 
					request for information (and is easy to teach, incidentally).</li>

			<h3> other languages<br />
			<img alt="language" src="../../images/languages_dog200.jpg" /></h3>
			<p> Many languages, such as Spanish, German and other Germanic 
			languages, do as English does and embed the question in a clause so 
			that there is no doubling of the question word order.&nbsp; In 
			English, and a range of other languages, we cannot have:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Do you know what time does the train leave?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I was wondering can you help?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I want to know can she be here<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*Can you tell me if is she coming?<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*Could you explain what is he doing?</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			However, even more languages <strong>do</strong> allow this kind of word order and 
			mistakes are frequently made.&nbsp; In French, for example, the 
			direct question form is similar to English so:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the metro station? = Où est la station de métro ?</em><br />
			but the indirect question retains the question form:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know where the metro station is? = Est-ce que vous savez 
			/ Savez-vous où 
			est la station de métro ?<br />
			</em>more or less literally:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you 
			know where is the metro 
			station?</em>]</p>
			<p> So, if your learners are producing:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I asked him where is the school<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*I want to know what is the time<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			*Could you tell me how is it done?</em><br />
			etc. the reason is to do, almost certainly, with the learners' first-language structures.<br />
			The <strong>teaching implication</strong> here is that we need to be 
			alert to this mismatch and make sure our learners notice the 
			difference between their languages and English.<br />
			Word-for-word translation exercises can help the noticing along.<br />
			</p>
			<h3> form<br />
			<img alt="potter" height="133" src="../../images/form_pottery200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p> Form needs very careful handling especially given the 
			considerations about other languages above.<br />
			Although there are, as we have seen, many different ways to 
			introduce an indirect question (<em>can you tell me, could you tell 
			me, would you let me know if</em> etc.) it is safer to start with 
			one or two only.<br />
			It is also safer to start with <em>wh-</em> forms before introducing 
			the<em> if / whether</em> forms for yes-no questions.<br />
			The <strong>teaching implication</strong> is to take it one step at 
			a time until the learners are comfortable manipulating the forms 
			before being asked to apply them.<br />
			There are some choices concerning how to go about explaining the 
			forms.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The area combines quite naturally with reported questions.&nbsp; 
				It is a small step from, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked me when the film starts<br />
				</em>to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me when the film starts?<br />
				</em>The reverse also works because once learners can handle the 
				indirect question forms, the reported question forms come 
				naturally.&nbsp; The difference lies in the change of tense 
				sometimes required if the reporting of a question takes place at 
				another time, e.g., with<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where does this bus go?<br />
				</em>reported as<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked where the bus went.</em></li>
				<li>Another approach is to take a different analysis altogether 
				and consider the clause as the object of the verb, i.e., a 
				clause acting as if it were a noun.<br />
				The 
				analogy here is that if the learners have mastered, e.g.,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked a question<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He knows the departure gate<br />
				</em>etc., in which the form is simply Subject + Verb + Object, 
				then substituting a clause for the object is intuitively 
				understandable for many.&nbsp; We can get, therefore, from, 
				e.g.,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knows the date and time of the meeting<br />
				</em>to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me when the meeting is</em> /<em> was<br />
				</em>to<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me when the meeting is?<br />
				</em>Clauses act as objects and subjects of verbs quite 
				regularly in English so the concept is transferable to other 
				areas and to structures such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where she is going to work is something we must decide</em> 
				[in which the clause is the subject of the verb]<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to decide where she is going to work </em>[in which 
				the clause is the object of the verb]</li>
			</ol>
			<p>(If approach 2 is an appealing one for you, you 
			may like to follow the (quite technical)
			guide to 
			nominal clauses in the in-service training section of this 
			site, linked in the list at the end.)</p>
			<h3> tone and intonation<br />
			<img alt="tone" height="133" src="../../images/music_pitch200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p> Before you can begin to practise the forms in freer activities, 
			it is very important to focus on polite intonation.&nbsp; There is 
			little point being able to use polite structures and language if you
			<strong>sound</strong> rude.<br />
			The <strong>teaching implication </strong>is to get the intonation 
			right from the outset and not to deal only with grammatical form and 
			then try to graft the intonation on later.</p>
			<h3> setting<br />
			<img alt="station" height="133" src="../../images/station200.jpg" width="200" /></h3>
			<p> The selection of an indirect question or statement rather than 
			direct question is usually a matter of style and appropriacy.&nbsp; 
			The forms realise the same communicative functions in different 
			settings.<br />
			The <strong>teaching implication</strong> is that when presenting or 
			practising the area, to make the setting, intentions and 
			relationships very clear.<br />
			Specifically, stranger-to-stranger encounters or those where there 
			is an unequal power relationship are appropriate settings.<br />
			Here are some ideas:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Using a graphic like this to set the scene for a role play 
				of an information desk:<br />
				<img alt="information" height="174" src="../../images/sign_airport310.jpg" width="310" /><br />
				The sequence could start with something like:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me where the escalators are?<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, to your left, madam.</span><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Could you tell me where the taxis leave from?<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir, over there, to your right.</span><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Do you know where the baggage drop is?<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through there, straight ahead, I 
				think.</span><br />
				</em>etc.<br />
				Almost any set of direction signs will be enough to set the 
				context and relationships.</li>
				<li>A similar setting is an encounter between a customer wanting 
				to rent a car and the car rental assistant filling in the form.&nbsp; 
				Get the learners to invent the questions after the first one or 
				two.<br />
				<img alt="form filling" height="207" src="../../images/form_filling310.jpg" width="310" /><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me how long you need the car?</em><br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About six days.&nbsp; I'm 
				wondering if it's cheaper by the week.</em></span><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little.&nbsp; Do you think you'll be doing a lot of 
				mileage?<br />
				<span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; Can you advise me 
				which deal is cheaper?</span></em><br />
				etc.</li>
				<li>Tourist information encounters work well, too, because half 
				the class can pretend to be strangers and the other half will 
				know the answers for their own town / city.<br />
				<img alt="tourist information" height="207" src="../../images/sign_tourist_information310.jpg" width="310" /><br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know where the bus station is?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Can you tell me how to get to ... ?</em><br />
				etc.<br />
				Once the scene is set and the relationships are clear, let your 
				learners do the work of constructing and practising their own 
				dialogues.</li>
				<li>An alternative is the same kind of procedure with a hotel 
				reception.&nbsp; In this case, both sides can ask and answer 
				questions naturally.<br />
				<img alt="reception" height="207" src="../../images/hotel_reception310.jpg" width="310" /><br />
				<em><span class="style_black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know where I can rent a 
				car?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I wonder if it's possible to leave my luggage with you.</span><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Can you say how long you'll be 
				staying?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Can you tell me what your car's licence plate is, please?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				We need to know which payment method you'll be using.</em><br />
				etc.</li>
