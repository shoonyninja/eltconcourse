			<p>You will hear a good deal about these words if you are taking an

			good deal which is wrong.</p>
			<p>You may, at the outset, have noted that the word <em>how </em>is 
			included in the list above but that it doesn't start with <em>wh</em>-.&nbsp; 
			That's true.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it appears in this guide and is 
			traditionally included in the group because it exhibits similar 
			characteristics.</p>

			<p>Not only do these words make questions, 
			the reason they do so is to do with their meaning.&nbsp; They all 
			have the general meaning of<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know what this refers to so 
			tell me.<br />
			</em>We'll consider the 9 main <em>wh</em>- words: <em class="style_brown">how, 
			what, when, where, why, who, whom, which, whose</em>.&nbsp; We will 
			consider them in isolation and talk about what else they do 
			later.</p>
			<p>We can elicit all sorts of information using these nine words.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>How did you know?</em> (manner)</li>
				<li><em>What was she wearing? </em>(thing)</li>
				<li><em>Where did they go?</em> (place)</li>
				<li><em>When did they go?</em> (time)</li>
				<li><em>Why was she crying?</em> (reason)</li>
				<li><em>Who told you?</em> (subject person)</li>
				<li><em>Who(m) did you tell? </em>(object person )</li>

				<li><em>Whose is that hat?</em> (possessive for person)</li>

			<ol id="list1" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li><em>How</em> questions are normally answered by using a 
				whole sentence and here an example might be<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue">How did you know?</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Mary told me<br />
				</em>It is unlikely that an answer would be<em><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Immediately<br />
				</em>but that is possible.&nbsp; Adverbs are sometimes what the 
				question is getting at as in e.g.,<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue">How was he driving?</span><br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Very carefully<br />
				</em>but that is a fairly rare event.</li>
				<li><em>What</em> questions are almost always directed at 
				non-human nouns or noun phrases so an answer to the question 
				might be something like<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue">What was she wearing?</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeans and a T-shirt<br />
				What</em> questions rarely refer to humans and we prefer<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue">Which person did you ask?</span><br />
				</em>over<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue">What person did you ask?</span></em></li>
				<li><em>Where</em> questions are used to elicit spatial 
				information.&nbsp; The answer will normally be a place or a 
				prepositional phrase, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue">Where did they go?</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To London<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				London<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Into the house</em></li>
				<li><em>When</em> questions usually elicit a time, a 
				prepositional phrase or a clause so possible answers are<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue">When did they go?</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 6<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				After lunch<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				When everyone had finished</em></li>
				<li><em>Why</em> questions are also normally answered with whole 
				sentences (sometimes much more) or clauses beginning with a word 
				like <em>because </em>such as:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue">Why was she crying?</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it was so sad<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Because he'd been so rude<br />
				</em>We can omit the word <em>because</em> although it is always 
				implied as in, e.g.:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car had broken down again<br />
				</em>These questions also frequently elicit a clause beginning 
				with <em>to, in order to</em> and <em>so that:<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				To make him feel guilty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to make him feel guilty<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				So that we'd take pity on her</em></li>
				<li><em>Who</em> questions traditionally refer to people as the 
				subject of the verb but also, frequently, to the object.&nbsp; 
				They always refer to people, never inanimate objects and rarely 
				non-humans.&nbsp; Answers might be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue">Who told you?</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The man in the shop<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Those people</em></li>
				<li><em>Whom</em> questions can only be reference to human 
				objects of the verb.&nbsp; Possible answers might be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue">Whom did you tell?</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The man in the shop<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Those people</em><br />
				In colloquial English <em>whom</em> is frequently 
				replaced by <em>who</em> so the question could easily have been<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who did you tell?<br />
				</em>but it still refers to the object, not the subject of the 
				verb.</li>
				<li><em>Which </em>questions imply a choice from a limited 
				number of options that the questioner is aware of.&nbsp; They 
				can apply to people and to non-animate items.<br />
				<em><span class="style_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which do you want?</span><br />
				</em>almost certainly refers to things, not people and implies a 
				limited choice of items to choose from.<br />
				possible answers might be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blue one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A plain one</em><br />
				If <em>which</em> questions are 
				used to refer to people, they must be accompanied by a noun such 
				as <em>girl, boy, man, person, customer</em> etc., all of which 
				refer to classes of people.&nbsp; The question cannot usually 
				be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue">Which did you tell?</span><br />
				</em>but could be<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue">Which police officer did you tell?</span><br />
				</em>Possible answers might be:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tall one<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Him<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				That one</em></li>
				<li><em>Whose</em> questions refer to people and very rarely to 
				animals, never to inanimate objects.&nbsp; Possible answers will 
				include the possessive <em>'s</em> marker or involve the use of 
				the possessive pronoun:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style_blue">Whose is that hat?</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John's<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Your mother's<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

			<p>There are some things that <em>wh</em>-questions cannot elicit.&nbsp; 
			For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We cannot ask about what are called dummy subjects.&nbsp; We

				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It got very windy yesterday</em><br />
				but the question<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What got very windy yesterday?<br />
				</em>is meaningless because the answer would be <em>it</em>.<br />
				Occasionally, in spoken English this is possible so we allow, 
				perhaps:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It got broken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What go broken?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The table.</em></li>
				<li>We cannot ask about the adjective complements of linking 
				verbs such as <em>appear, grow, become, seem</em> etc.&nbsp; We 
				can say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John appeared tired<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				She was exhausted<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They grew angry<br />
				</em>but the questions<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did John appear?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				What was she?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				What did they grow?<br />
				</em>are not possible without altering the meaning.</li>
				<li>We cannot ask about the verb.&nbsp; We can say<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told her mother a lie<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				They chose him</em><br />
				but the questions<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *What did she her mother?<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

			<p id="list2" style="visibility: hidden"> Question intonation on questions

			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What time is the meeting?<br />
			</em>generally falls, but on a question such as<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Are you coming to the meeting?<br />
			</em>it tends to rise.&nbsp; The effect can be represented like 
			this:<br />
			<img alt="question intonation" height="115" src="../../imagesgraphics/meetingintonation.png" width="250" /></p>
			<p> This is not an absolute rule &ndash; very little of intonation 
			contains such things &ndash; but it is a clear tendency.&nbsp; Many 
			languages rely solely on intonation to make questions from 
			statements and English has that ability, too, in questions such as<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are going to London?<br />
			</em>in which the intonation rises sharply along with voice pitch to 
			express disbelief or surprise.&nbsp; This is often rendered in 
			writing by double question marks and/or exclamation marks.<br />
			This is an area that needs to be taught because many learners will 
			assume that intonation always rises on questions and are in danger 
			of sounding rude and demanding if they do this with <em>wh</em>-questions.</p>

			<p>As we saw in the first set of examples, most <em>wh-</em>words 
			have a straightforward meaning.&nbsp; The word <em>how</em> is 
			somewhat different.&nbsp; What does it mean in these examples?</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>How long have you been waiting?</em></li>
				<li><em>How often does she do that?</em></li>
				<li><em>How much does he want the job?</em></li>
				<li><em>How long is the journey?</em></li>
				<li><em>How are you?</em></li>
				<li><em>How was the trip?</em></li>
				<li><em>How interesting did you find it?</em></li>

			<ol id="list4" class="style_brown" style="visibility: hidden">
				<li><em>How long have you been waiting?<br />

			<p>The issue here is the word is followed by a range of other 
			items (quantifiers, adverbs, adjectives etc.) and its meaning alters 
			considerably.&nbsp; Other languages do not have such a common 
			multiword so the area needs handling carefully.&nbsp; Learners can 
			easily become confused.</p>
			<p>The word <em>what</em> also exhibits multiple meanings but to a 
			lesser extent.&nbsp; We can have, for example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did you tell her? </em>(referring to something said)<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			What can I help you with? </em>(referring to to an action)<em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			What flight are you on? </em>(referring to a noun phrase)</p>

					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Formality and prepositions</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Formality in English requires the <em>wh</em>-word to be 
			accompanied by its preposition so we get, e.g.:</p><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style3" style="width: 483px">
					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style7" style="width: 160px">Formal question</td>
						<td class="auto-style13" rowspan="4" style="width: 18px">vs.</td>
						<td class="auto-style9" style="width: 161px">Informal question</td>

					<tr>
						<td class="auto-style10" style="width: 160px"><em>With 
						whom did you come?</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style12" style="width: 161px"><em>Who

						<em>With which officer did you speak?</em></td>
						<td class="auto-style12" style="width: 161px"><em>Which

					</tr>
					</table>
				
			<p>That's the general rule but the longer the clause 
			between the <em>wh</em>-word and the preposition, the more difficult 
			it gets to construct an informal sentence.&nbsp; Would you accept, 
			e.g.,<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did you use to get the awful mess out of the pipe and clear 
			away all the dirty water from the sink with?</em><br />
			or<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What time are you going to ask them all and their friends from 
			Holland to meet us under the pier at?</em></p>

					<h2>Emphasising <em>wh-</em>questions</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The most frequent way to emphasise <em>wh-</em>questions is the 
			use of the word <em>ever</em>.&nbsp; <em>For example</em></p>
			<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>Who ever did that?</em></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>How ever did you manage it?</em></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>Which ever did you choose?</em></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>How ever long have you been 
				waiting?</em></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>Why ever were you late?</em></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>Whose ever car was that?</em></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>When ever are you going to 
				finish?</em></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>What ever did she mean?</em></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>Where ever can she be?</em></li>
				<li class="greybulletlist"><em>Whom ever did you tell?</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some things to note:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>There are other popular emphasisers such as <em>the hell, in 
				heaven's name, on earth</em> etc.</li>
				<li>These are normally written as two words to distinguish their 
				function.&nbsp; When they are written as one word, they often 
				mean <em>It doesn't matter who/what/when/how/which</em> etc.&nbsp; 
				For example<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever comes late must sit over there<br />
				</em>is not emphatic; 
				it means <em>anyone who comes late.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He leaves whenever he feels a little tired<br />
				</em>is also not 
				emphatic; it functions as a subordinating conjunction just as
				<em>when</em> does.&nbsp; The same applies to<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can sit 
				wherever you like<br />
				</em>and to many other <em>-ever</em> words.</li>
				<li>The emphatic <em>why ever</em> only occurs as two words in 
				English.</li>
