	<h1>Function words</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="function words" height="280" src="../../imagesgraphics/functionwordcloud.PNG" width="650" /></p>
		<p>10 classes of words are usually recognised in English.&nbsp; These 
		are sometimes called 'parts of speech'.<br />
		Of these, some are 'open-class items' and some are called 'closed system 
		items'.&nbsp; If you don't know the difference, go to
		<a href="../lexis/wordclass.html" target="_blank">the guide to word class</a> and look through 
		that.&nbsp; Then shut that to come back to this page.</p>
		<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="two" height="165" src="../../images/tworacoons250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style2">
					<h2>Two sorts of words</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>Take a look at this sentence:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style11">
			<li>The glumpy finkleblender in the dwoodledam bongled bederously 
			and flummbered all my quitchicants.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In this sentence some of the words have been replaced by 
		nonsense.<br />
		What's important here is that we can make a stab at the meaning of the 
		sentence like this:</p>
		<table class="auto-style10" style="width: 70%">
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style16">The glumpy finkleblender</td>
				<td class="auto-style17">We can guess that
				<span class="auto-style11">glumpy</span> is an adjective 
				describing the noun <span class="auto-style11">finkleblender</span> 
				because of the analogy with other adjectives (such as <em>wonky, shaky, 
				slippery, happy</em> etc.).<br />
				We can also guess that the
				<span class="auto-style11">finkleblender</span> is something or 
				someone that performs an action by analogy with
				<span class="auto-style11">blender, gardener, writer, mixer
				</span>and so on (it may even blend finkles).&nbsp; Because the phrase is introduced by the 
				definite article (<em>the</em>) we can compare it to something 
				like <em>The swanky juicemaker</em> or <em>The wonky lawnmower</em>.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style18">in the dwoodledam</td>
				<td class="auto-style19">This is obviously a place and a noun 
				because a) something can be in it and b) it is preceded by the 
				definite article.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style18">bongled bederously</td>
				<td class="auto-style19">We can guess the verb is
				<span class="auto-style11">bongle</span> and it has a regular 
				past tense.&nbsp; We can also surmise that
				<span class="auto-style11">bederously</span> is an adverb from 
				the adjective <span class="auto-style11">bederous</span> because 
				it follows the verb and ends in <em>-ly</em>.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="auto-style14">and flummbered all my quitchicants</td>
				<td class="auto-style15">Again, <span class="auto-style11">
				flummber</span> is probably a regular verb which takes an object and
				<span class="auto-style11">quitchicants</span> is a plural noun 
				following <em>all my</em>.&nbsp; We also know that the
				<span class="auto-style11">quitchicants</span> have been
				<span class="auto-style11">flummbered</span> by a
				<span class="auto-style11">finkleblender</span>, by the way.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p><a name="1"></a>Easy.&nbsp; Now try it with the second sentence:</p>
		<ol class="auto-style11">
			<li value="2">Fleeb machine infuriated gruttle bibgle hoblem extent gringle 
			jid threw jadd fotig immediately.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Hmm.&nbsp; Not so easy.&nbsp; We can understand that the sentence is 
		probably about a machine and anger but that's about all because we can't see the 
		relationships that the words have with each other.</p>
		<p>What made sentence 2 more difficult to understand than sentence 1?&nbsp; 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'contentfunction',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have some sort of answer</a>.</p>
		<div id="contentfunction" style="visibility:hidden">
		
		<p><span class="auto-style29">In Sentence 1 the words that have been replaced with nonsense 
		are <strong>content words</strong>.<br />
		In Sentence 2 all the <strong>function words</strong> have been 
		replaced.</span></p>
		<p><span class="auto-style29">The moral in the story is that meaning is made up not only of the 
		meanings of the words but of the grammatical function and relationships 
		between the words.&nbsp; We need both to make any kind of sense.</span></p>

		<p>Function words are words which are only meaningful when they are in 
		company with other words.<br />
		For example.&nbsp; If you say <em>house </em>to people who speak 
		English, they will know what you mean but if you say <em>at</em>, they 
		are unlikely to have a clue what you mean.<br />
		(By the way, this site uses the term 'Function words' but you may see 
		the same concept called grammatical words&nbsp;or&nbsp;structure words or even synsemantic words.)</p>
		<p>Function words are all closed system items.&nbsp; They are closed in the sense 
		that we do not often add new function words to a language in the way 
		that we can add new content words for new items and ideas.</p>
		<p><a name="functioncont1"></a>Which of the following word classes are function words and which are 
		content words?</p>

		<p>There are some things to note:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Some verbs are considered function words.<br />
				These include modal verbs such as <em>can, might, should</em> 
				etc. which only carry meaning combined with a content-word verb 
				such as <em>decide</em>.&nbsp; Standing alone,<em> could </em>
				has no obvious meaning but combined with<em> imagine</em>, for 
				example, it does.</li>
				<li>Some other verbs are similar.&nbsp; These include <em>be, do</em> and <em>have</em>.&nbsp; 
				These are only function words when they act to form 
				part of a tense or other structure.&nbsp; For example,<br />
				<em>I have a house in Miami</em> &ndash; the verb <em>have</em> 
				is not operating as a function word here because it has meaning – i.e., <em>own</em>.<br />
				<em>I have been gardening</em> &ndash; here, both <em>have</em> 
				and <em>been</em> are function words because they are making a 
				tense structure, not carrying meaning apart from a grammatical 
				one.<br />
				<em>Do you want a drink? &ndash; </em>here <em>do</em> is a 
				function word which English uses to make a question form in some 
				tenses.<br />
				<em>I'll do the work </em>&ndash; here <em>do</em> is not a 
				function word because it carries lexical meaning &ndash; i.e.,
				<em>perform</em>.</li>
				<li>There are some other words (sometimes called particles) 
				which show the attitude of the speaker rather than carrying 
				meaning <em>per se</em>.&nbsp; Words such as <em>Well, ..., if, 
				but</em> etc. do not always act as conjunctions joining clauses 
				but can simply signal attitude.</li>
				<li>Interjections such as <em>ouch!</em> certainly do carry 
				meaning but they are considered function words because you can't 
				actually define the meaning and it may shift depending on 
				circumstances.&nbsp; That word could mean, for example, <em>
				She's singing off key</em> or <em>I have hurt myself</em>.</li>
				<li>Words like <em>no, right, yes, maybe</em> are also 
				considered function words for similar reasons.&nbsp; These are 
				sometimes called pro-sentences because they can act as whole 
				utterances in themselves.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>The General Service Word list</h4>
			<p><span class="auto-style11"><em>The&nbsp;General Service List&nbsp;(GSL) is a list of roughly 2000 words 
			published by&nbsp;Michael West&nbsp;in 1953. &nbsp;The words were selected to 
			represent the most frequent words of English and were taken from 
			a&nbsp;corpus&nbsp;of written English.</em><br />
			<span class="auto-style30">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Service_List)</span><br /></span>
			Note the date: 1953.&nbsp; Of course, the list has been updated 
			since then (go to the Wikipedia article for links to updated lists) 
			but the list of function words remains serviceable simply because 
			these are closed system items.&nbsp; The original General Service 
			List did not contain some nouns and verbs (such as <em>computer </em>
			and<em> click</em>)<em> </em> which are now frequent 
			over 60 years later because times change.&nbsp; Function words 
			don't.</p>

				<li><em>either </em>can function as a conjunction

			<p>This section does not consider teaching approaches to function 
			words.&nbsp; There are none.&nbsp; The range of types and functions 
			means that lessons, or a series of lessons, can only sensibly be 
			focused on small subgroups of function words such as:</p>
			<ul class="auto-style28">
				<li>conjunctions which add information (additives) or those 
				which contrast</li>
				<li>indefinite pronouns (<em>any, some, every</em> etc.)</li>
				<li>the definite article</li>
				<li>prepositions related to proximity (<em>near, at, against, 
				beside</em> etc.)</li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li>Don't be tempted to think that because function words are so 
				familiar to you that they will be easy for learners to 
				understand and use.&nbsp; All languages have ways of making 
				relationships between content words clear and to do that they 
				deploy all kinds of different functions but not necessarily 
				function <span class="style_underline">words</span> as such.&nbsp; 
				Some languages will do it by adding suffixes to the ends of 
				words, some by using different sorts of markers in sentences and 
				so on.<br />
				Even in languages which are similar to English (i.e., most 
				European ones) the variations are enormous and complicated.<br />
				This means that you will need explicitly to focus on what 
				function words are doing in sentences and how they work.</li>
				<li>Translation is fraught with problems.&nbsp; It is relatively 
				simple to translate many content words from one language to 
				another (although where word meanings stop and start is an 
				issue as are collocation, countability and connotation etc.).&nbsp; 
				So, for example, <em>book</em> is variously, <em>Buch, boek, 
				كتاب, libro, </em><em>leabhar, βιβλίο, könyv, livre</em> etc.<br />
				This does not work with any but the simplest function words.&nbsp; 
				Even something as simple as the idea of <em>either ... or </em>
				provides problems with many languages rendering it as something 
				like<em> or ... or</em> (<em>ose ose, vagy vagy, jew jew, ou ou</em> 
				etc.).&nbsp; Other languages have a single word to stand for the 
				concept and some use three words.&nbsp; Don't assume for a 
				second that any of the words for <em>either</em> in other 
				languages can change into determiners as the word can in 
				English.</li>
				<li>Don't rely on explanation.&nbsp; Because of the variations 
				in how people's first languages function grammatically (and 
				function words are grammatical) learners need to see the words 
				in action, understand the concepts they represent and deploy 
				them to make their own meanings.&nbsp; That means teaching.</li>
				<li>Keep the focus.&nbsp; The lists above contain four different 
				sorts of function words.&nbsp; It makes sense to focus on a few 
				of one sort only at a time.</li>
				<li>Even within the groups, there are conceptual subgroups.&nbsp; 
				For example, within the determiners lie the articles and the 
				English article system is itself complex and difficult to 
				understand.&nbsp; The same goes for the other groups.&nbsp; 
				Prepositions, in particular, are virtually non-translatable 
				across languages and a source of persistent error and confusion.</li>
				<li>Take opportunities to focus on function words which come up 
				when you are doing something else.&nbsp; They are so important 
				that you should miss no chance to help your learners 
				understand them and use them successfully.</li>
