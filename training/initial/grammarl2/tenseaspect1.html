	<h1>Tense and aspect: the essentials</h1>
		<p>
		<img alt="aspect" height="205" src="../../images/eye_multicoloured310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
		<p>What follows refers only to English.&nbsp; Languages deal with these 
		two issues <strong>very differently indeed</strong>.</p>
		<hr />
		<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
					<img alt="difference" height="166" src="../../images/difference_shoes250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
				<td class="auto-style9"><h2>What's the difference between Tense and Aspect?</h2></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p><strong>Tense</strong> refers to the time of an event and is often 
		marked by a change in the verb ending.&nbsp; So we have, e.g.:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>Rita believes in ghosts </em>(present)</li>
			<li><em>Rita believed in ghosts </em>(past)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In these examples, the tense is marked by a suffix, -s for the 
		present tense (which also shows that it is third-person singular) and -d 
		for the past form.<br />
		However, unlike many languages, English often has no inflexion on the 
		base form of the verb in many cases.&nbsp; For example, in:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They believe in ghosts<br />
		</em>the verb is in its base form with no marker to show tense or person but it is 
		still a present tense.<br />
		Arguably, too, English has no future tense because we don't have a form of 
		the verb to signify future time.&nbsp; We denote the future in many 
		ways, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She is going to talk to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will talk to me<br />
		</em>etc.</p>
		<p><strong><a name="1"></a>Aspect</strong> refers to how an event or state is <strong>
		perceived</strong> with reference to time.&nbsp; So we have, e.g.:</p>
		<ol start="3">
			<li><em>Rita has broken the rule</em></li>
			<li><em>Rita is breaking the rule</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Sentence 3</strong> tells us not only that the rule was broken in the past but 
		also that it changes the present.&nbsp; The fact that she 
		has broken the rule has consequences now.&nbsp; It is a present tense in 
		this respect making the present situation clear in relation to the past.&nbsp; 
		It will come as no surprise that this tense form is referred to as the 
		present perfect.<br />
		<strong>Sentence 4</strong> gives a different aspect.&nbsp; The <em>-ing</em> ending on the verb 
		is called a present participle ending and in English that tells us that 
		the event is happening now or happens repeatedly.&nbsp; Unfortunately, English present tenses 
		are a bit complicated.&nbsp; Think what these actually mean and then 
		click 
		<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'wordclass',0,'style.visibility','visible')">here for the answers</a>.</p>
		<ol start="5">
			<li><em>Rita walks to school</em></li>
			<li><em>Rita is walking to school tomorrow</em></li>
			<li><em>Rita is walking to school now</em></li>
		</ol>
		<div id="wordclass" style="visibility: hidden">
			<p><span class="auto-style8"><strong>Sentence 5</strong> implies that this is her habit, not necessarily 
		what she is doing right now.<br />
		<strong>Sentence 6</strong> is actually the present progressive used for a future event 
		that has been arranged in some way.&nbsp; It refers to the present and 
			relates the current arrangement to the future.<br />
		<strong>Sentence 7</strong> is the only one which is truly a present form.&nbsp; 
			It can, however, imply that this action is repeated (because, e.g., 
			she has lost her bicycle or has moved to a home nearer her school 
			and needs no transport).</span></p>
		
		</div>
		
		<p>Aspect and tense are very closely related.&nbsp; We can use other 
		tenses with progressive (<em>be + -ing</em>) aspects and with perfect 
		aspects (<em>have</em> + the past participle of the verb).&nbsp; Here 
		are two examples:</p>
		<ol start="8">
			<li><em>Rita had walked to school<br />
			</em>Perfect aspect, past tense – we call this the past perfect 
			tense.&nbsp; It relates a past event to another past event.</li>
			<li><em>Rita was walking to school<br />
			</em>Progressive aspect, past tense – we 
			call this the past progressive tense.&nbsp; It is often used in 
			conjunction with a simple form in, e.g.:<br />
			<em>Rita was walking to school when she met her friends</em><br />
			and this is, again, a relational tense providing the background (<em>walking</em>) 
			to the event (<em>met</em>).</li>
		</ol>
		
		
		<p>Before we go on, here's a summary of the all the present and past tenses and aspects 
		with their names, along with the future forms English also uses.</p>

		<p>An important concept to understand when talking about tense and 
		aspect is the distinction between an absolute tense and a relative 
		tense.</p>
		<ul class="redbulletlist">
			<li><strong>Absolute tenses</strong> set an event or a state in time 
			with no need for any reference to any other event or state.&nbsp; 
			For example:<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>She ate lunch at 1 o'clock</em><br />
				which sets the action in the past and tells exactly when it 
				happened</li>
				<li><em>He lives in London</em><br />
				which sets the state in the present with no need for any further 
				information</li>
				<li><em>The London train always leaves at 6</em><br />
				which sets the action as a definite, timetabled event.&nbsp; We 
				know it refers to the present, the past and the future.</li>
				<li><em>I will be forty years old on Monday</em><br />
				which sets the state (being 40) in a specific time frame 
				(Monday)</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Relative tenses</strong> relate two actions together and 
			cannot be fully understood without some kind of context or 
			additional information.&nbsp; For example:<ul class="greybulletlist">
				<li><em>He has lived in India for 20 years</em><br />
				which may be considered as a reference to the past but is only 
				fully understandable if it comes with some additional 
				information, for example<br />
				<em>... so he can tell you (now) something reliable about India</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but he is moving to Germany soon</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he will continue to do so</em></li>
				<li><em>She had already eaten</em><br />
				which clearly refers to the past but is not understandable 
				without some more information, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so didn't want anything</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but was happy to have a little lunch with 
				us</em></li>
				<li><em>They will have been at university for 2 years</em><br />
				which tells us about the future but is incomplete.&nbsp; We need 
				to add information, for example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and have learned a good deal about 
				geology</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and will graduate next year</em></li>
				<li><em>She was sitting on the bus</em><br />
				which tells us that an event was ongoing in the past but needs 
				to be completed with something like<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when she realised she had missed her stop</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when she started to feel ill</em></li>
				<li><em>She had been running</em><br />
				which combines two aspects (the perfect and the progressive) and 
				is incomplete unless we know what the tense relates to with, for 
				example:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because she was late for work</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and was exhausted</em></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This is important because many languages do not make a clear 
		distinction between the two types of tense and the concepts are not easy 
		to grasp.</p>
