		<p>
		Relative clauses are a way to define or add information to a noun in a 
		sentence.<br />
		So, for example, in<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog which howled all night and kept me awake<br />
		</em>The noun, <em>dog</em>, is rendered <strong>unique</strong> among millions of dogs 
		because only this one howled and caused me a sleepless night.&nbsp; The 
		pronoun <em>which</em> refers back to the noun <em>dog</em> and <em>dog</em> 
		is the subject of the verb <em>howl</em> (<em>the dog howled</em>).&nbsp; 
		We can make the same idea in English with two sentences like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>The dog howled all night</em></li>
			<li><em>The dog kept me awake</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>but it is easier and clearer to use a relative pronoun to link the 
		ideas.</p>
		<p>Here is another example of a slightly different sort of relative clause:<br />
		<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The White House, that stands on Pennsylvania 
		Avenue, is a huge building<br />
		</em>Here, too, we can make two sentences:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>The White House stands on Pennsylvania Avenue</em></li>
			<li><em>The White House is a huge building</em></li>
		</ol>
		<p>The situation is slightly different because we already know that The 
		White House is unique (it's the name of a particular building) so the fact that it 
		stands on Pennsylvania Avenue is 
		just extra information.&nbsp; The fact that it stands there does 
		not define the building, it just adds data<br />
		Look where the commas appear 
		and you will see that the clause is divided from the rest of the 
		sentence.<br />
		That's important, as we shall see.</p>

				<p>A simple rule to tell students is:<br />
				<strong>If the relative pronoun is followed <em>directly</em> by a verb phrase, it’s the 
				subject.<br />
				</strong>So, in <em>The man who just bought the car</em>, the 
				relative pronoun, <em>who</em>, is followed directly by the verb 
				phrase, <em>just bought</em>.&nbsp; This means that the relative 
				pronoun stands for the subject of the verb.<strong><br />
				If the pronoun is not followed by a verb phrase (but by a noun 
				phrase or pronoun) it is the object.<br />
				</strong>So, in <em>The book which she bought was a first 
				edition</em>, the relative pronoun, <em>which</em>, is followed 
				by a pronoun, <em>she</em>, so it cannot be the subject of the 
				verb.&nbsp; The relative pronoun stands for the object of the 
				verb.</p></div>

				<p><span class="auto-style8">In Sentences b, c and e we cannot 
				leave out the pronoun because that makes unacceptable sentences:<strong><br />
				</strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The man gave you the money is 
				very generous<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The children came late were punished<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The spider, he killed, was quite harmless</em><strong><br />
				</strong>In sentences a and d we can leave out the pronoun and 
				make acceptable sentences:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The book I read yesterday is on the shelf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water he drank made him unwell</em><strong><br />
				</strong>
				</span><br />
				<strong>Rule 1 is: If the relative pronoun refers to the
				<span class="style_underline">subject</span> of the verb we
				<span class="style_underline">must</span> use it.<br />
				</strong><span class="auto-style8">In sentences b and c, the 
				relative pronoun is the subject of the verb because we can 
				re-phrase them like this:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The man</strong> gave you the 
				money<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The children</strong> came late</em></span></p>
				<p>
				<strong>Rule 2 is: Object pronouns can be dropped ...<br />
				</strong><span class="auto-style8">In sentences a and d, the 
				relative pronoun is the <strong>object</strong> of the verb 
				because we can re-phrase them like this:<br />
				<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read <strong>the book</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man drank <strong>the water</strong></em></span></p>
				<p><strong>... but 
				<span class="style_underline">only</span> in defining relative 
				clauses<br />
				</strong><span class="auto-style8">In sentence d, we have 
				commas after <em>the spider</em> and <em>killed</em>.&nbsp; We know that 
				it is a non-defining relative clause and the commas could be 
				replaced by brackets with the same meaning.:<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spider (which he killed) was quite harmless</em></span></p>
				<p><strong>Is it possible to omit </strong> <em><strong>whose</strong></em>?<br />
				No.<br />
				We can have:<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The man whose tickets we stole</em></span><br />
				but not<br />
&nbsp;<span class="style_black"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; *The man tickets we stole</em></span></p>

		<p>We can replace who, whom and which with the pronoun that in many 
		cases but there is a rule here, too.</p>
		<p>In which of these sentences can <em>that</em> be used as the 
		relative pronoun instead of <em>who, whom</em> or <em>which</em>?<br />

		<div id="rel8" style="visibility: hidden">
		<p><span class="auto-style8">In sentences b and c we can replace <em>which</em> 
		and <em>who(m) </em>with <em>that</em>, so we have the sentences:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The bus that I took to the game was 10 minutes late</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The man that she married was quite rich</em><br />
		In sentences a and d, be cannot use <em>that</em> because we get:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;*The table, that was too expensive for me anyway, had 
		been sold</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>*Mary, that is Fred's sister, is a concert pianist</em><br />
		<strong>The rule is:<br />
		The pronoun </strong><em><strong>that </strong></em><strong>can 
		<span class="style_underline">only</span> be used in 
		<span class="style_underline">defining</span> relative clauses</strong> and then it’s more informal.<br />
		(Some people might accept using <em>that</em> for <em>the table</em> in 
		a non-defining clause but it is clumsy and often unacceptable to do so.)</span></p>

		<p>There is a lot more to learn about relative clauses but at the 
		initial stage of a teaching career, this is plenty.&nbsp; It's a 
		complicated area and needs careful handling.</p>
