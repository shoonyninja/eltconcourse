			<h1>ELT <span class="style_blue">Concourse:</span> frequently asked 
			questions</h1>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: If the site is free and carries no 
			promotional or advertising material, what's in it for the 
			contributors and editors?</strong><br />
			A: 
			Nothing.<br />
			It has been noted that there are those for whom the idea of someone doing anything useful except for 
			financial reward is quite unthinkable and who, therefore, doubt this 
			assertion.&nbsp; It is, however, a fact.<br />
			<strong>The ethos of the site is that knowledge, education and 
			information should be free.</strong></p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: For whom is the site intended?</strong><br />
			A: There are ten target audiences:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Learners of English</strong><br />
				for whom there are short lessons and exercises linked from the 
				menu on the left.&nbsp; Teachers, too, may find some of the 
				material useful for integrating into their lessons.</li>
				<li><strong>Teachers of English</strong><br />
				For whom there are some lesson materials and other guides also 
				linked from the menu on the left</li>
				<li><strong>People intending to take or taking a pre-service 
				training course or who have taken one but have limited 
				experience</strong><br />
				There is a link from the Teacher training index to that section 
				of the site.&nbsp; Follow links to Initial plus training.</li>
				<li><strong>Experienced teachers who need guides to specific 
				areas of language and methodology</strong><br />
				You should follow the link from the Teacher training index to 
				the In-service training section.</li>
				<li><strong>Experienced teachers going on to take a further 
				qualification such as the Cambridge Assessment English Delta or 
				the Trinity College diploma.</strong><br />
				There is a link from the Teacher training index to the Delta 
				section.</li>
				<li><strong>Teachers who are intending to develop their skills 
				and knowledge independently of any training course.</strong><br />
				You should follow the link on the left to Teacher development 
				(and any others you fancy).</li>
				<li><strong>Academic managers, especially those newly appointed</strong><br />
				You should follow the link to Academic management.</li>
				<li><strong>Teacher trainers</strong><br />
				Whether you are working with pre- or in-service teachers, you 
				should follow the link from the Teacher training index to the 
				Trainers' section.</li>
				<li><strong>Trainers in training</strong><br />
				There is a link from the Teacher training index to a course 
				designed to help people move on from English language teaching 
				to English language teacher training.&nbsp; Follow the link to 
				Training to train.</li>
				<li><strong>People interested in knowing more about English and 
				language in general or looking for answers to specific language 
				questions</strong><br />
				You should browse the A-Z index, linked from the menu on the 
				left or <a href="search_the_site.html" target="_blank">Search 
				the site</a>.</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: How can I use the material?</strong><br />
			A: Pretty much any way you like if it's not commercial.&nbsp; There's brief explanation on the 
			home page and a longer one on the page concerning copyright (linked 
			at the bottom of this and many other pages).<br />
					All materials on this site are 
					covered by a Creative Commons licence which means that you 
					are free to share, copy and amend any of the materials but 
					under certain conditions.<br />
					You may not use the 
					material for commercial purposes.&nbsp; The material may be 
					used with fee-paying learners of English but may <strong>not</strong> 
					be used on fee-paying courses for teachers.&nbsp; Small 
					excerpts from materials, conventionally attributed, may be 
					used on such courses but wholesale lifting of materials is 
			explicitly forbidden.&nbsp; There is, of course, no objection at all 
			to providing fee-paying course participants with annotated links to 
			materials anywhere on this site.&nbsp; Indeed, that is welcomed.<br />
			For more, refer 
			to the link on the home page to the Creative Commons licence statement.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Can I use the materials on a 
			teacher-training course?</strong><br />
			A: Only if your course is free to participants.<br />
			Any other use of the materials is commercial and not allowed.&nbsp; 
			If you wish merely to direct course participants to some of the 
			guides on the site, that is, of course, welcomed.<br />
			See the answer to the last question.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: I am on a teacher-training course and see that my 
			tutors are using your materials.&nbsp; What should I do?</strong><br />
			A: Firstly, you may like to consider why your tutors are relying on 
			other people's work rather than developing their own materials.<br />
			Secondly, please bring the copyright notice on this site to the 
			attention of your tutors and the course manager.<br />
			Of course, if you are simply being given a link to the materials 
			with, perhaps, a task to do, that is entirely legitimate and quite 
			welcome.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Can I change the material to suit my 
			situation?</strong><br />
			A: 
			Yes, you can amend, build on and develop the material as you like 
			but you can't then use what you have done for commercial or 
			promotional purposes.&nbsp; You must, however, state what you have 
			changed and how, giving due credit to this site.&nbsp; If you publish that material in any way, 
			you must do so under the same Creative Commons licence or a similar licence.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Can I put
</strong>
<span class="orange"><strong>ELT </strong> </span><strong>Concourse materials on my site?</strong><br />
			A: 
			No, that's theft.&nbsp; You may put a link to materials on your site 
			but not in a way that implies or states that
<span class="orange"><strong>ELT</strong> </span><strong>Concourse</strong> approves of you, your site or the materials 
			thereon.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Can I put
</strong>
<span class="orange"><strong>ELT </strong> </span><strong>Concourse materials on other 
			websites and social media sites?</strong><br />
			A: 
			No, that's theft.&nbsp; You may put a link to specific materials on 
			such sites 
			but not in a way that implies or states that
<span class="orange"><strong>ELT</strong> </span>Concourse approves of you, the site or the materials 
			thereon.<br />
			If you wish to do this, you may invent an
			<span class="style_underline">accurate</span> description of the 
			materials to which you are linking and you must clearly state that 
			the materials are not yours.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: If I want to use or quote from 
			material on this site, how do I credit it?</strong><br />
			A: 
			It is the site policy not to show the names of any authors of 
			materials (but there are rare exceptions) and materials are not 
			usually dated so, when referencing, place <em>n.d.</em> (meaning <em>
			no date</em>) by the reference.<br />
			This is the simplest way:<span class="auto-style1"><br />
			Name of material (i.e. the title of the page), n.d., + https://www.eltconcourse.com
			+ address of the page + [date accessed]</span>.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: I want to use some materials from the 
			site in a way not covered by the Creative Commons licence.&nbsp; How 
			do I do that?</strong><br />
			A: Ask for permission stating what you are intending.&nbsp; Use the 
			contact page to do that.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Who are the authors of the materials 
			on the site?</strong><br />
			A: It is not the policy of the site to ascribe authorship to any of 
			the materials unless the author specifically requests it.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Is the material on the site peer 
			reviewed?</strong><br />
			A: Not formally because asking authorities to peer review materials 
			costs money and 
<span class="orange"><strong>ELT </strong> </span>Concourse doesn't have 
			any.&nbsp; However, the approximately 1.5 million yearly visitors are 
			reviewing the material constantly in an informal way.&nbsp; Occasionally people have noticed errors or poorly expressed concepts 
			and corrections have been made.<br />
			<strong>Q (supplementary): Does this mean that some 
			authorities will differ from the opinions expressed and analyses 
			presented on the site?</strong><br />
			A: Oh, yes.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: I have noticed an error or something 
			I believe is inaccurate, incomplete or plain wrong.&nbsp; What do I do?</strong><br />
			A: 
			Please contact
<span class="orange"><strong>ELT</strong> </span><strong>Concourse</strong> saying what the issue is and on what page(s) 
			exactly it occurs.&nbsp; Say what's wrong and what you believe it 
			should be.&nbsp; Someone will investigate and, if you are right, the 
			correction will made.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for this.&nbsp; All errors on the site are either intentional or 
			otherwise.</p>
			<hr />
			<p class="nomarginbottom"><strong>Q: Are there any 
			conventions I need to understand?</strong><br />
			A: A few:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Malformed or unacceptable structures or formulations are 
				prefaced with a '*'.</li>
				<li>Questionable formulations are prefaced with a '?'.</li>
				<li>Very questionable formulations are prefaced with '?*'.</li>
				<li>Examples are <em>in italics</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Bold type</strong> is used for emphasis or to 
				identify key terms.</li>
				<li>Phonemic transcriptions are enclosed within slants /ænd/ are 
				in British English unless otherwise stated.&nbsp; Rarely, square 
				brackets are used to enclose phonetic transcriptions such as 
				[ɣ].</li>
				<li>Stress marking is placed before the stressed syllable.</li>
				<li>Optional items are enclosed (<em>in brackets</em>).</li>
			</ol>
			<hr />
			<p class="nomarginbottom"><strong>Q: Does the site support or defend any 
			theoretical standpoints?</strong><br />
			A: No, although there is one important foundation:</p>
			<p class="auto-style2">Hypotheses and theories with no or very little empirical 
				supporting evidence or only anecdotal evidence are assertions 
				and need to be treated sceptically.</p>
			<p class="noparaspace">Other than that, the guides on the site attempt to 
			view theoretical ideas, approaches and hypotheses as dispassionately 
			as possible.<br />
			Some effort has been made to distinguish between what may be 
			confidently asserted, based on evidence and authority, and that 
			which is merely speculative because:</p>
			<p class="auto-style2"><em>Ignorance more frequently begets 
			confidence than does knowledge</em><span class="auto-style4"><br />
			Charles Darwin</span></p>
			<p class="auto-style3">Articles on the site are an exception because they often do take 
			sides in a debate.&nbsp; If you hold an opposing view, you are 
			welcome to submit an article arguing your points for consideration 
			for publication.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Can I contribute to the site?</strong><br />
			A: 
			Yes.&nbsp; If you have something to suggest, please use the <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">Contact page</a> 
			and say what you would like to contribute.&nbsp; Please remember, 
			however, that this is not a blog site so it is not the 
			appropriate place for simple statements of unsupported opinion.&nbsp; 
			If you have a tub to thump or an axe to grind, work up your thoughts 
			into a proper article and it will probably get published.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Can I post a message on the site?</strong><br />
			A: 
			No.&nbsp; This is not a blog site.&nbsp; There are plenty of English 
			Language Teaching sites where you can post comments.&nbsp; However, 
			you can send a question or a longer comment at any time by using 
			the <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">Contact page</a>.&nbsp; If 
			it's interesting and suitable, it'll be published.&nbsp; See the next 
			section.</p>
			<hr />
<p><strong>Q: I have seen materials from </strong>
<span class="orange"><strong>ELT</strong> </span><strong>Concourse on other sites.&nbsp; Does that mean 
</strong><span class="orange">
<strong>ELT</strong> </span><strong>Concourse put them there?<br />
</strong>A: No.&nbsp; They have been illegally used in breach of the Creative 
Commons copyright licence, i.e., stolen.&nbsp; If you use the materials on this site 
nobody will sell on your email address or target advertising at you.&nbsp; Other 
sites are less scrupulous.&nbsp; Your 
choice.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Is
</strong>
<span class="orange"><strong>ELT </strong> </span><strong>Concourse affiliated to any 
			other site, ELT provider, publisher, examination board or ELT 
			service?</strong><br />
			A: 
			No, the site is not affiliated to anyone.</p>
			<hr />
<p><strong>Q: Can I advertise on </strong>
<span class="orange"><strong>ELT</strong> </span><strong>Concourse?<br />
</strong>A: No.&nbsp;
<span class="orange"><strong>ELT</strong> </span><strong>Concourse </strong>does not accept advertising.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Can I link to this site?</strong><br />
			A: 
			Yes, but not in a way that suggests
<span class="orange"><strong>ELT</strong></span><strong> Concourse</strong> is affiliated to any other site 
or approves of it.</p><hr />
			<p><strong>Q: How can I tell colleagues about the 
			site?<br />
			</strong>A: 
			You can download a small
<span class="orange"><strong>ELT</strong></span><strong> Concourse</strong> 
			poster to print
			<a href="documents/ELT_Concourse_Flyer.pdf" target="_blank">from 
			this link</a>.</p>
			<hr />
<p><strong>Q: Will you put in a link to my site?</strong><br />
			A: Maybe.&nbsp; You need to say what it is and what it's for.&nbsp; 
If your site is purely commercial, the answer is invariably no.</p>
			<hr />
			<p><strong>Q: Can I ask another question?</strong><br />
			A: 
			Yes, of course.&nbsp; Please use the
			<a href="contact.html">Contact page</a>.</p><hr />
