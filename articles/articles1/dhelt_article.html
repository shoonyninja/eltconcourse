			<h1>Demand-high ELT and my Aunt Sally</h1>
			<p>This short article concerns the cutting edge of ELT – anyway, 
			there are those who may think it does.<br />
			You may, if you have been especially alert, have discovered a new 
			methodological kid on the block – to wit, Demand-High ELT.&nbsp; For 
			more inspiring aperçus concerning how this will, it has been 
			claimed, change your professional life, visit the Wordpress page at
			<a href="https://demandhighelt.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">https://demandhighelt.wordpress.com/</a>.</p>
			<p>To be fair, the progenitors of the acronym make no great claims 
			(if we leave aside the bit about ‘reinventing our profession’) to 
			having developed a new method.&nbsp; In fact, they take some pains 
			to say exactly what DHELT is not.&nbsp; It is not, we read:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A method</li>
				<li>Anti any method</li>
				<li>Anti-Communicative Approach</li>
				<li>Anti-Dogme</li>
				<li>Anti-Task Based Learning</li>
				<li>The traditional idea of making things more difficult</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So we know what it isn’t.&nbsp; What is it, then?<br />
			Well, that’s a bit harder to pin down but what seems to be the case 
			is that DHELT is pro the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Pushing learners to upgrade their language and improve their 
				skills</li>
				<li>Gaining real learning value from classroom activities</li>
				<li>Provoking interventions that make a real difference</li>
				<li>Shifting teachers’ preoccupations from “successful task “to 
				“optimal learning”</li>
				<li>Transforming the “undoable” or “low” demand into “doable 
				demand”</li>
				<li>Discovering the minimum tweak necessary at any point in any 
				lesson to shift the activity sideways into the “challenge zone”</li>
				<li>Encouraging us to think about what attitude and action 
				changes would lead to “Demand-High” teaching in our classrooms</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So what is wrong with all that?&nbsp; You may well ask.&nbsp; The 
			answer, of course, is not much providing you can follow the 
			doable-undoable dichotomy.<br />
			The problem comes, as is often the case, with the setting up of easy 
			targets to shoot them down and appearing thereby to have discovered 
			something nobody else had seen.&nbsp; This form of caricaturing 
			people’s behaviour unfairly and then criticising it is not new.&nbsp; 
			It has been called an Aunt Sally after an old fairground game in 
			which a mannequin is set up in order for people to be able to throw 
			things at it to knock it down.&nbsp; It looks like this.</p>
			<p><img alt="aunt sally" src="../images/auntsally.gif" /><br />
			Here are some examples of the sort of behaviours DHELT is concerned 
			to banish from our classrooms and the sorts of assumptions we are 
			invited to share:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>“We assume that one person giving an answer means that 
				everyone has ‘got it’ and we can move on”</li>
				<li>The tasks and techniques we use in class [have] become 
				“rituals and ends in themselves”</li>
				<li>“We turn pages, check through answer lists, tick off 
				syllabus items.”</li>
				<li>“The activities and the materials are … the end in 
				themselves”</li>
			</ol>
			<p>And so on.<br />
			What’s happening, of course, is that poor teaching habits and 
			disconnected classrooms are being set up as if they were the norm 
			and then shot down – and rightly so.&nbsp; The behaviours outlined 
			here are examples of poor teaching but to suggest that they are what 
			we all do is slightly insulting.&nbsp; To be fair, Scrivener and 
			Underhill (2013) are not at all sure of their ground.&nbsp; In their 
			1600-word article, they ask no fewer than 23 questions.&nbsp; This 
			is another rhetorical trick, of course, because such questions are 
			premised on the reader supplying the ‘right’ answer.&nbsp; Here are 
			a few examples with the answers on the right:</p>
			
			<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style4" style="width: 95%">
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6"><strong>Question</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style8"><strong>Hoped-for response</strong></td>
					<td class="auto-style10"><strong>Real response</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">Where is the detailed attention to 
					the learning going on in the learner, as opposed to the 
					teaching going on in the teacher?</td>
					<td class="auto-style8">Swipe me!&nbsp; I’d forgotten about 
					the learners and learning.</td>
					<td class="auto-style10">Where it’s always been. I 
					pay attention to my learners and am concerned about 
					learning.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">Is whatever I do enabling my 
					students to be challenged to their full human learning 
					capacity?</td>
					<td class="auto-style8">No.&nbsp; Tell me how to do this 
					now.</td>
					<td class="auto-style10">Yes, I think so.&nbsp; By the way, 
					what's the other sort of learning capacity in people?</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">When a student gives a correct 
					answer, do you tend to acknowledge it, maybe with a 
					rubberstamping validation comment such as ‘That’s right’ or 
					with praise or echo, and then move on to the next question?</td>
					<td class="auto-style8">Yes, all the time.&nbsp; Please tell 
					me how to stop.</td>
					<td class="auto-style10">No.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">But could it be covering up as much 
					as it is uncovering – creating a comforting illusion that 
					learning is happening?</td>
					<td class="auto-style8">Yes!&nbsp; That’s what it does.</td>
					<td class="auto-style10">No, I don't think it's doing that.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">What if, instead, we involved many 
					more students in thinking about and unpacking the question 
					and answer, and in listening to each other?</td>
					<td class="auto-style8">What a wonderful idea.&nbsp; I’d 
					never thought of challenging my students to think and 
					listen.</td>
					<td class="auto-style10">(sigh) That’s what I do.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="auto-style6">But is this a kind of falseness in 
					contemporary methodology so familiar that we hardly stop to 
					notice its disconnection from learning?</td>
					<td class="auto-style8">Yes.&nbsp; Mine eyes have seen the 
					light.</td>
					<td class="auto-style10">What falseness 
					would that be, exactly?</td>
				</tr>

			<br />
			Lest you are thinking I have no time for this sort of flummery at 
			all, let me point out that I have no problem with the concept of 
			demand-high teaching.&nbsp; Getting the level of challenge right in 
			the classroom is extremely important and by no means easy to 
			achieve.&nbsp; I, too, am concerned that a lot of the teaching I see 
			and materials used in classrooms are underchallenging, conceptually, 
			culturally and cognitively.&nbsp; I don't think that's a hugely 
			debatable or controversial thing to say.&nbsp; One of the hallmarks 
			of inexperienced teaching is failing to challenge learners by 
			burning through and failing to exploit materials fully, accepting 
			indifferently accurate language and imprecise communication from 
			students, failing to follow up on learner output and so on.&nbsp; 
			Overcoming these faults comes with training and experience, of 
			course.<br />
			What I do have a problem with is the presumption that the initiators 
			of the blog that they have started a new 'meme'.&nbsp; They haven't, 
			really.&nbsp; The assumptions from which they work are, in fact, 
			behaviours which have been in the practice of experienced and 
			effective teachers for as long as there have been such things in 
			ELT.<br />
			To take a few examples from the site:
			<ol>
				<li>We should consider the idea of teaching one-to-one in a 
				group setting – doesn't that just mean paying particular 
				attention to one learner's production and learning because it 
				will benefit not only that learner but all the others in the 
				group who can empathise, follow the conversation and participate 
				vicariously in that learner's development?&nbsp; Who doesn't do this?</li>
				<li>"We are proposing a demand that comes precisely at the point 
				where the learner is capable of making their next steps forward" 
				– that's simply a matter of a good teacher's judgement 
				concerning when to intervene, when to extend and when to move 
				on.</li>
				<li>"to shift the activity sideways into the “challenge zone”" – 
				I think that's code for Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development 
				and that's been around since the early 30s of the last century.&nbsp; 
				It has echoes both of that concept and of Krashen's Input 
				Hypothesis.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>I don't want to appear churlish about this because a lot of what 
			Scrivener and Underhill are saying is unarguably wise (and timely).&nbsp; 
			The problem, of course, is that so much of it <strong>is</strong> 
			unarguable.&nbsp; Who has suggested that teachers shouldn't 
			challenge students?&nbsp; Who assumes that we shouldn't look for 
			opportunities to extend learners' output and challenge them to be 
			better?&nbsp; Who is it that is suggesting that our learners aren't 
			capable of more?<br />
			If you simply set out a bunch of statements about good practice then 
			you are in danger of falling into something squishy and numbing 
			along the lines of 'teachers need to be sensitive to their 
			students', 'learners should be taught things', 'classrooms should 
			contain opportunities for authentic communication' etc.<br />
			I am not suggesting that the idea of HDELT is somehow wrong, of 
			course.&nbsp; It isn’t; it’s just obvious.&nbsp; It’s useful to be 
			reminded of the need to extend learner output and raise the bar from 
			time to time but that’s very different from proposing something new 
			or daring.&nbsp; There is something in it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the 
			something that's in it is neither new nor remotely arguable.</p>
