			<h1>Understanding long sentences</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="long" height="207" src="../../../../training/images/train310.jpg" width="310" /></p>
			<p>Here is an example of the problem we want to help you solve:</p>
			<p class="auto-style34" style="width: 650px"><em>The present, 
			left-wing, national government, elected last year with a small 
			majority, has recently bravely proposed new and innovative 
			legislation stopping people hiding undeclared money in overseas 
			accounts to avoid tax and it is clear that such legislation will 
			encounter significant opposition from some financial quarters as 
			well as from the banks.</em></p>
			<p>That sentence is 52 words long and it is not unusual to find even 
			longer sentences, especially in technical or scientific texts.&nbsp; 
			This lesson is designed to help you understand the meaning quickly and 
			ignore what you do not need to know.&nbsp; This is called unpacking 
			the meaning.&nbsp; Think of the sentence like a train: it's all 
			joined together but each part carries different meanings.</p>
			<hr />
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="unpack" height="166" src="../../../../training/images/animals_cat_suitcase250.jpg" width="250" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style27">
					<h2>Unpacking the meaning</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>We will use the example above to help you find out what you need 
			to know and unpack that meaning only.<br />
			Here's how to do it.</p>

			<p>Most positive sentences in English follow a structure you know 
			well:</p>
			<p class="style_black"><strong>SUBJECT + VERB (+ OBJECT)</strong></p>
			<p><a name="1"></a>As you know, not all verbs take an object so 
			that part is (in brackets).</p>
			<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="auto-style30">

			<p>Be careful to understand split modifying phrases.&nbsp; Here's an example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>She went to see John in the morning</em></li>
				<li><em>In the morning, she went to see John</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In both these sentences, the verb is <em>went</em>.&nbsp; In both 
			cases, we know that the action happened <em>in the morning</em>.&nbsp; 
			The verb is modified by the prepositional phrase <em>in the morning</em>.<br />
			This information is given at the end or at the beginning but it is 
			separated from the verb:</p>
			<ol>
				<li style="height: 19px"><em>in the morning comes</em> at the 
				end (separated from <em>went</em> by <em>to see John</em>).</li>
				<li><em>In the morning</em> comes at the beginning and is 
				separated from <em>went</em> by <em>she</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The phrase <em>in the morning</em> clearly refers to the verb, 
			not to John.&nbsp; It tells us <strong>when</strong> she went.</p>
			<p>That is simple enough but it sometimes gets complicated.&nbsp; 
			For example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>We will have to check soon what the problem is by 
				looking at the data in May.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here, one of the modifiers for <em>check</em> is sent to the end of the 
			sentence:</p>
			<ol class="auto-style36">
				<li><em>soon</em>: the adverb modifier follows the verb directly 
				so is a simple post-modifying expression.</li>
				<li><em>in May </em>is separated from the verb by <em>soon what 
				the problem is</em>.&nbsp; The prepositional phrase, <em>in May</em>, 
				refers to the verb, <em>check</em>, not the data.&nbsp; It tells 
				us when we do the checking not when the data will be there.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The verbs phrase is <em>check ... in May</em>.</p>
			<p>Sometimes it is not clear what is modifying what.&nbsp; For 
			example, the sentence:</p>
			<p><em>He explained the problem for the audience</em></p>
			<p>Can mean:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>The audience had a problem </em>(That means, <em>He 
				explained the problem that the audience had</em>.)</li>
				<li><em>The problem was explained to the audience </em>(That 
				means, <em>He explained the problem to the audience</em>.)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Only the context will help you here.</p>
