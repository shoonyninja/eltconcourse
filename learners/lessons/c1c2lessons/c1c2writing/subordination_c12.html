			<p>Subordinators link a clauses together so we get, for example:<br />
			<em>He came to the meeting <strong>although</strong> he was feeling ill</em><br />
			In this sentence, the main idea is that <em>he came to the meeting</em>.&nbsp; 
			The subordinate clause is<br />
			<em><strong>although</strong> he was feeling ill</em><br />
			We can say,<br />
			<em>He came to the meeting</em><br />
			and we understand the sentence<br />
			but<br />
			we <strong>can't</strong> say<br />
			*<em>Although he was feeling ill</em><br />
			because that makes no sense without the main clause.</p>
			<p>We can have more than one subordinate clause in a sentence.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>She came to the party <span class="style_red"><strong>because</strong></span> she wanted to talk to him 
				<span class="auto-style25"><strong>and</strong></span>
				<span class="style_red"><strong>because</strong></span> she enjoys parties 
				<span class="style_red"><strong>if</strong></span> they are not too large and noisy</em><br />
				Here, we have a main clause:<br />
			<em>She came to the party<br />
			</em>a 
				subordinate clause:<br />
			<em><span class="style_red"><strong>because</strong></span> she wanted to talk to him<br />
			</em>linked to another subordinate clause:<em><span class="auto-style25"><strong><br />
			and</strong></span>
				<span class="style_red"><strong>because</strong></span> she enjoys parties<br />
			</em>with another subordinate 
				conditional clause:<em><span class="style_red"><strong><br />
			if</strong></span> they are not too large and noisy</em><br />
