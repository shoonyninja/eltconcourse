			<p>There are tasks to do in this lesson.&nbsp; When you see the word
			<span class="auto-style2"><strong>Task</strong></span>, stop for a moment and do the

			<p>Basically, there are two ways to join sentences together in 
			English (and most languages):</p>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td valign="top">
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Coordination: joining equal ideas</strong><br />

						For example:<br />
						<em>She came to the party <strong>and</strong> she met a 
						lot of nice people.</em><br />
						Both ideas can stand in single sentences:<br />
						<em>She came to the party.&nbsp; She met a lot of nice 
						people.<br />
						</em>We can take out the linking word (conjunction) and 
						the meaning does not change.</li>
					</ol>
					</td>

					<ol>
						<li value="2"><strong>Subordination: joining unequal ideas</strong><br />
						<img alt="subordination" height="281" src="../../images/subordination.png" width="250" /><br />
						For example:<br />
						<em>She came to the party </em> <strong><em>because</em></strong><em> she 
						wanted to meet a lot of nice people.</em><br />
						When we take out the linking word, we lose the meaning 
						of why she came to the party.</li>
					</ol>
					&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				</table>
			<p>Here, we focus on the first type only.&nbsp; There is
			<a href="subordination_c12.html">a separate lesson about 
			subordinating clauses</a>.</p>

			<p>In this lesson, we will mostly be looking at the first four of

			At the end, we will look quickly at the other four.</p>

			<p>You may think this is too simple for you but you may be 
			surprised.&nbsp; As we go along, ask yourself the questions:<br />
			<strong><em>Can I do this in my language?<br />
			Does the word mean the same in my language?</em></strong></p>
			<p>You will sometimes hear that clauses connected with <em>and</em> can be 
			changed around with no change in meaning.<br />
			For example:<br />
			<em>It is raining <strong>and</strong> it is cold</em><br />
			can be:<br />
			<em>It is cold <strong>and</strong> it is raining</em><br />
			In fact, it is quite unusual for there to be no change in meaning 
			and sometimes, if you turn the clauses round, you make a nonsense 
			sentence.</p>

				<dt><strong>FOR</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="blackpool" height="100" src="../../images/blackpool150.jpg" width="150" /><br />
				This coordinator sometimes means something like <em>because</em> 
				but the grammar is different:<br />
				We can say:<br />
				<em>He went to Blackpool <strong>for</strong> that is where his mother lives</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>He went to Blackpool <strong>because</strong> that is where his mother lives</em><br />
				and the meaning is similar, although the sentence with <em>for</em> 
				is very formal.<br />
				The difference is that we can say:<br />
				<em><strong>Because</strong> that is where is mother lives, he went to 
				Blackpool</em><br />
				but we <strong>cannot</strong> say<br />
				<em>*<strong>For</strong> that is where his mother lives he went to 
				Blackpool.</em><br />
				The word <em><strong>for</strong></em><strong> is a coordinator 
				and must come <span class="style_underline">between</span> the clauses</strong>.&nbsp; It cannot move 
				about!</dd>
				<dt><strong>YET</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="work" height="100" src="../../../../training/images/work150.jpg" width="150" /></dd>
				<dd>This coordinator means something like <em>but</em> and is more 
				formal:<br />
				We can say:<br />
				<em>He worked hard <strong>but</strong> didn't get the new job</em><br />
				and<br />
				<em>He worked hard <strong>yet</strong> didn't get the new job</em><br />
				and the meaning is very similar.<br />
				Both these words must come between the clauses so we cannot 
				have:<br />
				<em>*<strong>But</strong> he worked hard he didn't get the new job</em><br />
				or<br />
				<em>*<strong>Yet</strong> he worked hard he didn't get the new 
				job </em><br />
				BOTH of those are wrong because both <em>but</em> and <em>yet</em> 
				are coordinators and stand <span class="style_underline">between</span> 
				the ideas.</dd>
				<dt><strong>NOR</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="food" height="100" src="../../images/breakfast150.jpg" width="150" /><br />
				This coordinator works a little like <em>or</em> but for two 
				negative ideas.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>He didn't eat the food, </em><strong><em>nor</em></strong><em> 
				did he drink the coffee</em><br />
				which means:<br />
				<em>He didn't eat the food and he didn't drink the coffee</em><br />
				We also use this coordinator with words like <em>hardly, never, 
				no-one</em> etc. which are negative adverbs and pronouns.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>He hardly saw his friends </em><strong><em>nor</em></strong><em> 
				did he talk to his family</em><br />
				The word is not very common and you can always make the sentence 
				a different way to give the same meaning.<br />
				Notice that <strong>you must make a question form after <em>nor</em></strong>.&nbsp; 
				Saying or writing:<br />
				<em>*He didn't eat the food nor he drank the wine</em><br />
				is wrong!&nbsp; We must say:<br />
				<em>He didn't eat the food, </em><strong><em>nor did he </em>
				</strong><em>drink the wine</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>SO THAT</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				<img alt="snow" height="100" src="../../images/snow150.jpg" width="150" /><br />
				This is an unusual one because it has two meanings:<br />
				Meaning 1: <strong>the result</strong> of something.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>It snowed hard all night <strong>so that</strong> he 
				couldn't get out of the house</em><br />
				In this sentence, the fact that he could not leave the house is 
				the result of the snow.<br />
				You can always replace <em>so that</em> with <em>so</em>:<br />
				<em>It snowed hard all night <strong>so</strong> he couldn't get 
				out of the house</em><br />
				Meaning 2: <strong>the reason</strong> for something.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>I worked late last night <strong>so that</strong> I didn't 
				have to go to work early this morning</em><br />
				In this meaning, so that is not a coordinator because we can 
				move it to the front and have:<br />
				<em><strong>So that </strong>I didn't have to go to work early 
				this morning, I worked late last night</em><br />
				It is a subordinator in this sentence and we will look at it 
				again in <a href="subordination_c12.html">the lesson on 
				subordination</a>.</dd>

			<p>Look again at any writing you have done in English and try to

			<ol>
				<li>Times when you have made two short sentences and one longer 
				sentence with a coordinator would be better.&nbsp; When you find 
				it, make it better.</li>
				<li>Times when you have used the coordinators wrongly.&nbsp; 
				Remember, real coordinators must come between the ideas.</li>
				<li>Times when you have included the subject twice but it is the
