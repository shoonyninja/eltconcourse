			<p>Look again at the last example.<br />
			Usually, in a conditional,<em> if-</em>sentence, we can only use <em>
			will</em> once.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I will go to London If I have time</em><br />
			is correct, but<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I will go to London if I will have time</em><br />
			is <span class="style_red"><strong>wrong</strong></span>.<br />
			But this rule only works if you are using <em>will</em> to talk 
			about the future.<br />
			When you use <em>will</em> to mean that somebody is happy to do 
			something, then we can use it twice, like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I will go to London if you will come with me</em><br />
			Here, the first <em>will</em> refers to the future and the second
			<em>will</em> refers to whether someone is happy to do something.<br />
			That's an important difference.</p>
			<p class="indentpara"><strong><span class="auto-style38">The key 
			difference:</span></strong><br />
			Will <span class="auto-style39">can be used to talk about the 
			future.&nbsp; Then we are speculating or guessing what the future 
			holds:</span><br />
			Do you think the book will be interesting?<br />
			It will be cold in January<br />
			She will be new boss of the factory<br />
			Will <span class="auto-style39">can be used to offer, promise and 
			refuse:</span><br />
			Will you help me with this?<br />
			You look tired.&nbsp; I'll do the washing up<br />
			I will not explain this again!</p>
			<hr />
			<p>The past tense of <em>will</em> is <em>would</em> and it has the same two very 
			important meanings.</p>

				<dd>In this sentence, someone thinks that Peter is willing to

				If I am sure Peter is willing to help, then I can say:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Peter will help.</em><br />

			</dl>
			<p>We saw with the verb <em>will</em> that it is used to talk about 
			a future we are sure about.&nbsp; For example:<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; I will be 35 years old tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be cold in England in January</em><br />
			etc.<br />
			When we are not sure, or we think the future is unlikely, we often 
			use the past tense of <em>will</em>, and that is <em>would</em>.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather forecast said it would rain but 
			it's fine at the moment.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think John would be at home by now</em></p>

			<p>Look again at the last example and you will see that the same 
			conditional, <em>if-</em>sentence problem happens here, too.<br />
			Usually, in a conditional,<em> if-</em>sentence, we can only use <em>
			would</em> once.&nbsp; So, for example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;If I broke my laptop, I would be lost</em><br />
			is correct, but<br />
&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; If I would break my laptop, I would be lost</em><br />
			is <span class="style_red"><strong>wrong</strong></span>.<br />
			But this rule only works if you are using <em>would</em> to talk 
			about an unlikely future.<br />
			When you use <em>would</em> to mean that somebody is happy to do 
			something, then we can use it twice, like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;I would travel first class if my boss would buy the 
			tickets</em><br />
			Here, the first <em>would</em> refers to the unlikely future and the second
			<em>would</em> refers to whether the boss is willing to buy the tickets.</p>
			<p>Here's the summary so far:</p>
