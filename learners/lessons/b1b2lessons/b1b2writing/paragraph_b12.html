			<h1>How to write a paragraph</h1>
			<p>
			<img alt="paragraph" height="160" src="../../images/paragraph.gif" width="122" /></p>
			<p>If you want to write a good paragraph, you need to know <strong>
			three important things</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>How to <strong>tell the reader what the paragraph is about</strong>.</li>
				<li>How to <strong>order the information</strong>.</li>
				<li>How to <strong>link ideas together</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are 8 tasks in this lesson.&nbsp; When you see the word
			<span class="auto-style4"><strong>Task</strong></span>, stop for a moment and do the
			exercise.&nbsp; You will learn more that way.</p>
			<h2><a name="1"></a>What the paragraph is about: topic sentences</h2>
			<p>The first sentence of a good paragraph tells the reader what to 
			expect.&nbsp; This sentence is called <strong>the topic sentence</strong>.</p>
			
			<table class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="viking" height="166" src="../../images/man_viking250.jpg" width="250" />&nbsp;</td>
					<td><span class="auto-style4"><strong>Task 1: </strong>
					</span>Which of the following do you think is a topic sentence 
					of a paragraph about the Vikings (picture) in North America?<br />
			<ol>
				<li>For many years people weren't sure if Newfoundland was the 
				place in the stories, or if the stories were true.</li>
				<li>It was believed for a long time that the first European to visit 
				Newfoundland was and Englishman called John Cabot.</li>
				<li>Ingstad explored Newfoundland in the 1960s, and discovered 
				some amazing things.</li>
				<li>Now we know better.</li>
			</ol>
					<p>
					<a href="#1" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'first',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have your answer</a>.</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p id="first" style="visibility:hidden"><span class="style_brown">Right.&nbsp; The second sentence is a 
			topic sentence.&nbsp; This sentence tells us what the paragraph will 
			be about: what <strong>was</strong> believed and what is believed 
			now.<br />
			It can't be the first sentence because we have <em>the place </em>
			and <em>the stories</em> and we don't know what the place is and 
			what the stories are yet.<br />
			It can't be the third sentence because we don't know who Ingstad is.&nbsp; 
			When you introduce a name, you must tell the writer something about 
			who, what or where it is.<br />
			It can't be the fourth sentence because we have the word <em>better</em> 
			and we don't know what it is better <strong>than</strong>.</span></p>
			<p style="visibility:hidden"><a name="2"></a></p>
			<table class="auto-style2">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="viking ship" height="166" src="../../images/viking_ship250.png" width="250" />&nbsp;</td>
					<td><span class="auto-style4"><strong>Task 2: </strong>
					</span>Now read this and see which of the three sentences can 
					be the topic sentence for this paragraph.<br />
			
			<p ><em>The paragraph is:</em></p>
			<p><em><span class="style_black">Starting 
			in the late-700s AD, the Vikings began coming to the British Isles 
			and France as well as to Iceland.&nbsp; They also sailed to Russia 
			and to Byzantium (now Istanbul in modern Turkey).</span></em></p>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p><em>The three possible topic sentences are:</em></p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				<em>Over the next few years other Vikings came to the area.</em></li>
				<li>
				<em>One person who believed the Sagas told stories of real events 
				was a Norwegian called Helge Ingstad.</em></li>
				<li>
				<em>The Vikings' boats, which used 
				oars or a simple sail, were very good boats at the time and the 
				Vikings travelled a long way in them.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			<a href="#2" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'second',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have your answer</a>.</p>
			<p id="second" style="visibility:hidden"><span class="style_brown">Right.&nbsp; The third sentence is the 
			topic sentence because it talks about the boats and travelling.&nbsp; 
			The rest of the paragraph is about where The Vikings went.<br />
			It can't be the first sentence because that means the paragraph is 
			going to tell us about the area and the Vikings.<br />
			It can't be the second sentence because that means the paragraph is 
			going to tell us about Helge Ingstad.</span></p>
			<h3 >What topic sentences do in different sorts of writing</h3>
			<p >In the examples here we have used a text which gives 
			information.&nbsp; In this case, it's about Vikings and North 
			America.&nbsp; However, topic sentences are also needed in other 
			sorts of text.<br />
			<span class="auto-style4"><strong>Task 3: </strong></span>See if you can tell what they do in the 
			following and then click on the table to see the answers.</p>
			<p >
			<img id="img1" alt="ts4" height="155" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'../../images/topicssentence2.png')" src="../../images/topicssentence1.png" width="500" /></p>
			<p ><span class="auto-style4"><strong>Task 4: </strong></span>Now see if you can match the topic sentence to the type of 
			writing.&nbsp; <strong>The types of writing are the same.</strong><br />
			When you have an answer, click on the table to see if you are right.</p>
			<p >
			<img id="img2" alt="ts3" height="202" onclick="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img2',/*url*/'../../images/topicssentence4.png')" src="../../images/topicssentence3.png" width="500" /></p>
			<h2 >Ordering the information</h2>
			<p >This depends on the type of writing you are doing.<br />
			After the topic sentence, it works like this:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Saying how to do something</strong></dt>
				<dd>These texts are things like recipes for cooking or 
				instructions for a machine.<br />
				You order the information logically: what to do first, second, 
				third and so on.<br />
				For example 1:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>First, heat the oil and butter in 
				a pan and then add the onions.&nbsp; Cook them until they are 
				soft.&nbsp; Then add the vegetables and the spices</em></span> 
				etc.<br />
				For example 2:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>First, take off the cover by 
				lifting it at the end.&nbsp; Then remove the filter and clean it 
				with a little warm water.&nbsp; When it is dry, put it back in 
				the unit and replace the cover.</em></span></dd>
				<dt><strong>Telling a story</strong></dt>
				<dd>These texts are often about yourself and say what happened 
				to you.<br />
				Again, you need to help the reader by keeping to the order in 
				which things happen.&nbsp; So, you start with where you were, 
				what happened, what you did and what other people did.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>I arrived at the airport very 
				early and the check-in desk was closed.&nbsp; Because I was so 
				hungry by then, I went up to the restaurant on the first floor 
				and, to my surprise, I met my old friend from school.&nbsp; He 
				was sitting alone drinking coffee and was very pleased to see 
				me.&nbsp; We had breakfast together and I told him all my news</em></span> 
				etc.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Giving information</strong></dt>
				<dd>These texts are like the one about Vikings.<br />
				You tell the reader what the important facts are with one fact 
				in each paragraph following the topic sentence.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Francis Drake left England on 15th 
				November 1577.&nbsp; At first, he met very bad weather and had to 
				return to repair his ships.&nbsp; He left again on 13th December 
				and sailed first to North Africa before crossing the Atlantic.</em></span></dd>
				<dt><strong>Explaining something</strong></dt>
				<dd>These texts are like the ones you see in school books.<br />
				You keep one subject in each paragraph and you explain to the 
				reader how something happens and/or what it does.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>Hail forms when drops of water are 
				pushed up into colder air in the atmosphere.&nbsp; Then the 
				raindrops fall again.&nbsp; This happens 
				again and again and each time the drops get heavier.&nbsp; When 
				they are too heavy they fall out of the air and hit the ground 
				as hail.</em></span></dd>
				<dt><strong>Arguing and discussing</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are often texts you have to write in examinations.<br />
				Each paragraph will have <strong>one</strong> main point (the 
				topic sentence) and then an example of what you mean and why it 
				is important.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<span class="style_black"><em>The second problem is that smoking 
				is very unhealthy for people who breath in the smoke from other 
				people's tobacco.&nbsp; This is called 'secondary smoking' and 
				doctors have shown that it is almost as bad for you as smoking 
				yourself.</em></span></dd>
			</dl>
			<h2 ><a name="3"></a>Linking ideas</h2>
			<p ><span class="auto-style4"><strong>Task 5: </strong></span>Look at the parts in black in these sentences.&nbsp; What do you 
			see?</p>
			<p ><span class="style_black"><em>John Cabot</em></span><em> sailed 
			to Newfoundland in 1497 but <span class="style_black">he</span> 
			wasn't </em><span class="style_black"><em>the first European</em></span><em> 
			to visit.&nbsp; </em><span class="style_black"><em>The first ones</em></span><em> 
			were </em><span class="style_black"><em>the Vikings</em></span><em> 
			who sailed there 500 years before Cabot.&nbsp; </em>
			<span class="style_black"><em>They</em></span><em> wrote about their 
			visit in stories called </em><span class="style_black"><em>the Sagas</em></span><em>.&nbsp;
			</em><span class="style_black"><em>The Sagas</em></span><em> tell 
			the story of </em><span class="style_black"><em>Eric the Red</em></span><em>.&nbsp;
			</em><span class="style_black"><em>He</em></span><em> sailed to 
			Newfoundland in the 10th century.</em></p>
			<p >
			<a href="#3" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'third',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here to get an answer</a>.</p>
			<p >
			<img id="third" style="visibility:hidden" alt="viking paragraph" height="455" src="../../images/themerheme.png" width="700" /></p>
			<p >Do you see what's happening?</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The subject of the first sentence is
				<span class="style_black"><em>John Cabot </em></span>and the 
				sentence goes on to tell us that he was not
				<span class="style_black"><em>the first European</em></span>.</li>
				<li>Then, <span class="style_black"><em>The first ones 
				(Europeans)</em></span> becomes the subject of the next sentence 
				which tells us about <span class="style_black"><em>the Vikings</em></span>.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>They (the Vikings)</em></span> 
				becomes the subject of the next sentence which tells us about
				<span class="style_black"><em>the Sagas</em></span>.</li>
				<li><span class="style_black"><em>The Sagas</em></span> is the 
				subject of the next sentence which tells us about
				<span class="style_black"><em>Eric the Red</em></span>.</li>
				<li>Finally, <span class="style_black"><em>He (Eric the Red)</em></span> 
				is the subject of the last sentence.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It looks like this:</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="vikings paragraph explained" height="475" src="../../images/themerheme2.png" width="700" />&nbsp;</p>
			<p><a name="4"></a><span class="auto-style4"><strong>Task 6:
			</strong></span>Now, what's the next sentence?&nbsp; You have a choice of three 
			here.&nbsp; Decide which sentence should come next.<br />
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>John Cabot was born in Italy.</em></li>
				<li><em>In the 10th century, the climate was warmer than now.</em></li>
				<li><em>The Vikings came from Scandinavia.</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			<a href="#4" onclick="FP_changeProp(/*id*/'fifth',0,'style.visibility','visible')">Click here when you have an answer</a>.</p>
			<p id="fifth" style="visibility:hidden" class="style_brown">Right.&nbsp; 
			Sentence 2 is the right 
			answer.&nbsp; The next sentence should tell us something about the 10th century.&nbsp; 
			It must make a link to the last sentence.</p>
			<p><a name="5"></a><span class="auto-style4"><strong>Task 7:
			</strong></span>Try to put these sentences in the right order.<br />
			First, find <strong>the topic sentence</strong>.&nbsp; Put that 
			first and then see if you can put the other sentences in the right 
			order.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>At L'Anse aux Meadows the Ingstads found the remains of a 
				Viking settlement.</em></li>
				<li><em>He noticed that the places in the Sagas were similar to 
				Newfoundland.</em></li>
				<li><em>The Norwegian Helge Ingstad believed the Sagas tell us about 
				real events.</em></li>
				<li><em>Ingstad explored Newfoundland's Northern Peninsula in the
