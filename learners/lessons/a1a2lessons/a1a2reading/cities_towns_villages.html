					<p class="style_black"><em>I was born in a small village in 
					the south of France.<br />
					I took the school bus from my village to the next town 
					because my village was too small to have a school. There are 
					only about 300 people there!<br />
					When I was 12, my parents moved to a small town because my 
					father got a new job.<br />
					I went to school in the town but the town was too small to 
					have a university, so I went to Marseilles to study when I 
					finished school. Marseilles is not a very big city (with a 
					little more than one million people) but for a small-town 
					boy like me, it seemed very big. On my first day, I went for 
					a walk and got lost in the old streets near the sea.<br />
					I have been living in Marseilles for two years now and I 
					don't get lost any longer but it still feels very big to me. 
					I live a long way from the university so I have to take 
					three buses to get to my studies every day. When I lived in 
					a town, I walked to school in 10 minutes!<br />
					But I like living in a city because there are so many things 
					to do. In Marseilles we have lots of cinemas and theatres as 
					well as some of the best shops and cafes in France. I love 
					to sit in a cafe in the city centre with my friends from 
					university and talk.<br />
					In my village, there was nothing to do in the evenings and 
					there wasn't even a shop. We drove 10 kilometres every week 
					to do the shopping. In the town, there was only one small 
					cinema and no theatre or bookshop. In fact, there were only 
					about 20 shops there.<br />
					Marseilles is better than that and there are shops 
					everywhere.<br />
					When I finish university, I want to get a job in Marseilles. 
					I love it.</em></p>

					New York City has five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens,

					The city received 62.8 million tourists in 2017.<br />

					The village sits on top of a hill about 3 kilometers from 
					the sea and it is not on the main road so it's very quiet.<br />
					The village has five coffee shops and one very good 
					restaurant. As well as that, there's a mini-market which 
					sells almost everything you want. People come from all over 
					the area to eat at the restaurant because the food's so 
					good.<br />
					The village has a big, beautiful church and lots of people 
					come to it on special occasions to get married and so on. 
					It's too big for such a small village really.<br />
					Until 6 years ago, the village had its own school but that 
					closed and now the children have to go to the nearest town 
					to school. It's only 8 kilometers from here and the bus 
					takes them in the morning and brings them back in the 
					afternoon. There's no doctor but one visits every Wednesday 
					and he has an office in the village.<br />
					A bus service connects the village with the local towns and 
					shops or you can take the school but in the morning (but 
					it's very noisy).</em></p>
