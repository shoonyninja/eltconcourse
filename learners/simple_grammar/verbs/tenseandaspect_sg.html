			Three ideas to start with.&nbsp; It's important to understand the 
			difference:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Time</strong>: this refers to 
				<span class="style_underline">when</span> an event happens.</li>
				<li><strong>Tense</strong>: this refers to the 
				<span class="style_underline">form</span> of the verb.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br />
				<em>walked</em> and <em>had walked</em> are past tenses<br />
				<em>walks</em> and <em>is walking</em> are present tenses</li>
				<li><strong>Aspect</strong>: this refers to 
				<span class="style_underline">how the speaker 
				thinks about the event</span> in time.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<strong><em>He walked here</em> </strong>is finished and in the past<br />
				<strong><em>He has walked here</em></strong> means he is here now and I 
				know how he got here<br />
				<strong><em>She is playing the piano</em></strong> refers to right now 
				(and not finished) or an arrangement for the future and not 
				started</li>
			</ol>

					He <em>had finished</em> the work before he went home.</td>
					<td class="auto-style24">We do not use fixed times

			<p>That is all of them.&nbsp; They are not very difficult to use but 
			many languages do not have all of them.<br />
			Does yours language have these tenses?</p>
			<p><strong>The past simple</strong> is very common and we use it for 
			actions and states that we see as finished and complete.&nbsp; 
			It is an <strong>absolute</strong> tense.&nbsp; Here are some more 
			examples:<br />
			<em>He went to university when he was 18 and left when he was 22</em><br />
			He is not at university now and he is older than 22 now.&nbsp; Both 
			the action (<em>went</em>) and the state (<em>was</em>) are 
			finished.<br />
			<em>They broke my windows with stones and I repaired them</em><br />
			Both the actions are finished.&nbsp; The windows are not broken now.</p>
			<p><strong>The past progressive</strong> also refers to finished 
			time and finished events or actions.&nbsp; It is also an <strong>
			absolute</strong> tense and can join two finished events together.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>He was cycling to work when he got a telephone call</em><br />
			The cycling and the call are both finished.&nbsp; He is not cycling 
			now and he is not talking on the telephone.</p>
			<p><strong>The past perfect tenses </strong>are <strong>relational</strong> 
			tenses which connect two events together.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>She had invited me so I went to the party</em><br />
			The inviting came <strong>before</strong> the going but they are 
			both finished.&nbsp; She is not talking to me now and the party is 
			over.<br />
			<em>She had been running and needed a rest<br />
			</em>The running was a long action and that is why she needed a 
			rest.</p>
			<p><strong>'used to'</strong> is an <strong>absolute</strong> tense.&nbsp; 
			It always means that the subject is not doing it now.&nbsp; For example:<br />
			<em>I used to smoke</em><br />
			and don't now<br />
			<em>I used to be impatient</em><br />
			but I'm not impatient now<br />
			<em>There used to be a shop on the corner</em><br />
			but it isn't there now<br />
			In all cases, the action or state is finished.</p>

			<p><strong>The future simple</strong> is used to talk about a fixed 
			future.&nbsp; It is not the same as using <em>will</em> to say that you are 
			happy to do something (that is a present tense).&nbsp; For more, see 
			below.<br />
			Here are some more examples:<br />
			<em>The train will leave at 18:22</em><br />
			<em>I hope the sun will shine tomorrow<br />
			I will arrive by bus</em></p>
			<p><strong>The future progressive </strong>is used in the same
			<strong>absolute</strong> way to talk about something in the future 
			that is certain and fixed.<br />
			Here are some more examples:<br />
			<em>The train will be travelling at 100 kilometres an hour<br />
			She is very busy so will be working late<br />
			I'll be waiting for you at the airport from 6 o'clock</em></p>
			<p><strong>The future perfect</strong> is a <strong>relational</strong> 
			tense and joins two future things together.<br />
			Here are some more examples:<br />
			<em>The train will have left before I get there</em><br />
			<em>It will have rained for over 6 hours everyday<br />
			He'll have finished soon and then he will go home</em></p>
			<p>The future perfect progressive is not very common but it works in 
			the same way.<br />
			Here are some more examples:<br />
			<em>I will have been reading for two hours soon</em><br />
			<em>She will have been sleeping for over 9 hours so she'll feel 
			better</em></p>

				<dt><strong>Joining the past to the past</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>He had broken his leg so didn't go on holiday</em><br />
				This is talking about the past (<em>didn't go on holiday</em>) 
				but relating it to another past that came before (<em>breaking 
				his leg</em>).&nbsp; It is a past tense and it's called the past 
				perfect (past for <strong>then</strong>, perfect for aspect).</dd>
				<dt><strong>Joining the future to the future</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>I'll have finished very soon you I'll be home before 5.</em><br />
				This is talking about the future (<em>I'll be home</em>) but

			<p>These three aspects tell us about the <strong>type</strong> of action.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Progressive</strong></dt>
				<dd>This aspect shows us that the action takes time and goes on.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>She was running for the bus when she fell </em>(a longer 
				action stopped by a short action)<br />
				<em>I was reading a book when the telephone rang</em> (a long 
				action interrupted by a short action)<br />
				<em>He is sleeping at the moment</em> (a long action, happening 
				now)<br />
				With these actions, we do not know the time when they began or when they 
				stop.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Continuous</strong></dt>
				<dd>This aspect tells us about a state, not an action.<br />
				For example:<br />
				<em>She knows my brother<br />
				He sings beautifully</em> (it is his ability, not what he is 
				doing now)<br />
				<em>He works in a shop</em><br />
				These actions can sometimes not be happening now.&nbsp; For 
				example:<br />
				<em>He works in a shop but today is Sunday so he is walking in 
				the park</em></dd>
				<dt><strong>Repeated</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are short actions which happen again and again.&nbsp; 
				For example:<br /><em>Someone is knocking at the door<br />She is taking photographs</em><br />In the past (but not in the present) we can use the simple form 
				of the verb for the repeated aspect.&nbsp; For example:<br />
				<em>They banged the drums</em> or <em>They were banging the drums</em><br />
				<em>She was taking lots of photographs</em> or <em>She took lots of 
				photographs</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					<td>
					<img alt="prospective" height="133" src="../../../training/images/sides_path200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style6">
					<h2>The prospective aspect</h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This aspect looks forward from the present to the future.&nbsp; 
			For example:<br />
			<em>I am having dinner with John tomorrow </em>(I know this <strong>now</strong> 
			because John and I arranged this)<br />
			<em>She is going to see her mother tomorrow</em> (she has a plan in 
			her head <strong>now</strong>)<br />
			<em>It's going to rain</em> (I can see the black clouds <strong>now</strong>)<br />
			<em>The train leaves at 10:18</em> (the timetable is the same every 
			week)</p>
			<p>You can see that in English we have three main ways to talk about 
			the future <strong>based on the present</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>With <em>be + -ing</em><br />
				<em>I am working in London tomorrow</em><br />
				We use this when something is arranged now</li>
				<li>With <em>going to</em> + the base verb<br />
				<em>I am going to visit my mother tomorrow</em><br />
				We use this when we have a plan now</li>
				<li>With the present simple form<br /><em>The TV news starts at 6</em><br />
				We use this when there is a schedule or timetable which is 
				always true</li>
			</ol>
			<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td>
					<img alt="volunteer" height="133" src="../../../training/images/hands_volunteer_graphic200.jpg" width="200" /></td>
					<td class="auto-style6">
					<h2>Using <em>will</em></h2>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The word <em>will</em> is used to make a future in English (see 
			above) in, for example:<br /><em>The train will arrive in 5 minutes<br />
			</em>This is a future form in English.</p>
			<p>The word <em>will</em> is also used (only for people) to say that someone is 
			happy to do something.&nbsp; They are volunteering.&nbsp; For 
			example:<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			A: <em>Oh, I've left my tea in the kitchen</em><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			B: <em>It's OK.&nbsp; I'll bring it to you</em><br />
			The sentence <em>I'll bring it to you</em> is <strong>not</strong> a future tense.&nbsp; It is 
			a way to show that you want, or are happy, to do something <strong>
			now</strong>.<br />
			You can see this because only people can make offers or promises:<br />
			<em>I'll give you the money </em>is an <strong>offer</strong>, not a future tense<br />
			<em>The train will be late </em>is a <strong>future</strong> &ndash; trains do not 
			make promises or offers!</p>
